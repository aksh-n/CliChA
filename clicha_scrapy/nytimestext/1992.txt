0-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Gold Leads Precious Metals In a Rally Termed Technical
Heavy buying of gold futures early yesterday set off what analysts called a technical rally that overwhelmed the influence of a stronger dollar and gave a sharp gain to precious metals in general. The gold rally on the Commodity Exchange in New York resulted from the oversold condition of the market, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York. "Generally a strong dollar smothers a gold rally," said an analyst, James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York. "Gold ignored the dollar move because the rally by the market was so technical in nature." Gold futures for delivery in February settled $6 higher at $356.60 a troy ounce; March silver was 18.3 cents higher at $4.153 a troy ounce. Silver edged higher on the gold increase, then took off when it hit several buy stops. Drop in Producer Prices Traders also took solace from the drop in the Producer Price Index, with the idea that stagnant inflation might encourage investment and lead to greater industrial demand, Mr. Steel said. Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange showed a modest gain, with prices held back by disappointment over trade talks in Tokyo. There is doubt the talks will result in increased sales of American autos, Mr. Steel said. Platinum is used to make catalytic converters used in cars. A strike at the Impala platinum mine in South Africa had little effect on the market, with views expressed that the 10,000 striking miners will be back to work in a few days. Platinum for delivery in January rose $2.70, to $339.50 a troy ounce. Energy futures were mixed in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with oil prices fluctuating sharply as traders waited to see whether Iraq could get back into the market. Concerns over the possibility of a world oil glut continued to weigh on the market. Light sweet crude for delivery in February was a cent lower at $17.86 a barrel. February heating oil was 0.49 cent higher at 49.85 cents a gallon. February unleaded gasoline was 0.65 cent lower at 50.34 cents a gallon and February natural gas was 3.1 cent lower at $1.259 for 1,000 cubic feet. Wheat for delivery in March settled 3 3/4 cents lower at $4.00 3/4 a bushel. March corn was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.52 3/4 a bushel. March oats were 3/4 cent lower at $1.37 1/4 a bushel and January soybeans were a cent lower at $5.63 3/4 a bushel.

3-> COMPANY NEWS; A Deal of Real Heroes: Marvel to Acquire Fleer
In a deal that combines two passions of American youth, the Marvel Entertainment Group, the nation's largest publisher of comic books, has agreed to acquire the Fleer Corporation, one of the nation's largest trading-card companies, for $28 a share, or $265 million. Marvel's portfolio of superheroes includes Spider Man, Captain America, the X-Men and the Invisible Woman. Fleer, in addition to selling baseball and other sports cards, also makes Dubble Bubble gum. Investors and analysts said Marvel appeared to be getting the better of the deal. "Marvel's buying it on the cheap," said Ronald Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney. "The price is a little low for shareholders." "We think it's worth more," said Walter Morris, head of research for the Strong Funds, a large mutual fund company in Milwaukee that is one of the largest holders of Fleer stock. Investors and analysts said Fleer was probably worth $30 to $35 a share. "I think it's possible that somebody could come in with a higher bid," said Alexander Paris Jr., an analyst with Barrington Research Associates in Chicago. He added that even though the price was low, it would be hard to find a better match than Marvel and Fleer, both of which rely on boys aged 6 to 16 for the majority of their sales. Agrees to 'Breakup' Fee "The businesses fit together hand-in-glove," said Mr. Morris of the Strong Funds. "We'll wind up supporting the deal." Fleer has agreed to pay Marvel a $6.5 million "breakup" fee if the deal does not go through. Fleer executives did not return telephone calls. In a statement about the deal, Fleer's chairman and chief executive, Paul Mullan, said, "It will create exciting new product and cross-promotional marketing opportunities, enhancing our growth prospects in both trading cards and comic books." After the deal was announced, Fleer's shares rose $2.50 each, to $28, in over-the-counter trading. Marvel's shares closed at $33.375, up $1.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. Fleer is hooking up with Marvel in an effort to do battle better against the industry leader, the Topps Company of Brooklyn. Analysts said the deal signaled that the days of explosive growth in the baseball card business had ended. The market has become thick with competitors and returns of unbought cards have been high. Marvel has been gradually expanding its presence in the trading card business since 1990, when it introduced its Marvel Universe trading cards. Marvel focuses on cards with entertainment figures; Fleer has specialized in sports. "The acquisition of Fleer enables us to rapidly increase our presence in the $1.2 billion market for sports and entertainment cards," said William Bevens Jr., chief executive of Marvel. "The overlapping consumer demographics and distribution systems of the two companies uniquely position us to become a clear industry leader within the card marketplace." Boards Have Approved The definitive purchase agreement, which will be carried out through a tender offer, has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. A majority of Fleer's shareholders must tender their shares before the deal can be completed. Terry Stewart, president and chief operating officer of Marvel, said trading cards could help sell comic books. He said that last year, Marvel's premier issue of a new series, "The X Force," contained a card featuring a superhero. "If you wanted all four, you had to buy four copies," he said. The issue sold 3.7 million copies, making it one of Marvel's best-selling comic books ever. Marvel's deal to buy Fleer follows a March announcement by Topps that it planned to enter the comic book business. "This is not a response to that," Mr. Stewart said. The Topps switchboard was closed yesterday afternoon. Both companies also announced second-quarter earnings yesterday. Marvel said its profits for the quarter increased nearly threefold, to $7.2 million, or 30 cents a share, from $2.5 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 63 percent, to $37.5 million, from $23 million for the 1991 period. Fleer's profits increased nearly 4 percent, to $8 million, or 85 cents a share, from $7.7 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 20 percent, to $48.4 million, compared with $40.1 million a year earlier.

5-> CHRONICLE
It would have been logical for the party celebrating the Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors Festival to have been -- where else? -- out of doors. But on Thursday evening, it rained, so the 200 guests at the reception for MARTIN and AUDREY GRUSS, the major benefactors of the festival, found themselves in the Kaplan Penthouse of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center. Once inside, it was almost pastoral because ANTHONY SERRAZ, the floral designer for the Washington Street Cafe, which did the catering, happened to have a large mural of an outdoor scene on hand and quickly hung it up. The guests included many of the performers in the 75 events of the festival, scheduled Aug. 4-30, representatives of 12 consulates and Lincoln Center board members. The party was replete with typically New York incongruities. JENNETH WEBSTER, the festival's producer and artistic director, said, "In the men's room there was the mariachi band practicing, while in the women's room, there were people blowing up inner tubes." The inner tubes were part of the entertainment, props for a beach tableau. A gypsy dancer, a monkey king from the Chinese opera and two guitarists (one an Italian and the other an American Indian) also performed. Ms. Webster assembled a "Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors Survival Kit" for Mrs. Gruss. "We gave her a little wooden chair to sit down on in the front row if there are no front-row seats left, an umbrella hat in case of rain and a sun hat, a fan, sunglasses, a parasol, foot cream, muscle soak and bug spray," she said. That sounds quite enough to venture into the wilds of Lincoln Center.

6-> Awaiting Word on the Future of the Word at The New Yorker
To the Editor: As a subscriber for 45 years to The New Yorker, whose editorship will be taken over by Tina Brown in the fall, I am an older reader, "one of its primary handicaps," according to people in the business (arts pages, July 2). My son, whose passionate reading of The New Yorker makes him a primary handicap to my getting first grabs, rates only Rolling Stone ahead of it. To have grown up with a magazine that always seemed a friend on whom one might rely is to regret its passing and even to hope the passage will be subtle enough not to be recognized in one's lifetime. I have always found it preferable to be occasionally bored but never titillated (as with the gossipy hype of Vanity Fair, from which Ms. Brown comes); amused by those disingenuous "a friend writes" openers in "Talk of the Town," rather than brought up short by Esquire's merchandised cynicism; delighted to read a substantive profile of someone I might like to know, rather than teased to know about someone People deems a celebrity. I wish I could say I am reassured when Ms. Brown declares she edits for a sensibility, not an age group, and that The New Yorker will continue to be "text-driven because text is what this magazine is about." However, the nonwriting is on the wall. RICHARD HAUER COSTA Sylvan Beach, N.Y., July 3, 1992

7-> Ex-Premier Advances in French Race
Just eight months after Michel Rocard lost his job as France's Prime Minister, a shake-up today in the governing Socialist Party has suddenly turned him into the front-runner in the race for the party's nomination to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in 1995. Mr. Rocard was not officially affected by the party leadership's election of Laurent Fabius, the President of the National Assembly, to succeed Pierre Mauroy as the party's powerful first secretary. But in exchange for backing Mr. Fabius, Mr. Rocard appears to have rallied key party sectors behind his presidential aspirations. On Tuesday, Mr. Mauroy described Mr. Rocard as the party's "virtual candidate." Today, Mr. Fabius said he "carries our hopes and those of many French people." Political experts said that while the succession race is far from over, the revival of Mr. Rocard's fortunes reflects Mr. Mitterrand's loss of influence over fellow Socialists as party leaders prepare for what is increasingly referred to as the "post-Mitterrand" era. Relations Are Tense Although Mr. Rocard served as Mr. Mitterrand's Prime Minister for three years, relations between the two men have long been tense, dating to the days when they first competed for the leadership of the Socialist Party in 1971. In their political views the two men are not far apart. But when Mr. Rocard was replaced as Prime Minister by Edith Cresson in May, it was widely assumed that Mr. Mitterrand was trying to prevent his 61-year-old rival from emerging as his natural successor. In recent months, Mr. Mitterrand has also hinted that he believes the best Socialist candidate in 1995 would be Jacques Delors, who is now the influential president of the European Community's executive commission in Brussels. Mr. Delors, who served as Mr. Mitterrand's first Finance Minister, has in turn indicated interest in returning to French politics. Some experts believe that Mr. Delors's rising star was an important element in producing the new alliance between Mr. Fabius and Mr. Rocard, who until recently headed competing factions in the Socialist Party. The third main faction is led by Lionel Jospin, the Education Minister. Mr. Fabius, who is also a former Prime Minister and was long regarded as Mr. Mitterrand's favorite, is still only 45 years old and can probably afford to bow to Mr. Rocard's greater experience and popularity with an eye on the future. At the same time, by assuming the challenge of trying to revive his party's sagging fortunes before regional elections in March and crucial parliamentary elections in 1993, Mr. Fabius is gambling with his own political reputation in his new post as first secretary. Slump in Popularity After his election today, he pledged to "renovate, rally and reform the party," which has been shaken not only by bitter infighting but also by a slump in the popularity of Mr. Mitterrand and Mrs. Cresson. Recent polls show that only one in five French voters still support the Socialists. While an opposition victory in regional elections in March now seems unavoidable, the Socialists are above all anxious not to lose parliamentary elections next year. If they do, Mr. Mitterrand would be forced to share power with a conservative Prime Minister, weakening the Socialists' hopes of retaining the presidency in 1995. With many French voters blaming Mrs. Cresson for rising unemployment and a slowdown in economic growth, some Socialists argue that she should be replaced as Prime Minister now. Today she showed no interest in resigning. "I was appointed to be daring and vigorous," she said. "We will continue to work together for the whole of this year."

8-> Ferraro Wants D'Amato Ad To Be Stopped
Geraldine A. Ferraro said yesterday that she would try to force Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato to stop showing a new campaign commercial that includes a news clip of Ms. Ferraro criticizing the fund-raising tactics of State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Mr. D'Amato's Democratic opponent. The ad, in which a narrator labels Mr. Abrams "hopelessly political," is one of two tough new commercials the D'Amato camp began broadcasting yesterday as the Republican incumbent escalated his media war on his Democratic challenger. Ms. Ferraro lost to Mr. Abrams in the Senate primary after a bruising campaign in which Mr. Abrams and another candidate, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, repeatedly attacked her and raised questions about her integrity. Ms. Ferraro has so far declined to endorse Mr. Abrams in his fight against Mr. D'Amato. A Strong Response But yesterday, she responded forcefully to word of the latest D'Amato ad. "I don't support Al D'Amato," said Ms. Ferraro, who was campaigning in Seattle for Gov. Bill Clinton in the Presidential race. "I don't appreciate his cynical use of me or my candidacy to promote himself. I will contact lawyers to see if I can stop the showing of that commercial." Neither Senator D'Amato nor his aides could be reached last night to comment on Ms. Ferraro's reaction, and it was not clear what, if anything, she could do to block the commercial. But by running the ad, the D'Amato camp provoked Ms. Ferraro to making her strongest statement yet opposing a Republican victory -- even if did not move her to endorse Mr. Abrams. The D'Amato commercials are part of a strategy that has emerged in recent days as Mr. D'Amato has unleashed a series of television attacks on a kitchen-sink mix of topics on his rival. D'Amato aides said that pace and practice would continue. Mr. Abrams, busy trying to raise money, has had trouble getting his own message out and reacting to the D'Amato attacks in a way that reaches the same widespread television audience. So far, Mr. Abrams has run only two commercials, stressing the contrasts between him and the Senator on issues like abortion rights, which Mr. Abrams supports, and ethics. Mr. D'Amato's new 30-second ad was his most pointed effort yet to ally himself with Ms. Ferraro and her complaints that Mr. Abrams had waged a nasty primary fight. The ad uses footage from a televised debate, in which Ms. Ferraro accused Mr. Abrams of being "in contempt" of criticism by the State Commission on Government Integrity, which faulted him and other top state officials several years ago for taking campaign contributions from people with business before their offices -- in his case, lawyers and developers with pending condominium and co-op apartment conversions. Then an announcer says: "Bob Abrams once swore he wouldn't take money from people who do business with his office, people who profit from his decisions. But Bob Abrams needed the money to run his dirty little campaign against Geraldine Ferraro. He broke his oath, he took the money. Bob Abrams: Hopelessly political." Mr. Abrams's press secretary, Timothy Gilles, called the ads "more of the daily lies from D'Amato," who has been the subject of repeated investigations into whether he did favors for contributors. Mr. Gilles said Mr. Abrams promised only to reject contributions from direct vendors or contractors with his office and to restrict others voluntarily, for which the state commission praised him. Mr. Gilles said the voluntary restrictions only applied to his re-election campaigns for Attorney General, since any possible appearance of conflict related to his state work. The other D'Amato ad, 10 seconds, shows a mechanic under the hood of a pickup, as an announcer says: "Bob Abrams wants a 30 percent increase in spending, and that can only mean higher taxes and fewer jobs." At that, the truck's radiator belches steam, and the mechanic hits his head on the raised hood. The Senator's staff bases its calculations on figures from the staff of the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, of the costs of a pending national health insurance bill that Mr. Abrams has said he favors. But Mr. Gilles said: "Bob Abrams does not support a 30 percent increase in spending. The cold war is over and we no longer need to live in the past as Senator D'Amato believes, and in fact, we should be cutting the military budget."

11-> Studying the Fine and Less Expensive Art of Dining at Home
Surrounded by steam kettles and double-stack boilers, a class of food aficionados gathered around a master chef at his cutting board recently as he filleted a salmon, bone by bone, and lectured on the art of selecting vegetables. "Please don't buy those jumbo carrots," Bradley Ogden, one of the country's leading chefs, chided over the whir of exhaust fans. "The big ones have no flavor to them. When you buy one, smell it, see if it's heavy, if the stem is still attached, if it has an aroma. If it doesn't, put it back." Before him, taking notes, stood an accountant, a chiropractor, a schoolteacher, a stockbroker, a general contractor and some insurance executives, all of whom spent close to $900 a couple plus air fare to hear these words of wisdom and chop onions and grate ginger with the best in the business. They had flown in from Palm Springs, Fla.; Tulsa, Okla.; East Hampton, L.I., and Nashville, 88 people altogether who spent a tidy sum for a weekend of cooking school at the Four Seasons Hotel here. It was one of a series of enormously popular cooking weekends organized by Food and Wine magazine in conjunction with Four Seasons Hotels around the country that seem to have flourished in these days of scrimping and cocooning. To these amateur cooks, this was not money out the window but a long-term investment in healthier eating and a quick lesson in re-creating the foie gras 80's without guilt. "People are finding you can do it for less at home and on your own terms," said W. Peter Prestcott, a senior editor at Food and Wine. "Home is becoming the last fortress. People are redigging their moats, drawing the curtains and standing by their stoves with their nearest and dearest." Like recovering shopaholics chastened by overspending, some of the people who gathered here on a brisk spring weekend admitted to the excesses of a cheerier decade, the $100 dinners that had become all too routine, the feigned ignorance about how to preheat an oven. Now they want to change. "Our version of cooking was pushing the re-dial button on the telephone to see which restaurant delivered," said Melvina Ng, a Manhattan accountant, who came to the cooking weekend with her husband, Mark Ng, a teacher. Now Mr. Ng was assisting Mr. Ogden, the executive chef of the Lark Creek Inn outside San Francisco, with the blood-orange vinaigrette, pouring the olive oil as Mr. Ogden stirred. In another corner of the kitchen, Richard Shilowich, a general contractor from East Hampton, stood over a flat-top range grilling onions. The cooking weekend was his Christmas present from his wife, Terri Rauch, a chiropractor, and Mr. Shilowich, the primary cook in the family, was in nirvana. "What you get out of a weekend like this is a lot of subtleties," Mr. Shilowich said. "You can always pick up a recipe." For them, the weekend was a declaration of independence from long lines at hot restaurants and the pressure to be pretentious. "We've all gotten tired of the $100 dinners that are mediocre," Ms. Rauch said. "We're all going back to home-style things. Now you're not embarrassed to serve Irish stew or beef burgundy or pizza. People are just happy to be getting together. And you don't have to worry about somebody dropping the Waterford." The downscaling of the food experience was everywhere during the weekend. Instead of decadent centerpieces of fresh-cut flowers flown in from the tropics, the tables at the weekend's semiformal dinner had glass vases filled with things like turnips or artichokes in free-form vegetable sculptures. And in a course on table-setting, Mr. Prestcott showed how even cheap reproductions from modest retailers like Pier 1 Imports could become elegant table art with the right touch. He held up a blue fish vase and, before anyone could say it, conceded that everyone in the class probably hated it. Then he put three of them together as the table centerpiece. "Now it becomes Bernini," Mr. Prestcott said, pleased with himself. "It becomes a fountain. One thing finds another. It is not just a fish. It is a statement of mass and subject." In a lecture that was part Dalai Lama and part Robin Leach, he admonished the class not to make centerpieces into hedges or to use too-skimpy napkins or to seat ex-spouses together, all the while extolling the dinner table's central role in "the ceremony of life." "The table is a forum," Mr. Prestcott said. "It is where you present who you are, what you've learned, what is important to you, your way of living." That is why, he said, no table, however humble or how tough the times, should go without a little artistry. "Even on your non-Queen Elizabeth, Cousin Betty table, you want to keep a certain symmetry and neatness about it," he said. Over all, however, the weekend was devoted to lighter, more healthful cooking, and students were taught how to cook with less fat, using vinegars and chilis and herbs to bring out the flavor. "There is rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, tarragon vinegar, imported white-wine vinegar and raspberry vinegar, which you can easily make at home," said Mark Baker, executive chef at the Chicago Four Seasons Hotel. Within minutes, the kitchen took on the scent of vinegar and raspberries coming to a boil, nearly ready to be stored in earthenware a couple of weeks before being bottled. At the same time, a salmon fillet was ready after 10 minutes in a dime-store bamboo steamer over tarragon and ginger in water, without an ounce of butter or oil. And in another kitchen, Mr. Ogden was instructing students on such things as the best way to dress a tossed salad. "Most people season the center instead of the whole," Mr. Ogden said. He told them to oil the inside of the bowl rather than the lettuce and to "work from the bottom. Toss lightly until the leaves are evenly coated." Karen Santucci, a first-grade teacher from Rochester, was taking notes as if she were in a calculus class, afraid to do too much dicing of vegetables because she might miss something. "I didn't come here to chop and mash," Ms. Santucci said. "I can always chop and mash at home." She grew up watching her Italian grandmother make pasta from scratch and decided, recession or no, to take the leap and treat herself to a dream weekend as a present to herself. "I don't drink or smoke," Ms. Santucci said. "I don't drive a fancy car. I've never been one to whip out the Visa card and spend on just anything. But this is something that makes me smile."

12-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Dire Straits Brendan Byrne Arena East Rutherford, N.J. If Dire Straits hadn't been right there onstage on Sunday night, you might have thought you were sitting at home listening to the group's albums on the stereo. The sound was digitally perfect, mixed so that the singer Mark Knopfler's guitar notes were always at the forefront. The songs, spanning the band's recording history from "Sultans of Swing" in 1978 to the latest album, "On Every Street" (Warner Brothers), were often flawless reproductions of the studio originals. The audience was polite and restrained; no one stood up, no one yelled or whistled in the quiet parts. The only things missing were a couch, to stretch out on and maybe doze a little, and a remote control, to skip over the boring songs, of which there were many. Despite the enormous popularity attained with the 1985 blockbuster "Brothers in Arms," Dire Straits essentially makes private music. As a songwriter, Mr. Knopfler frequently works at a decibel level barely above a whisper, and his slow, hushed numbers are constructed from instrumental minutiae like delicate guitar fills, tinkling piano and long patches with nothing but the breath of a synthesizer. Even his hits have a painstaking precision; he seems to use fat power chords only when he wants to make a joke about rock-and-roll, as in the heavily ironic "Money for Nothing." Attempting to translate this into a live situation, Dire Straits became bogged down in a morass of textures and snail's-pace tempos. The nine-piece band, spread across a two-tiered stage, consisted of two drummers, three guitarists, a bassist, two keyboardists and a horn player. The two-and-a-half-hour show opened with what would customarily be a finale: a lengthy extended jam on "Calling Elvis," from "On Every Street," which went on for so long it almost needed an intermission afterward. Everyone took solos, including both drummers. Multicolored lights danced off every fret and cymbal, giving the stage the look of a kind of exotic aquarium. Elsewhere, Mr. Knopfler put in jams where there were no songs. "Sultans of Swing," for which shadowy crew members brought out a third, smaller drum kit so that Mr. Knopfler could affect the intimacy of a garage band, ended and then started again as a different tune before Mr. Knopfler had worked back to the original melody. New ballads like "Fade to Black" and "Planet of New Orleans" were so sluggish and monstrously uncompelling that their inclusion seemed pointless. Only in a few places did Mr. Knopfler inject some real human warmth into the show. He played a gorgeous steel-guitar lead in "Romeo and Juliet," from 1980's "Making Movies"; pedal steel guitar added a country tinge to the ditty "Walk of Life." "Two Young Lovers," from the 1983 "Twisting by the Pool," was a noble choice, but it showed how far Dire Straits has come from spontaneous, rough-and-tumble rock-and-roll. For most bands, live shows are an opportunity to bring out the heart and soul that might be missing from their recordings; for Dire Straits it worked in reverse.

13-> Review/Film; Police Thriller With Layers of Issues
"I want my cake and eat it too," says one of the characters in "Deep Cover," the story of a policeman assigned to masquerade as a cocaine dealer. The film itself seemingly embraces that same thought. On the one hand an upright police thriller, "Deep Cover" is also a rapt exploration of all the vice and viciousness that make the drug kingpin's life so popular with contemporary film makers. The film's cautionary message, which is stated outright, is undercut by its fascination with seamy glamour. At the resume level, there are several things that raise "Deep Cover" above the ordinary. The screenplay is by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean, who respectively wrote "The Player" and "Internal Affairs" and whose views on the subject of corruption are subversively entertaining. The director is Bill Duke, whose "Rage in Harlem" was a spirited period piece. Its stars are the quietly commanding Larry Fishburne and the wry Jeff Goldblum, who make an interestingly offbeat team. And its racial stereotypes have been reversed, since it is Mr. Goldblum, who is white, who plays the drug dealer and Mr. Fishburne who plays the cop. Mr. Fishburne, who made such a formidable impression playing the father in "Boyz N the Hood," has what is clearly the film's central role. Indeed, "Deep Cover" is seen so purely from this black policeman's viewpoint that the story's white characters take on a cartoonish exaggeration, just as black figures in white-dominated movies sometimes do. The film's brief glimpse of a white lawyer, his pretty blond wife and their studious little daughter in an all-white suburban kitchen offers a lacerating perspective on the yuppie dream. Its white and Hispanic drug traders are drawn in similarly broad ways. In contrast with this is the film's early look at little Russell Stevens Jr. and his father (Glynn Turman) in 1972. "What you want for Christmas, boy?" asks the father, who has just snorted some white powder in front of his terrified young son and who at this point has begun waving a gun. Moments later, watching his father shot to death in a bungled liquor-store holdup, the boy finds his character being forged. Twenty years later he is a stern, solemn policeman (Mr. Fishburne). His private motto regarding drugs and alcohol is "Never have, never will." Playing instantly on racial tensions in his film's first scene (just as he did in "A Rage in Harlem"), Mr. Duke shows Russell being recruited by an insulting white Drug Enforcement Agency operative (Charles Martin Smith) who wants him to infiltrate a vast drug cartel. "Undercover, all your faults will become virtues," the D.E.A. man says insinuatingly, referring to the fact that Russell's psychological profile is not dissimilar to a criminal's. Thus persuaded, Russell adopts the pseudonym John Q. Hull and takes up residence in a seedy Los Angeles rooming house, where the woman across the hall is soon offering to sell him her young son. Evidence of the drug culture and its ill effects is not hard to find. If the film does a powerful job of depicting that drug culture and of demonstrating how high-level dealers keep their business associates in line, it is less successful in separating the many strands of a deeply cynical and convoluted plot. The story often loses sight of Russell/John and his gradual inner transformation. (Before the story of his drug escapade is over, he will be participating in the killing of underworld rivals, not to mention sampling the merchandise.) Instead, the film pays attention to ugly encounters into which the undercover cop is reluctantly drawn, from the fatal poolroom beating of a suspected police informer to the shooting of an especially ruthless dealer. Eventually, the hero's participation in these events brings him a fancy car, new clothes and a new home, all on Government orders. "I liked being a big shot," Mr. Fishburne says hauntingly in voice-over. "Wouldn't you?" Although "Deep Cover" stumbles over too many minor characters, it sustains interest through the contrast and camaraderie between Mr. Goldblum's lawyer, who has a get-rich- quick scheme involving detailed marketing prospectuses for drug sales, and Mr. Fishburne's once-honest cop. Also on hand are Victoria Dillard as a money-laundering art dealer with a cool, seductive manner, and Gregory Sierra and Roger Guenveur Smith as two of the story's many drug entrepreneurs. Clarence Williams 3d's earnest narcotics officer figures prominently in the film's ending but only adds to the overall confusion. "Deep Cover" eventually degenerates into so much gratuitous violence that "kill" sounds like the most-used verb in the screenplay's last stages. The screenplay's frequent emphasis on homophobic insults is another unfortunate touch. "Deep Cover" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity and sexual situations. Deep Cover Directed by Bill Duke; written by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean; director of photography, Bojan Bazelli; edited by John Carter; produced by Pierre David and Mr. Bean; released by New Line Cinema.

14-> COLLEGES; Miami Athletes Implicated in Illegal Grants
The United States Attorney's office asserted today that more than 65 University of Miami students, almost all of them athletes, received Federal financial aid fraudulently during a two-year period commencing June 1989. The Unitd States Attorney's office said that more than 40 of those were football players. It is the first public indication of just how widespread the practice was at Miami, the co-defending national football champion. The university has been under investigation by the United States Attorney's office for 13 months, since a former assistant academic counselor, Tony Russell, admitted falsifying forms for Pell grants and accepting kickbacks of up to $85 from each. Sixty-five present or former Miami students were sent letters by the United States Attorney's office that made them eligible for a pretrial diversion program. But the prosecutor, Martin B. Goldberg, today left no doubt about the culpability of those 65. 'They Were Not Deceived' "There is evidence that they knowingly and willfully made false statements and furnished false information in applying for Federal financial aid," Goldberg told United States Magistrate Linnea R. Johnson at today's hearing. "Some even falsified tax forms. "They were not deceived," Goldberg said. "They were not duped. Nor were they blindly led astray." As for those implicated in the investigation beyond the 65 who got letters on July 2, Goldberg said it will become evident eventually why they were not offered an option of the pre-trial diversion program, which stipulates that the athletes "accept responsibility for their conduct," make restitution for any money obtained fraudulently and cooperate fully with Goldberg's investigation. In return, they would not be prosecuted. Many of the 65 have obtained legal counsel, a requirement before being allowed to enter the diversion program, Goldberg said. Twelve of those who say they do not have the resources to obtain an attorney attended today's hearing to secure court-appointed counsel. Variety of Athletes Involved A starting defensive lineman, Diego London, a senior, was among those who attended. Also attending were the former Hurricane football players Shannon Crowell, Marty Golloher and Melvin Sharp, along with the basketball players Samarr Logan and Hammie Ward, and a golf team member, Eric Egnatios. Three female athletes also were present -- Rachel Violet (tennis), Nancy Jones (track) and Mary Beth Wadlington (swimming), along with two nonathletes: Charles Gilchrist and Derrick Robinson. A source close to the investigation said at least four other current football starters have received letters and are considering the diversion program. It now appears that the United States Attorney's investigation will continue into another football season. A status hearing is set before Johnson Aug. 31. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, which could ban Miami from bowl game appearances and reduce scholarships because of the school's issuing fraudulent grants, is awaiting the conclusion of the Federal investigation before starting its own.

15-> Bridge
For thousands of bridge players today was the beginning of the American Contract Bridge League's Summer National Championships here, but for 100 or so it was the ending of the Grand National Teams, which began at grass-roots level eight months ago. In Flight A, one semifinal will match Florida with New England and the District of Columbia with Nevada. Two teams from the New York metropolitan area are among eight survivors in the Flight B event. One is a Long Island foursome consisting of Otto Rothenberg of Merrick, Arthur Haley of Centereach, Bert Kulic of Nesconset and Richard Baumer of Holbrook. The other is a Westchester squad composed of Nielih Cheng and Peter Kalat, both of Scarsdale; Jeffrey Allen and Pat Calahan, both of Hastings-on-Hudson, and Bruce Platt of Dobbs Ferry with Carlos Munoz of Stamford, Conn. How to Lose a Loser On the diagramed deal from the Flight A Grand National Teams, Walter Johnson of Columbus, Ohio, played skillfully to bring home four hearts after the opening lead of the spade ten. This was covered by the jack and the queen and won with the ace. Faced with a possible loser in each suit, South began by leading a trump to the king. East won with the ace and returned a club. It was most unlikely that East would shift to a club if he held the king, so instead of routinely playing low from his hand, Johnson put up the ace. This was the key play. He then led the diamond jack and put up dummy's king to make his game when West played low. It would have done West no good to take his diamond ace, for he would have been forced to give the declarer a trick somewhere. But notice the difference if South had failed to play the club ace. West would have taken his king and could then have cashed his diamond ace and led a club or a heart. South would have been forced to lose a spade at the finish for down one. This fine play turned out to gain nothing, but it averted a loss. In the replay West led a club against the same contract and South made the winning guess by playing dummy's queen.

16-> Brown Resignation Highlights High Turnover Among Chiefs
Lee P. Brown's departure after two and a half years as New York City's top police official is -- in one sense, at least -- typical of an emerging pattern across the nation: with increasing frequency police chiefs are lasting only a short time in the job. In the last five years, the heads of the police departments in 41 of the 50 largest cities in the country have resigned or been dismissed, according to an analysis by the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington. Thirteen cities have replaced their chiefs twice in that time, and Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas have each had three different police executives. "They're burning out, dropping out, getting fired or having health problems," said Robert Trojanowicz, a professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University and a co-author of the forthcoming book, "Police Management for the 21st Century." Part of the reason for this, criminal-justice experts say -- and perhaps a consideration in Mr. Brown's desire to spend more time with his wife, who is seriously ill -- is that the job has grown far more demanding. Running a big-city police department is no longer simply a matter of commanding troops and catching criminals. Trying to get at the root of crime, cope with shrinking budgets and respond to conflicting demands, the police chief must be a blend of diplomat, coach, drill sergeant and community organizer, on the streets at dawn, commending a precinct commander at noon, speaking at a church at night. Reviewing his tenure in New York with a reporter the other day, Mr. Brown acknowledged that he had jousted with budget officials in City Hall and with the press and noted, without a hint of regret, that he had often worked 16-hour days. Still, his relish at serving at what he portrayed as the pinnacle of policing in the United States came through vividly, and he made it clear that he was not leaving because he had been unhappy in the job. "The time I can spend with my wife is the issue," he said. Criminal-justice experts also say that a subtler issue may be at work, one that has also dogged school superintendents: Police chiefs are being asked to work within a society struggling with problems, like homelessness and high unemployment, that are far beyond their control. "People look to the police chief for the answers to all the problems of society," said C. Roland Vaughn, the Chief of Police in an affluent suburb of Atlanta and the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which represents 8,000 police executives in the United States. 'The Court of Last Resort' "We're sort of like the court of last resort for a lot of people who need help," said Patrick S. Fitzsimons, the Chief of Police in Seattle. "We're being asked to intercede and find shelter, to take people out of squatters' situations. We're in the middle on something created by the economy. You have to take a humane approach." The high turnover in police chiefs has led many criminal-justice experts to call for the creation of formal contracts that would give the chiefs some insulation from the whims of a mayor, an angry public or electoral change. Mr. Trojanowicz has suggested, for example, that a chief be guaranteed that he or she would serve at least two years into the mayoral term following his or her appointment. Many modern police leaders, like Mr. Brown, have come to resemble chief executive officers of major corporations, more likely to be seen in dark suits and ties than star-studded uniforms, more likely to be armed with law degrees and Ph.D.'s than guns. Mr. Brown has a Ph.D. in criminology from the University of California at Berkeley and his chief deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, who has been named acting head of the department, has a law degree from St. John's University, a master's in law from New York University and a master's in public administration from Harvard. "The chief has to be a person with vision, a manager, a leader and an interpreter of political policy," said Joseph D. McNamara, the retired Chief of Police in San Jose, Calif., who has a Ph.D. from Harvard and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Higher Salaries With better education and greater responsibilities, criminal-justice experts say, the pay of police chiefs has been gradually rising. Mr. Brown, for example, was paid $110,000 a year. The job pays $85,000 in Philadelphia and more than $150,000 in Los Angeles, said Darrel Stephens, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. After the mayor's job, said Gerald W. Lynch, the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, "nothing in the city demands more time and energy and total commitment." Not many chiefs can stand the heat for long. "A good 40 percent of them either resign or are fired under pressure," said Mr. Stephens, who made the analysis for the police forum. "A lot of the other people, after they've been in the job two or three or four years or so, start feeling the conflicting pressures, and they just retire, drop out. Very few grow old in the job." Though there are no comparable statistics on the length of service of police chiefs in the top 50 cities prior to the Police Executive Research Forum analysis, both Mr. Stephens and Mr. Trojanowicz said they believed the turnover had greatly increased. Reuben Greenberg, the Police Chief in Charleston, S.C., agreed. "The job has so many pressures," he said. "In some cases a civilian group or the mayor is trying to run the department. You have very little leverage." Changing of the Guard For years, Mr. Trojanowicz said, police chiefs came up through the ranks. They knew the politics of their community, and they tended to be less aggressive and innovative than the new breed of police chief. New chiefs tend to be better educated and often take the top spot in a department after having served for 10 years or so in another city, in a kind of apprenticeship. "Years ago," Mr. Trojanowicz said, "there wasn't so much boat-rocking." There was no sign of dissatisfaction with Mr. Brown from City Hall and, by all accounts, he was enthusiastically pressing ahead with a transformation of the department, putting thousands of officers on foot patrol in what he calls community policing. But his wife, Yvonne, had become seriously ill and, an aide said, he felt there could be no compromising in his "totally consuming job." Like many police executives who step down these days, Mr. Brown is returning to the campus. He will teach at Texas Southern University. Many others take jobs as directors of security for private companies, and some become consultants. Mr. Stephens said he knew of only two chiefs who had been given leaves of absence in recent years -- one to recover from a heart attack, the other for a year of study at Harvard -- and Mr. Brown apparently did not consider asking for one. "It's the nature of the job," Mr. Stephens said. "There's an expectation that whoever is in charge is going to be able to be there and do the job." Mr. Vaughn said the high visibility of the police chief takes a toll on his family. "He has to be accessible all the time and has to be accountable all the time," Mr. Vaughn said. "Like the preacher's kids, the chief's children are expected to adhere to a higher standard. It's difficult for a wife to share her views for fear people will think they're the chief's views, too. It becomes somewhat of a guarded life." Mr. Brown said that after serving in New York, he considered his police career finished. "I think 17 years of being a c.e.o. of law enforcement is enough," he said. "When you leave as the Police Commissioner of New York, where else do you go?"

18-> Constructing Modern Idiom on a Base of Tradition
In a time when poetry has reveled in its freedom, deploying unmetered, unrhymed lines across the page, the formal properties of Derek Walcott's work are instantly visible to the eye. To open his "Collected Poems" is to find oneself in the presence of a writer for whom English poetry is no oppressive burden, to be cast off like the colonial past of Mr. Walcott's native St. Lucia, but a vibrant tradition, to be plundered and recast in his own contemporary idiom. Couplets and quatrains unfurl with a stately regularity, suffused with echoes of Shakespeare and Keats, T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden. "Art is History's nostalgia," Walcott writes in "Omeros," an epic-length modern "Odyssey" composed in terza rima. In his work, the voice of his English precursors resonates, animated by his own people's voice, a rich Creole patois mimed in "The Schooner Flight": "I go draw and knot every line as tight/ as ropes in this rigging, in simple speech. . ." The son of a schoolteacher who died when Mr. Walcott was a year old, the poet was raised in a bookish atmosphere. "Our house had a wire-meshed library of great books," he recalled in a memoir of his youth, "principally a uniform edition of Dickens and Walter Scott and Sabatini." His teachers recited Swinburne by heart, inculcating in him the notion that poetry was "living speech." A quatrain spoken by one of his characters could serve as an ironic autobiography: I'm just a red nigger who love the sea, I had a sound colonial education, I have Dutch, nigger, and English in me, And either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation Clearly, Mr. Walcott is the latter -- a nation polyglot in the extreme. "With equal right," as Joseph Brodsky, his friend and fellow Nobel laureate, has noted, "Walcott could have said that he has in him Greek, Latin, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian, French: because of Homer, Lucretius, Ovid, Dante, Rilke, Machado, Lorca, Neruda, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Pasternak, Baudelaire, Valery, Apollinaire." In part, his genius is his versatility -- his recourse to what Brodsky calls "a genetic Babel." Yet however international Mr. Walcott's style, his language is quintessentially English. More than any poet of his generation, he has absorbed our poetic canon -- absorbed and internalized it. Mr. Walcott, says the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, "possesses English more deeply and sonorously than most of the English themselves." At times, he can sound derivative. "We swore to make drink/and art our finishing school," he writes in the cadence of Yeats; "A white church spire whistles into space/like a swordfish" borrows shamelessly from Robert Lowell. In his earlier work, especially, Mr. Walcott's apprenticeship to his English masters has a slavish feel to it; the elaborate, knotted rhetoric is too high-pitched, inflated for rhetoric effect, as in these willed and ponderous lines from "The Fortunate Traveler": The heart of darkness is not Africa The heart of darkness is the core of fire In the white center of the holocaust. But at his best -- and there is little dross in Mr. Walcott's oeuvre -- he achieves a sustained eloquence, an exhilarating amplitude; he's "a man immersed in words," the poet James Dickey has written, "not afraid of them, but excited and confirmed by what he can cause them to do." In awarding Derek Walcott the Nobel Prize, the Swedish academy singled out his "historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment." Multicultural in the demographic and political sense: Mr. Walcott is black, his homeland a Caribbean island remote from the dominant "white" culture, he is a poet for whom exile -- both geographic and personal -- has been the informing fact of his life. But his work vindicates T. S. Eliot's account of the way in which a poetic tradition evolves through the modification of works of art "by the new (the really new) work of art among them." In Derek Walcott, we can discern the history of what is most enduring in our tradition, invigorated, as it has always been, by the voice of our most recent immigrants. Invigorated and made new. PROUD PEOPLE, HEAT AND SILVERED LIGHT I sat on the white terrace waiting for the cheque. Our waiter, in a black bow-tie, plunged through the sand between the full deck-chairs, bouncing to discotheque music from the speakers, a tray sailed in one hand. . . . He was determined to meet the beach's demands, like a Lawrence of St. Lucia. . . . Then Lawrence frowned at a mirage . . . now the mirage dissolved to a woman with a madras head-tie, but the head proud, although it was looking for work. I felt like standing in homage to a beauty that left, like a ship, widening eyes in its wake. "Who the hell is that?" a tourist near my table asked a waitress. The waitress said, "She? She too proud!" As the carved lids of the unimaginable ebony mask unwrapped from its cotton-wool cloud, the waitress sneered, "Helen." And all the rest followed. -- "Helen at the Beach" ("Omeros," Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1990) The time will come when, with elation, you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror, and each will smile at the other's welcome, and say, sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was your self. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life. -- "Love After Love" ("Collected Poems, 1948-1984," Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1986) Why do I imagine the death of Mandelstam among the yellowing coconuts, why does my gift already look over its shoulder for a shadow to fill the door and pass this very page into eclipse? Why does the moon increase into an arc-lamp and the inkstain on my hand prepare to press thumb-downward before a shrugging sergeant? What is this new odor in the air that was once salt, that smelt like lime at daybreak, and my cat, I know I imagine it, leap from my path, and my children's eyes already seem like horizons, and all my poems, even this one, wish to hide? -- "Preparing for Exile" ("Collected Poems, 1948-1984") The full moon is so fierce that I can count the coconuts' cross-hatched shade on bungalows, their white walls raging with insomnia. The stars leak drop by drop on the tin plates of the sea almonds, and the jeering clouds are luminously rumpled as the sheets. The surf, insatiably promiscuous, groans through the walls; I feel my mind whiten to moonlight, altering that form which daylight unambiguously designed, from a tree to a girl's body bent in foam; then, treading close, the black hump of a hill, its nostrils softly snorting, nearing the naked girl splashing her breasts with silver. Both would have kept their proper distance still, if the chaste moon hadn't swiftly drawn the drapes of a dark cloud, coupling their shapes. -- From "Europa" ("Collected Poems, 1948-1984")

20-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Lord, Dentsu Wins Amati Ad Account
On Madison Avenue, where the world divides into agencies that have automobile accounts and those that do not, Lord, Dentsu & Partners yesterday joined the ranks of the "haves." The agency, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York, won the estimated $60 million account for Mazda Motor of America's forthcoming luxury-car division, Amati, after a closely watched five-month review. Lord, Dentsu's rivals were Foote, Cone & Belding in San Francisco, whose sibling Los Angeles office is the agency for Mazda Motor's Mazda cars and trucks, and three agencies that have been aggressively pursuing auto accounts: Della Femina, McNamee Inc., Los Angeles; Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, New York, and Tatham/RSCG, Chicago. Change of Fortunes "This is the biggest win I've ever had," said Richard J. Lord, chairman and chief executive of Lord, Dentsu. For Lord, Dentsu, a joint venture of Young & Rubicam Inc. and the giant Dentsu agency of Japan, the assignment represents a significant change in its fortunes. Only a few months ago, some advertising executives said the agency was in a tailspin, following its loss of several large clients, including its sole automotive account, Peugeot, which withdrew from the American market. The agency reorganized itself and strengthened its Los Angeles office by hiring Leonard Pearlstein as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Pearlstein was a founder of Keye/ Donna/Pearlstein, a defunct Los Angeles shop that was well respected for its creative work. "Lord, Dentsu demonstrated to us the best creative thinking, the best planning and the best execution of the creative," said Richard Colliver, group vice president and general manager of Amati. Highly Desirable Prize Though Mazda will not introduce its first Amati models, two sedans, until 1994, the account was a highly desirable prize amid the slump in automotive ad spending. Indeed, some advertising executives had wondered whether Mazda would consider another agency besides Foote, Cone & Belding. "Foote, Cone is a good agency," Mr. Colliver said, "and they've had a good relationship with Mazda for more than 20 years. But the Mazda division is one division of this company and the Amati division is another." Amati will compete with such luxury-car lines as like Honda's Acura, Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus. The Amati account will be handled from Lord, Dentsu's Los Angeles office, and some New York employees will relocate there.

21-> What Feminists Learn From Hillary Clinton; Get Serious, America
To the Editor: As a European observer of your emerging Presidential campaign, I am amazed at the way political debate in this country is driven by salaciousness, rather than issues. Is it really because the solutions proposed for the country's social and economic woes aren't sexy enough to hold anyone's attention for long? In France, where "l'amour de l'apres-midi" (love in the afternoon) is still a favored, and often political, pastime, the Gov. Bill Clinton affair must be seen with bemusement and amusement, especially in view of Prime Minister Edith Cresson's reported views on the sexuality of American, British and German men. In Italy, sex and politics are like bread and cheese, or pasta and tomato sauce. Only in Britain do politicosexual scandals still cause a stir. Yet the birth of an illegitimate daughter to the erstwhile secretary of Margaret Thatcher's 1983 campaign manager hardly prevented him from assuming ministerial office later in the 80's. Gary Hart, with less mud on his name, hasn't had that second chance. Following months of press coverage of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill and William Kennedy Smith sagas, isn't it time to judge Presidential candidates on how they perform in public with at least as much attention as we give their purported exploits behind closed doors? To judge how what they say in public translates into what they do in public? The evidence is all there, for anyone who wants to step out of the neighborhood supermarket and look. Instead of reading The Star, American voters should be reading a few more lips, and a lot more closely than the last time. CLAIRE C. SPENCER New York, Jan. 30, 1992

22-> MARKET WATCH; Swapping Woes: A Fed Official Sees Problems
Will the next great banking crisis come not from the things on banks' balance sheets -- the bad loans -- but from the things not on them, the arcane financial innovations that show up in bank financial reports deep in the fine print? Ask that of a banker involved in such things, and you'll get -- not for attribution, of course -- assurances that all is well. Given how little is disclosed, it is very hard for an outsider to challenge, or confirm, such assurances. But now comes a regulator with access to better information than the rest of us, saying that he does not know what is going on, but it certainly worries him. "You had all better take a very very hard look at off-balance sheet activities," said E. Gerald Corrigan, the president of the New York Fed, in a speech to bankers. "High-tech banking and finance has its place, but it's not all that it is cracked up to be." What worries him the most is the booming business in swaps, a market measured in the trillions of dollars by the International Swap Dealers Association. In a simple swap, one party agrees to pay the other's fixed-rate interest payments on, say, a $100 million loan -- the "notional principal amount," in swaps jargon -- while the other agrees to pay variable rates. Those huge principal amounts grossly overstate the size and risk of the market, but even so, the figures are big. If one party defaults, the other resumes making its own interest payments or buys a new swap to replace the old one. The maximum loss is the cost of the new swap. If all swaps defaulted now, a Fed official says, several large banks would lose more than $10 billion each. That is unrealistically high because, in many cases the bank may offset losses on one deal with profits on another. And anyway, most will not default. So what is a better figure? Who knows? Next year there will be better disclosures, but questions will remain. Used properly, the risk of an interest-rate swap for a bank is not very different from the risk of making a loan. Since swaps are often made by companies with good bond ratings, those risks may be less than on many loans. And because some new swaps just reverse old ones, a banker says, "growth in swaps outstanding does not produce a corresponding growth in risk." But swaps and other financial innovations can also be used to place huge bets on the markets. And Mr. Corrigan seems to be worried that those bets may be made, and lost, before top management, or regulators, realize what is going on. Delivering what he called a warning to bank managements on Jan. 30, he voiced fears that "some of the specific purposes for which swaps are now being used may be quite at odds with an appropriately conservative view of the purpose of a swap, thereby introducing new elements of risk or distortion into the marketplace." Is he right to worry? That's the problem with how secret this market has been. For outsiders, there is no way to be sure.

23-> COMPANY NEWS; T.W.A. PENSION DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR AIRLINE'S SALE
The $1.2 billion shortfall in Trans World Airlines' pension funds was removed yesterday as a significant obstacle to the bankrupt airline's acquisition by creditors and employees. T.W.A. agreed to pay part of the shortfall over 15 years, while the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursues T.W.A.'s owner, Carl C. Icahn, for the entire $1.2 billion shortfall. T.W.A. reached agreements with creditors and unions in August to sell the airline in exchange for cost reductions. The airline said yesterday that its lower costs had helped it win an aircraft-maintenance contract from Hawaiian Airlines, meaning that T.W.A. will now be able to retain more than 250 of the 692 workers it had planned to lay off at its Kansas City, Mo., overhaul plant.

24-> Shirley Berman, 55; Sued Over Child's Birth
Shirley Berman, whose daughter, born with Down Syndrome, inspired her to wage a battle for a New Jersey law requiring doctors to inform parents if their unborn child is retarded, died on Feb. 8 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 55 years old and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J. She died of cancer, a family spokesman said. Mrs. Berman, a social worker, began a legal battle after her daughter Sharon, now 17, was born with Down Syndrome. Mrs. Berman contended that her doctor failed to tell her she risked having a retarded child and that the fetus could have been tested for the condition. In 1979, the New Jersey State Supreme Court ruled that doctors could be sued for "wrongful birth" if their negligence deprived a mother of her right to an abortion and a child was born with defects. Mrs. Berman worked for the Westchester Association for Retarded Children. A native of Montreal, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Canada, a master's in art therapy in 1981 from the College of New Rochelle and a master's in social work from Fordham University in 1988. She is survived by her husband, Paul; two daughters, Sharon, at home, and Deborah, of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Jonathan, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Minnie Segal of Montreal, and two brothers, Bernard and Henry Segal, both of Montreal.

25-> BASEBALL; Mariners' Sale Remains in Cloud of Secrecy
The maneuvering surrounding the Seattle Mariners has become so confused that the chairman of baseball's ownership committee issued a statement yesterday saying he would hold a news conference after the committee's meeting, which he has moved to another site so it could remain secret. The ownership committee will meet today to act on a revised plan under which a Japanese group would buy 49 percent, or a minority share, of the Mariners instead of 60 percent as originally proposed. The meeting had been scheduled for Dallas, but when that information became known publicly, Fred Kuhlmann of the St. Louis Cardinals, the committee chairman, decided to change the site to St. Louis, though Kuhlmann would not confirm that the new site was St. Louis. Kuhlmann's secretary said he would not return a telephone call to discuss the meeting, but she said he had instructed her to say that a meeting would be held "later this week" and that after the meeting, "there will be a press conference." The statement did not say where the news conference would be held. The members of the committee have not indicated how they would vote on the matter. But Representative Norm Dicks of Washington has said that Commissioner Fay Vincent "very strongly supports the deal." Vincent himself has declined to say publicly where he stands on the matter. The issue of Japanese ownership of a major league club was raised earlier this year when the family that founded Nintendo, the world's biggest video game company, offered to supply 60 percent of the proposed $100 million that a Seattle group offered to buy the Mariners and keep them in the city. The owners initially opposed the Japanese involvement because they had a policy against foreign ownership. But they were immediately criticized for their stand, and people on both sides set about trying to forge a compromise that would make the Nintendo family more acceptable to the owners. Molloy Expects Approval Major league club owners are expected to approve today the nomination of Joseph Molloy as managing general partner of the Yankees. The approval is expected in a telephone conference call during the ownership committee's meeting in St. Louis. The committee, some of whose members have met with Molloy, will recommend his approval to the other owners, a committee member said. Although the owners have a policy requiring owners or managing partners to live in the area where the team is located, they have not made that a condition for Molloy's approval. Molloy, George Steinbrenner's son-in-law, lives in Tampa, Fla., and is expected to keep that as his permanent residence. Molloy will be the third managing partner the Yankees have had since Steinbrenner was ousted in August 1990, as part of his agreement with Commissioner Fay Vincent over his relationship with Howard Spira, a Bronx gambler. Robert Nederlander served as managing partner until the end of last year. Then the Yankees' partnership designated Daniel McCarthy, a Cleveland tax lawyer, to succeed Nederlander, but he failed to win Vincent's approval.

27-> Do We Spend or Save To Get Out of This?
To the Editor: "Layoffs Called No Big Threat to a Recovery" (front page, Feb. 9) suggests that the recession's real danger is not that 2.9 million jobs have been lost, causing enormous suffering in many parts of the country, but that the job losses are frightening working Americans. Economists you quote bemoan that Americans seem reluctant to emulate the Federal Government by reaching for their credit cards and going on a spending spree with money they do not have. This seems ironic in light of the same day's "Attention America! Snap Out of It!" (Business section), which quotes a consensus among economists that our "economic ills" can be cured if Americans save more and make long-term investments. So, if we try to consume our way out of the recession, will we make our economy sicker? JONATHAN LASH Director, Environmental Law Center Vermont Law School South Royalton, Vt., Feb. 10, 1992

28-> Head of Security in Sao Paulo Is Dismissed
The governor of Sao Paulo has dismissed the state's security director after accusations that police summarily executed prisoners during a prison riot on Friday. Gov. Luiz Antonio Fleury Jr. ousted Pedro Franco de Campos on Wednesday after pressure from human rights groups that accused the police of summarily killing more than 100 inmates in Carandiru Prison. Mr. Campos ordered more than 300 heavily armed troopers to raid a cell block after a fight broke out between rival gangs. Inmates and human rights advocates dispute the official figure of 111 inmates killed. One survivor, Milton Marques Viana, said 284 inmates were killed, based on the number of those missing. The prisoners were killed "through summary executions, indiscriminate shooting by riot troopers or by police dogs that ripped them apart," Mr. Viana said. "Before the shooting there were 2,069 of us in cell block No. 9. Today, the number is 1,785." Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, of the Center for the Study of Violence at the University of Sao Paulo, said at least 180 inmates were killed. Governor Fleury named Michel Temer, a state attorney general, to replace Mr. Campos and announced the establisment of a Prison Affairs Department to control the state's prisons. The prisons were formerly controlled by the police.

29-> PRO BASKETBALL; Northwest by North Jersey
It has been nearly three years since the Portland Trail Blazers traded Sam Bowie to the New Jersey Nets. But he hasn't forgotten. "I still haven't accepted the way my 'firing' was done or my 'replacement' was done," said Bowie, who was sent to the Nets along with a 12th round pick in the 1989 draft for Buck Williams. "I just wish I was notified by someone in the hierarchy to say, 'Sam, you've been appreciated or you haven't been appreciated. You're heading to Jersey.' I heard about it on the radio. Nobody contacted me and it's just bad business. You don't do people that way." Drazen Petrovic was also considered expendable in Portland, which selected him in the third round of the 1986 draft. But he expressed no bitterness about the deal that sent him to New Jersey in 1991. "I knew from the first time I played out there that Clyde Drexler was going to be in the starting lineup for another 10 years, so I needed to find another team where I can play more minutes," said Petrovic. "I knew the situation in New Jersey was right for me because Reggie Theus, he was 33 years old, and I knew that in the next two years I could take advantage of that." "I asked to be traded," said Petrovic, who was born in Sibenik, Croatia, and who bought out the final three years of his contract with Real Madrid in Spain for a reported $1.15 million to sign with Portland before the 1988-89 season. "I knew three days before that I was going to New Jersey and when we played our last game against Phoenix they told me after the game. So I was happy to get away from there and get some playing time." Petrovic averaged 12.6 points in 43 games for the Nets last season. And this season, with Theus, last season's leading scorer playing in Europe, Petrovic has become the team's top scorer with a 19.6 points per game average. Bowie is having his best season as a pro, averaging 16.6 points and 8.6 rebounds. Petrovic and Bowie will be seeing some of their old teammates when Portland comes to the Meadowlands Thursday night. But Bowie probably won't be seeing them on the floor of Byrne Arena. He pulled a hamstring in his right leg in the second quarter of Tuesday night's 109-95 victory over the Boston Celtics and is questionable for the Blazers game. "Oh yeah, I got a lot of friends watching me out West," said Bowie, who was a first-round draft choice of the Trail Blazers in 1984. He played there for four seasons and made the National Basketball Association's All-Rookie team. "I keep in direct communications with Clyde Drexler, Jerome Kersey and Terry Porter, so for me to say it's not an extra incentive. There is an extra incentive." Petrovic is going into Thursday's game with sort of confidence that is reflective of the Nets' successful run at the Meadowlands, where they have won 10 of their last 11 games. "Every game at home, even when Chicago was here, we never go in a game and say, 'Hey we're going to lose tonight,' " he said. "The best game we played on the West Coast was when we played against Portland," said Petrovic, recalling that disastrous five-game trip when the Nets lost to the Trail Blazers by 113-108 on Jan. 31. "We've got to become aggressive and play the same kind of basketball we played at that time." The Nets have to forget that Portland is the second best road team in the Western Conference, and third best in the league at 15-10. They are an impressive 17-4 against Eastern Conference teams and 9-1 against the Atlantic Division. Portland is also the best rebounding team in the N.B.A. and hasn't lost to the Nets since Dec. 7, 1985.

30-> Bush Officials to Give Census Tapes to Congress
Months of Government bickering over revised census information ended today when the Bush Administration agreed to give Congress half the numbers Democrats had demanded. The data, which the panel chairman has said would be made public, may provide ammunition to those who feel shortchanged by new voting districts or Government spending that are based on the 1990 census. The Commerce Department will give the House census subcommittee computer tapes with information on more than three million areas, many as small as a city block. The blocks will be chosen at random from the 6.9 million covered by the 1990 census. Compensating for Undercount The census adjustments were compiled by taking the original count, comparing it with the results of a later survey of 171,000 households and using statistical models to compensate for an estimated census undercount of 3 million to 5 million people. Many of the people overlooked by census takers were poor black and Hispanic residents of big cities. Besides the sample of block information, the Commerce Department agreed to give Congress adjusted information for all the states and for counties, cities, towns and other local jurisdictions with 1,000 or more people -- about half the localities in the United States. The department will use the original census count rather than the alternative numbers to decide whether to release data on a particular area. States use census numbers to adjust boundaries of election districts so each person elected to a legislative body represents about the same number of people. Also, some government aid money is distributed according to population. This year, census data influences about $116 billion in Federal spending. In July, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher decided against using the revised numbers, saying the accuracy of the estimates was suspect. The chairman of the House census subcommittee, Representative Tom Sawyer, Democrat of Ohio, asked Mr. Mosbacher to give all the adjusted information to Congress. When Mr. Mosbacher refused, saying the inaccuracy of the data could have a disruptive effect on redistricting efforts around the country, the subcommittee subpoenaed the tapes. The Secretary further angered House Democrats in December, when he refused an order to appear to explain why he would not yield the tapes. "With all due respect to the Secretary, he was just plain wrong in trying to withhold these numbers," Mr. Sawyer said in announcing the agreement. "His intransigence was unfortunate." The Commerce Department had no comment on the agreement. Mr. Sawyer has said that the subcommittee would let states and the public see the information and that the panel needed the tapes to help improve the way Americans would be counted in the 2000 census. Sawyer aides said they expected to get the tapes in late January and would turn the tapes over to a computing center, perhaps at a university, for processing.

31-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Clinton; Mission: Keeping Track Of Those Keeping Track
In the view of the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton, this deceptively placid riverside capital has reporters the way some dark kitchens have mice, and it has called on Betsey Wright to keep track of them. "This reporter said to me, 'It isn't possible to operate covertly in this state, is it?' " she said in an interview last week. "I said: 'That's the point. It's not possible. If you want a list of sightings of you in this state, I can give it to you.' " And not just one reporter: Ms. Wright claims to have "sightings" of 35 members of the national press who have come to Little Rock and the surrounding countryside this month, looking into Mr. Clinton's past and his performance as Governor of Arkansas. To varying degrees, she keeps abreast of which files they are rummaging through at the State Capitol, what sources they badger from their lairs at the Holiday Inn and the Excelsior, and which tongues they seek to loosen in the shadowy barroom of the Capital Hotel. In a campaign that is wrestling more with questions about its own integrity than with any opponent, Ms. Wright joined up three weeks ago to undertake an unusual and sensitive task: insuring that the Clinton candidacy is not mortally wounded by a visiting journalist. Damage Control? Since then, she has played cat-and-mouse with reporters and their sources, calling journalists to inform them that they have been spotted, offering the Clinton perspective, advising their sources on what to say and how to say it. Ms. Wright describes this as a standard damage control operation for a national campaign. But political opponents and some journalists believe that the Clinton operation has striven to establish itself as unusually organized, zealous and intimidating. The suggestion that this might somehow be untoward appalls Ms. Wright. "I don't believe this campaign is doing anything more than most campaigns," she said. "All campaigns have this kind of operation, and I have worked in many, many campaigns over the last 30 years." She admits going on the attack, with fax machine and telephone, against news accounts that she considers unfair to her candidate. But she says she has no knowledge of what some reporters and their sources describe as a series of efforts, seldom directly tied to the Clinton campaign, to discredit the Governor's critics or the authors of unfavorable news articles. Most political campaigns try to stay alert to the prospect of unfavorable news, but as far as is publicly known, no Presidential political staff has made it such a principal occupation to monitor and affect the investigations by journalists. Ms. Wright said the problem is with the national press, a swarm of big-city reporters who are surprised when their descent upon rural Arkansans causes a huge stir and when word quickly slips back to Clinton headquarters. "Is there any tracking of reporters going on? Nah. I don't have any radar. I don't have a machine in place," Ms. Wright said, maintaining that her "sightings" are based on an informal network of contacts. "The only way I ever know about reporters working on stories is when people call me." Long a Clinton Adviser The urgency with which the campaign views her task is reflected in her prominence. Betsey Wright was for nearly a dozen years one of Governor Clinton's most senior aides and political advisers, the overseer of his 1982 race to recapture the Arkansas statehouse, his longtime chief of staff, and head of the Arkansas Democratic Party from mid-1990 to last September. She abandoned a fellowship last month at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, where she led a seminar in high-technology politics, to return to Little Rock and address the campaign's press problems. Her return coincided with prominent quotations from her in The Los Angeles Times denying cocaine use by Mr. Clinton and in Vanity Fair saying he was "careless about appearances," but blameless, in his dealing with "groupie girls" who hung around during his political rise. The swath she has cleared on the campaign's organization chart is no less significant. In less than a month, Ms. Wright has assembled a full-time staff of eight, give or take a few, and filled an empty one-story office building behind the Clinton campaign headquarters with computers and televisions, a photocopying machine and stacks upon stacks upon stacks of Governor Clinton's personal files, his official records and copies of news articles about his political career. Ms. Wright has made no secret from the beginning of why she returned to Little Rock. "The picture being created nationally is that he is someone who is crazed and mixed up only with things that are linked with sex, drugs and money laundering," she said at a March 24 news conference. "And we all know that is not true. There is something that is basically wrong when the character portrayal of a man, regardless of his strengths and weaknesses, is so far afield from the truth." That something, she said then and repeated this week, appears to be a well-hidden opponent who is "orchestrating" negative reports about Mr. Clinton. She described that opponent as "somebody very brilliant," but said she did not know his or her identity or motives. "I don't think it's the press," she went on. "I think the press is being manipulated by it." Everybody Knows Everybody Far from killing or deterring efforts to follow up allegations against the Governor, Ms. Wright said, the Clinton campaign wants to provide the national press news organizations a context. That context is that Arkansas is a small state where everybody knows everybody; that relationships that would pose conflicts of interest in big cities or major states are simply unavoidable here; that most complaints of skulduggery in Governor Clinton's past have been examined by the Arkansas press, and found lacking. Perhaps the chief receipient of the campaign's attentions is The Los Angeles Times, which infuriated Clinton aides and helped provoke Ms. Wright's return by questioning the Governor's support for a bond issue that ultimately benefited a political associate under police scrutiny. Calling from campaign headquarters, Ms. Wright recently demanded that state police officials to break off an interview with a Los Angeles Times reporter and instead require that all questions be submitted in writing, according to William C. Rempel, one of the newspaper's reporters in Little Rock. Mr. Rempel said Ms. Wright later apologized for her order, which the police obeyed. "At other times she's called us and said, 'I've picked you up on my radar screen,' " he said. "It's in the context of offering to be of assistance, or asking a little more about what we need. But they know what we're doing." Mr. Rempel said he is neither alarmed nor deterred by the campaign's shadow. But some others have complained, sometimes angrily, about what they consider misleading or damaging information that has surfaced in Arkansas -- usually from outside campaign offices -- when a negative news account is pending or has been published. Roy Drew, a Little Rock investment adviser who has relentlessly criticized the Clinton Administration's financial dealings since the mid-1980's, contended in an interview last week that state officials circulated information last month about his 1983 censure for misconduct by a securities-trading organization, shortly before a critical article appeared in The Washington Times. "When I'm dealing with reporters, I know exactly how they're going to hit me," Mr. Drew said. "It's not just a system to deal with problems, it's a whole system to deal with people who want to speak up." In an interview, Bob Nash, head of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority that was criticized by Mr. Drew in The Washington Times account, called the newspaper's account "garbage" and refused to comment on Mr. Drew. Ms. Wright said she did not know whether any information about Mr. Drew or other critics of Governor Clinton had been circulated to the press by state officials or the campaign, but that "it hasn't come out of here." Similarly, a Hollywood producer who is close to Governor Clinton called Little Rock's major newspaper, The Democrat-Gazette, last week to complain that a profile of Hillary Clinton in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine had been rewritten to "get some dirt" on Mrs. Clinton after editors deemed it "too positive." The article quoted Mrs. Clinton as encouraging reporters to investigate rumors that President Bush had had an extramarital affair, a report that was widely circulated and denied in the mid-1980's. Vanity Fair denied the report to the Little Rock newspaper.

32-> Taking 'I Want My MTV' Seriously in Vineland
Just before Thanksgiving, Yolanda Gutierrez opened her cable television bill and learned that the cost of basic service would increase $2.50 a month beginning Jan. 1. Then she discovered that the cable company, Sammons Communications Inc., planned to drop her favorite channel, Music Television, from basic service and replace it with a pay-per-view rival, the Video Jukebox Network. Over the next six weeks, 32,000 of Ms. Gutierrez's neighbors and 77,000 of Sammons' customers in other areas of the country -- 40,000 in Bucks County, Pa.; 20,000 in Johnson City, Tenn., and 17,000 in Bristol, Tenn. -- received similar news. "I was shocked, and I felt insulted," Ms. Gutierrez recalled. Politicians and Rock Stars First she called officials of the cable company, who told her the decision was final. Then she called friends and started a campaign to force Sammons to reverse its decision. What began as local campaigns in four areas to restore MTV has escalated in the last three weeks into a fight involving Music Television, the Dallas-based cable company, thousands of its subscribers and politicians and rock stars. There have been previous confrontations over cable company decisions to drop Music Television. Most frequently, they have been prompted by parents worried about the content of the music videos their children view, and the clamor to reinstate the service has usually come from a youthful band of protesters chanting the slogan, "I want my MTV." But the current uproar is different. Not a Bunch of Teen-Agers The protesters -- who include the 57-year-old Mayor of Vineland, Harry Curley, and the 33-year-old Ms. Gutierrez, a third-grade teacher -- are generally older and more politically savvy. Instead of relying on chants and marches, they have organized drives to strip the offending cable company of its local franchises. "I think they thought they would get a bunch of teen-agers protesting," said 31-year-old Linda Bane of Morrisville, Pa., who was so angered when MTV was dropped in Morrisville and four other Bucks County towns that she organized Viewers Voice for MTV. Since Jan. 2, Mrs. Banes and her colleagues have collected more than 1,500 signatures on a petition urging subscribers to cancel all premium cable channels unless MTV is reinstated by Jan. 31. The disgruntled viewers have begun to lobby politicians, urging that Sammons's franchises, which are up for renewal, be canceled. "I think Sammons made an error in assuming we were simply going to sit back and take it," said Ms. Gutierrez, a heavy-metal fan who estimates that she watched as much as 30 hours of MTV weekly. "They forgot who's paying the bills." In Tennessee, Senator Albert Gore was drawn into the fray last week when he visited Johnson City to discuss pending legislation on cable industry regulation. Angry voters besieged him with complaints and calls for action against Sammons. The cable company said it had decided to drop MTV in the four towns after it polled local managers and conducted a survey among subscribers. "The local managers felt that they could remove MTV in their markets and it would not be sorely missed," said DeAnna Causey, a spokeswoman at the company's Dallas headquarters. Sammons replaced MTV with Video Jukebox Network, a 24-hour music-video channel on which subscribers dial a 900 number to make a selection at a cost of as much as $2.50. MTV was included in what subscribers paid for basic cable service. "Basically," Mrs. Bane said, "they replaced a Mercedes with a Yugo." Reaction 'Unbelievable' MTV weighed in for the protesters last week, sending one of its most popular video jockeys, (Downtown) Julie Brown, to Vineland for a rally that it said drew 500 people, and buying radio and television advertisements opposing the move that have run in this area and in East Tennessee and that feature Phil Collins, Paula Abdul, Rod Stewart and Billy Joel. "Consumer reaction has been unbelievable," said Carole Robinson, a spokeswoman for MTV. "We were flooded with thousands of calls in each market." Sammons has held fast to its decision, saying that an overwhelming majority of the 109,000 customers who lost MTV has not complained. Sammons, which says it is the 17th-largest cable company in the country, with 55 semiautonomous systems serving 920,000 subscribers in 19 states, "feels that it should be able to sell MTV on an a la carte basis," Ms. Causey said. "Subscribers should have the option to purchase MTV if they want it, or not purchase it if they are not interested." "We are actively involved in similar negotiations with other programmers, and our requests are consistent," Samsons said. MTV would not comment on its negotiations with Sammons. But the ability of cable operators to shift programs from the basic package to pay-per-view status has become a major issue in the industry. "No programming service will agree to that," said an executive with one service who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We make money on ads and by the number of eyeballs that are in front of the television." Ms. Causey said that because of public complaints, Sammons and other cable operators are seeking ways to hold down the cost of basic service, which for Ms. Gutierrez rose to $17.50 a month. Cable operators anticipate that costs will rise further as technological advances allow expanded channel capacities and more basic channels. "We are not fighting with our customers; we are fighting for our customers," Sammons said. But such entreaties have done little to appease MTV fans. "When I got involved in this, my primary reason was to keep my favorite show on the air," said Ms. Gutierrez, who has collected nearly 4,000 signatures on another petition to force Sammons to put reinstate MTV. "But this has gone far beyond MTV and Sammons. We don't want Sammons to go broke, but they are being bullies."

34-> Review/Pop; The Musical Horizons of Iris Williams
When the Welsh contralto Iris Williams made her New York cabaret debut last year in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, singing a program of Jerome Kern songs, her rich, foggy voice and refined elocution handsomely matched the pristine melodiousness of the Kern material. In her return engagement at the club, where she is appearing through March 21, Ms. Williams has expanded her musical horizons in a show that has separate sections devoted to Rodgers and Hart, the Gershwins, Harold Arlen, English pop composers and Edith Piaf songs. This time, although Ms. Williams's beautiful voice, with its deep, smoky timbre, buzzing vibrato and letter-perfect diction, gives the songs respectable formal readings, the rhythmic subtleties of the Gershwin and Arlen material elude her. And the tea-party politeness of her Piaf interpretations misses the passion that is essential to bring songs like "La Vie en Rose" and "Je ne Regrette Rien" to dramatic life. Last Thursday evening's show also had the aura of a classical song recital rather than an intimate cabaret performance, as Ms. Williams, accompanied by Art Weiss on piano and Steve LaSpina on acoustic bass, mechanically ran through a 22-song program. The singer was at her best in numbers like "My Heart Stood Still," in which melodic sweep matters more than rhythmic punctuation. But in songs like "Fascinating Rhythm" and "I've Got the World on a String," that demand a syncopated lilt, Ms. Williams and Mr. Weiss maintained a reserved formality that was underscored by his plodding tempos. The loveliness of Ms. Williams's voice was finally not enough in itself to prevent the evening from turning into a bland historical survey.

35-> BASEBALL; Mobbed in Milwaukee: Yount Gets No. 3,000
Engulfed by a sense of drama that exceeded his expectations and embraced by the frenzied affection of his fans, Robin Yount of the Milwaukee Brewers tonight became the 17th player in major league history to reach 3,000 hits. After failing to get the ball out of the infield in three frustrating times at bat, Yount hit a line-drive single off Cleveland pitcher Jose Mesa, over the head of second baseman Carlos Baerga and into right-center field, beginning a celebration that stopped the game for nine minutes in the seventh inning. Yount ended the night with one hit in five at-bats, ending a 5-4 loss to the Indians with a soft lineout to shortstop. But the defeat, which dropped the Brewers five and a half games behind first-place Toronto in the American League East, will be forgotten long before his moment. "I really, really wanted it to happen at home, here today," Yount said. "Maybe a little too much so. I got caught up in the whole ordeal the first three at-bats and got pretty disgusted with myself after the third one. "I said it was time to get in the ballgame and play baseball. I think that helped going to the plate." In the Company of Clemente Yount, who will turn 37 a week from today, became the third youngest, after Ty Cobb and former Brewer and Milwaukee Brave Hank Aaron, among the 17 players to reach 3,000 hits. The single, which tied Yount with Roberto Clemente in 16th place, made him the first to reach the milestone since Rod Carew in 1985 and the second since Carl Yastrzemski reached it 13 years ago this week. Yount's 3,000th hit places him alongside Willie Mays as the only players with that many hits plus career totals in excess of 200 home runs, 200 stolen bases and 100 triples. He has never been possessed by the numbers, leaving them for someone else to count and interpret. But the possibility for No. 3,000 created a near-capacity crowd of 47,589 -- a generation of fans to follow his career -- that continued to enter the parking lot even after the game began 32 minutes late. Dashing Through the Flashbulbs The scene that followed his hit, with teammates racing toward first base from the dugout and bullpen as flashbulbs sparkled throughout the stands, extended beyond any statistic. Yount was quickly surrounded by his teammates, slapping and grasping their hands after he was lifted on their shoulders. The rush to first base was led by Jim Gantner and Paul Molitor, who earlier this season combined with Yount to accumulate the most hits of any three teammates in the history of the game. Their combined total since 1978, when the three first played together, reached 6,340 hits tonight. "I just hit the bag and turned around and Gumby was there," Yount said of Gantner, "and Paul was right behind him. It's hard to describe something like that." Said Molitor: "I've never felt emotion like that. To see Robin respond, it was very unexpected. The tears were flowing. I was pretty numb going up there." Yount has often preferred to talk about his team more than himself, but the feeling at first base was something to enjoy. "You don't get feelings like that very often," he said. "It was something that I was going to let last as long as it could." He began this 19th season in Milwaukee needing 122 hits to reach 3,000. After hitting .276 at the All-Star Game break, Yount finished July with an average of .192 for the month. A 1-for-33 slump delayed his achievement. But Yount had at least one hit in 15 of the 18 games before tonight, a .379 average over that stretch, giving himself a chance to reach the milestone before the Brewers leave for a weeklong road trip that begins Friday night in Baltimore. Tempering the Emotions One night before, Yount had said that the added adrenalin produced by the emotional crowds was not a problem for a hitter. "Not if you can keep your concentration," Yount said. "The more excited, the more pumped up you get, that's what athletes are looking for. "Obviously, you've got to concentrate on what you're doing. If it affects that, it's too much. But if you can keep your mind on what you do, there can't be enough." Tonight the Brewer fans stood and cheered -- and his teammates in the first-base dugout stood up, too -- as Yount walked to home plate for the first time. But on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after five fouls, he grounded out weakly to first. He struck out in the third and again in the fourth. The second strikeout, after his line drive had missed the right-field foul pole by a few feet, led Yount to fling his bat in disgust. Yount was without a hit in seven plate appearances as he flung his bat, a fact that would be forgotten when his hit began a celebration at first base. Very soon, the $24 commemorative T-shirts were displayed at souvenir stands, and sleepy young children were riding down ramps on the shoulders of their parents. "It was just going to be another hit," Yount said when his work for the night was done. "Obviously, it turned out not to be just another hit."

36-> CHRONICLE
SALMAN RUSHDIE, the British author who has lived in hiding since 1989, said yesterday at the University of Colorado in Boulder that he intends to be increasingly visible, in the hopes that public pressure on the Iranian Government will lead it to lift the death threat under which he lives. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his assassination after Mr. Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses" was deemed to be blasphemous according to Islam. Referring to trips he made to Spain, Denmark and Norway in June, Mr. Rushdie said during an interview at the university that "the political climate in these countries on this issue improved 1,000 percent." "The political value of it is very great," he said, referring to his visits. "There is a slight increase in the risk, but that is something one has to live with." His public appearance this week is part of his third trip to this country in less than a year. Mr. Rushdie conducted a news conference and gave individual interviews at the university before speaking to 3,000 people at the start of a two-week-long literary symposium. "One thing that is clear to me now is, what is most dangerous is silence," he said, vowing to continue forays into public view to demonstrate that "terrorism by remote control" does not work. He said he believed the time was growing increasingly ripe for changes in the Iranian policy toward him: "They are facing food riots in the streets every week. The country is desperate for the reconstruction of its economy. It's anxious to play more of a geopolitical role. "The thing that is most in my favor is the fact that the country is such a wreck," he said. "Because currently it's so anxious to get massive agreements in trade and aid with the free world, there is leverage." The passage of time had put his plight in a logjam, he said "but when you move the right log, it moves very fast. We just have to make sure we find the right log."

39-> Bridge
Some 70 years ago a perky 12-year-old girl watched her uncle playing whist and announced that she could play better. She proved it, earned some pocket money and grew up to be one of the greatest female bridge-players of all time. She was Rixi Markus, who died on Saturday in London at the age of 81 after a remarkable 60-year career. She made her reputation as the youngest member of an Austrian squad that won three straight international women's team titles from 1935-37. The last of these was a world championship, the first of four. In 1938 she fled Austria by train as Hitler's forces entered the country, taking her 8-year-old daughter to London, which became her permanent home. She soon proved to the British bridge community that was analytically swift, combative and occasionally controversial: She was involved in two bridge-related libel cases, one as a defendant and one as a witness. In 1951 she began a memorable partnership with another Austrian refugee, Fritzi Gordon, who died in February. In a quarter of a century, playing for Britain in women's competition, they collected the World Olympiad Team title, two World Pairs titles and seven European Team titles. Mrs. Markus was the bridge columnist for The Guardian newspaper for 37 years and the author of nine books. She organized an annual match between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and was made an M.B.E. by Queen Elizabeth. On the diagramed deal, playing with Mrs. Gordon, she brought home a six-heart contract that might seem impossible. She ruffed the opening diamond lead in her hand and cashed two spade winners in the hope that the queen would fall. She then crossed to the club ace, discarded two spade losers on diamond winners and ruffed a diamond. She then cashed the club king, ruffed a club and ruffed the spade jack. The ending was: [ DIAGRAM ] When the club ten was led, West had to ruff and lead from the heart king to give South her slam.

40-> BUSH IN JAPAN: Bush's Painful Trip; Japanese Feel the Talks Will Not Help U.S. Economy or Rapport With Tokyo
As President Bush's grueling trade mission in Asia ended this morning on a note of confusion and discord, perhaps the reason was that without realizing it, the participants in Japan had given birth to the first summit meeting between rival superpowers in the post-cold-war era. All the old trappings of past confrontations between the Soviet Union and the United States were in Tokyo this week -- talks that churned past midnight, fact sheets, briefing sessions, dueling news conferences and a chorus of angry assertions and counterassertions of deception and bad faith. But instead of negotiating missile silos and warheads, the disagreements focused on auto parts procurement practices and standards for dashboard warning lights. "Arms-control negotiators always used to say that 'the devil is in the details,' " said a Japanese diplomat. "Now I know what they meant." Little Gain Expected There was no specter of nuclear war, of course. But negotiators seemed to realize that if the huge and growing trade deficit between Japan and the United States was not brought under control, it could drive Tokyo and Washington apart, hurt their economies and damage Mr. Bush's re-election prospects. It was too early to discern the American political effects of the Tokyo talks. But the widespread view in Japan was that the negotiators' efforts would not help the American economy or Mr. Bush's political fortunes, and indeed that they could lead to even deeper Japanese-American antagonism. Mr. Bush's hopes for a clear signal of greater Japanese purchases of American automobiles, auto parts and other products were shattered when an accord hammered out on such purchases was criticized by Japanese and American manufacturers as having little force or meaning. Japan, on the other hand, had hoped to transcend petty trade disputes and take note of Tokyo's leadership in aiding poor nations, refugees and the environment. But no new initiatives were announced in those areas, and trade issues were as prominent as ever and likely to become more bitter. Talk of Insults The negative tone of Japanese commentary on the whole United States approach was scathing. "Is there not a decent individual in the Bush Government who truly understands Japan?" a columnist, Takahiro Oda, said in the Asahi newspaper today, after listing what he said were insults to the Japanese leadership by the White House's hectoring demands for purchases of American products. As for insults, Americans too chafed today, when Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's pledge to work on trade issues came with a distinct edge to it. Mentioning AIDS, homelessness and declining education standards as the root of American trade problems, the Prime Minister said, "Since Americans themselves are aware of these problems, I am convinced they will overcome these problems because I believe that the United States is a great country." Error of Summitry The scene of Mr. Bush's illness and gallant recovery the next day muted the images of hostility, especially for Mr. Miyazwa, who held the stricken President's head, comforted Mrs. Bush and encouraged her to reassure a dinner banquet frozen in fear over the spectacle Wednesday night. Barbara Bush was such a hit with the Japanese audiences that her face was immediately spread all over the popular newspapers. The wives and widows of every recent Prime Minister were interviewed, commenting how admiring they were of her graceful and witty television performance. But in pushing Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa into the arcane matters of trade negotiations, Japan and the United States seemed to have committed a cardinal error of summitry, in that they raised the stakes and involved the principal leaders before the time was ripe for an agreement. "Japan and the United States should not have committed themselves to negotiating these topics until the talks have reached a more advanced stage," said Yukio Okamoto, a business consultant and former Japanese diplomat. "These are really complicated matters. What I fear now is a backlash." Japan's Criticism As his news conference, Mr. Bush seemed uncomfortable with the details of the automobile accord and turned aside all questions about it, asking that they be directed to other specialists. But he said he was convinced that the deals on automobiles would produce jobs for Americans. For Mr. Bush the whole trip in Asia started inauspiciously early last year, when it was first scheduled and canceled because of the Persian Gulf war. Then it was scheduled for November but canceled because of the President's need to attend to domestic politics. By the time he got to Japan, he added major new demands for the automobile industry, whose troubles are major issues in the Presidential campaign. But that set off unsparing criticism among the Japanese. Newspapers seem to delight in traditional metaphors, like calling Mr. Bush's party an ominous return of the "black ships" of Commodore Perry in the 19th century that forced Japan to open its borders to trade. Still others have noted that the anti-American mood in Japan extends to the latest Godzilla movie, in which the famous sea monster defends Japan against marauding foreigners who want the Japanese to adopt a foreign computer standard as a means of subjugation. Sympathy and Symbolism The mood reached a crescendo as Mr. Bush arrived but was suddenly dissipated by the sympathy that Japanese showed when the President collapsed at dinner on Wednesday night. But even there some commentators said that it was symbolic that Mr. Bush, like the United States, had run out of energy and needed help from Japan and Mr. Miyazawa. The summit meeting showed most of all that Japan might have taken a few steps to placate American demands, but Tokyo declined to see the problem as the United States did: a question of a "level playing field" in which outsiders could have more access. Instead of opening up its markets, Japan simply responded by pledging to purchase enough new imports to defuse anti-Japanese anger in Washington. Aside from revising some of its standardization and inspection procedures, Japan left the basic rules of free trade unchanged, particularly in the case of the auto accords. That was, in fact, a major step in carrying out what the United States has said it opposes: managed trade. All week, Mr. Miyazawa appealed to Japanese and to Japanese auto companies to make some sacrifice for the United States out of sympathy or compassion. At a news conference at the Shinto shrine of Ise, he tried to stir sympathy for the American condition but sounded, to some Americans, very patronizing. Tokyo's Coming of Age "We must appreciate how seriously layoffs are in America," he said. "Imagine a family where the mother has to tell her children, 'Dad no longer goes to work tomorrow.' Layoffs are the kind of thing which throws many families into despair. The President is coming to Japan against the background of such economic and social worries." What that reflected was itself a coming of age for Japan, in that the country was being asked to respond from a position of strength to help what the Prime Minister called "a friend in need." The main thing that Japan wanted out of this week's summit meeting was a new burst of credibility for the concept of "global partnership." But Japanese officials had to admit that there was not much new in the extensive statements about all the initiatives between Japan and the United States.

41-> PRO BASKETBALL; Forgettable, That's What the Knicks Were
On a night Pat Riley wanted to remember, the Knicks played a game he would love to forget. In their most pathetic offensive performance since the inception of the shot clock in 1954, the Knicks fell to the Los Angeles Lakers, 81-68, at the Forum. It was the lowest point total for New York in the 24-second clock era, one fewer than the 69 points it managed against the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 20, 1973. It was a nightmare for Riley, who made his first appearance at the Forum as the Knicks' coach. He coached the Lakers to four National Basketball Association championships during the 1980's, leaving the team after the 1989-90 season. "We just could not find any offense, that was very obvious," said Riley. "I'd been thinking about this game ever since the season started, and I'm glad that it's over. I knew it would be difficult to coach and probably more difficult on the players. "The Lakers played a great defensive game. We have not played that poorly in a long time." It was a total team collapse, as the Knicks at times looked like a high school team on offense, and an inept one at that. Perhaps they were nervous. Perhaps they wanted to win too badly for Riley. Perhaps they were distracted by the hoopla surrounding Riley's return. Perhaps they had so much fun in the California sun for two days, they forgot to prepare for the game. Whatever, the Knicks had to be embarrassed. The Lakers (30-25) snapped a seven-game losing streak, their longest since 1958. But the Lakers, aside from James Worthy, who scored 27 points, were not impressive either. For the Knicks (34-21) it was their second consecutive loss on a West Coast trip that continues Thursday in Sacramento against the Kings. Patrick Ewing had his worst game in a month, shooting 4 for 18 and finishing with 8 points. Ewing showed his frustration with 9 minutes 20 seconds remaining, when he was given a technical foul after screaming at Referee Kenny Mauer. At that point, Ewing had hit 2 of 13 shots and had scored only 4 points. But that confrontation seemed to inspire Ewing, if only briefly. He immediately made a steal, scored on a breakaway dunk, then scored again on a 15-foot jumper from the key. That brought the Knicks to within 66-55, with 8:20 to play. Then Gerald Wilkins scored on a driving slam dunk. But after Vlade Divac, who played for the first time in 45 games, made one of two free throws, Wilkins and Ewing missed jump shots. Worthy missed an open jumper, but Tony Smith got offensive rebound and scored on a follow-up, giving the Lakers a 69-57 lead with 5:20 to go. The Knicks never threatened again. 'Couldn't Hit Anything' "I couldn't hit anything," said Ewing. "It seemed no one else could either. At some point I figured we would break out of it, but we never did. I never remember anything like it." The day was emotional for Riley. In the morning, Magic Johnson stopped by the Knicks' practice to visit Riley, and the two men embraced. Johnson attended tonight's game to welcome back his former coach. Johnson has attended Lakers games regularly since he retired in November after testing positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but this was one game he particularly did not want to miss. At halftime, the Lakers' 1972 championship team, which Riley played on, was honored. Riley came back onto the court when the Knicks returned from the locker room to accept his plaque. The crowd stood and gave him a 30-second ovation, and Riley smiled and waved. Riley got an immediate crowd reaction when he walked on to the court before the game, about a minute before the player introductions. The crowd stood and applauded for the man who coached the Lakers to four N.B.A. championships in his nine-season tenure. Riley kept a stoic look on his face and sat down on the Knicks' bench until the game began. From that point on, the Knicks looked more nervous than Riley. New York had its lowest-scoring half of the season, and trailed at halftime, 43-34. The Knicks couldn't make open shots, they couldn't make layups, and the horrible shooting was a team effort. Consider these first half shooting statistics from the field: Ewing was 1 for 8, Xavier McDaniel was 3 for 10, John Starks was 1 for 4. As a team, the Knicks shot 17 for 48 -- 35.4 percent. To make matters worse, New York did not attempt a free throw. There was no need for Los Angeles to foul the Knicks. New York shot so poorly, the Lakers simply surrounded Ewing in the lane and let the Knicks shoot, and miss, from the perimeter. When the second half began, both teams had a lot at stake. The Knicks were trying to avoid their second consecutive loss, as well as the embarrassment of playing poorly on Riley's big night. And the Lakers were trying to avoid their eighth consecutive defeat. REBOUNDS The Lakers were the only team the Knicks had not played this season. The Lakers make their only visit to Madison Square Garden this season on March 10. WILT CHAMBERLAIN, who was in attendance tonight, left the Forum during the game and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for an evaluation, a nursing supervisor said. The reason for his hospitalization was not immediately known.

42-> Gilbert Chase, 85, Critic and Author Of Music Studies
Gilbert Chase, a musicologist, critic and the author of important studies of American and Spanish music, died on Saturday at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill. He was 85 years old and had lived in Chapel Hill since his retirement from teaching in 1979. He died of pneumonia, said his wife, Kathleen van Barentzen Chase. Mr. Chase was born in Havana, where his father was a naval officer, on Sept. 4, 1906. He studied music history at Columbia University and the University of North Carolina. In 1927 he moved to Paris, where he worked as a music critic for the European edition of The London Daily Mail and as a correspondent for Musical America and Music and Letters. During his years in Europe, he pursued an early interest in Spanish music, and on his return to the United States he wrote his first book, "The Music of Spain" (1941), still a central text on the subject. His studies of Spanish music led him to investigate Latin American music, and he published his "Bibliography of Latin American Folk Music" (1942) while working as the Latin American specialist in the music division of the Library of Congress. Mr. Chase served as a cultural attache in Lima, Peru (1950-53), Buenos Aires (1953-55) and Brussels (1960-63). Books and Reviews In 1955, he published his most frequently cited work, "America's Music From the Pilgrims to the Present." The work was the first to treat the music of Charles Ives and Carl Ruggles as important additions to the 20th-century repertory, and the first to deal with American popular and art music as being equally significant. His other books include "Music in Radio Broadcasting" (1946) and "The Composer Speaks: A Historical Anthology 1770-1965" (1967). He also contributed book reviews and reports on Latin-American music to The New York Times from the late 1930's to the mid-1950's. He was the director of the Tulane School of Music in New Orleans from 1955 to 1960. He was also a professor of music at the University of Oklahoma, in Norman, where he founded the Inter-American Institute for Musical Research, and a visiting professor at the University of Texas, in Austin. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons: Paul, of San Raphael, Calif.; Peter, of Columbia, S.C., and John, of Chapel Hill.

47-> For Children
New Jersey Children's Museum 599 Industrial Avenue Paramus, N.J. (201) 262-5151 Recommended ages: 1 to 8 The New Jersey Children's Museum is a former warehouse, but children don't care: there they encounter a real fire engine and they may put on red boots, red raincoats, plastic firefighters' hats and climb aboard and ring the truck's bell. There is also a real Hughes helicopter, where they may sit in the cockpit and pull levers. The 15,000-square-foot museum, which opened in March, is partitioned into 30 thematic rooms. It can take up to two hours to walk through the entire museum, but many children want to remain in a single area they like a lot. And there is a lot -- perhaps too much -- to choose from. Some exhibits seem hastily pulled together, with perfunctory decorations that fail to create an encompassing sense of fantasy. But the museum keeps striving. Its themes include a building room with a real excavator, Legos and a sandbox; a train room with a train set (although the locomotive pulls only a caboose, as one 4-year-old pointed out); a mechanical room with a motorcycle ride, a repair shop with toy tools and a large toy car; an art room with three computers programmed with Kid Pix software; a doctor's office with an examining table and stethoscopes (the museum's owners, Anne and Elliott Sumers, are physicians), and a music room with Casio keyboards. What is attractive about the museum is the variety, the real objects and the emphasis on interaction and, ultimately, play. At the pizzeria, one child put on an apron, banged on a real cash register and offered his mother a slice of plastic pizza. Then he asked her to pay for it. The museum is open daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; it fills to capacity on rainy days, so call ahead. Strollers and food are not allowed. Admission is $6 on weekdays; $7 on weekends. Free for children younger than 1. Native American Crafts Demonstrations National Museum of the American Indian 3753 Broadway (at 155th Street) Washington Heights (212) 283-2420 Recommended ages: 4 and up Through Nov. 13 Ina McNeil, a Hunkpapa-Lakota Sioux artist and a descendant of Chief Sitting Bull, makes traditional Lakota dolls, using a method learned from her grandmother. She demonstrates the intricacies of her work to children while explaining how she uses materials like porcupine quills, beads, home-tanned buckskin and, occasionally, human hair. She also discusses beading and the symbols on a homemade quilt hanging behind her along with other facets of her culture. Ms. McNeil is to be at the museum from 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. today; 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. tomorrow, and 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. on Oct. 20 to 23, Nov. 10, Nov. 12 and Nov. 13.

48-> COMPANY NEWS; No Gaps or Static From These Cordless Phones
For people who find cordless telephones appealing in theory but appalling in practice, new models being shown here at the Consumer Electronics Show, the industry's mammoth semiannual trade show, offer hope. A new generation of cordless telephones has extended ranges of up to half a mile, not only beyond most consumers' backyards, but beyond those of their neighbors down the block. Users now are often frustrated when the signal dies out in the bathroom or the bedroom. The new phones use a higher-frequency radio signal, and one model on display here represents one of the first wide applications of digital technology to consumer telecommunications, replacing the analog signals now used. The new phones would eliminate static, provide wider coverage without blank spots, and provide digital passwords and scrambling for tough-to-crack security. No Security In contrast, today's phones lack security, because they can interfere with or occupy the same radio frequency as a neighbor's cordless phone, a baby monitor or even a garage-door opener, and can be subject to eavesdropping with easily available radio equipment, like scanners. Cordless phones are basically radios, connected to a transmitter in the base, that plug into conventional telephone outlets. They have been growing in popularity for the last decade because callers no longer have to be tethered to a wall. Often selling for less than $100, the phones are a tenth the cost of cellular phones, but do not offer the mobility of cellular systems, which can be carried in a car, briefcase, or even a shirt pocket. In 1989, the Federal Communications Commission freed the 900-megahertz part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which allows signals from the base transmitters in cordless phones to travel a far greater distance than the maximum 1,000 feet for today's cordless telephones, which operate at 46 to 49 megahertz. The 900-megahertz cordless phones would provide complete coverage for a typical two-story suburban house, between two floors in an office building, and in most restaurants. They should operate up to 3,000 feet or more in a virtually open field, without interference from metal building braces or fluorescent lights. Three manufacturers are producing 900-megahertz phones for sale this summer -- the Panasonic Company, with a $500 analog unit; Code-a-Phone, which has a $400 analog unit, and a small company called Vtech Communications Inc. in Beaverton, Ore., which has a $300 digital cordless phone that it will begin shipping this month. Security Codes In Vtech's completely digital phone, the Tropez 900DX, the security of the telephone signal is made possible by scrambling the digital code. The phone selects one of more than 65,000 possible digital security codes each time the handset is placed in the radio transmitter base. The phone also automatically selects one of 20 frequencies for the best transmission. Present analog phones select among 10 such channels, but the user must do so manually. Steve Johnson, the president of Vtech, a unit of the Hong Kong-based Video Technology, said the company also planned to sell two other models in June with the 900DX. A $349 model will incorporate two phone lines, as well as a caller-identification screen that identifies the number of the incoming call -- provided the local telephone company provides the service. A $399 unit would incorporate a digital answering machine.

49-> CHRONICLE
VICTOR BORGE has offered to match the reward for information about the theft this week of manuscripts by Hans Christian Andersen from the Andersen Museum in Odense, Denmark. The museum is offering $8,500 for information about the stolen papers that include the manuscripts for "The Little Mermaid" and "The Emperor's New Clothes." The burglary was discovered Wednesday, the police in Odense have said. The burglars drilled holes into a wooden door and removed a panel, circumventing the museum's alarm system. The museum estimated the manuscripts' worth at about $700,000. "Hans Christian Andersen is part of every Dane," said Mr. Borge, who was born in Copenhagen, "and for those who live far away from their native country, the memories become even more precious." Mr. Borge was speaking yesterday from Indianapolis, where he was on a concert tour. "We hope that this might produce some witnesses, and I thought that if a reward is what is necessary, then a double portion would be twice as necessary," he said. "Every time I go to Odense I visit that museum." This is not Mr. Borge's first effort on behalf of Hans Christian Andersen. More than 36 years ago, he was asked to raise money to complete the statue of the writer that has stood in Central Park, near Fifth Avenue and 72d Street, since 1956. Instead, he donated $14,000, or half the amount needed, himself.

50-> Schnittke's Opera In World Premiere
What may have been the most important event in Russian operatic history since the first staged performance of Prokofiev's "Story of a Real Man" in Moscow in 1960 took place Monday night. In Amsterdam. The occasion was the world premiere of "Life With an Idiot," the first opera by Alfred Schnittke, who now lives in Hamburg, Germany, but who counts as Russia's most respected, best-known living composer. The performance at the Netherlands Music Theater of this surrealist, often grotesque and sexually explicit score took place in the presence of Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus and was greeted with a fervent standing ovation. Narrated by a character known simply as "I," the libretto tells of a man guilty of some unidentified crime who is ordered by the party to bring an idiot into his home as punishment. But his idiot, Vova, soon starts disrupting his happy home. Eventually Vova seduces I's wife and then I himself. Vova kills the wife, and I winds up in the asylum, an idiot himself. The three Americans who took the principal roles -- the baritone Dale Duesing as I, the soprano Teresa Ringholz as My Wife and the tenor Howard Haskin as Vova, the Idiot -- won cheers, Mr. Duesing especially. But the greatest applause was for Mstislav Rostropovich, who conducted, and for Mr. Schnittke. The sight of Mr. Rostropovich, who is the most fervent hugger and kisser since Leonard Bernstein, tugging the shy and back-pedaling Mr. Schnittke into the limelight created one of the sweeter curtain calls in recent operatic annals. It was not Mr. Schnittke and Mr. Rostropovich alone who made this such a significant occasion. The librettist was Viktor Yerofeyev, who based his work on his short story of the same name; Mr. Yerofeyev, who lives in Moscow, has had his first novel, "Russian Beauty," published in 25 countries. The stage director was the 82-year-old Boris Pokrovsky, who has been associated with the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow since 1943 and was its chief stage director for 26 of those years. The decor was by Ilya Kabakov, a well-known avant-garde Russian artist. All these talents came together because Pierre Audi, the innovative artistic director of the Netherlands Opera, "pounced" on the chance to commission the opera when he heard from the composer that he felt inspired by Mr. Yerofeyev's story. Mr. Audi then brought Mr. Rostropovich on board and acceded to his wishes for the rest of the team. Mr. Rostropovich said he had been trying to collaborate with Mr. Pokrovsky for 18 years. The premiere took place in Amsterdam, where it will play through April 30, for another reason as well. Russia long shunned Mr. Schnittke's musical progressiveness and now, when it might wish to honor him, cannot afford to do so. There is even some thought, however, that Mr. Yerofeyev's scabrous tale and Mr. Schnittke's biting musical satire might still be too much for Russian conservatism. "I think this opera would shock people in Russia," Mr. Yerofeyev said at the post-premiere reception. "When I wanted to do it at the Bolshoi, they told me they were too bolshoi for it." In Russian, bolshoi means big or grand. Mr. Yerofeyev has translated his story ingeniously to the stage, but the very act of expanding a highly literary tale into the broad gestures of opera has underscored the allegorical implications. The libretto does contain key phrases like I's desire for "a blessed, holy-fool-type abnormality, national in form and content." At the end -- this is the last line of the story -- he talks of "the swan song of my revolution." Mr. Schnittke, for his part, satirizes everything in sight, including the "Internationale" in a version so dissonant that Mr. Rostropovich said it "smelled like Roquefort." Soviet-style red is the dominant color of the production, the program book and the poster. Vova is even made up to look like Lenin. Such hints point the viewer toward an interpretation of the opera as a critique of Communism, the ordinary Russian seduced and destroyed by mindless, systematic monomania. Marcel Proust wanders helplessly through the piece, and Mr. Yerofeyev said "he represents culture in this century, but Vova is stronger." The Dutch press has labeled the opera "a requiem for the Soviet Union." In an interview, Mr. Rostropovich conceded with a wink that "of course" Vova was meant to look like Lenin, adding that "I always see the history of my country in this opera." But all the participants also wished the opera to be perceived in more universal terms than mere political satire. "Vova is also Hitler or Saddam Hussein," Mr. Rostropovich argued. "Any dictator with an idee fixe." Mordant skepticism has long been a part of Mr. Schnittke's musical personality, and such tendencies dominate this opera. The often dissonant music ranges from the eerily atmospheric, to raucous ensembles, to singers and choral ensembles and instrumentalists spread about the theater, to a tango with Mr. Rostropovich at the piano, to a short but moving cello solo for the conductor, who also happens to be the world's best-known cellist. The Role of Humor Mr. Rostropovich and Mr. Audi even suggested that there was something inherently Russian in finding serious art funny -- such as the eerie a trio that ends the opera, the Wife singing addled bird song, Vova howling "Ech" (the only word he ever sings) and I meandering on, as mad as Tom Rakewell at the end of Stravinsky's "Rake's Progress." Mr. Rostropovich said that while that passage moved him to tears, Mr. Schnittke found it hilarious. Mr. Schnittke, however, insisted that his music encompassed serious, unambiguously emotional sentiments, too. An admiring Russian composer in a recent BBC documentary film said that what made any Schnittke premiere exciting was that one never knew what kind of music one might hear. Although his "poly stylistic" approach constantly threatens to lose focus, Mr. Rostropovich insisted that the composer had "so strong a personality" that coherence was maintained. Although Mr. Schnittke has had two physically debilitating strokes, one four years ago and one last June, his mind is sharp and he is pressing forward with two new operatic projects. Both are for the West, one on the Faust theme for Frankfurt and another on the life of the Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo for Vienna. Neither, he said, would tap his skeptical vein in any way. All this work, he added contentedly, will be composed in Hamburg, not Moscow. He was surrounded by Russian well-wishers at the premiere, but he has no intention of returning to Russia any time soon. Born in 1934 to a father born in Germany and a German-Jewish mother, he said that "I have long suffered in Russia because I have not one drop of Russian blood." Mr. Rostropovich suggested that Mr. Schnittke's case was "like a dog: if you always beat a dog, he is not coming back to the place where he was beaten. In Moscow all of Schnittke's life, they beat him."

51-> HOCKEY; Rangers Can't Miss With Open-Net Truths
It has been only five month since I wept with Adam Graves in the hellish bowels of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, cringing as the crowd chanted, "1940, 1940." The Penguins dumped the Rangers out of the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs and Adam choked out, "We'll talk more later, O.K.?" I patted his shoulder and said: "Next season. Take care of yourself." And now it's next season. I'm not sure I'm ready to talk to him yet. I have tried to avoid thinking about the Rangers for 21 weeks now, stuffing my Blueshirt Bulletins under pre-Tina New Yorkers and N.F.L. crunch-porn videos. For 149 days I have tried to divert myself by reading all stories comparing Fay Vincent favorably to Thomas a Becket, and Ray Handley unfavorably to Captain Queeg. But last season's passion bubbles up like bad ice. Tonight, 3,576 hours since the ending, the Rangers begin in Landover, Md., against the Washington Capitals, and I am not afraid, for this season they will sip from the Cup and these are the reasons why: 1. ROGER AND MESS By giving Roger Neilson a new multiyear contract, the Rangers have brought creative tension to Madison Square Garden. A cerebral coach who likes to shuffle players like cards and a passionate old superstar who wants to skate with the same bodyguards every game will have to find a way to win together. The players look to Mark Messier ("A guy who had been to the mountain," exulted John Vanbiesbrouck last season, "who'd done what we wanted to do, win. We could ask him the one question we were dying to have answered. What is the sacrifice? What do we have to do to get where you have been?"). But they also know that if Neilson has management's confidence and ear, Coach ranks higher than Captain. Besides, Mess never answered the question. He had been bought for only one purpose -- to get himself a fifth championship ring. Meanwhile, the low-key Neilson looks better in New York's skipper class among the likes of Jeff, Buck, Bruce, Ray and those competition dressers, Chuck and Pat. 2. THE RUSSIANS ARE HERE As I pontificated last season, "Ice hockey will offer final closure to the conflict with the Evil Empire because it will be about white Americans and Russians." Khrushchev was widely mis-understood when he said, "We are going to bury you." He was talking about right-wing scoring. And now we have Aleksei Kovalev, a 19-year-old earning $500,000 for his rookie season. He will skate with Sergei Nemchinov. Prepping in Binghamton will be Sergei Zubov. The new rules are made for the Russians' buttery game. Because they are cuter than Canadians, optional helmets will make them rock stars. Starting high-sticking at the waist will also help. However, the continued practice of hooking opponents in dark and scary places -- skill in which is a graduation requirement in Canadian junior hockey -- will maintain a certain balance of power. 3. LUCKILY, WE LOST LINDROS Although I missed the nuance at the time, Neil Smith tipped me off last season when he said, "There's no such thing in hockey as one player so dominant he's worth all the problems he might bring." Problems? Here is a 19-year-old who has already written an autobiography, "Fire on Ice" (HarperCollins, 1991), in which he wrote: "My mom's very outspoken while my dad thinks a lot." Mom Bonnie is considered the whip-hand behind Eric's dissing of French Canada, and Dad Carl is an accountant who manages him. Can you imagine them up against Messier's family, who handles him, much less the Mess having to actually skate with that big kid or, worse, give up ice time to him? Of course, we didn't want him. Brilliantly, Smith destroyed Philadelphia for years to come. 4. MARIO'S MILLIONS When Lemieux signed that seven-year, $42 million contract with the Penguins this week, poor Adam Graves was finally freed of the last shred of guilt for slashing the superstar and breaking his hand in the playoffs. Graves still feels shame for not hurting Jaromir Jagr, too. The incident had a profound effect on Ranger supporters. At the time, Godie, of the Connecticut hockey fans Jane and Godie, said: "That's hockey. It's old style, and I'm not condoning it, but it is The Game . . . Half-hook, half-slash, not exactly the Crime of the Century as some of your colleagues are suggesting." "Graves is bad," screamed Jane. "He's a young loose cannon who loves to be the star. He's used the attention he's gotten as Messier's protector as a license to slash. He feeds off all the anger in the crowd. He's scary to me. Godie's always talking about the grace and beauty of hockey, but all I see is the Power 90's, hit hard, grab what you want." But all wounds have healed. This week, along with Mario, Jane and Godie also signed a contract. They got married on Sunday. 5. A HOCKEY TRUISM The 53d time is the charm.

52-> BASEBALL; Hayes's Homer Lifts Yankees in 9th
George Steinbrenner would have liked this game. Not all of it; just the ending. Perhaps the only thing the once and future managing general partner of the Yankees would have enjoyed was this: a two-out, bases-empty home run by Charlie Hayes in the ninth inning that beat the Seattle Mariners, 8-7, tonight at the Kingdome. Hayes's shot, off Dennis Powell, came on a 1-and-1 pitch and landed halfway up the bleachers in left field. Hayes even stood at the plate to admire it. The Yankees, who had 15 hits, had their troubles beating the Mariners for the second time in two games. They couldn't hold a three-run lead in the third inning, and they failed to cling to a one-run advantage in the sixth when Pat Kelly's two-run double put them in front, 7-6. But after Hayes's homer, Steve Farr pitched a scoreless ninth to gain his first victory of the season. It gave the Yankees five victories in six games and left the Mariners with their seventh consecutive defeat and 24th in 32 games. Chaotic From the Start The night never had an orderly look to it. The Yankees scored runs in each of the first three innings, but the Mariners came back with three in the third off Curt Young to tie it. Seattle then added two more in the fourth, chased Young and seemed in control, 5-3. But the tide soon turned again. In the sixth, the Yanks got a run-scoring double from Matt Nokes and a two-run double from Pat Kelly, both off reliever Rich DeLucia, to jump back in front, 7-6. They couldn't get more in the inning, though. DeLucia intentionally walked Dion James, then got Randy Velarde to bounce into a double play. With Kelly at third, DeLucia intentionally walked Don Mattingly and pitched around Mel Hall, walking him to load the bases. Roberto Kelly then fouled out. James Spells Tartabull In the first, the Yankees scored after James, batting leadoff and playing in right to give Danny Tartabull a rest, reached base on an error by first baseman Lance Parrish. He took third on Velarde's double and scored on a one-out sacrifice fly by Hall, although Velarde was thrown out trying to tag up and take third. One inning later, Roberto Kelly opened with a single before designated hitter Kevin Maas lined a double into the right-field corner. Clete Boyer, the Yankee third-base coach, attempted to hold Kelly at third, but when the throw from Seattle's Jay Buhner sailed off line, Kelly sprinted home, making it 2-0. The Yankees got another run in the third, starting with a two-out walk to Velarde by Mariner starter Brian Fisher. Mattingly's single sent Velarde to second, and Hall's single brought him home. Mattingly, though, was thrown out trying to score from third on a wild pitch with Roberto Kelly at the plate. But all at once, the Mariners erased the deficit. They sent nine men to the plate in the third, took advantage of Yankee errors by Hayes at third and Hall in left, and got a two-run double from Kevin Mitchell and a run-scoring single from Buhner. They gave themselves a two-run cushion in the fourth after Young, coming off a superb performance last Sunday against the California Angels, gave up a double to Henry Cotto and a walk to Edgar Martinez. After a double steal, Ken Griffey Jr. lined a single to left, bringing in both runners. Young was replaced by Tim Burke, who avoided further trouble -- for the moment, at least. INSIDE PITCH The Yankees, who remain in hot pursuit of a starting pitcher, are still talking with the California Angels. General Manager GENE MICHAEL said on Friday that his Angel counterpart, WHITEY HERZOG, intended to visit the Yankees' top affiliate at Columbus soon to look at players. He also said that Herzog had mentioned the name of one Angels pitcher, possibly JIM ABBOTT, who is seeking a long-term contract. The other two left-hander possibilities, MARK LANGSTON and CHUCK FINLEY, have no-trade clauses in their contracts and would probably reject the Yankees. Michael would not discuss what pitcher he might have an interest in, although he did say about the Angels' interests: "I have an idea what it would take. I know they have an interest in young players." . . . The Yankees' Columbus, Ohio, farm team set a club scoring record Friday night, beating Tidewater, 21-5. DAVE SILVESTRI hit a grand slam homer in an eight-run sixth.

54-> Editors' Note
An article on Tuesday about Germany's new assertiveness in its policy toward Croatia placed great stress on an assertion by an unidentified State Department official that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had used the German word "Sieg," instead of "Erfolg," to mean "success." As the article explained, the word "Sieg" has come to be associated with declarations of the Nazi Government. Contrary to that report, Chancellor Kohl actually used the word "Erfolg" and not "Sieg." The Times should have checked the original text of Mr. Kohl's remarks, and not relied on a secondhand account of them.

56-> More Access to Waterfront Is Urged in Messinger Plan
Saying that the city's current period of financial hardship is a good time for long-term planning, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan has proposed to open much more of the borough's 32 miles of waterfront to the public and to take the first steps toward a continuous esplanade around the island. Ms. Messinger's plan, contained in a 96-page report released last week, is the first to bring together dozens of other studies and to seek to guide development on the entire waterfront well into the next century. The proposals range from moving fences and putting up extra signs to building multimillion-dollar parks. "This is precisely the right moment for visionary planning," Ms. Messinger said after releasing the report on Wednesday. "The hiatus in real-estate development produced by the recession also has a silver lining -- with the acrimonious battles over private waterfront development temporarily moot, we can seize the opportunity to plan the waterfront's future for the public good." In the vast majority of neighborhoods, the report advocates opening the shoreline to the public and discourages residential or commercial development that would make the waterfront private. It does support mixed-income housing in the large development being planned for the 57-acre Penn Yards tract on the Hudson River between 59th and 72d Streets. Fences, Signs and Waterfront "Part of the tone of this whole report is what can be done tomorrow?" Ms. Messinger said. "As we looked at it we discovered much of this mileage was city-owned and with relatively small-scale changes we could have greater access." For instance, the report suggests that the United Nations School at East 24th Street should be asked to provide access to the East River and that signs should be posted to tell pedestrians how to thread their way through the Waterside Plaza houses, at East 25th Street, to a public esplanade that few know about. The report also includes an ambitious proposal for a park along the Harlem River from the Triborough Bridge to 145th street, land that is zoned for a park but has become a wasteland of garbage and derelict cars. The initial phase of the construction would cost $2.7 million, and Ms. Messinger said she would support using capital funds under her control to help finance it. The report suggests that where possible the city should terminate leases with parking lots along the waterfront, move its own tow pounds and other operations elsewhere and eliminate the two prison barges currently moored on the shoreline. It says the city should renegotiate or terminate leases with businesses that restrict public access to the water. West Side Highway, Plus Park Here are the report's recommendations for some controversial areas: *Stuyvesant Cove from East 16th Street to 24th Street. The report recommends terminating the developer for the Riverwalk development, which was to be built largely on platforms on top of pilings. That plan was dropped in 1990 because of environmental problems, but the developer, Related Housing Inc., continues to hold rights to the site. Instead, Ms. Messinger would like to see a waterfront park with no businesses other than concession stands. *West Side waterfront from Battery Park City to West 59th Street. Ms. Messinger urges pushing ahead with the recommendations of the West Side Waterfront Panel, which issued a report in late 1990. The plan would construct an esplanade, remove barriers like parking lots and tow pounds and allow new development only on the east side of a reconstructed West Side highway. *The Penn Yards. The report supports the main thrust of a plan offered by the developer Donald J. Trump and a consortium of civic groups known as the Riverside South Planning Corporation after Mr. Trump's idea for a large-scale development, Trump City, collapsed last year.

57-> GARDENING; Perils and Triumphs of the Rare-and-Exotic-Plant Collector
SOME things never change. For bring'em-back-alive plant hunters like Paul W. Meyer, there is still danger and exhilaration in scaling mountains and trekking forests. His quest? Splendid new species for gardeners back home. Never mind that a four-wheel drive has replaced the donkey or yak as preferred transportation. Or that the once-cheap labor is now a major expense. Modern plant hunters continue a tradition that some believe started with the pharaohs' search for fruiting plants. Finding prize exotics was also a lucrative pursuit among Renaissance merchants and a fashionable diversion among Victorians. Sleeping on floors and cheerfully swallowing such delicacies as silkworm pupae fried in soy sauce is still part of the job, Mr. Meyer said. On his earliest foray -- a 1979 trip to South Korea -- he was a staff horticulturalist for the Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. There, he netted 200 collections of seeds from rare plants. Mr. Meyer, now director of the Morris Arboretum, strolls its grounds appraising reminders of those early trips, like the now 10-foot-tall Korean Mountain Ash (Sorbus alnifolia) and 15-foot-tall Japanese alder tree (Almus japonica), both rarely seen in the United States. "Our goal is not simply to add rare or unusual species to the Morris collection," Mr. Meyer said. "The plants we look for must further one of several objectives that ultimately benefit home gardeners." These objectives include species tolerant of salt spray or flooding, species that expand the gene pool for outstanding traits like variegated leaves or resistance to insects and disease, and species that withstand conditions like the compacted soil that suffocates cities' tree roots -- Mr. Meyer's particular interest. And so the Korean Mountain Ash collected from a site near the Sea of Japan has proven tolerant of the ice-melting salts that kill roadside trees, while the Japanese alder, a flood-plain species whose roots have nodules that add to the soil, appears unaffected by impoverished city earth that is lacking in oxygen. Effective plant collectors are "need driven," said Barry R. Yinger, who has logged more than 20 plant expeditions since 1976, most to Japan. "We go to areas where we expect to find plants with traits that fill our needs," said Mr. Yinger, who is head of horticulture for the Somerset County Park Commission in Far Hills, N.J. One of his own "need driven" excursions took him to a frosty Korean locale where he had heard there were camellias capable of surviving exceptional cold, and to a remote spot where day lilies reputedly bore 50 to 70 flowers a stem -- "the highest I'd ever heard of," he said. Both species were located. Seeds were collected. And both are now being propagated for sale to home gardeners. "I admit I do jump up and down a bit when I discover something special," Mr. Yinger said, "like the time in a Japanese woodland when I literally stumbled over something incredible." It was a white flowering Japanese hydrangea vine (Schizophragma hydrangeoides Moonlight) whose silver leaves have dark green veins. It is not yet well known, but it's a plant that he predicted would one day be among the most popular of climbers. "Such finds make the heart beat faster and the blood pressure rise," he said, "but I also try not to get overly excited. Sometimes the plants you think are unique turn out not to be. Then you must face the fact they're not such a big deal." Only in the last four centuries have records documented these "human-assisted movements of plants around the globe," said Dr. Stephen A. Spongberg, author of "A Reunion of Trees" (Harvard University Press, 1990, $35), said. Dr. Spongberg's own first hunt took him to Japan and Korea, in 1977. While the hunter's goal -- better garden plants -- remains the same, Dr. Spongberg said, few modern explorers go forth the way Ernest Henry Wilson did at the turn of this century. Chinese Wilson, as he was called, introduced more than 1,000 new garden species in 11 years; he was first sponsored by a single nursery (Veitch & Sons in England), then by a single institution (the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University). "But now," said Dr. Spongberg, "costs are such that it takes several subscribers -- institutions and/or individuals -- to sponsor a trip." Depending on the country to be explored and the trip's duration, an expedition can cost upward of $5,000 for an individual and $30,000 for a team. In addition to the Morris and Arnold arboretums, recent expedition sponsors include the United States National Arboretum in Washington, the Holden Arboretum in Mentor, Ohio, Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Hometown support notwithstanding, once alone in the forest or plains, modern plant hunters continue to face perils that are not so different from the avalanche that crippled Mr. Wilson. The warlords are gone, said Lawrence Lee, curator of the Asian Collection at the United States National Arboretum, but "there are always dangers, like poisonous snakes, some wild animals and a lot of pretty bad roads." He added: "Also, if you slip when climbing a mountain, you still fall several thousand feet. "I've been warned not to 'hike and look' at the same time." His two expeditions in the last four years have been to China, where 20th-century political unrest might be considered as hazardous as marauding 19th-century bandits. "Our goal is to have many people benefit from one collecting trip," Mr. Lee said, "and that includes the scientists and botanical gardens within the host country." The result is the organization founded last year, the North America China Plant Exploration Consortium, which welcomes any institution interested in introducing and evaluating Chinese plants. One of Mr. Lee's plant-hunting discoveries was a Magnolia cylinderica, whose large white tulip-shaped blooms develop into cylindrical upright seed pods. But since this plant rarely produces seeds in the wild, he returned with young twigs, or scion wood. These have already been grafted onto root stock here. "It's not like the old days, when plant explorers went out and stripped the countryside," Mr. Lee said. "We never dig plants from the wild. And we're careful not to remove so many seeds that the wild plants will be endangered. "So many of our cherished garden species are from China," he added, . ""like hostas and hydrangeas. I also found it fascinating to be plant-hunting not so far away from the 500-year-old village where my grandfather was born." NURSERIES FOR THE NEW Newly introduced species eventually reach general retail garden centers. But these nurseries take pride in offering rare or hard-to-find new plants as soon as stock is available. CAMELLIA FOREST NURSERY, 125 Carolina Forest Road, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27516; catalogue, $1.

58-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Hewlett to Join Two-Way TV Effort
Furthering the link between computers and consumer electronics, the Hewlett-Packard Company said today that it would collaborate with TV Answer Inc. to develop the first national "interactive" television system. The product would let viewers use their television sets to shop, bank, pay bills, and order food and other services. Using technology from TV Answer, a developer of wireless data services based in Reston, Va., Hewlett-Packard will manufacture and market devices to control a two-way television system in the home. "With TV Answer, we are at the threshold of bringing together the two most powerful information tools available to consumers -- the television and the computer," Robert J. Frankenberg, Hewlett-Packard's vice president and general manager of the personal information products group, said in a statement. Toward the Digital Household The device, a specialized computer that would employ a digital-transmission system similar to that of cellular telephones, could also be used for educational training, participation in game shows, news polls and promotional contests. Hewlett-Packard expects the product to sell for below $700, or less than early videocassette recorders, and plans to make 1.5 million units in the first year. Hewlett-Packard's announcement is part of a growing move to merge computing and consumer electronics as digital technology becomes ever more widespread. Apple Computer Inc. has said it will collaborate with Sony on a series of "personal digital assistants" for such tasks as organizing schedules and receiving electronic mail. And Apple is rumored to be working with a second Japanese company, the Sharp Corporation, on consumer electronics products as well. Some analysts say the incorporation of digital technology into home products offers American companies a chance to recapture the lead in consumer electronics, which was long ago conceded to the Japanese. While others note that the consumer electronics industry operates on much slimmer profit margins than do computer companies, Hewlett-Packard's 20 years in the hand-held calculator business give it some experience with the consumer market. F.C.C. Takes Action Last month, responding to a petition that TV Answer filed in 1987, the Federal Communications Commission decided to set aside space for two-way television in the electromagnetic broadcast spectrum. "TV Answer has successfully moved interactive television from an exciting concept to an emerging market," Mr. Frankenberg said, "and H-P is committed to driving the hardware standard by being the first company to deliver high-quality interactive television appliances at really attractive prices." On the New York Stock Exchange today, Hewlett-Packard's shares rose $1 each, to $74.

59-> Making a Difference; 'Thrilled Beyond Belief'
The Beach Boys sang, Henry Kravis danced disco and waiters in surfing garb offered White Castle burgers and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. Thus -- with food from the 50's, music from the 60's, dance steps from the 70's and celebrities from the 80's -- did the FMR Corporation introduce Worth, its magazine for the 90's, last Wednesday at Roseland in New York City. FMR, the parent of Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund company, has put $20 million of its own money into the venture, and its chairman, Edwin C. Johnson 3d, was at the party, boasting and beaming over what he called his "new baby." But the man of the hour, resplendent in a royal-and-orange Hawaiian print blazer with coordinating ascot and baseball cap, was W. Randall Jones, the 36-year-old former publisher of Esquire and now the chief executive of Worth. In a day-after interview, Mr. Jones pronounced it a wonderful party, one in which Mr. Kravis and Robert Trump, Donald's brother, could "have fun in the same room" with unknown media planners. "And I have been thrilled beyond belief at the response to the magazine," he added. "Everyone at the least admires our courage for launching a magazine in this economy -- and, at the best, is mesmerized by the first issue." According to its birth certificate -- the party press kit -- Worth is a personal finance magazine aimed at "leading-edge baby boomers who want to take control of their financial destinies." The maiden issue featured a look at stock index funds, concluding that a low-fee Vanguard fund was a better deal than a Fidelity rival. But a piece on the boom in baseball card collecting did not mention that Fidelity funds have been big investors in Score Board, which sells baseball cards and collector kits.

60-> Burglars Hit Bronx Borough Chief's Office
Burglars stole electronic equipment from Borough President Fernando Ferrer's office in the Bronx County Courthouse early yesterday, the authorities said. It was the 12th break-in at the building this year. Mr. Ferrer's aides estimated the value of the equipment, including a fax machine, a VCR and a television set, at $1,600. Only two nights before, burglars stole a fax machine from the Budget Unit; that fax machine was a replacement for one that had been stolen three months before. "There's just no security here," said Clint Roswell, Mr. Ferrer's press secretary. The building, at 851 Grand Concourse, closes at 6 P.M. and by 8 P.M. the custodian goes, leaving the building without any kind of security. Under the 1993 budget, an allocation has been set aside for security devices but none have been installed. Since the rash of break-ins began about 13 months ago, Mr. Ferrer has repeatedly asked the city for a security guard, his spokesman said. "But the response has been: budget cuts," Mr. Roswell added.

61-> Gabor Csordas, 71, of Hungarian Church
The Rev. Gabor Csordas, a retired leader of Hungarian Protestants in America and a spokesman for Hungarian religious and political causes, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan with a second home in New City, N.Y. He died of heart failure, his family said. As a longtime dean in the Hungarian Reformed Church of America, he was a leader in a denomination with about 60 churches and 10,000 members in the United States. He founded the Hungarian Reformed Church on 229 East 82d Street in Manhattan in 1958 and served as that congregation's pastor until he retired last fall. For years he broadcast religious and political messages over Radio Free Europe to Hungary and was a staunch foe of the Communist takeover of his native country. In the United States, he helped many Hungarian refugees and other emigres resettle. Born in Szekesfehervar near Budapest, Mr. Csordas came to the United States in 1947 to study at the Union Theological Seminary. After earning a master's degree in 1948, he became the pastor of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Surviving are his wife, Irene; two sons, Gabor, and John, both of Wilton, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Erika Ujvari of Manhattan; a brother, Bela, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

62-> SKIING; Slopes Now Offer Discounts Plus Fun in the Sun
For many skiers, spring brings an automatic reaction: pack away the skis and move on to other activities. But experienced skiers know that spring is the time to get serious. "The irony is, in spring, when skiing is the best, skiers stop skiing," said Marilyn Hertz, a Camelback, Pa., skier who leads groups on spring trips to the Rockies and Europe. "It's then that the days are longer and sunnier. You can ski without bulky clothing. You might also get a big snowfall for powder skiing." The Price Is Right Another reason to ski in March and April is that the price of lift tickets goes down, sometimes way down. And often, these bargains last until the end of the season in mid-April. For instance, skiers from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island can ski free at Sunday River, Me., from March 23 to 27. All that is needed is a driver's license to prove residency in one of those five states. "We know there are areas that New Yorkers can get to faster," said Skip King, Sunday River's director of public relations, "but we want people in those regions to try our area." Free skiing has been offered all season at Brodie Mountain, Mass., to anyone who is unemployed, and will continue until the area closes. The region has been hit by layoffs and so far about 200 people have taken advantage of the program. Loyalty Is Rewarded "I think people will pay for their lift tickets when they are back to work," said Matt Kelly, the manager of the area. "Most people are basically honest, and this will develop their loyalty to Brodie." Loyalty is also rewarded at Stratton Mountain, Vt., where frequent-skier cards, which are purchased for $25, reduce the normal price of a lift ticket -- $39 on weekends and holidays, $32 midweek -- by $10 each time you ski. In addition, those skiers who have used the ticket 10 times during the season can ski midweek for $15 a day. Beginning in April, the reduction for all frequent-skier card holders climbs to $15 a day. Valuable Coupons Coupons on Mountain Dew soda bottles are worth 20 percent discounts on midweek tickets at 29 New York ski areas, including Belleayre, Gore Mountain, Holiday Mountain, Hunter Mountain, Ski Windham and Sterling Forest. Using the American Express card to purchase $100 worth of lift tickets can bring skiers a $25 restaurant certificate at ski areas across the country. Among the areas in the East participating in this program are Gore Mountain, Whiteface, Catamount, Ski Windham, Hunter and Cortina Valley, N.Y.; Bromley, Smugglers' Notch, Stratton, Killington and Mount Snow, Vt.; Vernon Valley and Craigmeur, N.J., and Brodie, Butternut, Jiminy Peak and Otis Ridge, Mass. In addition to the discounts described above, most ski areas in the Northeast will be celebrating their own ode to spring with special bargains on lift tickets and accommodations in the coming weeks. Areas usually continue to make snow, weather permitting, and groom trails, but in some cases not all trails will be open and not all lifts will operate.

63-> Xerox Profit Down by 61%
The Xerox Corporation said today that its earnings fell 61 percent in the fourth quarter after a special charge for cutting 2,500 workers from its document processing unit. For all of 1991, Xerox reported an 87 percent increase in earnings. In the three months ended Dec. 31, Xerox earned $91 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with $235 million, or $2.27 a share, in the comparable period in 1990. Revenues fell 3 percent, to $4.87 billion from $5.01 billion. Xerox took a special charge of $175 million in the latest quarter to pay for severance costs associated with the job cuts. Xerox announced in December that it would eliminate 2,500 jobs from its worldwide work force of 101,000. The fourth-quarter results were also affected by income from the 1990 sale of Xerox South Pacific Operations to the Fuji Xerox Company, a Japanese affiliate of which Xerox owns half. The company reported an after-tax gain of $50 million for the fourth quarter of 1990. For the year, Xerox reported net income of $454 million, or $3.91 a share, on revenues of $17.83 billion.

64-> Making a Difference; The $550 Million Verdict
Joseph D. Jamail, the homespun Texas lawyer with a knack for wringing big awards from juries, did it again last week. In a stunning verdict, a jury in a state court in Galveston awarded more than $550 million to Mr. Jamail's clients -- investors in the Miniscribe Corporation, a now-defunct disk drive manufacturer that was accused of falsifying its financial records. Most of the award consisted of punitive damages assessed against Miniscribe's former chief executive, Q. T. Wiles; its accountant, Coopers & Lybrand, and a major financial backer, Hambrecht & Quist. All three parties were found by the jury to have behaved fraudulently and negligently, as was Hambrecht & Quist's co-founder and co-chief executive, William R. Hambrecht, who was a director of Miniscribe. Attorneys and spokesmen for the defendants denied participating in fraud and said they would appeal. Mr. Jamail said he was not surprised by the findings of the jury regarding fraud, but added "I was a little surprised about the money, yes." "It's my biggest since Pennzoil," he added, referring to the 1985 decision in which a jury ordered Texaco Inc. to pay more than $10 billion to Pennzoil for interfering with a merger between Pennzoil and the Getty Oil Company. Mr. Jamail was Pennzoil's lead attorney. Texaco ultimately settled the case for $3 billion. In the latest case, Mr. Jamail represented Kempner Capital Management and the U.S. National Bank of Galveston, which bought Miniscribe debentures on behalf of 158 investors in 1987 at a time when the Longmont, Colo., company seemed to be doing quite well. But it turned out that Miniscribe's financial situation was not what it appeared. In 1989, a special investigation by some outside directors and auditors concluded that Miniscribe's management had "perpetrated a massive fraud" by, among other tactics, shipping bricks as disk drives and counting them as sales. Mr. Jamail runs a small Houston firm, Jamail & Kolius, with eight other lawyers but no partners. He admits that he is vain -- he declined to give his age, which is in the mid to late 60's -- and that he loves to have things written about him, "even if it's on the toilet wall." How does he get juries even to think in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars? "You don't have to have millions to be able to think about it," he said. "The idea is to make them think about right and wrong."

65-> OUTDOORS; At Season's Stormy End, a Hunter Finally Gets His Geese
A few days ago I realized that I had not fired a shot at a duck or a goose during the entire 1991-92 waterfowling season. Prodded by the knowledge that I hadn't been so deprived for more than half a century, save for three years during World War II, I took one of my fowling pieces from the wall and swung it to my shoulder. It felt good. That particular shotgun, a 12-gauge over and under, had been purchased two seasons back when I knew that I had to have a gun of modern manufacture, one that would handle the steel shot that is now mandatory for waterfowling throughout the nation. Until the steel shot regulations extended to the regions in which I do most of my waterfowling, I had been using a little 20-gauge over and under and lead pellet loads for both ducks and geese, restricting my shots to 40 yards or less. The 20-gauge is new enough to handle the abrasion of steel shot, but it isn't possible to cram enough steel pellets of the right size for geese into a 20-gauge shell. Although it offended my Yankee frugality, I purchased the larger 12-gauge, mainly for geese. Right after I acquired the gun, the landowner on whose fields I did 99 percent of my goose hunting placed them off-limits to such activities. I bagged a few ducks with my new gun, but never had a chance to use it on geese. This season the time for duck hunting slipped away before I knew it, and by the end of January the only remaining legal waterfowling in coastal Massachusetts where I live was a special season for Canada geese, which closed Feb. 5. Because of this, I was delighted by a call from Larry Hepler, a Martha's Vineyard cabinetmaker who has access to some good goose territory, inviting me to go forth with him. The weather report was equally pleasing. A major snowstorm with high winds was predicted for the day of our hunt, a storm that would certainly improve our chances. On days with little or no wind, geese are difficult to decoy. They tend to fly high, scanning the earth beneath with care and shying away from anything that looks even slightly dubious. In high winds, or high winds and snow or rain, they usually move close to the ground and when they see a spread of decoys in a cornfield or one that has been planted to winter rye, they frequently respond with little or no hesitation. It's as if battling the elements robs them of caution. There are exceptions to this, of course. Every veteran goose hunter has had at least one rewarding encounter with geese when there wasn't a whisper of wind and the sun poured down out of a cloudless sky, but such occasions are rare. We were settled in Hepler's hay bale blind in a field of winter rye long before dawn, having stuck a few dozen silhouette decoys into the frozen earth. We also put out a dozen more decoys made of flexible plastic that were designed to flap their wings when touched by the wind. They flapped their wings vigorously in the northerly gale that was developing, so much so that two of them flew right off their stakes. The hay bales shuddered in the wind gusts as did I after the warmth created by our walk to the blind had left me. The day was dark, a few snowflakes were whirling down and the temperature was about 20 degrees. We could see no geese on the frozen salt pond before us, but at about 8:30 A.M. Larry spotted a lone goose flying at us low over the brown marsh and fields. "You saw him first. You take him," I whispered. "You take him if he comes in on your side," my friend replied. The goose came in on my side. He was 30 yards away and setting his wings when I stood to shoot. It was an easy opportunity, but when I swung on him and pulled the trigger, the gun failed to fire. I pulled again with the same result and shouted to Larry to do the honors, but by that time the goose had flared out of range downwind. I fiddled with my gun and discovered that for some reason the trigger pull had become extremely stiff. I hadn't been able to pull hard enough with my half-numb finger. I stuck the offending digit in my mouth and warmed it. Another hour went by before a flock of more than 200 geese materialized to the west of us. They settled on the ice nearly a half mile away, then began to take off in small bunches. One group of about a dozen came our way. When we stood to shoot, I picked the lead bird of a pair that was close to me and when I fired, both fell. Seeking to get three geese with two shots -- the daily limit is five during the special season -- I picked a third bird and pulled. Nothing happened. The recoil of the first shot from my over and under is supposed to ready the second barrel for shooting, but it failed to do so. Larry had also bagged two geese, and a half hour later we each picked up one more. By 10 o'clock, there were no geese in sight, it was obvious that the snowstorm wasn't going to reach us, and we called it quits, pleased that we had done as well as we had. That night -- remembering how weapons had malfunctioned in the bitter cold my airborne regiment experienced in the Battle of the Bulge -- I took my faltering fowling piece apart, removed all traces of oil and grease from its innards and lubricated it with an ultra-light oil. That did the trick, but I'll have to wait for the 1992-93 season to swing on my next goose. There was a time when such a wait would be depressing, but -- one of the few gifts given by advancing age -- I'll add that single encounter to all the others and rejoice.

66-> COMPANY NEWS; Microsoft's Earnings Up 55%
The Microsoft Corporation said today that profits rose 55 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31 on stronger sales of its Windows operating system for personal computers and related software. The company reported profit of $175.2 million, or 90 cents a share, on sales of $681.9 million in its second fiscal quarter, compared with $112.9 million, or 61 cents a share, on sales of $460.5 million earned in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales of Windows 3.0 software have surpassed nine million copies since that version of the operating system went on the market on May 22, 1990. An operating system is the platform on which other programs, or applications, are used. With Windows, a personal computer user can perform various functions by moving a cursor or indicator through symbolic displays, rather than having to type complex sequences of commands required by a DOS-based system. In over-the-counter trading today, Microsoft shares lost $1.25 each, closing at $26.50.

70-> SCIENCE WATCH; Deafness Gene
Scientists say they have identified a gene that can cause deafness in children, a step that may help in diagnosis and in finding a treatment. Two independent teams of scientists have reported finding the gene that when defective causes a disorder called Waardenburg's syndrome. The inherited syndrome is responsible for 3 percent of childhood deafness, said Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, an author of one of the reports. People with the syndrome often have a distinctive appearance that can include a shock of white hair, wide spacing of the eyes or one eye a different color from the other. Only about 20 percent of patients have total hearing loss, Dr. Milunsky said. But anybody with the defective gene has a 50 percent chance of transmitting it to his or her child, in whom it may produce deafness, he said. Dr. David Edelstein of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, who was not connected with the study, said the finding might aid in diagnosis and point the way to a treatment. The finding of the gene is reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. Researchers studied families with a history of the disease, and found that mutations in the gene were associated with appearance of the syndrome. One team included Dr. Milunsky and colleagues at the Boston University School of Medicine and Elias da Silva at the Federal University of Puernambuco in Brazil. The other team included researchers in Britain and Germany.

Federal investigators today charged the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association's majority stockholder with fraud, saying he misappropriated nearly $100,000 two years before the institution failed. The charges against W. James Metz, who was a Silverado board member, consultant and executive committee chairman, brings to two the number of senior officials accused of wrongdoing by Federal agents. Silverado's chairman, Michael Wise, was indicted last week on charges that he stole $458,000 from the savings and loan. In a joint release, the F.B.I. and the Justice Department said Mr. Metz was charged with misapplying $99,840 of Silverado funds on or about June 30, 1986.

Aimery Somogy, a publisher of art books, died on Dec. 29 at the Ambroise-Pare hospital outside Paris. He was 94 years old. No cause of death was given by his family, who announced his death today. Mr. Somogy was born in Hungary in 1897 and went to Paris in 1925. He founded his publishing house in 1937. Among his early successes was "Hitler Told Me," a German refugee's tale of persecution under the Nazis. The book was a best seller until the Germans invaded France in 1940, when it was banned and Mr. Somogy's publishing operation was shut down. After the war, Mr. Somogy published Arthur Koestler's "Spartacus." Recent Somogy publications include the monographs of many famous artists, art dictionaries and encyclopedias.

73-> A Look at the City; Call Me Juror
Two thousand two hundred twenty-four potential jurors trudged into the courthouses of lower Manhattan on Monday. I, armed with bagel and low expectations, was one of them. There was no disappointment for those who expected filth in every room (part of the city's master plan to cut working hours without reducing costs), three armed guards dozing in each courtroom (part of the state's employment plan), and endless hours of waiting (a specialty of all governments). For at least 12 of us, however, something extraordinary was in store as we entered the courtroom of Judge Michael Corriero of New York State's Supreme Court to hear The People v. a young man accused of selling cocaine to an undercover policeman. Called upon to sit in judgment, we were touched by that divine spark of common sense and decency. But before partaking of that spark, we had to be selected -- which was harder than getting into Harvard. Of the 45 who sought admission, only 12, plus 3 alternates, could be accepted. The judge, prosecutor and defense attorney took longer to pick the jury than to try the case. The process is termed "voir dire," French for speaking the truth. It should be called "oy vay," Yiddish for oh, pain. The first batch of 16 prospects looked and sounded the same as the second and third batches -- and as the final jury. But with all three court officers exercising a veto, heads rolled. Those who said "I love New York" were dismissed, apparently on grounds of insanity. So were any who admitted ever having talked to a lawyer. When the judge said "Tell me about yourself," life histories poured out, as if unplugged. One Wall Street type hanged himself by saying he worked for "a world-renowned economist." But a lady who tossed in that she had spent a year as an "intern at the Harvard School of Nutrition" passed muster. The prosecutor, a 24-year-old Asian-American, bounced all Asian-Americans. The defense attorney, who might have been Hispanic, cashiered the Hispanics. Hope surged in me. I was going to get into Harvard -- I mean, on the jury. My turn. Number 40. I was ready. "I'm a native New Yorker who left and returned and now lives on the West Side, who's never knowingly talked to a lawyer, who likes New York" (all the picked jurors actually loved New York, but had figured out the code), "who would be impartial and even Solomonic, but who never gets chosen for juries because I'm a journalist." The court officers were on the defensive. The crowd was on my side. Oppressed journalist. Always rejected. But not this time. The trial was on. The accused, a young Hispanic, did not speak English and required a translator. The Egyptian-born lab technician who testified that the powder allegedly sold to the undercover cop was cocaine didn't speak English very well, but loved to speak it. One detective did not know right from left. The issue came down to the undercover cop's credibility. He had no "ghost" or "shadow" on the street with him the day of the arrest, so no one else saw the supposed sale. The 10-plus officers in the arresting-backup team apparently weren't qualified to be ghosts. The marked money was not found on the accused. The cops either forgot to take a picture of the accused at the station house right after the arrest, or lost it. And so on. Judge Corriero, a man of considerable civility and disciplined intelligence, spelled out the law with superb clarity and sensitivity, and sent us to deliberate. Never in my life have I seen a group of people so attentive for two days. Never have I seen people put aside self-absorption so completely. Never more respect for one another -- the bus driver, the banker, the security guard, Nancy, Larry, Sabrina, Lauren, all. To each, the accused was more important than any of us and all of us. With pain, with doubt about sloppy police work but not with "reasonable doubt," we found the man who never looked at us guilty. Our jury experience, I am told, was not unusual. Something in our government actually works. People can be called to public responsibility. For a fleeting moment, I couldn't help but feel that perhaps one day a political leader would summon that spark.

76-> Art in Review
Michael Chandler Salvatore Ala Gallery 560 Broadway (at Prince Street) SoHo Through Feb. 1 Michael Chandler's art is becoming more assured and persuasive. The latest abstractions by this American painter are rendered in the somber, sometimes murky palette he favors, but many of them are shot through with flashes of vivid color. Broad, looping, widely spaced brushstrokes, which recall the very different styles of Willem de Kooning and Gerhard Richter, crisscross the canvases. They often evoke thick grasses through which a viewer peers at ground level. Landscapes of one kind or another are implicit in almost all of the 15 works in the show. They suggest shallow spaces densely packed with activity. Mr. Chandler puts to use a gamut of Abstract Expressionist devices, like drips and splashes, to energize his images. Where he builds biomorphic shapes into the compositions, the effect is clunky and static. He seems at his best in canvases like "Two Songs," "Grin and Dive," "War Games" and "Wolf's Leap," where his gestural improvisations speak most vividly of risk and experimentation.

77-> Witness Says Victim Had Hands in Air
Moments before he was fatally shot, 16-year-old Phillip Pannell was standing in a yard with his hands raised, a Teaneck resident testified today in the manslaughter trial of the Teaneck police officer accused of killing him. The witness, Dorothy Robinson, a nurse's aide, said she heard the first of two shots fired at Mr. Pannell as she left her home near the scene to visit a neighbor. "I heard a pop sound," Mrs. Robinson said. "It just made me look up." She said she saw two officers running, their guns drawn, and Mr. Pannell standing a few feet from them, his legs shielded from her view by a hedge. "I could see his hands up," she said. "He was coming around like this with his hands up," she added, turning toward her right in the witness box. Then the youth stumbled, she said. Feared Victim Was Grandson Mrs. Robinson said she began running toward Mr. Pannell because she thought he was her grandson. As she ran, she said, two people were shouting, "Don't shoot." Then a second shot was fired, Mrs. Robinson said. She said she saw only a muzzle flash and did not know which officer had fired. By the time she ran into the yard, Mr. Pannell was lying mortally wounded. She said he was on his back, with his arms stretched above his head and one leg tucked under his body. Mrs. Robinson said she attempted to administer cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, but one of the officers told her to back away. She said she did so as an angry crowd gathered in the street and a nearby driveway. She said she helped restrain one teen-ager who was attempting to attack Officer Wayne Blanco, a back-up officer to the policeman accused of the shooting, Gary Spath. Mrs. Robinson's partial account of the shooting is the first offered by prosecutors in their effort to prove that Officer Spath, who is white, was criminally negligent for shooting Mr. Pannell, who was black. Lawyers for Officer Spath, who is 31 years old and has been on the Teaneck force 10 years, are arguing that the shooting was justified because Mr. Pannell had a weapon in his jacket pocket and because, they said, he was attempting to remove it when he was shot. The state says that Officer Spath, who has been suspended with pay since the shooting in April 1990, had no absolute knowledge of the gun's presence and that Mr. Pannell's hands were raised in an apparent gesture of surrender when he was killed. Mrs. Robinson said Officer Spath was "very upset" after the shooting, cursing and throwing his portable radio against a fence. During cross-examination, the chief defense lawyer, Robert Galantucci, attacked Mrs. Robinson's credibility, contending that she once said in a television interview that a third officer had cursed and thrown a radio. He argued that Mrs. Robinson attributed the outburst to Officer Spath after talking with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who befriended Mr. Pannell's parents after the shooting and led several protest marches in Teaneck. She said she was "confused" during the TV interview but heatedly denied that Mr. Sharpton had influenced her. "I never took any advice from Mr. Sharpton at any time," she said angrily. "He never told me what to say." Mr. Galantucci also challenged her testimony that Mr. Pannell's hands were raised above his head, contending that she told a grand jury in June 1990 that his hands were raised only shoulder high. Mrs. Robinson said she did not recall that testimony. When the lawyer pointed out that she told detectives on the night of the shooting that an officer weighing about 250 pounds -- far more than Officer Spath -- had fired the fatal shot, Mrs. Robinson said, "There was a lot of pressure put on me that night." Earlier today, there was testimony from three teen-agers who had been with Mr. Pannell when Officers Spath and Blanco confronted him on a school playground about two minutes before the shooting across the street. The three, Tomisha Autry, 16, Tyrrell Autry, 15, and Corey Goodall, 15, testified that Mr. Pannell ran off and was not touched or searched. They also said Officer Blanco did not shout that Mr. Pannell had a gun. Mr. Galantucci said in his opening argument Wednesday that Officer Blanco had done so.

78-> BASEBALL; Cone Is Likely to Hit Jackpot in Mets' New Proposal
For the Mets, the negotiations lack the drama that surrounded last spring's dealings on a contract extension for Dwight Gooden. The negotiations also lack the mutual mistrust that characterized last spring's bargaining with Frank Viola. The negotiations on a long-term deal for David Cone, though, won't lack for impact or dollars. The Mets, eager and determined to sign the right-hander to a multiyear contract and thus avoid the chance of losing him to free agency at the end of the 1992 season, will extend Cone a formal contract proposal early next week. The offer in all probability will be for three years and is expected to approach $12 million. "We're ready to start to get involved with some kind of numbers," said Al Harazin, the general manager of the Mets. "It's obvious we are interested in signing David to a deal of longer than a year, and it's been made clear to me that he's interested in such an arrangement to one on his end." On Tuesday, Harazin met with Cone's agent, Steve Fehr, as part of the preliminary stages of negotiations. No proposal was made, but certainly no potential impasse appeared likely as a result of the discussion. No Sense of Gloom "I definitely don't have any sense of gloom based on what we talked about," said Fehr. And one clearly got the sense that the enthusiasm for signing Cone within the organization was such that the once supposedly inflexible negotiating terms are about to be altered. The Mets, who refused to give either Gooden or Viola extensions of more than three years, have indicated they might relent in the case of Cone. "My preference is to do three years," said Harazin. "My track record with long-term deals for pitchers, after all, is not great. But I'm not going to rule out four. I'm a realist." It's a realism born of recent history, the signings to four-year packages for Mike Morgan, Tom Candiotti, Chuck Finley and Bryan Harvey over the last several weeks having again redefined the marketplace. But Harazin's willingness to do the unprecedented for Cone also reflects the club's longstanding and resilient conviction that the 29-year-old Cone has the potential to be among the most dominant pitchers in the game. It's a conviction that can at least be traced back to last spring, for it was the organization's commitment to spending enormous dollars on Cone that colored its less than desperate efforts to retain the services of Viola. Big Finish to 1991 And that commitment has apparently survived intact, even though 1991 was a typical season for Cone, loaded with astounding performances, erratic episodes and a good, but far from great final overall record. Cone who struck out 19 Philadelphia Phillies in the season's final game to equal a National League record, led the league in strikeouts with 241, easily outdistancing Greg Maddux's 198. But Cone, who was ordinary during the stretch of the season that decided the club's fate of failure, wound up only 14-14, plagued by his nearly trademark lapses of concentration. Cone has set up no deadlines and made no specific demands, saying last month that he would consider any offer, from one year to four or beyond. He also said that unlike Viola and Gooden, he would be willing to extend negotiations into the 1992 season if no deal had been worked out. Cone, who has won his last two salary arbitration cases with the Mets, could ultimately wind up reliving the procedure this spring. The Mets and Cone have to exchange figures for a one-year deal for the purposes of arbitration by next Friday.

79-> Sheldon H. Gorlick, A Tax Authority, 63
Sheldon H. Gorlick, a lawyer, an editor and an authority on taxes and professional incorporation, died on Monday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 63 years old and lived in Ridgewood. He died of complications resulting from leukemia, his wife, Herthe, said. Specializing in physicians' personal and professional finances, Mr. Gorlick joined the staff of Medical Economics magazine in 1961, becoming a senior editor. Resigning in 1986 to practice law full time, he remained with the magazine as an editorial consultant until his death. A native of East Orange, N.J., he worked part time for The Newark Star-Ledger while attending Rutgers School of Journalism. After graduation, he worked as a reporter for The Jersey Journal and received a law degree from New York University in 1959. In 1961, Mr. Gorlick was a member of a small group of lawyers who lobbied successfully for Congress to provide special tax treatment for professional corporations. Subsequently, he became a founding member of the Group, an association of lawyers representing professional corporations. He was author of two books: "Now That You're Incorporated: Coping With Changing Tax Laws" and "The Whys and Wherefores of Corporate Practice," both published by Medical Economics Books. Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Warren, of Washington, and Ronald, of Brooklyn, and a brother, Eugene, of Englishtown, N.J.

80-> Advanced Micro's Silicon Cash Cow
Saying it has experienced a "virtual stampede of customers," Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported today that it had captured more than 30 percent of the market for the 386 microprocessor in the fourth quarter of 1991, leading to record quarterly revenues and its highest profit margins since 1984. The semiconductor company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it had sold more than $145 million in 386 processors, many more than under the company's most optimistic projections. The sales signal that the monopoly the Intel Corporation has enjoyed on this silicon cash cow, the central chip in millions of personal computers, has been shattered. Advanced Micro's success in cloning the 386 has also resulted in a turnaround for a company that has been struggling with losses and low profits since 1985. During that time, industry analysts suggested the need to replace W. J. Sanders 3d, the company's founder, chairman and chief executive, who has personified his company in a way few other chief executives have. Some critics had said that Mr. Sanders, a marketing ace known for his gold rings, Rolls-Royces and Riviera vacations, was neglecting Advanced Micro's daily management. Now, however, some of those questions are dissipating. Mr. Sanders, who said he did not want to leave when the company was foundering, says he is having too much fun to give it up now. Dispelling rumors that he would soon retire, Mr. Sanders, who is 55 years old, said recently that he had signed an agreement with Advanced Micro's board that has him running the company through 1996, with an additional year possible at his option. "It's so good, it's scary," Mr. Sanders said in an interview about the company's business prospects. He sees further improvement in the first quarter of this year, adding, "We're eating Intel's lunch in the marketplace." Intel has said it was confident it could stay ahead of Advanced Micro in sales and in new technology. For the fourth quarter of 1991, Advanced Micro reported net income of $106.7 million, or $1.17 a share, six times that of the third quarter and a sharp contrast to a loss of $42.9 million in the comparable 1990 quarter. Gain From Asset Sales The income for the 1991 period includes a gain of 52 cents a share from asset sales, primarily Advanced Micro's stake in Xilinx Inc., another semiconductor company. But the company's pretax operating profits, of $63.2 million, was also up sharply from the third quarter and from a loss a year earlier -- exceeding Wall Street's expecations. Advanced Micro's sales in the quarter totaled $366.1 million, up by 37.7 percent from $265.8 million in the 1990 period. "You've got to take your hat off to them," said Daniel Klesken, a semiconductor analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. in San Francisco. "It was outstanding." Advanced Micro's shares fell 12.5 cents today, to $18.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. For the year over all, the company had a net income of $145.2 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with a net loss of $53.5 million the year before. Its revenues rose by 16 percent, to $1.22 billion from $1.05 billion. Mr. Sanders said that while the 386 had garnered all the attention, the company had made progress in other ways. It has trimmed its payroll to 10,800, from a peak of 18,000 after it acquired Monolithic Memories Inc., another chip maker, in 1987. Advanced Micro has also converted many of its chips to a more modern semiconductor technology. Still, analysts said, virtually all the company's operating profits and growth in revenues in the fourth quarter came from the 386. Last year, the 386 contributed more than $250 million to the company's revenues, exceeding Mr. Sanders's projections of about $100 million for the year. In 1992, he said, 386 sales could exceed $600 million. Richard Whittington, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York, said Advanced Micro could earn as much as $3 a share this year. "This company is on an explosive earnings path," he said. Advanced Micro's chips first caught on with smaller personal computer makers in the Far East early last year, when they had trouble getting Intel chips because of tight supplies. But now, Advanced Micro's chips are catching on with virtually all personal computer companies, because they offer higher speeds or consume less power than Intel's chips at the same prices. Still, some analysts say that Advanced Micro has become too dependent on one product and that the boom may not last. They say the 386 market will diminish as Intel moves customers to the more advanced 486, for which it has no competition, and to the 386-SL, a chip geared for tiny battery-powered computers. Intel also said this week that it would cut the prices on its basic 386 chip by up to 35 percent, making it tougher on Advanced Micro. Intel, which last year became the nation's largest semiconductor company, still has lawsuits pending against Advanced Micro for copyright infringement that could force Advanced Micro to withdraw its chips from the market, modify them or pay royalties to Intel.

82-> Kerry Repudiates B.C.C.I. Panel Assertion
Senator John F. Kerry, who heads the Senate subcommittee investigating the activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday repudiated the conclusion the subcommittee reached last week that former Senator John Culver had played a key role in the bank's lobbying campaign to quash Congressional scrutiny. Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Culver's contacts with Congressional staff members had been made at the request of his law partners, who were representing B.C.C.I., and were "neither improper or unusual." He minimized those contacts as a "limited part" in B.C.C.I.'s attempts to halt the investigation. The draft report made available last Thursday offered the broadest portrait yet of how influence peddling, bribery and government action allowed the bank to support drug-money laundering and international terrorism through a range of fraudulent activities. 'Neither Improper Nor Unusual' In a section discussing attempts by the bank to stop Mr. Kerry's subcommittee from investigating the bank's involvement in drug-money transfers, the report named Mr. Culver, Democrat of Iowa, as the main source of calls on the bank's behalf that led the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to question whether Mr. Kerry's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations had any jurisdiction over international banking. In an unusual statement given that he was correcting a committee report issued under his auspices, Mr. Kerry said that Mr. Culver's contacts " were neither improper nor unusual and were a limited part of B.C.C.I.'s very substantial overall effort regarding this investigation." Mr. Culver was unavailable for comment, but according to statements released yesterday, he first learned of the accusation in news reports last Friday and had never been told by the subcommittee staff of his purported involvement or queried about it. Mr. Kerry said yesterday that Mr. Culver had provided "additional information" on Tuesday about the contacts that would be made public in the final report. Mr. Culver characterized his involvement as "a few hours over a period of years" and "absolutely beyond reproach by any moral or ethical standard." He said that the draft report had layered "innuendo on falsehood on misrepresentation repeatedly and recklessly" to imply that he had used his influence to delay and impede the investigation.

83-> Easing of Abortion Curb Is Disputed
Contrary to the Bush Administration's recent assertion that doctors may discuss abortion in federally financed clinics, the rule that bans abortion counseling continues to apply to them, experts told lawmakers today. Two weeks ago, the Administration announced that its rule forbidding abortion counseling in 4,000 Government-financed family planning clinics applied only to nurses and counselors, not to doctors. But at a hearing today before the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, doctors and lawyers on both sides of the abortion issue gave a different interpretation, saying the rule actually made no distinction between doctors and other professionals and that the Administration's position carried no legal weight. They said any effort to exempt doctors could result legal challenges from anti-abortion groups. The testimony today suggested that the Administration's effort to steer a political course between opponents of abortion and groups advocating abortion rights may have failed to achieve that goal. Medical Groups' Opposition Medical organizations -- including the American Medical Association, the American Medical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists -- continued to strenuously oppose the Administration's position. Spokesmen for the various medical organizations said in testimony today that the Administration's latest position gave no help to doctors, who they said would still be bound by the counseling rules. At the same time, lawyers from groups that are either neutral on the abortion issue or that have supported the Administration's previous stand, said that the effort to exempt doctors -- who make up a minuscule proportion of the workers in family planning clinics -- carried no legal weight. But today, Dr. William Archer, head of the Office of Population Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, testified that he would not enforce the rules against doctors who discuss abortion at the clinics "as long as I am in this job." Asked what was to prevent him from just changing his mind later and deciding to enforce the rules against doctors, Dr. Archer said he was acting on instructions from the President, put forward in a letter last November. Representative Henry A. Waxman, the chairman of the subcommittee holding today's hearing, asked Dr. Archer whether doctors might now provide abortion counseling under the latest guidelines. "If a doctor feels that is appropriate in his or her professional judgment, yes absolutely," Dr. Archer told the California Democrat. But when Mr. Waxman asked if a doctor could refer a woman who wanted an abortion to an abortion clinic, Dr. Archer said the doctor's counseling did have some limits. A doctor may not tell a woman where she can get an abortion, but may only read a list of approved clinics compiled by local family planning officials. The list may include some clinics that carry out abortion, but not if the clinic's chief mission is abortion. Mr. Waxman then asked if the woman took the same list and asked the doctor which of the clinics on the list might give her an abortion, Dr. Archer said the doctor would not be permitted to tell her. The counseling rules also state that no family planning clinic receiving Federal funds may carry out abortions as well. Family planning centers under the rule must be "physically and financially separate." But today, in another attempt to soften the rule's effect, Dr. Archer said the Administration did not intend to enforce the rule against hospitals that provided both services in one building. "We do not mean to separate out-facilities in a hospital," he said. "We intend for hospitals to go ahead" with both family planning and abortion services, he said. In today's hearing, intended to examine the Administration's apparent change of position on the counseling rules, Dr. Raymond Scalettar, a member of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, said the Administration's statements "provide some relief" but "essentially reinforce the view that the department may censor communication of truthful information about legal medical options." Dr. Scalettar said it was still unclear what doctors might tell patients because the regulations seemed to conflict with the Administration's statements in recent weeks about what doctors might say. He and others said that courts would be more likely to rule that doctors, even after the Administration had said it would not target them, were still prohibited from counseling on abortion. Yet, he said, if a doctor withheld abortion counseling and a woman suffered serious complications in her pregnancy, the doctor could be sued for malpractice for not offering his best advice. Dr. Scalettar said the medical association was still opposed to the Administration's rule. "What will be the next unpopular procedure that we will have to hide from our patients?" he asked. "We really have to get the Government off our backs when it comes to taking care of our patients." The rule prohibiting any counseling on abortion was issued in 1988, but legal and political challenges have kept it from being enforced. And since last fall, the Administration has tried to fend off complaints from from all sides, including conservatives in Congress who might otherwise support the Administration's position, that the guidelines interfere with free speech and the ability of doctors and other medical professionals from giving their best medical advice. Late in the afternoon of Friday, March 20, Administration officials held a news conference and said they would not enforce the counseling rule against doctors, but only against nurses and other counselors in the federally financed family planning clinics. Bar Association Speaks Today, the American Bar Association, which has maintained its neutrality in the debate, issued a letter saying that despite statements by the Administration: "The 1988 regulations still impose serious restrictions on Title X doctor-patient communication. Legislation is still needed to remedy this serious problem." To assure that its revised position would have legal effect, the Bush Administration would have to propose new regulations and put them out for public comment, a process that can take many months. The Administration has declined to do that. Congress passed legislation last year to end the policy, but Mr. Bush's veto of that measure was sustained when the House fell a dozen votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to override. New bills to overturn the counseling rule are now making their way through Congress.

84-> CHRONICLE
DOROTHY SCHULMAN, the honorary chairwoman of a Chanel fashion show this evening at the Henry Flagler Morrison Museum in Palm Beach, Fla., has received 60 letters pleading for tickets. "They say, 'Why am I being turned away?' " Mrs. Schulman said yesterday. " 'I am crying, and I want to be part of it.' " The sold-out event, which will benefit the Children's Medical Center at St. Mary's Hospital in Palm Beach, is costing Chanel $250,000. It is easy to see why, from the explanation of the logistics by JULIE MANNION, the producer of the show and a partner in the public relations firm of Keeble, Cavaco & Duka. It is to be staged in "the largest tent in south Florida," she said, with a floor, risers, a runway and special lighting. For the cocktail party, trees were placed outside the museum to look as if they were growing into its windows. Moss was flown in from Seattle, and vines from North Carolina, to reflect the theme, "Coco and the Enchanted Forest." Two dozen models will wear designs from KARL LAGERFELD'S spring and summer couture and ready-to-wear collections, Ms. Mannion said. They are coming in from France, Portugal and the Bahamas. Six hairdressers from Tokyo and Paris will be on hand, not to mention the caterer, security guards, musical engineer, nurse and paramedics. ELESABETH GILLET, a chairwoman of the event, said a gasp arose when she proposed raising the price of a ticket from $175 to $250. The increase was approved, she said, but even so, "we have had to return at least 100 checks." Why such a strong demand? "The construction work," she said, "and the public relations." Well, that's telling it like it is.

85-> What's a Little Pollution? Europe's Forests Keep On Growing
CONTRARY to a commonly held view, the forests of Europe have grown substantially despite a chronic assault by air pollution, according to a study by scientists in Finland. Pollution is indeed causing harm, the study says, and could lead to a future long-term decline. But after analyzing a range of recent studies, the Finnish scientists concluded that from 1971 to 1990, the rate of tree growth on the Continent increased by 30 percent and the total volume of wood in tree trunks increased by 25 percent. "A decline of forest resources in Europe is a threat for the future, not a historical fact," the Finnish investigators wrote in the current issue of the journal Science. The study was conducted by Dr. Pekka E. Kauppi, Dr. Karl Mielikainen and Dr. Kullervo Kuusela of the Finnish Forest Research Institute in Helsinki. The conclusions on the rate of forest growth were based on detailed studies from Finland, France and Sweden, and those on total forest volume on data from Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. These intensive surveys were supplemented by less detailed assessments from the rest of Europe. Some forestry experts, including the authors themselves, say that the lack of definitive data from all but about a third of Europe is a drawback. To extrapolate from a few countries to the rest of the Continent "may be a bit tenuous," said Dr. Peter Duinker, a forestry expert at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, who is familiar with the European situation. Moreover, he said, many important signs of pollution-induced forest decline would not necessarily be revealed by simple surveys of forest growth and forest mass because "the complicating factors are enormous." Still, he said, he could not dispute the evidence so far as it goes. Warming Promotes Growth Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues cited a number of possible reasons for what they say is the forests' growth, including a warming climate; the fertilizing effect of airborne nitrates; and an increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is the basic raw material that plants use, in combination with sunlight and water, to manufacture food. Both nitrates and carbon dioxide are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Potentially, Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues say, these positive influences could lead to similar increases in growing stock and growth rate in other parts of the world. But they also said that ultimately, the positive factors could be outweighed by the harmful impact of pollution. They found that deposits of airborne pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels have changed soil chemistry on the Continent in ways that could have long-term adverse effects. Because entire forest environments change on a time scale of decades, however, the upward growth trend of the last two decades cannot be reversed in fewer than 5 to 10 years, guaranteeing that forest resources will be plentiful for the next 10 to 20 years, the authors wrote. Some of what they say appears to be consistent with some recent findings in the United States. A Federal study ordered by Congress, completed in 1990, concluded that acid rain could stunt forests in the long term by altering soil chemistry, that red spruce at high altitudes was being damaged and that acid rain might be contributing to a decline of sugar maples in Canada. But it found no evidence of an overall forest decline. Similarly, preliminary studies by scientists at the New York Botanical Garden have indicated that uncut old-growth forests at the garden's site in the Bronx have continued to function efficiently despite some of the worst pollution in America. The New York scientists warned, however, that such insults could lead to ultimate decline. No Trees Near Smelter The Finnish investigators reported that more than 15 percent of Europe's trees were moderately to severely defoliated, though they noted that this does not always indicate decline in a forest stand. Defoliation often takes place naturally in a fast-growing forest as some trees outcompete others. The scientists calculated that about 3,100 square miles of forest, or about half a percent of the Continent's total, had been killed by pollution. As a particularly extreme instance, they cited the vicinity of the Montshegorsk smelter at Kola, near Murmansk, in northwestern Russia. Emissions of sulfur compounds and heavy metals from the smelter have killed all trees within a radius of three miles, according to the report. The destruction is the most extensive in the immediate area of any single source of pollution in Europe, the report said. But severe decline like that at Montshegorsk is rare, the scientists concluded. Among the factors not included in the Finnish analysis, said Dr. Duinker, is the fact that since World War II, Europe has been engaged in a deliberate effort to build up forest resources to meet the wood demands of a resurgent economy. European foresters also remove a lot of unhealthy-looking trees so that they can be salvaged alive for commercial use, a fact acknowledged by Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues. This "may be masking our ability to detect pollution-induced decline by going in and getting out the trees in worst shape," Dr. Duinker said. He also suggested that less severe forest decline than in the 3,100 dead square miles "could be a real phenomenon." There may be 10 times more forests in moderate decline and 100 times more in slight decline, he said. "It's like a boxer," he said. "Minor punches could put the guy on the floor after 15 or 20 bouts."

86-> BRIDGE; A New Championship: The Pan-American
FOR more than 60 years there have been national championships. For more than 40 years there have been world championships. But now, for the first time, there is something in between. Next Saturday nine days of play will begin in Corpus Christi, Tex., in the first Pan-American Championships. Participation from 24 countries is expected. In the open series, the Brazilian team, with a bunch of world champions, will be hard to beat, though the United States will be strongly represented in both the open and women's divisions. Two of the four American women's squads met recently in Memphis to select the American team for the 1992 world championships, and the diagramed deal was dynamic. It will be seen that East-West can expect to make five spades, losing a trick in each minor suit. But the defense can prevail with a minor-suit lead and one or even two heart ruffs. That result occurred in one room, and East was decidedly disappointed to lose 200 when the defense was perfect. Her spirits revived considerably when she heard the story of the replay. Jo Morse sat East and, as shown, took a direct shot at four spades over one heart, judging that slam was unlikely opposite a passed partner. That was passed around to the North player, Sue Picus, who naturally chose to compete. Four no-trump was not Blackwood, of course, but a request to partner to pick a suit at the five-level. South chose diamonds, but it was not over. Joyce Lilie as West persevered to five spades, thinking that somebody would be able to make 11 tricks. This was a normal decision, but it turned out badly for a surprising reason. Sharon Osberg as South was still in the game, and carried on to six diamonds, believing, no doubt, that five spades would make and that her attempt at a save would result in a modest defeat. She was wrong on both counts. East doubled with some confidence, and West led a spade. This was ruffed in the dummy, and a heart was ruffed. The East-West bidding suggested that the minor suits would not break evenly, and Osberg now made a brilliant decision by finessing the club nine. When this won she ruffed another heart, led to the diamond ace and ruffed yet another heart. The position was now this: [ DIAGRAM ] South finessed the club queen and East was helpless. With the hearts established in the dummy it did not matter whether she ruffed or not. Sooner or later, South would lead winning hearts from the dummy to make the contract. Bringing home a doubled slam with a combined count of 15 points was a happy event for North-South. They had won the battle, and 13 imps, but they eventually lost the war.

87-> PRO BASKETBALL; Cavaliers Halt Bulls' Home Streak
Craig Ehlo had 4 points as Cleveland outscored Chicago by 6-2 in the final 1 minute 32 seconds and snapped the Bulls' 14-game home winning streak with a 113-112 victory tonight. Michael Jordan scored 46 points, but the Cavaliers still broke a 12-game regular-season losing streak against Chicago. Ehlo drove the lane for a basket and a 111-110 lead with 1:04 left and added two free throws 20 seconds later for a 113-110 advantage. Jordan responded with a pull-up jumper from 15 feet with 34 seconds left, making the score 113-112. Scottie Pippen, who scored 24 points, had a chance to put Chicago ahead with 6 seconds left, but his shot went off the rim. Jazz 88, Celtics 83 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 30 points and Utah held Boston to 11 points on 1-for-19 shooting in the fourth quarter to beat the Celtics, who fell to three and a half games behind the Knicks in the Atlantic Division. Boston missed its first 18 shots from the field in the final period until Joe Kleine's 3-pointer, the second of his career, with eight seconds left. Hawks 117, Bullets 110 BALTIMORE (AP) -- Rumeal Robinson scored a career-high 28 points to lead the Hawks. His previous career best was 27 points, earlier this season against Washington. The game was tied at 106 when Atlanta's Duane Ferrell made a driving layup with 1:39 left. After Washington's Michael Adams missed a 3-point attempt, Paul Graham made two free throws for the Hawks.

Timberwolves 124, Rockets 122 HOUSTON (AP) -- Tony Campbell had 35 points and Sam Mitchell scored all 13 of his points in the final 10 minutes, leading Minnesota to the overtime victory.

(AP) -- Tim Hardaway scored 25 points and Chris Mullin 22 as Golden State survived a 1-for-15 shooting drought at the start of the second half.

88-> PNC Bank Revamping
The PNC Financial Corporation, America's 13th-largest bank holding company, announced today that it was combining several units and changing its name to the PNC Bank Corporation. Beginning in February, all banks and most affiliates will change their names to the PNC Bank. The gradual name change for all units will be completed by early 1994, the company said. The PNC Financial Corporation will become the PNC Bank Corporation in February. That same month, PNC will combine the charters of the Pittsburgh National Bank and the Provident National Bank. The Marine Bank in Erie, Pa., will be merged into the combined bank in April. PNC, with $45.5 billion in assets as of June 30, operates about 500 offices in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and Delaware.

89-> Yeltsin, in Britain, Warns Of Peril of Russian Unrest
At a stopover on his way to the United Nations, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia warned today that his country could collapse into "general unrest" and authoritarian rule if its economic reforms failed, and appealed for continued help from Western countries. He left with broad promises, but not with much that he could take to the bank, just like the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, last July, after his meeting with leaders of the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies. Mr. Yeltsin arrived at 10 Downing Street this morning on his first international trip since the Christmas collapse of the Soviet Union, with his financial and military advisers in a fleet of polished black Russian Zil limousines. After four hours of talks with the British Prime Minister, John Major, the Russian leader said he "respected" Britain's refusal to include its nuclear forces in any arms reduction talks. Before leaving Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin had welcomed President Bush's announcement Tuesday night of major cuts in American ground-based and seaborne nuclear warheads, matched them with offers of even bigger cuts in Russia's sea-based systems, and called on Britain, France and China to "follow our example." British Nuclear Force Mr. Major explained this morning that Britain would go ahead with plans to replace its Polaris submarine force, and much of its air force nuclear capability, with a deterrent force of four Trident submarines that could carry up to 512 warheads by the end of the 1990's. He told Mr. Yeltsin that it was "only a minimum deterrent force, threatening no one." Before he left this afternoon, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would no longer aim its missiles at Britain; he made a similar pledge concerning the United States last week. "The number of nuclear weapons at the disposal of the U.K. is not comparable with ours and therefore the matter is not really worth discussing," he said. Most of their discussions concerned economic affairs, according to the two leaders and their aides. Mr. Major said Britain would press for full Russian membership in the International Monetary Fund by April of this year, and would urge the other industrial democracies to find ways of giving further assistance to the republic, "possibly in the form of a ruble stabilization fund." In a joint declaration, Russia and Britain pledged to insure that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction were held under secure control at all times. Mr. Major said that Britain would send a technical mission to Moscow to see what could be done to help the Russians store, dispose of, and safeguard nuclear materials from the weapons they dismantle as they cut back their military forces. Advice for Russian Military He also said he had offered to send "a small number" of British Defense Ministry officials to the Moscow headquarters of Defense Minister Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov to help with restructuring of the Russian armed forces and insuring effective democratic control. Mr. Yeltsin gave no indication whether he would welcome them. Saying that Britain was determined to help democracy in Russia, Mr. Major enumerated the aid programs already underway, bilaterally and within the European Community, amounting to $670 million so far, and pointed to the Group of Seven wealthy industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund as the best sources of further assistance. The only new aid he mentioned today was $504 million Britain was making available for an International Monetary Fund program insuring export credits and investments in Russia and other former Soviet republics "The only thing that can impede our progress will be general unrest," Mr. Yeltsin said, "and general unrest will happen if our reforms fail. Should the reforms fail, we shall face a new leadership and Russia will fall into the habits which tortured us for 74 years." Before leaving for the United States, he said the amount of aid the West was providing was "by no means" enough. "Deeds we need, not words," he said. In a joint declaration, the two countries agreed to be "friendly states and partners within the international community," and promised to formalize their relationship in a British-Russian treaty. Mr. Yeltsin then went off to visit Mr. Major's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, and reboard his plane for New York.

91-> Police Are Paid by Us And Accountable to Us
To the Editor: The most striking feature of "Righteous Anger Spilled Over at Police Rally" (letter, Sept. 25) by Phil Caruso, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president, is its irrelevance. No matter what Mr. Caruso's explanation, members of the police force -- who work for the public and for the Mayor -- broke laws and violated the civil rights of numerous public officials when they rioted, damaged cars of city staff members and hurled racial epithets at the Mayor and members of the City Council. Likewise, that the incident "injured no one" is both irrelevant and false: that a crime is "victimless" does not stop the police from apprehending criminals in other situations. More important, public humiliation of African-Americans is injury, and Mr. Caruso's insensitivity to this serves only to underscore his own racism. Most galling is the notion that no one other than the police has a right to review the behavior of the police in this and other incidents. The police are public employees, and those who pay their salaries have every right to set standards for how they do their jobs. STEPHEN E. PHILLIPS Brooklyn, Sept. 25, 1992

92-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Cable's Use Of 'Free' TV Is Debated
Saying they were sticking up for consumers, entertainment executives quarreled with one another before a Senate panel today over whether cable television should continue to have free access to over-the-air broadcasts. Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Patents, suggested that the executives' opinions had been shaped not by consumer concern, but their own profit motives. If the free-access law is repealed, "someone is going to make more money," Mr. DeConcini said, adding, "How much more are you going to make?" Addressing the subcommitee were heavyweights from the motion picture, cable television and broadcast industries. No one answered the question directly. Those Who Seek Payments "The greatest economic benefit will be to consumers," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, who supports repealing free access. He said a fair market value was not being paid for the Hollywood products broadcast by the television networks and picked up by cable systems. If cable operators had to start paying, Mr. Valenti said, the money would be used to enhance the programming available to everyone. Barry Diller, outgoing chairman of the Fox Inc. broadcasting network, went even further, saying that if cable did not start contributing to the costs of broadcast programs, "there will be nothing worth watching on free television." Mr. Diller pointed out that cable operators had two sources of revenue: rates and advertising. Broadcast stations and networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- have only advertising. 'Compulsory Licensing' Debated Under a law known as "compulsory licensing" that was passed in 1976 to help the fledgling cable indusry grow, the creators of programs for broadcast are compelled to allow cable companies free access to local television signals. Broadcasters argue that the so-called compulsory license represents a giveaway to their biggest competitor. A bill to repeal the law has been introduced in the House, but not yet in the Senate. Repeal would open the door for negotiations between those who make the shows and those who carry them and would likely lead to payments by cable companies for local and network programs. Such a change is thought likely to add to the monthly bills of cable television subscribers. But Mr. Diller argued that the new source of revenue would mean continued quality programming for everyone, not just those who can afford cable. Ted Turner, head of the Turner Broadcasting System, said the networks made a lot more money than cable, which was just starting to see success. "Cable has succeeded and now the broadcasters want to get our money," Mr. Turner said. "These guys are up here because we're in their pockets a little bit." He said the law had been good for consumers because it was promoting diversity in television programming. James Hedlund, president of the Association of Independent Television Stations, also opposed repeal of the law, while Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters said it should be re-examined. Broadcasters provided crucial support when the Senate passed a tough cable television regulation bill in January.

93-> TV SPORTS; Oh, for Olga or Nadia, or Even a Little More Kim
Oh, oh. NBC's Olympics ratings are no longer spectacular. After a wonderful first week, when ratings peaked with last Thursday night's 22.3, those nettlesome Nielsens fell for three straight nights beginning Sunday, before the decline was stemmed with a 15.8 Wednesday. By last week's fantastic Thursday, NBC's prime-time coverage averaged a 19.9 rating -- 17 percent above the same period in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. But by Wednesday of this week, NBC's 11 nights in Barcelona were tied at 18.2 with its 11 nights in Seoul. (With alacrity, NBC notes that the rating exceeds the 15.3 guaranteed to advertisers -- which is all that truly matters because NBC won't have to give away free commercials. The rating is also dandy, NBC says, because fewer people watch television in July and August than in September and October, when the Seoul Games took place.) What's the difference between the two weeks' ratings? Viewer fatigue? Boredom? Or something much more ominous, like all those ex-No. 1 Fans snapping from sensory overload and smashing their glowing sets at the latest image of Barcelona (or am I reading too much Stephen King?). Actually, the difference lies with the power of gymnastics, swimming and diving against track and field. NBC loaded up with eight nights of prime-time gymnastics (two more than in Seoul and in the 1984 Los Angeles Games, televised by ABC), taking full advantage of the Summer Olympics' traditional first-week scheduling. For ratings purposes, gymnastics is the equal of figure skating, the highest-rated event in CBS's Winter Olympics telecasts from Albertville, France. The ratings success of gymnastics, especially, and swimming and diving is credited to their esthetic appeal to women. "Women don't have to be lured to gymnastics," said Nick Schiavone, NBC's vice president of media and marketing research. "Women seem to come to the artistry and balletic-like quality of it more easily than men." David Poltrack, CBS's senior vice president of planning and research, added: "Our surveys show gymnastics and swimming are No. 1 in interest to women. There's a fluidity and grace to both that is attractive." The beauty to a network of women's attraction to sports like gymnastics and swimming is that it enlarges the core of Olympic viewing. Despite the presence of great female athletes like Jackie Joyner-Kersee, women don't watch track and field nearly as avidly, said Poltrack. Whither track and field? Track and field events will still lead NBC to ratings victories in these Games, though not as big as those of the first week. NBC's goal all along has been to tell stories, so to maintain its ratings it must now keep telling stories, keep wrapping us in the flag and hope it is not preaching just to the converted. The seams are showing in the scheme by the executive producer, Terry O'Neil, to persuade us that everything shown on tape really happened moments ago. This "plausibly live" approach can work, but not when believability is stretched beyond reasonable limits. Bizarre time-warping occurs when a diver climbs a platform, NBC cuts to a profile and returns to see the diver still climbing. Or when Bob Costas says something happened moments before when it took place hours ago. Or when John Tesh says an event was taped earlier when everything was taped earlier. Or when NBC breaks from the U.S.A.-Unified Team women's basketball game with 2:15 remaining for about seven minutes and returns with -- 2:15 left! My old pal the Triplecast told me there were 4.6 seconds left. (I hope you plausibly believe that I wrote all this moments ago, just before you picked up this newspaper.) AIRWAVES The retrospective Tuesday night on the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich during the 1972 Summer Olympics was brilliantly produced (with film from Jordanian and German archives) and moving, as was an interview on the late-night show with the daughter of the slain fencing coach. . . . Can't remember announcers being more righteously indignant than BOB TRUMPY and AL BERNSTEIN were at the MONTEL GRIFFIN-TORSTEN MAY bout, or a more appropriate repeat usage of the word atrocious. . . . Can't remember a top announcer fawning as much over the mighty as when DICK ENBERG called JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH, the International Olympic Committee president, "Your Excellency." Fine line from the track announcer, CRAIG MASBACK: "Hitting hurdles is like driving a drag race over speed bumps." . . . Even better, from the volleyball announcer, PAUL SUNDERLAND: "The bottom line is the men's volleyball team is undefeated without hair." . . . BRUCE JENNER, on Triplecast track coverage, yesterday managed to give plugs from Visa, Reebok and his own track meet in a space of 90 seconds. But he came up with a good line on a misstep by decathlete DAVE JOHNSON: "Oops, the Reeboks slipped."

94-> U.S. Says Iraq and Iran Violated U.N. Truce Terms
Iraq flew fighter jets from its air bases on Sunday to defend against Iranian planes that bombed a guerrilla base inside Iraq, Bush Administration officials said today. An Iranian jet was shot down during the episode, but it remains unclear whether it was downed by an Iraqi jet or by ground-based anti-aircraft guns, as was initially reported. Admininstration officials, who said they were informed of the Iraqi combat flights by the United Nations, said the flights technically violated the terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war last year. Under those terms, Iraq is prohibited from flying fixed-wing military aircraft anywhere over the country. But the officials also noted that the Iranian incursion violated a United Nations cease-fire resolution that ended eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq in 1988. "Both are technically in violation" of United Nations orders, an Administration official said. "We don't know what it means. Is it an isolated incident? Everyone is looking at it, but no one is going to jump to any conclusions, or is raising any alarms about it." On Sunday, Iranian planes raided an opposition base in the Iraqi desert where rebels train against the Iranian Government. It was the most serious attack by Iran since its cease-fire with Iraq. The rebel base is 50 miles inside Iraq and 40 miles north of Baghdad. Some of the Iraqi jets that responded are based near Baghdad, officials said. Iraqi aircraft are prohibited from flying to reduce the dangers to nearby forces of the coalition that was allied against Baghdad in the gulf war and to United Nations personnel inside Iraq. The prohibition is also intended to prevent air strikes against Kurds in Iraq's north and Shiites in the south, who have have mounted armed opposition against Baghdad. In addition, the United States patrols Iraqi territory with military fighters and monitors Iraqi airspace using with reconnaissance aircraft. -------------------- Council Orders U.N. Inquiries UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Security Council asked the United Nations offices in Teheran and Baghdad today to investigate Sunday's violence and to report back immediately. "The Council members call upon all the parties concerned to resist from all acts of violence," said Simbarashe Simbanenduku Mumbengegwi of Zimbabwe, this month's Council president. The Council also asked both sides to observe the 1988 cease-fire resolution.

95-> COMPANY NEWS; A.T.& T. Subject of F.C.C. Order
Responding to complaints by rivals that A.T.& T. was not playing fair, the Federal Communications Commission ordered the company today to change what it tells customers about using their long-distance calling cards. Long-distance credit cards are now indispensable for most travelers, but one enduring effect of the breakup of the Bell System has been mass confusion in making credit card calls from pay telephones. Scores of new companies have begun operating pay telephones in recent years, and they use a wide variety of big and small long-distance carriers. As a result, even sophisticated customers have become befuddled when the pay telephone summarily rejects the card number from their own long-distance company. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company kicked off a new controversy last year when it issued a new calling card. The company boasted that its card allowed customers to make calls just by dialing zero, the phone number and their credit card number. Trouble was, this "zero plus" dialing did not work on about one-quarter of pay phones that use long-distance companies other than A.T.& T., and many customers were furious. Rivals complained that A.T.& T. was trying to put subtle pressure on pay-phone companies and hotels to sign up with A.T.& T. to avoid getting angry customers. Competitors complained that A.T.& T. had failed to properly tell customers that they could reach the network from any pay phone by dialing a toll-free number or a special code. The F.C.C. is hoping to write rules requiring all pay phones to use computer data bases that allow them to verify card numbers from any company. In the meantime, it ordered A.T.& T. to immediately begin to "educate" its customers on how to use the special codes. A company spokesman said A.T.& T. would "continue its commitment to educate customers."

96-> Quayle Distorts Democratic Platform on Gays; Oregon Bashing
To the Editor: "Behind the Hate in Oregon" by Michelangelo Signorile (Op-Ed, Sept. 3) grossly misrepresents my state. Yes, Springfield, Ore., did pass an antigay ordinance. This city has a voting population of about 32,000, with maybe 19,000 voting at that election. The population of Oregon is close to three million. The tiny percentage voting "yes" at the Springfield election would hardly justify saying that "a once tolerant, progressive state" is being transformed "into a repressive, frightful place" and that we are embarking on "ethnic cleansing." Yes, Lon Mabon and his Oregon Citizens Alliance are a vexing and narrow-minded group that has raised havoc in various ways in my state. However, they do not represent the thinking of the hundreds of thousands of fair-minded Oregonians. I oppose ballot measure 9, as do Senators Mark Hatfield and Bob Packwood. Contrary to the article, the chairman of the Oregon Republican party has publicly denounced the Oregon Citizens Alliance and ballot measure 9. I do not think it will pass. This blanket indictment of Oregon and Oregonians belongs in the same trash can with any statement that would say that all Californians are looters, throw fire bombs and are bullies -- or that all New Yorkers gang-rape helpless females in Central Park. VICTOR ATIYEH Portland, Ore., Sept. 21, 1992 The writer was Governor of Oregon from 1979 to 1987.

97-> AT THE GRASS ROOTS -- ROSS PEROT; Perot Says Democratic Surge Reduced Prospect of Victory
In halting his campaign before it ever formally began, Ross Perot explained today that the Democratic Party had become so much stronger recently that he no longer believed he could win the election at the polls in November. Instead, he said, he feared that a three-way contest would have to be decided in January by the House of Representatives, a prospect he called disruptive to the country. "When we started in early summer," Mr. Perot said at a news conference here, "there was a climate there where we could win outright. The Democratic Party has revitalized itself. They've done a brilliant job, in my opinion, in coming back." [ Excerpts from news conference, page A16. ] A Series of Setbacks But officials of the Texan's campaign said the Democrats' resurgence was only one reason for Mr. Perot's decision. In recent weeks the Perot camp has suffered unfavorable news articles about Mr. Perot's history and style as a business executive, setbacks in public opinion polls and fundamental arguments over the direction of the campaign -- discord that culminated in the resignation on Wednesday of Edward J. Rollins, the campaign co-manager. Morton H. Meyerson, one of Mr. Perot's most trusted business associates and friends, who also serves as a "senior adviser" to the campaign, said today that Mr. Perot had been surprised at the intensity of the scrutiny he was receiving and of the attacks leveled at him by political opponents. "I think he visualized the difficulties of the task," Mr. Meyerson said. "I don't think that he quite realized the tension, the pulling and tugging and the extraneous ideas that come out about a Presidential candidate. I think he thought it would be on a slightly higher plane." Disappointed Supporters Regardless of Mr. Perot's reasons or prospects for success, his announcement disappointed, even infuriated, many supporters. Volunteers at local Perot campaign headquarters across the nation, having been roused to action just weeks or months ago, said they felt betrayed. [ Page A13. ] Nor did Mr. Perot offer them much guidance on what to do next. He declined to endorse either President Bush or Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. He urged followers to continue circulating petitions to get his name onto state ballots, saying that this would let the Republican and Democratic parties know who the disaffected voters are. And he suggested that his backers might want to stay together as a voting bloc to influence the political process. "That's up to them," he said of the volunteers. "They would make that decision." If some supporters accused Mr. Perot of a failure of courage, he angrily rejected the idea. A reporter asked him what he would say to those who would consider him a quitter, a man unable to take the heat of a political campaign. "People can say anything they want to say," Mr. Perot said, affixing the questioner with a cold stare. "I am trying to do what's right for my country. Now that probably makes me odd in your eyes, but that's what I'm trying to do." A Core of Support Mr. Perot's campaign has suffered from several recent reversals, including an embarrassing appearance last weekend before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where he referred to blacks as "your people." Mr. Perot's troubles have been reflected in recent polls. A survey of 950 registered voters taken Monday and Tuesday by CBS News put him in third place in the Presidential race, with 17 percent of the respondents saying they favored his candidacy. It was the first time in months that Mr. Perot had been below 20 percent in a national poll. But despite the drop in the polls, Hamilton Jordan, who has served with Mr. Rollins as co-manager of the Perot campaign, said today that he believed that Mr. Perot could have won the Presidency outright if he had chosen to stay in the race. "This guy has at least a 20-25 percent core vote out there in a three-person race," Mr. Jordan said. Still, the race seemed to be taking its toll on Mr. Perot. "The campaign for him wasn't fun anymore," said Mr. Rollins, who was interviewed as he arrived back in Washington today. "It was tough, and his reasons given this morning had a lot to do with it. "He saw the potential of winning diminishing day by day, and he didn't want to run the kind of campaign he would have had to run to win." 'Our Only Hope' Perot supporters greeted the news with dismay. "I'm devastated," said Sandra Rafferty of Laguna Hills, Calif., an accountant for a country club. "Perot was our only hope. Everyone I talk to isn't going to vote." The cynicism over politics as usual that fueled the Perot drive could still be heard today in the voices of his disappointed backers. "It doesn't make a difference who gets in," said Richard Peterson, 46 years old, of Phoenix. "They say what they'll do and they get in and they can't do it." Mr. Meyerson said that Mr. Perot had been thinking about leaving the race for several days. Last Friday, Mr. Meyerson and Thomas W. Luce 3d, the campaign's chairman met with Mr. Jordan and Mr. Rollins, who said the campaign effort was foundering. Both Mr. Jordan and Mr. Rollins urged that steps like an immediate advertising campaign were needed. Mr. Perot rejected that advice, prompting Mr. Rollins's resignation. But, Mr. Perot denied today that the internal differences were behind his decision to step aside. "Insignificant," Mr. Perot said of the campaign turmoil. "It was nothing." At Least $10 Million Spent According to aides, Mr. Perot made his final decision to withdraw Wednesday night when he met at his home with Mr. Meyerson and Mr. Luce. Mr. Meyerson said he did not try to dissuade his friend. "What I basically told him," Mr. Meyerson said, "was there are two choices: it's go all out to win and press it to the wall or stop." Mr. Perot estimated today that he had spent $10 million on his campaign. That represents a tiny fraction of his wealth, the equivalent of only a few weeks of interest earned on his estimated holdings of more than $2.5 billion. Still, he may have saved himself $90 million or so by stopping his campaign now, since he was often reported to have said he would spend $100 million to win the White House. Precise figures on how much of his own money Mr. Perot spent will not be known for a few weeks, when he files additional reports on his expenses with the Federal Election Commission. The latest figures, through May 31, showed he had contributed $3.2 million out of a total of $4.1 million received by his election organization. Those figures do not include the money spent on salaries, travel and other expenses in June and July, as well as the separation agreements he reportedly signed with Mr. Rollins and others who abandoned Mr. Perot in the campaign's final hours. With Mr. Perot's sudden announcement, telephone lines manned by volunteers were flooded by calls from supporters around the country, expressing consternation and anger in addition to hope that Mr. Perot would reconsider his decision. "The phones have not stopped since the announcement on CNN," said Charline E. McClary, a volunteer who was fielding telephone calls at the campaign headquarters here. Several volunteers said they would continue efforts to place Mr. Perot on the ballot in their states, and some talked gamely of starting a draft-Perot movement. But Mr. Meyerson said it was his guess that Mr. Perot would seek to remove his name from the ballot in those states where he has already qualified. "Why am I disappointed in Ross Perot?" said Dick Rose, vice chairman of the Perot volunteer effort in Arizona. "I thought he had more guts than to drop out this early." Mr. Perot's announcement sent shock waves from Madison Square Garden to the Wyoming ranch of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, where the President was fishing. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Perot after his announcement. "On a very personal basis," Mr. Bush said, "I congratulated him. I told him I understood how difficult a decision it must have been. I told him that he had really and truly energized an awful lot of people." Mr. Clinton, in a written statement released by his campaign, said: "I was moved by Ross Perot's announcement today. His decision in no way minimizes the remarkable effect that he and his supporters have had on this country."

98-> U.S., Condemning Fujimori, Cuts Aid to Peru
The Bush Administration today branded President Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of the Peruvian Congress and the detention of politicans "unjustified" and "unconstitutional" attacks on democracy, and suspended all aid except for humanitarian assistance. Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who arrived in Peru on Sunday for talks on a range of issues, today canceled an appointment with Mr. Fujimori and was refused permission to see the President of the ousted Senate, the State Department said. But Mr. Aronson was able to meet with the Foreign Minister and the Government's coordinator for human rights. For the Administration, which points to its role in fostering progress toward democracy, the establishment of free-market economies and the end of civil strife in the hemisphere, the unexpected reversion to military rule in Peru is a setback. It follows by barely six months the military overthrow of the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti and by an attempted coup in Venezuela in January. Emergency Meeting of O.A.S. "Those who have been applauding democracy so hard have not stopped to pay attention to the fact that its roots are very shallow," said Robert Pastor, the National Security Council's Latin America specialist in the Carter Administration. "There is a connection between Haiti, Venezuela and Peru," said Mr. Pastor, now professor of political science at Emory University. "The United States needs to take a leadership position in the Organization of American States to solve the Haiti crisis once and for all and establish a safety net for democracy. The time has come for the O.A.S. to pass beyond collective rhetoric to collective action on democracy." The O.A.S. called an emergency meeting tonight, but it was unclear if there would be any action. Some diplomats suggested that sanctions against Peru might be discussed. A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said today, "While we recognize that President Fujimori inherited severe problems, we believe that these problems do not justify, nor can they be resolved though, unconstitutional means." "The United States calls for the full and immediate restoration of constitutional democracy, which must include immediate freedom for those detained, and full respect for human rights, immediate restoration of a free and independent press and civil liberties, and immediate resotration of independent legislative and judicial branches of government," Mr. Boucher said. The Administration had requested $275 million in economic and military aid for Peru for fiscal 1992, an increase of nearly $40 million over the 1991 appropriation. In Congress, where there has been reluctance to give military aid to Peru because of the human rights record of the Peruvian Army in its encounters with leftist guerrillas or its conduct of the war against cocaine growers, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, announced that he would introduce legislation Tuesday cutting off all nonhumanitarian aid. In a statement, Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Fujimori's action a "brutal mugging of Peruvian freedom." 'Rapidly Descending Spiral' Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on the hemisphere, agreed that Mr. Fujimori's action was condemnable but had to be understood in the light of the "rapidly deteriorating" Peruvian political situation. "Peru is on a rapidly descending spiral, with authority increasingly exercised by narco-traffickers and Shining Path guerrillas," Mr. Torricelli said in an interview. "Increasingly, the legal authorities in Peru are not in control of their own country." Mr. Torricelli said Latin American and Caribbean nations that have been reluctant to take action against the military in Haiti should learn that "not taking a take strong stand against a coup anywhere opens each and every government in the region to a similar problem." Richard Feinberg, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum for hemispheric leaders, said many of Peru's problems derived from a 20-year-old economic debacle that has not narrowed gaps in the hemisphere's most divided society -- "the colonial enclaves of the upper-class suburbs in a sea of indigenous mestizo people." But there are also wider political issues to be considered, he added. "With notable exception of Mexico," Mr. Feinberg said in an interview, "parliamentary institutions and political parties are lacking in legitimacy in Latin America. Politicians are seen as old, tired and corrupt."

99-> YACHT RACING; Japan in Danger of Not Qualifying for Finals
The calamities that plagued the Japanese crew during the semifinals of the America's Cup challenger trials last week are likely to seal the team's fate on the race course Tuesday. If Japan's Nippon syndicate fails to win its match against New Zealand, the team won't have enough points to make it to the finals. "We've dug ourselves in pretty deep holes this week," said Chris Dickson, Nippon's skipper, after racing Sunday. "And it's getting very dark down there." The Nippon crew has one victory and four losses in the Louis Vuitton challengers' semifinals. Italy and New Zealand are tied for first, each with four victories. France is third, with three. There are three races left in the nine-day series, which will send two boats onto the challenger finals, to begin April 19. Broken Rudder for Nippon Last week, misfortune rode the rail of the Japanese boat. Nippon broke its rudder in one race, collided with the French yacht in another, and was forced to take a racing penalty when victory seemed imminent against New Zealand. In the most dramatic mishap, the Nippon sailors were forced to jettison a cracked boom as their only hope of finishing a race against Italy. Fueled by a $40 million budget, the Nippon Challenge has the support of 30 Japanese companies, and some of the best technology in the world. Four years ago, Nippon organizers hired Dickson, a New Zealand yachtsman, to guide the team through its cup effort, the first in Japanese history. With no more than a handful of sailors to choose from, Dickson placed ads in Japanese newspapers asking athletes to apply -- no sailing background necessary. The novice Japanese crew learned to sail on used America's Cup boats, and gained experience that was put to its greatest test last week.

101-> BASEBALL; Victory Comes With Thrills and Spills
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning, Manager Buck Showalter of the Yankees stopped the game tape in his v.c.r. and turned his television set to Showtime. He had been watching countless hours of film underlining the Yankees' recent slide toward the bottom of the American League East, and he had decided to switch the channel, looking for relief. In those wee hours, Showalter found his escape in the form of one of those late-night movies with unrecognizable actors and a title that's hard to recall. Last night, for seven innings, he thought he had found more escapism at Yankee Stadium. After losing 10 of 12 games to slide 16 games from first place and 10 under .500, the Yankees produced a 7-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox but no real relaxation for Showalter, who had to sweat out a dismal bullpen performance that only reinforced the problems the Yankees have been having. "I had been watching film up to 2 A.M.," Showalter said, trying to explain his late-night viewing habits. "I figured I should watch something unrealistic. I was tired of looking at reality." Reality for the Yankees is a record (50-59) no better than that of last season after 109 games, despite the addition of such players as Danny Tartabull and Melido Perez, despite all the talk of improvement and the team's encouragingly strong start. That kind of reality, though, was blessedly absent for the most part last night. Winless since July 5, Scott Sanderson pitched seven shutout innings to move his record above .500 (9-8) and drop his earned run average below 5.00 (4.76) for the first time since July 22. Bernie Williams backed Sanderson in the fifth inning with his first homer since being recalled on July 31, and Matt Nokes hit his team-leading 15th home run to add more excitement in the seventh. It was only a frustratingly bad relief performance by Tim Burke -- one that cost the Yanks five runs (albeit one unearned) in one-third inning of work -- that blemished this night. "We made it interesting -- I should say the Red Sox made it interesting," Showalter said. "I'm concerned that we have not been pitching like we were earlier in the year." Later, when asked how tough it was to watch the bullpen perform, Showalter said: "It's not a whole lot of fun. It's nothing that the players and the pitcher that are giving it up aren't feeling, as well." There was hope in the dugout -- hope that this one would be a much-needed wide-open victory -- as the game rolled into the eighth inning with the Yanks up, 7-0. Then Sanderson sat down with some nagging pain in his shoulder, Burke trotted out of the bullpen, and everything started falling apart. In an agonizingly long 20 minutes, Burke gave up three hits and one walk and let loose a wild pitch for what turned into a five-run inning. His much-booed outing wasn't helped by a rare first-base error by Don Mattingly, who bobbled a Phil Plantier grounder for his second miscue of the season -- his first error in 819 chances. To make matters worse, relievers Greg Cadaret and John Habyan failed to salvage the inning for Burke, who left the game with the bases loaded. "Our bullpen's been so good for so long that it's unusual to see them struggle," said Sanderson, who insisted that his shoulder problem was of no major concern. "What's happening now is more the exception than the rule." Sanderson, of course, was the beneficiary of great run support, most notably from Nokes, who singled in Dion James for the team's fourth run, in the fifth inning, and then launched a three-run shot into the right-field bleachers on his next at-bat to close out the Yankees' scoring. "Seven to nothing would have been a nice game for Sam Militello to watch," said Showalter, speaking of the rookie pitcher who was called up to replace the injured Curt Young yesterday. The Yankees placed Young on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring and purchased Militello's contract from Class AAA Columbus. INSIDE PITCH SAM MILITELLO, who was 12-2 with the Columbus Clippers, will make his major league debut tomorrow against JOE HESKETH. . . . ROBERTO KELLY was missing from last night's starting lineup, but Manager BUCK SHOWALTER said the move was made purely to give Kelly a day's rest.

103-> Dow Off 23.10, to 3,368.88, on Jobless Report
The stock market declined broadly yesterday after the Government reported yet another rise in initial claims for unemployment benefits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.10 points, to 3,368.88. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,180 to 549 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board came to 200.4 million shares, up from 175.9 million in the previous session. Expecting Slow Recovery The market reflected expectations for a slow economic recovery. Recent economic data show little threat from inflation, which should help stocks, but offer little hope for enough economic growth to stimulate investors. Reaffirming that sentiment, the Labor Department said yesterday that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose to 424,000 for the week ending May 2. It was the second straight weekly rise. Some economists had forecast claims at 410,000, down from 415,000 in the previous week. In addition, many investors were apparently putting off buying stocks, speculating that the Federal Reserve might ease rates again as insurance against a backslide in the economy. Such a cut could help stock prices. Another negative for the market is that while the Dow set a record closing high of 3,397.58 on Monday, it only briefly passed the 3,400 mark. And other, broader market indexes have not matched the Dow's performance, which adds to the downward pull, market analysts said. Gains for Inventories Even the good news of better-than-expected business inventories did not support the market. The Commerce Department said yesterday that inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent, above the one-tenth of 1 percent that economists had forecast. The Nasdaq composite index slid 5.92 points, to 576.46. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.72 points, to 227.72, while the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.96 points, to 391.79. The most actively traded issue on the Big Board was Advanced Micro Devices, down 1 7/8, to 15 5/8, after a rival company said it would cut prices on an advanced computer chip. Other active issues included the Gap, down 3 5/8, to 37 1/4, after analysts lowered the company's 1993 earnings estimates, and the Limited, down 1 1/8, to 21, on poor earnings, released earlier this week.

105-> Profits Off 82% at Genentech
Genentech Inc., the biotechnology concern, today reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings primarily because of increased research and development spending. But the decline also reflected a drop in sales of the company's blood-clot-dissolving drug, Activase, which was shown in recent trials to be no more effective than a competing drug, Streptokinase, which sells for about one-tenth as much. Genentech's first-quarter earnings were $3.5 million, or 3 cents a share, down 82 percent from $19.4 million, or 17 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales fell 3 percent, to $129 million from $132 million. Genentech shares gained 37.5 cents today, closing at $27.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Roche Holdings A.G., the Swiss pharmaceutical company, owns a majority of Genentech shares. "Genentech is investing approximately 50 percent of 1992 revenues in R.&D. to meet the goal of having three new products -- and new indications for existing products -- approved by 1995," G. Kirk Raab, Genentech's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Increased R.&D. spending is necessary largely to fund the clinical trials needed to test the many promising products in our pipeline." Sales of Genentech's Protropin, a human growth hormone used to treat dwarfism in children, increased 10.3 percent, to $48.4 million, in the quarter, but sales of Activase, the anti-clot drug, fell 20 percent, to $44.5 million.

106-> Yugoslav Refugee Crisis Europe's Worst Since 40's
The exodus resulting from war and suffering in the former Yugoslavia is presenting Europe with its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, prompting urgent appeals from United Nations refugee officials for a political solution. Roughly 2.3 million people have fled from towns and villages in the former federation of six republics since the country began to disintegrate in June 1991, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Most of the displaced people are from Croatia or from Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose moves toward independence have met with fierce resistance from Serbian fighters backed by the Yugoslav Army. Another 850,000 people are trapped in their homes in four Bosnian towns besieged by Serbian nationalist forces -- Sarajevo, Bihac, Tuzla and Gorazde, the United Nations agency says. The High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata of Japan, has called an international conference of Foreign and Deputy Foreign Ministers for next Wednesday at her headquarters in Geneva to galvanize support for the agency's relief work and to push Government leaders, particularly in Europe, to intensify their search for a political solution. "The burden on the host countries is becoming unbearable," Mrs. Ogata said in her call for the conference, and "the plight of the displaced is increasingly desperate." Of the 2.3 million refugees, more than 400,000 have fled to countries outside the former Yugoslavia's borders. Germany has admitted the largest number, 200,000, followed by Hungary, with 60,000; Austria, with 50,000, and Sweden, with 44,000, according to unofficial government estimates provided to the United Nations agency. More than 1.8 million refugees are living precariously within countries of the former Yugoslav federation: roughly 630,000 in Croatia, including areas of the republic designated as protected refugee zones by the United Nations; nearly 600,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 375,000 in Serbia, and smaller numbers in Slovenia, Montenegro and Macedonia. Officials at the refugee commissioner's headquarters view the Yugoslav catastrophe as a chilling reminder of World War II and its aftermath, when millions of people were uprooted by military destruction or by policies of persecution under Hitler and Stalin and countries they controlled. The mission of the High Commissioner for Refugees, codified before the war and again in a 1951 Geneva Convention, is to extend protection to individuals or families who are fleeing persecution for their nationality, religion or political beliefs. Most of the people displaced in the former Yugoslavia "are the very refugees the 1951 Geneva Convention was written to protect," Mrs. Ogata wrote in an article in today's issue of the German weekly Die Zeit. "The vast majority of these refugees have been brutally driven from their homes by a reprehensible practice known as 'ethnic cleansing.' " The term "ethnic cleansing" or "ethnic purification" has frequently been invoked by the Serbian nationalists who are driving Croats and Muslims from their homes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 1950's, the United Nations refugee agency's focus had gradually shifted away from Europe to cope with problems in Africa, Asia and Latin America as people in those regions were uprooted by civil wars, political upheaval after decolonization, or political repression. But at its current level of activity, the refugee agency expects to spend $150 million of its outlay of $1 billion this year in the former Yugoslavia alone, said the High Commissioner's chief of staff, Soren Jessen-Petersen. "In Europe!" Mr. Jessen-Petersen said as if in disbelief. "Europe has once again become a main center of U.N.H.C.R.!" The purpose of the conference next Wednesday is to awaken governments to the frightening scale of the Yugoslav refugee problem, and find a way to meet immediate needs, Mr. Jessen-Petersen said today in an interview. "Without a political settlement, we may have two million refugees on our hands when winter comes," he said. "By October we won't know what to do with these people." Winters in the Balkan region are severe, and most of the refugees are staying in unheated quarters and lack winter clothing. Refugee officials fear that many of the 2.3 million refugees may be prevented from returning to their homes even in the long run as ethnic Serbs and Croats insist on holding on to their territorial gains. "This may present us a permanent refugee problem," Mr. Jessen-Petersen said.

107-> BARCELONA: TRACK & FIELD; Kenyans Make It A Steeple Sweep
It was a memorable moment for African men as three Kenyan distance runners swept the medals in the 3,000-meter steeplechase tonight. Memorable, that is, until two African women -- one black and one white -- upstaged them 25 minutes later. Yet the results of the women's 10,000 meters merely confirmed that this was Africa's night in the Olympics. Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia became the first African woman to win a distance track medal, and South Africa's Elana Meyer, who finished second, won her country's first track and field medal in 32 years. And in the end, it was the victory lap that mattered as much as the result of the race. Tulu may have sprinted away from Meyer in the last lap to take the gold, but the two women, wrapped in their flags, seemed to symbolize the new Africa of multiracial sports as they circled the stadium together. 5,000 Meters Next for Tulu "I am very happy since I am the first African woman to win the 10,000 meters," the 20-year-old Tulu said at a post-race news conference. "Now it is my intent to try the 5,000 meters." Meyer, though, seemed aware that she was making history -- at least in South Africa, which is participating in its first Olympics since 1960. "When I got on the track, I knew I was doing this for the real South Africa, for the whole of South Africa," she said. "It was an amazing feeling." The 26-year-old Meyer was not in fact the first South African medal-winner at the Barcelona Games. Earlier in the day, Wayne Ferreira and Piet Norval won a silver in the men's tennis doubles. But Meyer also made the point today that she and Tulu "did this for African women." African women are only now beginning to emerge as a new force in track and field, after years of cultural attitudes that discouraged athletic participation. In the 1970's, Kenya's married women were not allowed to compete, shorts were controversial and hurdles were out of the question. Even now, Hassiba Boulmerka of Algeria, the world champion at 1,500 meters, who will compete in the women's 1,500 final Saturday, has had to overcome Muslim strictures about her public appearance. First Clean Sweep The Kenyans, who have won five of the last seven Olympic gold medals in the steeplechase, had never before recorded a clean sweep. The three winners -- Mathew Birir, Patrick Sang and William Mutwol -- had planned it that way. "We worked as a team," Mutwol said. "We knew any one of the three of us could win the gold. We kept ahead and watched out for anyone coming up on us. Then, in the last lap, it was every man for himself." Birir took the gold in 8 minutes 8.84 seconds, crossing the line with a big smile across his face even though his left foot had been punctured by a spike earlier in the race. Sang followed him in 8:09.55 and Mutwol came third in 8:10.74. In the women's 10,000, it was Meyer who decided to break with the leader Liz McColgan and the other crowd of runners after 6,000 meters. But Tulu immediately followed and never left her shadow. At one point, Meyer even invited Tulu to pass her and set her own pace, but she declined, preferring to await her moment. The long-striding Ethiopian clocked 31 minutes 6.02 seconds against 31:11.75 for Meyer. The American distance runner Lynn Jennings, from Princeton, N.J., came in third with a time of 31:19.89, becoming the first American woman to win an Olympic track medal in a race longer than 800 meters. McColgan, one of the pre-race favorites, finished fifth. "I am as happy as a pig in mud on a cross-country course," Jennings said with a laugh.

108-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Presidential Politics Adds To Fall in Gold and Silver
Gold and silver prices fell yesterday because the decision by Ross Perot not to run for President as an independent candidate reduced the uncertainty surrounding the Presidential race. "The market's gut reaction to the Perot news was bearish," one trader said. "The feeling seemed to be that with him out of the race, Bush's chances of staying in the White House increase, and he's seen as less threatening to the economy than Clinton." Gov. Bill Clinton won the Democratic Presidential nomination on Wednesday. Precious metals have often been seen as a haven during political and economic uncertainty. Gold also weakened yesterday because the dollar fell after Germany's central bank tightened monetary policy by raising its discount rate three-quarters of a point, to 8.75 percent. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery in August fell $1.50, to $353.20 an ounce, and silver for September dropped 3.2 cents, to $3.928 an ounce. Platinum prices also tumbled amid signs of revived diplomatic efforts in South Africa and a general feeling that the rise in platinum tied to political unrest may have been overdone. One analyst said involvement by the United Nations in racial turmoil in South Africa, the world's leading producer of platinum, and the possibility that Cyrus R. Vance, former Secretary of State, might act as a mediator, could head off a general strike scheduled for Aug. 3. Platinum for October tumbled $6.30, to $383.50 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices closed slightly firmer after a mixed showing that reflected a dearth of market-moving news. Crude oil for August gained 8 cents, to $21.79 a barrel, after trading as low as $21.65, and gasoline for August advanced 1.04 cents, to 60.95 cents a gallon. Some investors bought gasoline contracts against sales of heating oil, causing August heating oil to fall 0.22 cent, to 60.12 cents a gallon.

109-> Army General Is Implicated In Colombian Prison Escape
Senior Government officials here say they are increasingly convinced that a decorated army general entrusted with the prison transfer of Colombia's most notorious drug baron, Pablo Escobar, was either bought off or intimidated into cooperating in his escape Wednesday. In an interview, an official involved in Colombia's anti-drug operations today gave the first detailed description of the the 22 hours that elapsed between a presidential order to transfer Mr. Escobar and the confirmation of his escape. Officials now say they believe that Gen. Gustavo Pardo Aniza, commander of local army units assigned to take over Mr. Escobar's prison, may have helped him flee dressed in soldier's clothing or hidden in a military vehicle. Initial reports, inspired by a call to a radio station by a nephew of Mr. Escobar, said the prisoner had fled via a secret tunnel. An official who helped plan the prison operation said, "The main person responsible is General Pardo; I cannot imagine any other possibility. Pardo says, 'let's keep looking for a tunnel, I am sure that it exists,' but we have seen no evidence of anything like that." Officials said that General Pardo may have been bribed or threatened into cooperating. He has not been charged with any crime. Officials said they decided to move Mr. Escobar from his specially built mountaintop prison to a military compound after months of monitoring his criminal activity -- including directing drug transactions and ordering executions -- behind prison walls. They said intelligence reports suggested the prisoner was plotting an escape. On Tuesday morning, officials say, General Pardo was ordered to secure the area of the prison at Envigado and move in by late afternoon to take control. But when the deputy minister of justice and the deputy director of prisons arrived that evening from the capital, no military action had been taken. Soon afterward, when it appeared that Mr. Escobar and his fellow inmates had taken over the prison, the two Government envoys entered the compound unescorted to persuade Mr. Escobar to surrender peacefully, a senior official said. Instead, they were taken hostage. When President Cesar Gaviria learned late Tuesday of the capture, he ordered a Special Forces team from the capital to go to Envigado to free them. Throughout the evening, telephone messages came from Mr. Escobar seeking to negotiate, but officials said Mr. Gaviria rejected all discussions. Officials said the arrival of the Special Forces was delayed at least two hours, until about 3 A.M., by the commander of the Colombian Air Force, who has since resigned, and is also under investigation for his possible role in the escape. Just before 6 A.M. on Wednesday, the order was given from the capital to the elite forces to storm Mr. Escobar's prison immediately. An hour and a half later, presidential advisers learned that this order too had been ignored. By 8 A.M., when a direct order was given to the major in charge of the elite unit, bypassing General Pardo, the prison was quickly taken in a struggle that left one person dead. Mr. Escobar and nine associates were already gone. Officials say they were repeatedly kept in the dark about General Pardo's failure to follow orders by a need to maintain radio silence about the operation. During his interrogation, officials say the general offered only weak excuses, ranging from rainfall to power failures, to explain why his 500-man company never moved on the prison. Suspecting further complicity among army officers, a senior official said that an elite police force, known for its long blood feud with the Medellin Cartel, had taken over the investigation and search for Mr. Escobar. Official say they believe he remains in the general area of the prison.

110-> U.S. Rejects Dinkins's Plea for Old Burial Site
The Federal Government has rejected Mayor David N. Dinkins's request to stop excavation on part of the site of a 34-story office tower being built over a Colonial-era cemetery for black New Yorkers in lower Manhattan. The regional head of the General Services Administration, William J. Diamond, told the Mayor that to stop the project now "would jeopardize the fragile human remains which are no longer sealed" under layers of earth deep below the street. 400 Remains Taken The Mayor, who made the request in a letter to Mr. Diamond that City Hall made public earlier in the week, disputed Mr. Diamond's contention yesterday, saying any danger to remains that have not been disinterred could be eliminated by a new layer of dirt. Mr. Dinkins also accused the agency of pressing ahead with excavation in violation of an agreement worked out in January with the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. "That was not to have taken place," the Mayor said of the continued removal of remains. "That was not the agreement." The agency says that about 400 remains have been taken from the site, 300 from beneath where the main portion of the building will be and 100 from beneath a planned pavilion at one corner. The Mayor refused yesterday to be drawn into speculation on what he might do if the General Services Administration does not stop work at the cemetery site, between Broadway and Elk, Reade and Duane streets. "Let's see what he says," the Mayor said, referring to Mr. Diamond. Mr. Dinkins said that the agreement required Mr. Diamond's agency to file an archeological research plan by Jan. 10. "Not only is this plan six months overdue," the Mayor said yesterday in a second letter to Mr. Diamond, "but you now inform me that its completion will require yet another three months." But Mr. Diamond's letter said that the project was in compliance with the agreement. "Therefore," he said, "there is no basis for discontinuance of ongoing excavations." He also said that to stop work would not be cost-effective. "Work cannot be suspended for any appreciable amount of time without major design and construction changes to the work in progress," Mr. Diamond said.

114-> BARCELONA: BOXING; In a Blur, Cuban Ends a U.S. Boxer's Quest
Thumbed in the left eye, flyweight Timothy Austin of the United States boxing team walked away from Cuba's Raul Gonzalez, took a right on the back of his headgear and a standing-eight count, then accepted a left-right-left battering before the referee, Kishen Narsi of India, stopped their Olympic bout today after only 64 seconds of the first round. "I could've continued," Austin said later, holding an ice pack on his left eye. "But the referee made a good decision. He saw I was squinting. My vision was blurry. I didn't want to get caught by a punch I couldn't see." 9 Cubans in Finals Cuba now has boxers in 9 of the 12 finals that will determine gold and silver medals Saturday and Sunday. In addition to Gonzalez, the Cubans advancing today were superheavyweight Roberto Balado, light-middleweight Juan Lemus and light-welterweight Hector Vinent. Balado and Lemus are the reigning world amateur champions in their divisions. Along with other semifinal losers, Austin will be awarded a bronze medal, but his elimination left only two American boxers in the finals: lightweight Oscar De La Hoya and middleweight Chris Byrd. The three United States medals will be its fewest since the three it won in 1956 at Melbourne, Australia, when heavyweight Pete Rademacher won a gold before turning pro and becoming the first boxer to fight for the heavyweight title in his first pro bout, a sixth-round knockout loss to world champion Floyd Patterson. In their Saturday bouts, Byrd, the youngest of United States Coach Joe Byrd's five sons, will oppose another Cuban, Ariel Hernandez, while De La Hoya goes against Marco Rudolph of Germany. For the tournament, the United States has a 20-10 won-lost record, compared with 39-3 for Cuba (3-0 against Americans). If the Cubans were to win all nine of their finals, they would match the United States' gold-medal total in 1984 at Los Angeles. That year, Cuba observed the Soviet bloc's boycott. According to Austin, he was bending down when Gonzalez "came up with a punch, I wasn't sure which hand." Asked why he turned away, he said, "Because of the thumb in the eye; it hurt." He also was hoping that turning away would help restore the vision in his eye. "It's happened to me before and I got my vision back," he said. "This time I didn't." Half an hour after the fight ended, Austin reported that "when I look from side to side or down below, it hurts." According to the team physician, Dr. John Lehtinen, there was "no damage" to Austin's eye but its condition will be reevaluated. Austin's hometown coach, Joe Falcone of the Northside Boxing Club in Cincinnati, complained about his own absence in the corner. "To me," Falcone said, "it proves one thing: every boxer needs his natural coach. Look at Chris Byrd. He's got his natural coach, his father, in his corner. If I had been in Timothy's corner, he would've been a lot calmer coming up, he would've warmed up better." Asked about Falcone's theory, Austin said he "felt comfortable" with Byrd in his corner but had trouble discussing personal matters with the team coach. According to Byrd, Austin "was too warm, we had to cool him down" before Gonzalez began peppering him with punches. Spanish Fighter Advances Spanish featherweight Faustino Reyes, with King Juan Carlos watching, advanced to the finals by outpointing Ramazi Paliani of the Unified Team, 14-9. If Reyes were to defeat Andreas Tews of Germany on Sunday, it would be the host nation's first Olympic boxing gold medal. In Balado's 15-1 battering of Brian Nielsen of Denmark, the Cuban all but knocked the tattoos off the biceps of his burly foe. But at the final bell, Nielsen playfully swatted Balado across the back of his blue trunks and later playfully toed him in the groin. In addition to the nine Cubans and two Americans in the 12 finals, Germany has three while Ireland and Nigeria each has two. Spain, Canada, the Unified Team, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and North Korea each has one.

115-> Ex-Prosecutor Asserts U.S. Frustrated B.C.C.I. Inquiry
A former Federal prosecutor testified today that his efforts to pursue an investigation against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International were delayed and frustrated by his superiors at the Justice Department, raising further questions about the Government's handling of the case. Dexter Lehtinen, the United States Attorney in Miami until January, said that in 1991 when his office was building a tax case against B.C.C.I., it needed a judge's order to obtain B.C.C.I. documents in about 10 foreign countries. To take that step, attorneys in the field must receive approval from the Justice Department in Washington. "But we never got permission and it was never explained," Mr. Lehtinen said. The Justice Department said any delays in the case were the result of its shortcomings. James A. Bruton, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the tax division, said that when his staff examined the case they found "serious legal and factual questions." Mr. Lehtinen, according to Justice officials, was an outspoken and controversial investigator, who was never nominated for Senate confirmation so that he remained an Acting United States Attorney during his tenure from 1988 to January, when he resigned. Mr. Lehtinen was just one of several witnesses who appeared in a marathon session before the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations. Other witnesses included a representative from Abu Dhabi, the London-based liquidator of the bank, the chief counsel of the Federal Reserve, the chief of enforcement for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and executives of the big Washington bank that B.C.C.I. had secretly owned, First American Bankshares. During the daylong hearing, the witnesses disclosed several new details about the B.C.C.I. scandal. For example, John Stone, the chief of enforcement for the F.D.I.C., estimated that the losses from the failure of the Independence Bank of Encino, Calif., another American institution that had been secretly owned by B.C.C.I., would be $130 million to $140 million. Since all the bank's deposits are federally insured, the Independence failure could be costly to taxpayers. Citing the loss estimate, Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate subcommittee, said, "That puts a lie to the often-quoted statement that B.C.C.I. has not cost taxpayers any money." However, Mr. Stone of the F.D.I.C. said the Government hoped to be able to dip into the more than $500 million that B.C.C.I. forfeited in December as part of a plea agreement with the United States, to cover most or all of the cost of the failure of Independence. Big Price Difference J. Virgil Mattingly Jr., the Fed's general counsel, said that one of the main items his investigators were pursuing was an explanation for the huge difference between the $225 million that First American Bankshares paid to acquire the National Bank of Georgia, when the deal was announced in 1985, and the roughly $90 million First American got from its recent sale of the Georgia bank. The deal is suspect, Mr. Mattingly said, and the huge price gap cannot be explained by declining real estate values or other market changes over those years. "The information available to us indicates that B.C.C.I. was behind the transaction, and that B.C.C.I. substantially benefited from the transaction, he said. The extent to which two former American executives, the Washington lawyer Clark M. Clifford and his protege, Robert A. Altman, were involved in the talks on buying the Georgia bank could well figure in the continuing investigation of the two men. Both Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The role of Abu Dhabi, the main B.C.C.I. shareholder, was examined during the hearing. Mr. Mattingly said that the Abu Dhabi authorities had provided access to some documents and individuals to American investigators. But about 30 former bank officials remain under house arrest in Abu Dhabi and key documents there remain off-limits. To truly uncover the dimensions of the fraud and its motivations, Mr. Mattingly said that investigators at the Fed, the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Justice Department must have "access to the people in Abu Dhabi and all the documents in Abu Dhabi." Portrayed as Victim For his part, Ahmed al-Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and a member of the emirate's working group on B.C.C.I., said he hoped that agreement would be reached soon to give American investigators broader access to people and documents in Abu Dhabi. Mr. Sayegh portrayed Abu Dhabi as the biggest victim in the B.C.C.I., having lost some $3 billion, and he pointed out that the huge fraud had been going on long before the emirate became the majority shareholder. The former United States Attorney in Miami, Mr. Lehtinen, did not directly accuse his superiors in the Justice Department of misconduct. But he did tell a story of inexplicable foot-dragging, viewed from his perspective, during 1991 when his office was pursuing a tax case against B.C.C.I. He also said that in late August 1991 he received a call from a senior Justice Department official in Washington, who said he was calling on behalf of William Barr, then Acting Attorney General, and asked him not to seek an indictment in the case. Mr. Lehtinen termed the call "very peculiar and very odd." The Miami United States Attorney's office eventually proceeded with a scaled-down case, and got an indictment in November.

116-> ALLIES TO DISCUSS MILITARY SOLUTION TO IRAQ STANDOFF
Iraq's refusal to disclose records of its weapons programs prompted more calls for military confrontation today. United Nations inspectors left Baghdad empty-handed, and the Bush Administration hinted at a renewed bombing campaign against Iraqi targets. But both the scope of any action and the breadth of international support for it remained in question. Administration officials said they expected to press through the weekend at the United Nations for a consensus on a military response among the world's major powers. In New York, a senior United Nations official, Rolf Ekeus, appeared pessimistic as five members of the inspection team flew out of Baghdad today. Their departure for Bahrain ended an 18-day effort by United Nations officials to enter an Agriculture Ministry building where Iraq is suspected of hiding records on its ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs. Stern but Imprecise Warnings "We cannot accept that this matter drags on indefinitely," Mr. Ekeus said. "The time component is now so slender for everyone." Similar stern but imprecise warnings came from Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary. Under a United Nations resolution that ended the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, Iraq is ordered to grant United Nations inspectors unconditional access to all records of its efforts to build missiles, nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has regularly balked at the resolution, and argued in its latest refusal that the international inspectors were spies who were seeking to enter a civilian building, not a military one. Negotiations between Mr. Ekeus and the Iraqis to gain access to the building have so far been fruitless. Push for an Ultimatum The United States, Britain and France favor giving Iraq an ultimatum to surrender its weapons files or face armed punishment. But a senior Administration official said this evening that it was still unclear whether such an ultimatum could gain the assent of all five permanent members of the Security Council. This afternoon, Iraq's delegate to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, said in New York that Baghdad appeared ready to provide a "very positive" response on Saturday morning in negotiations on access to the ministry building. The Bush Administration nevertheless issued ominous-sounding warnings of military action against Baghdad throughout the day and strove to build a public case for an attack on Iraq should the standoff continue. Mr. Bush, campaigning in Ohio and Missouri at midday, canceled a weekend trip to his Maine home and ordered his national security aides to Camp David for a review of military options. Mr. Fitzwater said the President would meet on Saturday morning with his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and General Powell. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is in Manila this weekend, attending a meeting of Asian nations. Mr. Bush said he had acted at the behest of Mr. Scowcroft, "to be sure we have every opportunity that's available to the United States on the table and discussed." Traveling with Mr. Bush, Mr. Fitzwater said today that the White House continued to see "a pattern of defiance" in Iraq by President Saddam Hussein and his Government to the United Nations resolutions. "The pattern of defiance and the widespread nature of the violation of the resolutions suggest this may be a more difficult situation, and we are prepared to act accordingly to enforce the resolutions," Mr. Fitzwater said. And General Powell warned Mr. Hussein that the United States would not restrain itself should a decision to use force be made. "It will be our rules, not his," he said at the residence of the French Ambassador to the United States, where he was being awarded the French Legion of Honor. His French counterpart at the reception, Adm. Jacques Lanxade, added that the French military was prepared to do what the politicians ask. Willingness to Wait Unclear It was unclear how long Washington and its allies were prepared to wait for Iraqi compliance before beginning military action. Some officials suggested that renewed bombing could begin as early as next week. But General Powell cautioned today against assuming that a new war was imminent or inevitable, and he seemed to suggest that an Iraqi agreement to let inspectors into the ministry building would by itself defuse much of the crisis. "What we hope will take place," he said, "is that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime will come to its senses." But even that compromise could prove a bitter pill for the Administration, because the departure of United Nations inspectors from Baghdad means that Iraq has a license to move from the Agriculture Ministry any documents inspectors are seeking. That would allow Iraq to appear to relent under international pressure, escape punishment, and still give nothing of value to the inspectors, Mr. Ekeus said. The Western allies would prefer to gain some formal Security Council backing, such as a written ultimatum, before beginning a new military campaign against Mr. Hussein. But they also maintain that current United Nations resolutions already authorize military action, and talks in the Security Council this weekend are aimed more at gauging support for a range of military options than at securing a blank check for an armed response. "That's a very fluid process," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the United Nations talks. "You work in concentric circles, and you just see how far you can get. Everything is on the table, from a very narrow response to a very broad one." The United States, frustrated for nearly 18 months by President Hussein's ability to stay in power and even taunt his enemies, clearly favors a broad one. General Powell called Iraq's defiance of United Nations inspectors "symptomatic of a broader pattern of behavior," and others implied that an allied strike at Iraq would hit a variety of targets as a result. Signs of Cracks in Alliance But even as Washington and its allies turned up the pressure on Mr. Hussein, there were signs of some cracks in the international will to use military pressure to force Iraq into compliance with the United Nations mandate. Turkey, which allowed its territory to be used as a staging area for the air assault against Iraq in January 1991, said today that it would deny Western nations access to its air bases for any operation against Iraq. The State Department outlined today what it called Iraq's "steadily expanding" defiance of United Nations mandates. The Iraqi actions included efforts to starve Kurdish minorities in the north and to exterminate Shiite dissidents in the south; its refusal to sell oil as demanded by the United Nations to finance war reparations and relief for its citizens; its refusal to negotiate a new border with Kuwait, and its increasing harassment of United Nations officials inside Iraq. The five weapons inspectors who left today had faced growing threats to their safety, including an attack on one inspector and close brushes with violence among others. About 65 United Nations inspectors still remain in Iraq. New Iraqi Attacks in South The Iraqi military, at the same time that it has taken precautions in anticipation of an allied attack, has stepped up its offensive against Iraqi rebels. "A new military offensive against its own people is now under way in the south," the State Department said today. The attacks were described as a "flagrant violation" of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688. The resolution orders Baghdad to cease "repression" of the Kurds in northern Iraq and of Shiite Muslims in the south. On Wednesday, Iraq used fixed-wing combat planes against rebel positions, according to senior Administration officials. It was the first time that the Iraqi military has used jet planes against its own people since the cease-fire, according to Pentagon officials.

118-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats; Clinton Presses Welfare Overhaul, Stressing Job Training and Work
Gov. Bill Clinton today called for an "end to welfare as we know it" and proposed a major program of job training and education for recipients of public aid. Mr. Clinton said he would quadruple to $4 billion the amount the Government spends on job training for welfare recipients and add $2 billion in tax credits for the working poor. By 1996, he said, the Government would be spending an additional $6 billion a year. In exchange, Mr. Clinton repeated his past promises to demand more of parents. He said he would crack down on fathers who refuse to pay child support and limit mothers on welfare to a stay of no more than two years. After that, he said, they would have to take a job in private business or perform community service to receive Government aid. "When poverty and jobless rolls rise, we all pay," he said in a speech at the Clayton County Social Services office here. "In the last year, we spent $8 billion more than we were spending three years ago on welfare and food stamps alone." Mr. Clinton and his aides were mindful of the mixed signals such an announcement could send on a subject that has frequently carried with it racial overtones. The speech was set in the South, and Mr. Clinton surrounded himself with a racially mixed group of mothers and their babies. He delivered it on the same day that he addressed the National Baptist Convention, a largely black denomination. But the campaign has determined that it can sell a message of welfare restructuring by appealing to middle-class blacks and whites rather than to racial stereotypes and following through on an issue in which Mr. Clinton has been heavily involved in his home state of Arkansas. Mr. Clinton's speech today amounted to a reiteration of his views rather than an announcement of a new plan. For the past year, he has stressed a theme of mutual responsibility, arguing that the Government should do more to help the poor and the poor should do more to help themselves. While Mr. Clinton has been vague on some important specifics, many welfare experts credit him with more than a decade of serious study and experimentation with welfare programs in Arkansas. He also played a major role in lobbying for the 1988 Family Support Act, which was signed by President Reagan. "His proposals address the problems head on, in a way that is consistent with the best current thinking on the welfare system," said Isabel Sawhill, an economist with the Urban Institute, a Washington research organization. Presenting his current program as a continuation of past work, Mr. Clinton said the act, which provides up to a $1 billion a year in job-training for welfare mothers, has "never been fully implemented and it didn't go far enough." Would Use Military Savings He said his program would be paid for out of savings from military budget reductions and increased taxes on the wealthy that he has said would also pay for a number of other domestic programs he has proposed. "The changing face of welfare and the changing nature of it, and the enormous barriers of people moving from welfare to a productive life deserve special attention," Mr. Clinton said. "Especially now that most people on welfare are young women and their little children." "By the time we're through, we shouldn't have a welfare program in America," he said. "We ought to have a helping hand program followed by a jobs program." Later today, Mr. Clinton shared a stage with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader and former Presidential candidate who has maintained a cool, almost icy, distance from the Democratic ticket since the July nominating convention. Grim Greeting from Jackson At the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention, Mr. Jackson sat stony-faced behind Mr. Clinton as the Arkansas Governor received a warm reception from the religious groups. Afterward, Mr. Jackson met Mr. Clinton briefly in a backstage restroom while more than a dozen clergymen milled around outside and guarded the doorway. Mr. Jackson said later that Mr. Clinton agreed to meet with him next week to discuss voter registration plans. "In the next 55 days, the character and the vision and the will of the American people will be severely tested," Mr. Clinton told the convention minutes before. "The other side represents the same old things except worse. But they're very good at raising the fears of the American people." Mr. Jackson is supposed to undertake a party-sponsored voter registration bus tour later this month. He has said he is working for the party more than he is for the ticket. "The partnership I seek is not one for elections and votes," Mr. Clinton said to the crowd. "It's one that will go way, way beyond that." "Just remember folks, you're fighting in the greatest tradition of America," he said. "The 'We-can' crowd against the 'We-can't' crowd." Mr. Clinton took only a few, muted partisan jabs at President Bush in his remarks today. In a fact sheet released with his speech, Mr. Clinton's staff faulted Mr. Bush for not mentioning welfare restructuring in the nominating speech he delivered at the Republican convention in much the same way that Republicans have taken Mr. Clinton to task for giving short shrift to foreign policy in his own convention speech. Georgia Governor on Attack But the Democratic nominee left most of the direct hits to Gov. Zell Miller, the Democratic Governor of Georgia who has attacked Mr. Clinton's political opponents on his behalf before. "George Bush, after putting more people on welfare than any other President, is complaining that the welfare system is overlooked," Mr. Miller said. "That reminds me of that Lincoln story of the man who murdered his parents and then threw himself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan." After remaining stable for nearly two decades, welfare rolls surged to all-time highs in the past years, fed by both the lingering recession and an increase in female-headed households. About 4.8 million families, or 13.6 million people, receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program. That figure is about from 3.7 million families as recently as 1989. Bruce Reed, the campaign's policy director, said that the welfare-to-work plan would affect the 1.8 million households that have been receiving public assistance payments for two years or more. After those people had received the two years of training the program would provide, they would then have to leave the welfare rolls for jobs. Mr. Reed said there was no way to estimate precisely how many people would be affected within the first four years of the program. Mr. Bush rarely discussed welfare until the campaign heated up this year. Since then, he has said that he wants to give states increased flexibility to conduct experiments.

119-> 28 Graves Giving Up Secrets of the 1700's
Because of a twist of archeological fate and a minor mistake on an old map, H. David Geer's sand-and-gravel crew stumbled onto a bit of 1700's rural America two years ago. A tiny and long forgotten farm family cemetery -- 28 bodies representing generations of a family called the Waltons -- suddenly re-emerged into the 20th century. The bodies, some turned to dust by two and a half centuries, others preserved to the braided hair on a 15-year-old girl, were given thoroughly modern treatment. Samples were taken for DNA analysis and X-ray studies in Washington. In Connecticut the state archeologist studied church and land records and sought out descendants, as required by a law intended mainly to protect and respect Indian grave sites and artifacts. Today the Waltons were returned to the earth, as their descendants from as far away as California, Nevada and Maryland gathered on a stony hillside to watch a pastor from the church where the Waltons had worshiped intone a liturgy of recommittal as old as the remains. "Walking around where an ancestor walked 300 years ago is awe inspiring, and a little frightening, really," said Robert Walton, a retired computer operator from Bethesda, Md., who learned a few months ago that he had had relatives in Connecticut at one time. The Waltons of Griswold pulled up stakes in the 1830's for the flat and fertile farmland of Ohio and apparently never looked back. But farming was still in their blood. Descendants from Oklahoma and Minnesota, recounting histories at graveside, said they had grown up on farms. But the six direct descendants and the other relatives by marriage who gathered had mostly lost the family trail in Ohio. Gold Mine of Records Archeologists say the Walton cemetery is an important discovery partly because of the unusual interplay of science and history it offers. Many old cemetery finds, notably the Negros Burial Ground being excavated at a construction site in lower Manhattan, offer no hope of establishing identities for the remains. Records were poor or nonexistent, especially among enslaved and impoverished people. Here in eastern Connecticut, however, the New England habit of minding everyone else's business -- even among apparently humble families like the Waltons -- produced a gold mine. Church records, marriage records and land deeds, which can be traced from the 1600's in many old towns like Griswold, have led State Archeologist Nicholas F. Bellantoni to assign tentative identities to two bodies. They may well have been the patriarch and matriarch of the clan, Lawrence and Jemima Walton. Both died sometime around the 1750's, around the time that the family purchased a small piece of land from a wealthy old sea captain, Stephen Johnson. The bill of sale said that the family had been using the land for a cemetery for years and that the sale would simply make it legal. The scientific investigation, conducted mainly at the National Museum of Health and Medicine and the Smithsonian Institution, has already produced a portrait of Revolutionary era farm life that was in many cases as brutal and short as it was thought to be. Of the 28 bodies that have been found, half are from children 13 or younger. In one area seven children were buried in a cluster, perhaps the victims of measles, which swept through the town in 1759, or smallpox, which arrived in 1790, affecting a whole generation of Waltons. The scientists have also found evidence of the dread of disease that haunted families in the days before modern medicine. The body of a 55-year-old had been mutilated about 10 years after his death, apparently to prevent the illness that may have killed him, tuberculosis, from stalking his family from beyond the grave. Both femurs had been broken and placed in a cross, and the skull was moved to the lower abdomen. Archeologists have found up to eight such mutilations around the same period, mainly in New England, and apparently linked to TB. The man's ribs were marked with scars from a long-term battle with the disease, according to Paul S. Sledzik, curator of the anatomical collection at the National Museum. Mr. Sledzik said the family might have also suffered from oral problems like the salivary tumors that apparently afflicted a young man who died in his late 20's. The scientist said the DNA taken from the samples would be matched against a sample from Jeanne Church Abrams, a seventh-generation direct descendant of Lawrence Walton. The samples could show how traits have evolved over 250 years. Mr. Geer has begun wondering. His family dates 300 years in Connecticut, and researchers have discovered a marriage between a Walton and a Geer in the 1700's that may have ultimately produced part of his family line. He may in fact have discovered his own distant cousins in the gravel pit. "It's weird," Mr. Geer said. "It's very weird."

120-> Assemblyman Says His Gun Vote Erred
An Assembly Republican who voted to repeal New Jersey's ban on semiautomatic weapons said today that he would not support an attempt to override Gov. Jim Florio's expected veto. The switch by Assemblyman Robert J. Martin of Morris Plains leaves the bill's supporters with only the minimum 54 votes needed for an override in the 80-member Assembly. Mr. Martin said that he had "made a mistake" in voting for the repeal. "Most people feel that we need tough gun-control laws," Mr. Martin said. The Republican-controlled state Senate and Assembly last Monday approved a bill to legalize all of the weapons outlawed under the two-year-old gun ban, except Uzis and AK-47's. The measure also would create mandatory penalties for knowingly possessing a gun within 1,000 feet of a school or for committing certain drug crimes with a gun.

121-> Over 900 in Pakistan Dead in Severe Floods
More than three million people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 have died in Pakistan's worst floods in decades, officials said today. The death toll passed 950 as officials reported more deaths after breaches in embankments flooded much of central Punjab province. Workers continued to evacuate villages along the Indus River as it hurtled south, swollen by churning waters of five tributaries. The flooding began last week after torrential rains in the northern mountains. River waters poured through two vital irrigation barriers as army engineers raced to strengthen embankments.. A Cabinet official said 3.3 million people in Punjab had been forced to evacuate their homes.

123-> Pakistan Provides Legal Safeguards
To the Editor: I share Asia Watch's concern for women in Pakistan and agree with Dorothy Q. Thomas and Patricia Grossman ("Pakistan's Women Suffer Special Abuse," letter, Aug. 20) that if there is any case of brutality against women, it must not go unpunished. Nor must police brutality against men be condoned either, and I wonder why the writers restrict their sympathy to women in detention. Men make up the overwhelming number of those in detention in Pakistan; women are an insignificantly small proportion of the number of prisoners. This was the finding of Pakistan's leading feminists and human rights lawyers, Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani ("The Hudood Ordinances," 1990), whom Asia Watch has relied on heavily in its report, but whose statistical data it has ignored. For instance, in 1988 there were only 657 women prisoners in Punjab. The law in Pakistan not only provides safeguards to prevent harassment of women at masculine hands, but it is also tilted to the extent of reverse discrimination. For instance, a female constable's presence is a legal requirement at the time of a female's arrest. Moreover, a woman in Pakistan cannot be charged with the offense of adultery. Under Section 497 of the Pakistan Penal Code, only a man can be punished, and in all such cases "the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor." The draftsmen of the Pakistan Penal Code did not intentionally expose women to the risk of being accused of adultery, as they are in Western Europe and America. The legal bias in favor of women has been extended. Last May, the Government amended the Criminal Procedure Code so that women can no longer be remanded in police custody. This was done to eliminate the possibility that police officers might harass women. Thus I find it startling that Ms. Thomas and Ms. Gossman state so sweepingly that the law courts discriminate against women. In making out a case of repression under "Islamid" (Hadood) laws, the Asia Watch report acknowledges its reliance on the publication by Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani. But those investigators found that of the total of 26 hadd cases (until 1988), only 3 convictions were upheld by the Appellate Court. Asma Jehangir's finding is that in no instance has a hadd punishment been carried out in Pakistan. AGHA GHAZANFAR Minister (Public Affairs) Embassy of Pakistan Washington, Sept. 1, 1992

124-> CREDIT MARKETS; Long-Term Bond Sale Goes Well
An auction of $10 billion worth of 29 1/2-year bonds, the final part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, went well yesterday. Despite the successful auction, traders began to sell securities after the auction results were announced as a defense against the chance that April employment data, to be released today, would show unexpected strength. Concern that the employment figures might show that the economy was growing faster than currently anticipated were alleviated somewhat late yesterday when the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on April 27. Unexpectedly Large Drops The declines in the monetary aggregates were much larger than expected, especially a $9.7 billion drop in M-2, the money measure followed most closely by the Fed. The drop in M-2 put its growth since the fourth quarter below the low end of the Fed's target range for the growth of that category this year of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent . Prices of outstanding bonds and notes came off their lows after the money numbers were released, and closed little changed on the day. Analysts said the weak money report seemed to increase the chances the Fed may choose to cut short-term interest rates again soon. "Unless money supply, which is a leading economic indicator, reverses recent weakness over the next two to three weeks, it would be increasingly likely that the Fed will ease," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. "And the decline in money supply will probably take some of the sting out of an unusually strong employment report, if that happens," he added. In advance of the employment report, most Wall Street economists were forecasting that nonfarm payroll employment rose by between 50,000 and 75,000 jobs last month. An increase of that size would be consistent with the sluggish, halting recovery most analysts say is unfolding. The money supply report partly overshadowed the Treasury bond auction, which was the concluding piece of what turned out to be a highly successful quarterly refunding for the Treasury. At the auction, the bonds were sold at an average yield of 8 percent, up from an average of 7.91 percent at the last bond sale on Feb. 13. Existing Issue 'Reopened' Rather than issue a new bond, the Treasury chose to "reopen" an existing issue -- the 8 percent bonds of November 2021 -- that were originally sold in November 1991. The decision was made because current market conditions were not conducive to a new issue. It was the first time since 1984 that the Treasury had chosen to reopen an outstanding bond more than once. The reopening created a huge, $32 billion issue. "Even though this is the third time the Street has bid for this issue, there was surprisingly good demand," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Given the fact that the bonds have a record floating supply and that the employment report is imminent, this was an excellent auction." Outstanding Issues Rise As Mr. Kahan suggested, the money supply report did seem to allay traders' concerns about the employment statistics, because prices of outstanding notes and bonds moved higher late in the session. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 3/8, down 1/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday. Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10019/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 6.73 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 1/32 , to yield 5.24 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.58 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Wednesday. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 3.70 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late rate of 3.99 percent. High-Yield Issue Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a $400 million offering of high-yield securities issued by the Adelphia Communicactions Corporation. The 12.50 percent senior notes mature in 2002 and were priced at $100, or par. Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which, because of heavy demand, was increased in size from $275 million. The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and B by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was sluggish, traders said, partly because of the Treasury's refunding auctions. Prices of most investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged on the day, according to market participants. And municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 29 1/2-year Treasury bonds: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 100.000 Average Yield . . . 8.00% Low Price . . . 100.000 High Yield . . . 8.00% High Price . . . 100.113 Low Yield . . . 7.99% Accepted at low price . . . 61% Total applied for . . . $24,899,829 Accepted . . . $10,043,767 N.Y. applied for . . . $23,625,606 N.Y. accepted . . . $9,838,964 Noncompetitive . . . $361,000 Interest set at . . . 8% The 30-year bond matures Nov. 15, 2021.

125-> At Fork in Road, Czechoslovaks Fret
Slovaks and Czechs are awaiting Jan. 1, when this country is to split in two, with regret, resignation and a remarkable absence of animosity. Premiers Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic and Vladimir Meciar of Slovakia agreed on July 23 to dissolve the two republics' 74-year marriage after the failure of talks over Slovakia's demands for sovereignty within the federation. President Vaclav Havel, a Czech, resigned when Slovakia's Parliament declared sovereignty, rather than preside over a break he had tried to avert. Like Mr. Havel, the two Premiers are unhappy about the dissolution. "I repeat again and again that I am very sorry that this is happening," Mr. Klaus said in an interview in Prague. Bohuslav Geci, Mr. Meciar's spokesman, said in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, "Mr. Meciar was one of those who wanted to save the federation, but as a functioning partnership, not with one superior partner and one inferior." 'It's a Sin to Break It Up' Mr. Havel seems to have caught the mood of the two republics. Random interviews in streets, beer halls, churches and other public places showed much regret and only rare support for the impending break. Most Czechs and Slovaks seemed resigned. "I'm not happy about it," said Marek Blazej, a 19-year-old student sitting with his girlfriend on a rail fence in Lanzhot, a village on the Czech side of the Morava River, which is soon to become an international border. "We were together for so long, it's a sin to break it up. For so many years we have helped each other, and now we have to worry about hatred arising." 'Regretting It Will Not Help' About four miles away, in the Slovak village of Kuty, two elderly men, who declined to give their names, and Pavol Hesek, a 36-year-old unemployed factory hand and construction worker, were interviewed outside the Roman Catholic church, where an overflow crowd attended Mass on Sunday. "Our relations with the Czechs around here have always been excellent," Mr. Hesek said. "Even the local nationalists would say the same." The old men nodded in agreement. "Regretting it will not help us," one said. In a poll taken for the Government last month, only 37 percent of Slovaks and 36 percent of Czechs said they would vote for a split in a referendum, but more than 80 percent said they considered a break inevitable. The Slovak government's view is that Mr. Klaus touched off the separation by refusing concessions that would put Slovakia, the poorer part of Czechoslovakia, on a more equitable economic footing within the federal structure. Deputy Premier Milan Knazko, a well-known actor who is also Slovakia's Foreign Minister, said the Meciar government wanted the Slovak-Czech relationship transformed into "a straight line" between two republics, rather than a "triangle" with a federal Government at its apex. 'The Human Dimension' Mr. Knazko expressed hope for links in what he called "the human dimension." "We must sign a treaty so that Czech or Slovak citizens would not be foreigners in the other republic," he said. He said Slovakia wanted the right for Czechs and Slovaks to vote in either republic's elections. The number of Slovaks in the Czech republic is put at 300,000 (of a total population of 10 million); the number of Czechs in Slovakia is 50,000 (out of 5 million). Mr. Knazko said he saw the federal Parliament's vote last week against separation as a mere "episode" that will not delay the breakup. "These federal organs no longer have the capacity, are no longer sufficiently respected" to take significant action, the Deputy Premier said. 'Having Ourt State Is a Right' But in interviews along the border, only the parish priest in Kuty gave support, with reservations, to separation. Emphasizing the Catholic Church's historic identification with Slovak nationalism, the priest, the Rev. Irenej Ciutti, said: "Without doubt, all people feel having our own state is a right. Those believing in God feel it is a God-given right." For most of its history, Slovakia has been ruled by Hungarian kings and emperors. The only independent Slovak state in modern times was created by Hitler as he dismantled Czechoslovakia in 1939; it was led by the Rev. Jozef Tiso, who was executed for treason and war crimes after World War II. Father Ciutti, who is 33 years old, said the Catholic Church did not want to be involved in daily politics but continued: "It is my duty to inform people of what religion says about rights and duties. The people have a right to hear that to have their own state is a God-given right." But the priest also said that people on both banks of the Morava had lived so closely with one another that they could be considered as "one people" of "two nations." Their closeness makes Czechs and Slovaks "disoriented" as separation approaches, he said. Whatever indecision might exist in the Slovak countryside, where the Catholic Church has considerable influence, is reflected in the capital. "I feel like somebody is cutting off my arm or leg and wants me to be happy, to feel it's nice to be handicapped," said Zuzana Szatmary, a Bratislava journalist.

127-> ALZHEIMER EFFECT TIED TO CHEMICAL
Researchers say they have the first evidence that two primary abnormalities seen with Alzheimer's disease, low levels of a chemical that carries signals between nerve cells and the formation of hard plaques in the brain, may be directly related to the disorder. Work with cell cultures suggests that low levels of the brain transmitter chemical acetylcholine, a common symptom of Alzheimer patients, contribute to formation of hard deposits of amyloid protein that also clog the brain tissue of most patients with the disease, scientists said today. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said the findings, if confirmed, pointed to a new approach to developing drugs to combat the disease. Dr. Richard J. Wurtman of M.I.T., director of the laboratory in which the work was done, said much of the current research into drugs to fight Alzheimer's was aimed at finding chemicals that stimulate acetylcholine production or inhibit its breakdown. Perhaps the ideal drug, he said in an interview, would be one that stimulated the action of acetylcholine in its newly discovered role of regulating amyloid protein production. First Direct Link "This gives us a real target for drug development," Dr. Wurtman said. "If we get the right drug, we should be able to reduce symptoms and actually slow the disease at the same time." The new work, to be published Friday in the journal Science, is the first to establish a direct link between two major characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Wurtman said this was also the first time a neurotransmitter, a chemical that carries messages between brain cells, had been shown to affect protein metabolism. "This is a potentially exciting finding that has to be verified in a living system, such as an animal model," said Dr. Sangram Sisodia, an Alzheimer researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. Noting that the M.I.T. work was done in cell cultures, Dr. Sisodia cautioned that it was too early to conclude that there was a definite connection between the neurotransmitter and deposits of amyloid plaques in the brain. "To make the link, you have to go to an animal model to reproduce the experiment," Dr. Sisodia said. "A promise of the latest work is how it will help in designing the new experiments." A principal finding of the new study is acetylcholine's potential role in the processing of a substance called amyloid precursor protein, the basic substance from which amyloid plaque deposits originate. The M.I.T. research indicates this parent protein can be metabolized to form either protein fragments that break down and are excreted by the body, or the hard protein plaque that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer patients. The researchers took human kidney cells containing the precursor protein and added the genetic information that caused them to develop receptor molecules that respond to acetylcholine. The receptor molecules on the cells' surface link with acetylcholine and similar chemicals and this combination triggers protein production by the cells. 2 Pathways Indicated In the experiments, the scientists reported, the cells stimulated with acetylcholine processed four to five times more non-accumulating protein from the precursor protein than did cells not stimulated with the neurotransmitter. Dr. Wurtman said this indicated that there were two pathways for processing the precursor protein, a "good way" that appeared to be dominant and resulted in nontoxic, removable protein fragments, and a "bad way" that resulted in hard, insoluble amyloid plaque. If acetylcholine is at reduced levels because of Alzheimer's disease, he theorized, the body takes the "bad" pathway and makes the damaging amyloid protein. While it has not been proved that making more of the "good" protein results in less of the "bad," Dr. Wurtman said there appeared to be a constant level of precursor protein in the body, indicating that if it was not metabolized one way, it would be processed by the opposite pathway. Experiments are under way to see if this is true, he said. Dr. Roger M. Nitsch of Massachusetts General Hospital and M.I.T., who did much of the research reported in the Science paper, said that because few amyloid deposits were found in healthy brains, the harmless processing pathway of the precursor protein must prevail under normal conditions. "This observation showed for the first time that neurotransmission and amyloid precursor processing are related biochemical events," he said. Dr. Gene Cohen, acting director of the National Institute on Aging, said the work was potentially significant and another example of the rapid progress researchers were making in understanding Alzheimer's. An estimated four million Americans suffer from the incurable, memory-robbing disease and the incidence is rising as the population ages. "Alzheimer's continues to be one of modern medicine's great mysteries and we are still trying to find out what causes the disease and how the disease process unfolds at a fundamental level," Dr. Cohen said in an interview. "One of the things people have been looking at is the abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein, and this latest work is potentially a big piece of that puzzle."

128-> Review/Jazz; An Evening of Ellington, In Spirit and in the Notes
In their heyday, the big bands honed their music by playing night after night, on tour or in longterm residencies. The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra has tried a little of the same discipline; it toured the United States for four and a half weeks before starting its New York season with a concert of Duke Ellington's music on Wednesday night at Avery Fisher Hall. Time together has made a strong ensemble even stronger, polishing the group attack toward a brash, brassy authority. "We're here tonight to swing as hard as possible," announced Wynton Marsalis, the group's trumpeter and the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. He wasn't kidding. As a jazz-repertory group, the orchestra has not set out to recreate hallowed recordings (although it's a rare treat to hear Ellington's arrangements in concert rather than on albums of varying fidelity). The orchestra adds its own improvisations (while staying within Ellington's idiom) and brings new phrasing and emphases to the arrangements, varying the music just as the Ellington band did when it revisited old tunes through the decades. Conducted by David Berger, who also transcribed many of the pieces, the orchestra doesn't entirely reflect the easy-chair urbanity of the Ellington band. It has a more modern, more openly muscular approach, hinting at the work it takes to turn complex arrangements into the clean-lined, pure pleasure of swing. The program ranged through nearly four decades of Ellingtonia, music as old as the 1928 "Black and Tan Fantasy" and as recent as the 1966 "Amad." Along the way, it touched on blues (everywhere), New Orleans jazz ("Stompy Jones"), pop ("Love You Madly"), hard-driving swing ("Rockin' in Rhythm"), Asian music ("Amad") and the cinematic detail in sonic portraits of a train in "Daybreak Express" and a kaleidoscopic neighborhood in the 14-minute "Harlem." Any concert is necessarily a tiny sample of Ellington's vast catalogue, but each piece was bursting with ideas, from the multiple styles packed into the short "Black and Tan Fantasy" to the ceaseless thematic transformations of "Harlem" to the Olympian humor of Ellington's version of Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King." There were showpieces for the ensemble, like the interlocking syncopations of "Braggin' in Brass," and for individual musicians, particularly the saxophonist Todd Williams with a marathon solo in "Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue" and a crooning melodic lead in the more obscure 1958 piece "Happy Reunion," where the saxophone is answered by wisps and puffs of muted brass. Mr. Marsalis turned "Boy Meets Horn," once a feature for the trumpeter Rex Stewart, into a tease, moving between an introverted, bleating tone and a full-bodied swagger while never using a mute. Norris Turney, who once held Johnny Hodges's alto-saxophone chair in the Ellington orchestra, had a sultry poise in "Stompy Jones" and a sassy blues feeling in "Things Ain't What They Used to Be" (by Mercer Ellington and Ted Parsons). Bill Easley sent perky clarinet lines scurrying around and through the ensemble in "Jack the Bear." The pianist Sir Roland Hanna has a glittering, Baroque style, a long way from Ellington's understatement, but his underlying blues sense and witty harmonic revisions were perfectly at home in "The Clothed Woman" and his guess-this-tune introduction to Billy Strayhorn's "Take the 'A' Train." At times, the orchestra seemed to have trouble with Avery Fisher Hall's acoustics. During the first half of the concert, drums and brass threatened to overpower saxophones and clarinets, muddying Ellington's intricately balanced voicings in "Rockin' in Rhythm"; for the second half, however, the orchestra adjusted. But clearly, it has benefited by its time on the road. Now, the next step is to put the group on stage where people can dance.

129-> Backed by Zell Investment, Carter Hawley Re-emerges
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the department store chain, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings today with stronger financing and a leaner executive suite. But it still faces a deteriorating economy in its principal California market. As part of the reorganization agreement, the Zell/Chilmark Fund infused an additional $50 million today into the reorganized retailer, which owns the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium chains in California and Broadway Southwest in Arizona. The fund, headed by the Chicago investor Sam Zell, is now the company's largest creditor and shareholder. Zell/Chilmark bought 80 percent of Carter Hawley's $600 million in unsecured debt from junk-bond holders and suppliers for 47 cents on the dollar, which will trim the company's interest payments by $43 million a year. In exchange, the fund will control 75 percent of the company's common stock. Employees and public shareholders will see their holdings diluted to 7 percent of outstanding shares, while unsecured creditors will control 18 percent of the company. California Economy an Obstacle During the reorganization, Carter Hawley consolidated and centralized its division-level executive suite, a $25 million cost-saving measure. The company's two secured creditors, owed $500 million, also agreed to postpone payments for several years. The question now is whether the reorganized retailer can achieve its aims of upgrading aging stores, broadening its customer base and stocking more fashionable goods in light of the worst economic downturn in California since the Great Depression. The economic picture in California, where Carter Hawley has 73 of its 87 stores, is not expected to improve before 1994. "There's no indication that job losses are stabilizing, especially in Southern California," said Brad Williams, an economic forecaster for the Commission on State Finance. "Retailers have had it tough," he said, "and with the current trends in unemployment, I don't see it getting much better soon." In a report issued this week, the commission said 800,000 jobs had been lost in California since 1988, about 25 percent of them because of military spending cutbacks. Further Changes Are Seen "It's a question of whether Zell will give them the time," Walter Loeb, an industry analyst, said of Carter Hawley. He predicted more changes, like consolidating the company's four chains into two, and possibly other Zell cash infusions to pay for store renovations. Leonard Rabinowitz, chairman of a clothing maker, Carole Little, and a Broadway supplier, said Carter Hawley was bringing in a new team of apparel buyers to improve its goods. Another change is the expected departure of Carter Hawley's chairman and chief executive, Philip Hawley, who is 67 years old. "I would think it would be logical that he'd retire," said James B. Sleyden, a retailing professor at the University of Southern California. "His strength was total management, and they don't need that anymore." A company spokesman declined to comment, and officials of Zell/Chilmark were said to be unavailable.

130-> Art in Review
Harry Callahan Aaron Siskind Pace/MacGill Gallery 32 East 57th Street Through Oct. 24 Aaron Siskind Robert Mann Gallery 42 East 76th Street Through Nov. 21 Aaron Siskind, who died in 1991, taught with Harry Callahan for many years, first at the Institute of Design in Chicago and later at the Rhode Island School of Design. As a result, the two men are often linked in exhibitions and publications despite the differences in their work. The exhibition at Pace/MacGill plays off this connection by contrasting relatively atypical groups of photographs by each artist. Mr. Callahan is represented by a series of close-ups of women's faces photographed in 1950 on the streets of Chicago. The women, photographed with a 35-millimeter camera and a telephoto lens, are lost in thought, their faces reduced to enigmatic masks. In other pictures from the same period, some of which are included here, Mr. Callahan photographed passers-by from a low angle, turning them into heroic figures against the backdrop of the city's skyscrapers. Both projects recall Walker Evans's attempts to photograph people unawares from a fixed point of view. Here, though, Mr. Callahan's pictures form a telling counterpoint to Siskind's photographs of boys performing acrobatic dives into Lake Michigan in the late 1950's. Centered in the square frame and silhouetted against the white sky, the divers become calligraphic figures. At their best they seem to float weightlessly within the photographs, tense with effort but free of the earth. The Robert Mann Gallery is offering a small survey of Siskind's career, with major stages of his work represented by one or two pictures each. Included are early documentary photographs he made in New York City in the 1930's, abstractions from the early 1940's and the later close-ups of drips of paint and torn posters that brought him fame. The most fascinating pictures here are from a snapshot album he assembled in 1930-32 after being given a camera as a wedding present. While many of these are simply snapshots, pictures of such subjects as a branching tree and a boulder suggest that Siskind already had both an urge and an eye for abstract form.

131-> CHRONICLE
His name is familiar -- HOAGY BIX CARMICHAEL -- and so are the songs in the show he narrates every Thursday evening during October at Tatou, on East 50th Street. They were written by his father, the legendary Hoagy Carmichael. Hoagy Bix Carmichael, a movie and television producer, is planning to bring a musical called "Hoagy and Bix" to Broadway next fall. In the meantime, he said, "I don't want people to forget this is happening." He continued: "The idea is for backers to be there, for publicity. It is sort of kicking the whole thing off. These are tough times, and if the marquee doesn't say Andrew Lloyd Webber, people don't line up." To inspire interest, Lillias White sings and Mr. Carmichael tells anecdotes in the Tatou shows. "He was a pretty multifaceted guy without five minutes of training," he said, explaining that his father had been in law school when his friend the great jazzman Bix Beiderbecke said, "Hoagy, you don't need to be a law student. Come down and record." Hoagy Carmichael eventually did earn his law degree from Indiana University, his son said. "But he would have gotten it four years earlier had it not been for this guy, Bix," he added. "He just kept on going on the road with Bix, instead of class."

132-> Abroad at Home; Death At Bush's Door
At a private meeting last month former Secretary of State George Shultz spoke in passionate terms about the human disaster taking place in what was Yugoslavia. He deplored the American Government's failure to do more to stop Serbian attacks on Bosnia. There are many ways for the United States to influence the Serbs, Mr. Shultz said -- many more options than we have tried. One possibility, he said, is to bomb Serbian munitions depots. Mr. Shultz spoke Sept. 19 at a management meeting of Forstmann Little & Company, a Wall Street investment firm of whose board he is a member. The board makes a practice once a year of hearing about world problems. No record was made of Mr. Shultz's comments. When I tried to reach him, he was about to leave for Korea and said he had not spoken from a text and had no time then to put his thoughts down. But those who heard him were moved by the force of his words. "He was very outspoken," said Theodore Forstmann, senior partner in the firm. Another listener said he spoke of the Yugoslav challenge to American policy as a moral issue of the deepest kind. George Shultz is a conservative and a loyal Republican. But in three Cabinet jobs in the Nixon and Reagan Administrations he put principle above politics, for example rejecting Nixon plans to use the Internal Revenue Service against "enemies." He disagreed with the plan to trade arms to Iran for hostages when President Reagan and Vice President Bush were for it. Today Mr. Shultz is evidently distressed at the inaction of President Bush in the face of the Bosnian tragedy. As every American should be. I do not remember a time when a President has failed so pathetically to act when he had many opportunities to prevent and then to stop a cruel and pointless slaughter. Just think what is happening in Bosnia today. Sarajevo, the capital, is being bombarded by Serbian heavy guns. The guns are in the surrounding hills, in plain view. American planes could silence them in a few days -- a day, probably -- if we had a President with the courage to act. Despite promises, the Serbs are continuing their Nazi-like "ethnic cleansing" of Bosnia. They can laugh off the promises because the American President shows no sign of caring. In the six months of Serbian attacks on Bosnian civilians, 10,000 children have been killed or been reported missing. And worse is on the way. Sir Donald Acheson, special representative of the World Health Organization in Sarajevo, warned this week that the beleaguered city's food warehouses are empty. To keep the 380,000 people trapped there alive, he said, will require flying in 240 tons of food every day. Unless that unlikely target is met, he said, "Children will begin to die of starvation in about four weeks' time, adults about four weeks later." The scene in Bosnia is enough to break the heart of any normally sensitive person. Theodore Forstmann flew there himself last month and came back utterly distressed. He has organized the shipment of many thousands of parkas, blankets and heaters to ward off the winter cold that will kill Bosnians even more swiftly than starvation. But does George Bush care? Only now, months after it mattered, is he talking about stopping the flights of Serbian bombers over Bosnia. He has done nothing to interdict the flow of munitions from Serbia to Serbian soldiers in Bosnia. He has exerted no force, moral or physical, to lift the deadly siege of Sarajevo. U.S. military leaders are understandably reluctant to see our forces used anywhere unless they can be sure of a smashing victory. But the world today requires the use or threat of force in subtler ways, and we have a civilian Commander in Chief to say so. Is Mr. Bush so indifferent to the Bosnian tragedy because he is callous? Is he the wimp he has tried so hard to deny he is? Or is he just interested in politics these days? He has his people put out the slimy lie that Bill Clinton may be a Communist agent. But he himself does not have the guts to take on the Communist dictator of Serbia. Whoever has a chance to question George Bush in the first debate should surely ask: Why have you not met the first post-cold-war challenge to decency and humanity in Europe? Is this your idea of the new world order?

The Islanders yesterday sent TOM KURVERS to their minor league team, the Capital District Islanders. Kurvers, a veteran defenseman and power-play specialist, is also the team representative for the National Hockey League Players Association, a coincidence not overlooked by several players at practice yesterday as the team prepared for tonight's visit to the Capital Center and a game against the Washington Capitals. Kurvers is also headed for a salary arbitration with the team management. In three games this season, Kurvers has no goals and two assists. He has sat out four games, and the team's power play has been struggling. Tuesday night, in a 4-3 victory over Philadelphia, the Islanders scored one goal in eight times with the man advantage. DON MALONEY, the Islanders' general manager, said he has been talking with several teams about a trade for Kurvers.

134-> Art in Review
Norris Embry Snyder Fine Arts 588 Broadway (near Houston Street) SoHo Through Oct. 17 Norris Embry's painting is sometimes referred to as outsider art, a term used for the work of insane and self-taught artists. Mentally unbalanced Embry certainly was, but as this show suggests, he was also a cosmopolitan artist, fluent in the traditions of international modernism and himself inspired by outsider art of an earlier time. He was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1921 and knew Wols, studied with Oskar Kokoschka and counted Asger Jorn among his friends. He first became aware of the famous Prinzhorn collection of the art of the insane in West Germany in the 1950's and studied it avidly. His own insanity overtook him in the 60's after he returned to America. He died in 1981. The work at Snyder dates from these last two decades. Most of it is on paper in a mixture of watercolor, gouache, oil stick, ballpoint pen and collage. Typically, each sheet is jammed with Expressionist figures, abstract and totemic shapes, and written texts: sometimes single words, sometimes entire pages from diaries, letters or desk calendars pasted on. The results often seem like edgy but articulate doodling. Walking from one painting to the next is like listening to a compulsive talker who says everything he thinks, punctuating the flow with the occasional self-rebuking "NO," the initials Embry used as a signature. Yet manic busyness is only one of Embry's moods; work from the 1960's is almost funereal, with shapes spaced out over a dark ground, and in 1980 suddenly everything opens up into a chromatically vivid near-abstraction. What is stirring throughout is the sense of a man using art as a personal record. Witty asides and delicate jottings are there, though more often the fearsome side of the psyche comes through. "Untitled (1152)," with its collaged cutout of a sleeping woman and its large painted male figure, a wristwatch strapped to his arm, a red heart sitting in the center of his chest, and a bloodlike wash seeping from his shoulder, projects the anger, sexual longing and panic that give Embry's works its jarring emotional pitch. When the exhibition "Parallel Visions" opens in Los Angeles later this month, documenting the influence of outsider art on insider modernist painters like Klee, Dubuffet and Pollock, Embry will be included, enjoying a special status. He was both an insider and an outsider. The combination in Embry's case is art both imaginative and profoundly felt, and it has never looked better than in Snyder Gallery's lovingly mounted show.

135-> Review/Music; Venerating Frida Kahlo
There is a type of religious play, common to many cultures, that goes something like this: Take the life of a revered saint or seer. Select highlights from that life, episodes of suffering, martyrdom, trial and triumph. Enact them in sequence, accompanied by music drawn from the folk culture. Fill the drama with icons and symbols, costumes and display. That about sums up the music drama "Frida: The Story of Frida Kahlo," which opened the Brooklyn Academy of Music's 10th Next Wave Festival on Wednesday night. The drama's book, by Hilary Blecher, recounts the details of the life of Frida Kahlo (1907-1954), the Mexican painter whose fierce self-portraits and images of bodily mutilation have been adopted as touchstones for political and artistic movements and have made her, in recent years, a cult figure. She is always referred to, familiarly, as Frida. The sets for this production are spare, with a backdrop of scaffolding. Miniature puppets, life-size puppets and plastic masks mix with naturalistic acting. The stagehands, as in some allegorical dramas, are all representatives of Death, dressed as skeletons. The music, by Robert Xavier Rodriguez, draws on Mexican and Spanish folk styles along with echoes of Gian Carlo Menotti, Broadway show tunes and phrases from the classical tradition. But despite the work's origins at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia in 1991, and its planned presentation by Houston Grand Opera, the music itself, with its amiable folk character, seems almost intended not to distract attention from Frida's life. As if to emphasize the devotional nature of the enterprise, the lobby of the Majestic Theater, where the work is being performed this weekend and next week, is devoted to an exhibition, "Pasion por Frida," created under the auspices of Mexico's National Institute of Fine Arts. On display are photographs, memorabilia, works inspired by the artist and commercial items cashing in on her visage. There is a photograph of Frida holding an ornamented skull. There is a glittering Frida icon created by an artist she inspired. And there is the pop paraphernalia, some of which is on sale: Frida T-shirts, Frida nail polish, Frida postcards and a Frida calendar. The dutifully honorific theater piece brings in some of the elements that have made Frida an almost Roman Catholic religious figure. She was in a horrific bus accident at the age of 18, her body skewered by a metal handrail. Physical pain dominated her life and work; she required more than 30 operations and plaster casts for her shattered spine. She often painted herself as a suffering Madonna, in one picture with a ring of thorns around her neck. Political elements are mixed with the religious. Frida was an ardent Communist and a Stalinist until she died (she also had an affair with Trotsky and for a brief time was a suspect in his assassination). She was an avid Mexican nationalist, flamboyant in her folk style of dress and scorning the influences of the United States. She was married to Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist, who shared her political passions. She suffered from his philandering and did quite a bit of bisexual exploration on her own. The unrelenting gaze that emerges from her paintings, and her obsession with her own body and its dismemberment have made her a central figure for feminist intellectuals. Even the world of pop fashion has adopted her during the last 10 years. Madonna (the singer) owns two of her paintings and treats her as a patron saint. This could make for a fascinating drama, particularly since the details of her life are theatrical just in the telling. But Ms. Blecher, who directed the drama, really did seem to conceive of this as a religious play. Unfortunately that means it has greatest impact only on those who already believe. Each major scene in her life was enacted, either by puppets or by the singing actors: her horror at starvation of peasants in the streets, her first menstruation, her love for the leader of a radical student group, her meeting of Rivera, her operations, her dinner with the Rockefellers in New York (treated as agitprop satire). These episodes, all taken from biographical sources, are punctuated by monologues. But always the main point seems less to create a compelling drama, than to touch all the bases; their importance or significance is taken for granted, simply because this is the life of Frida. Matters were not helped by some of Migdalia Cruz's lyrics ("I love love") and spoken dialogue ("You can't compare Trotsky to one of your sluts!" Frida shouts at Rivera). In fact, the score itself, written for six players, including keyboard, accordian and percussion (an ensemble led by Robert Kapilow) did very little to amplify or explain or intensify the events onstage. Mr. Rodriguez has written accomplished atmospheric music, mostly drawn on Mexican sources. There is a carnival dance, a tango, mariachi music; the result is pleasant, but not particularly memorable. As Frida herself, Helen Schneider is appealing, bringing out the humor and irony in the character that doesn't usually emerge in the iconography; on Wednesday night her voice was lovely, sure-pitched and naturally produced despite the awkward amplification used throughout the evening. But except for the effective final scenes, she was so charming, she hardly resembled the narcissistic and tragically pained figure of the Frida cult. As Rivera, William Rhodes looked and acted the part, with energy and good-humored imagination. But the most effective parts of this work were not in the characters or their songs, but in the imaginative puppetry, which could, in its cartoonish quality, create startling and unusual effects. Images were taken directly out of the paintings -- a wounded deer, a hospital bed, a bowl of fruit, a broken body -- all acting as surreal icons in a tale of a saint. The puzzle was why this work, which is now touring the country as part of a collaboration with the Houston Grand Opera, the American Music Theater Festival and Women's Project and Projections, should have been considered part of an esthetic vanguard, a representative piece to open this year's Next Wave Festival. It is a thoroughly conventional work in its music and its ambitions, "advanced" only in its invocations of its subject's politics and its relationship to contemporary fashion. Is this really the Next Wave?

136-> Richard G. Denzer, Ex-Prosecutor And New York Judge, Dies at 80
Richard G. Denzer, a longtime prosecutor who helped rewrite New York State's penal laws, died on Wednesday while on a family visit in Kensington, Md. He was 80 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Boca Raton, Fla. He died of cancer, his family said. Mr. Denzer, a native New Yorker, graduated from Amherst College and in 1935 from Yale Law School. The next year, as a $1-a-year volunteer, he joined the staff of Thomas E. Dewey for the special investigation in New York City that established the future Governor's national reputation as a "racket buster." When Mr. Dewey was elected Manhattan District Attorney in 1937, Mr. Denzer stayed on as an assistant district attorney, a post he held for 23 years. Led Indictment Bureau He became one of the closest aides of Mr. Dewey's legendary successor, Frank S. Hogan, who appointed him chief of his indictment bureau in 1947. Three years later, he took charge of Mr. Hogan's appeals bureau. Mr. Denzer accepted the appointment in 1961 as chief counsel and executive director of the newly formed State Temporary Commission on Revision of the Penal Law and Criminal Code. The law and the code, setting forth how the penal law is administered, dated to the 19th century. Mr. Denzer oversaw the staff that researched and framed the changes for the updated version the Legislature had asked for. It took nearly a decade to complete. Mr. Denzer was a law professor at Fordham University in 1973 when Gov. Nelson A. Rockeller recruited him and 15 others as judges to handle the spate of drug cases arising from the state's stringent new narcotics law. Technically, they were Court of Claims judges on loan to the State Supreme Court with the title of acting justice. After that assignment, in a case in 1979, Justice Denzer sentenced Adela Holzer, a former Broadway producer, for defrauding scores of investors of their savings. He called her conduct "simple greed" and ordered her jailed for two to six years. A Violinist's Murder Justice Denzer was the presiding judge in the trial of Craig S. Crimmins, a stagehand accused of murdering Helen Hagnes Mintiks, a 31-year-old violinist who was playing for the Berlin Ballet, then appearing at Lincoln Center. She disappeared on July 23, 1980, and her nude body was found the next day down a three-story air shaft in a construction area. At the trial the next spring, the defendant was found guilty of murdering the victim while tring to rape her. Justice Denzer sentenced him to 20-year-to-life prison term with the possibility of parole in 20 years. He called the slaying "bizarre" but said he spared the defendant the maximum of 25 years to life because that should be reserved for criminals with a history of violence. He retired from the bench at the end of 1981, but he remained a judicial hearing oficer until last year. He is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Paxson; a daughter, Sally Denzer of Manhattan, and a stepdaughter, Lorna Tahtinen of Kensington, Md.

138-> Helmet Helped Girl In Bicycle Accident
I'll admit that bicycle helmets, to the unfamiliar, can look a bit peculiar. But this is one New Jersey mother who lauds the new law in Westfield on mandatory use of helmets ("Grumbling Over Law Requiring Helmets on Young Bicyclists," Jan. 19). On Sept. 6 of last year, our 7-year-old daughter, riding down a hill, hit a metal pipe and literally flew head first into a brick wall. She sustained severe facial abrasions and cuts, requiring a number of stitches and the care of a plastic surgeon. Thanks to her helmet, she did not suffer more serious, permanent head injury. Each of the doctors who saw her agreed that the helmet saved her from what could have been disastrous injuries. As a parent, I'm thankful that I've instilled in her the practice that, just as we buckle ourselves into seat belts in the car, the wearing of a helmet is also a safety habit that must be followed. Any parent who resents the so-called intrusion of the government should in fact be grateful for the concern. As we all know, very often we must learn to protect ourselves from ourselves. SISALEE M.

142-> Review/Film; Giving Up The Glitter Of Success
It's lonely at the top. Success is a misery for Dusty, a ponytailed country-music star so famous he doesn't need a last name. The screaming fans and the fancy stage lighting have lost their appeal. So has Dusty's manager, Lula (Lesley Ann Warren), who wears too much leather and screeches things like "Cute guys like you who sing are a dime a dozen." So at the start of "Pure Country," Dusty decides to get a haircut, escape his fame and rediscover the simple life. "I'm tired of all the smoke and the lights," declares Dusty, played by the singer George Strait with a monotone and a wooden grin, in a performance that is all cowboy hat. "It ain't me." So he embarks on a search for his simpler self, the kind of voyage also attempted (a lot more successfully) by John Mellencamp in his recent "Falling From Grace." For Dusty, this means going miraculously unrecognized in a small-town coffee shop and meeting a nice girl at a honky-tonk, then finding himself trapped in a parking-lot brawl. See "Thelma and Louise" for a much livelier take on similar scenes. As directed listlessly by Christopher Cain, "Pure Country" lacks even the enjoyable chutzpah of a vanity production, preferring a somnolent seriousness about Dusty and his problems. The resulting film is, as one of its characters could easily have said, slower 'n molasses. Too much of it depends on the magnetism of Mr. Strait, who peers into the camera sheepishly and never seems the superstar he is supposed to be. The Strait songs on the soundtrack sound pleasant enough, but never catch fire. "Pure Country," which in no way lives up to its title, also features Isabel Glasser as the hearty rodeo queen who rescues Dusty (known as Wyatt in his nice-guy incarnation) from a life of empty glitter, and a nearly unrecognizable Rory Calhoun as her crusty father. Molly McClure plays the knowing Grandma who advises Dusty: "There are no answers. Only the search." Rex McGee's screenplay is all on a par with that. Among the film's few scenes to command any attention are the concert shot in which a camera hurtles frighteningly toward Dusty from the back of a huge indoor stadium, and a rodeo scene in which a lone rider circles an arena to the tune of "America the Beautiful," with the inspirational mood impaired by advertising posters plastered all over the walls. "Pure Country" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes very mild profanity. Pure Country Directed by Christopher Cain; written by Rex McGee; director of photography, Richard Bowen; edited by Jack Hofstra; music by Steve Dorff; production designer, Jeffrey Howard; produced by Jerry Weintraub; released by Warner Brothers.

143-> Russia's Elixir -- A special report.; Vodka, Scourge and Balm At Center of Russian Life
"Daddy, now that vodka is so expensive, will you drink less?" "No, my son. You'll eat less." -- Russian joke According to the Kievan Chronicles, Vladimir I, who converted Russia to Greek Orthodoxy at the end of the 10th century, rejected Islam on the grounds that he would never get Russians to stop drinking alcohol. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his infamous campaign against alcohol, had no better luck. Today, according to Lieut. Col. Vitaly N. Gunenkov, chief of the Interior Ministry's department for drink-related crimes, the problems associated with too much vodka-drinking -- crime, absenteeism, lost production, sickness -- are worse than they were before Mr. Gorbachev's campaign of 1985 to 1988. "It's like a pendulum that is swinging hard in the other direction," Colonel Gunenkov said. "Now it is worse than it was in 1984, and this year shows the trend is also worsening." Crimes Are Up He said crimes committed by drunken people in Moscow were up 15.9 percent in the first seven months of this year over the same period last year. Drunken people are now committing 35.6 percent of all crimes in Moscow, he said, and nearly 80 percent of crimes against individuals: murder, rape, robbery. Figures are similar nationwide. Experts say comparisons between Russia and other countries with alcohol problems are difficult because of varying definitions of what constitutes an alcoholic. But Russia's problem is widely acknowledged to be among the worst in the world, ranking only with Poland's in terms of social costs that result from drunkenness. In addition, the United States and other countries have enormous problems of lost work, sickness and absenteeism because of drugs as well as alcohol. But vodka -- so typically Russian and so endemic -- also provides a window into the new economy, into both its opportunities and social costs. As with every other aspect of Russian life, the business of vodka is swarming with inconsistencies and corruption in this great transition from a socialized command economy to a free market. The production of vodka remains, as it was under the czars, a state monopoly that still accounts for more than 10 percent of Government revenues, exceeding the amount received from individual income tax. The sale of vodka, however, is no longer a state monopoly. Individuals can import and export, secure their own supplies, whether legally or illegally, and profit as they can. And while the Government still tries to license who can sell vodka when, and at what markup, it can now be bought legally 24 hours a day, and its price, in reality, has been freed. Russians are drinking less alcohol per capita now than in 1984. But they are drinking just as much vodka, even though its price has gone up considerably. And more of the vodka consumed is samogon, home brew of dubious quality, while unknown numbers of people continue to get their alcohol, and their early deaths, from dangerous or poisonous substances like window-cleaner, anti-roach chemicals, cheap perfumes, glue and gasoline. "Today the patterns of drinking are also more dangerous than before the reform," said Vladimir G. Treml of Duke University, an economist and expert on Russian drinking. Citizens of some wine-drinking countries like France, Italy, Spain and Portugal actually consume more alcohol per capita than Russians, but the pattern of drinking in these countries is safer because the alcohol is consumed with food and in the presence of family and friends, he and others say. On the list of per capita alcohol consumption, in 1990 the former Soviet Union ranked only 36th, with France first and the United States, a heavy beer-drinking country, 24th. "Drinking large quantities of distilled liquor in a short period, which is typical of Russia, is the most dangerous," Dr. Treml said. Russia, after all, is the land of the endless toast, of male bonding through the bottle, and of a rigorous social etiquette requiring that once a vodka bottle is open it must be emptied. "Samogon left in the bottom of the glass is bitterness thrown in the face of a friend," as the saying goes, and there is still significant social sympathy for the heavy drinker who finds that the pain and tragedy of life is best resolved through alcoholic oblivion. A Natural Part of Life Vodka is also cherished, almost akin to patriotism, and the poorest family will break out a bottle for guests. The word vodka is a diminutive of the word voda, meaning water, and vodka is regarded as just as natural a part of life. Around it, as around wine in the West, much romance has grown, and aficionados argue passionately about which vodka from which distillery is the most flavorful, smooth, pure. And there are many different brands and flavors of vodka: lemon, pepper, fruit, buffalo grass and a special "hunter's vodka," deep brown with herbs and spices. The love of "little water" has had horrifying consequences. According to the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, as many as 30 million people in the former Soviet Union are alcoholics or alcohol abusers -- about 10 percent of the population. The evidence in Russian cities and towns is overwhelming: the drunkards huddling in doorways and subway stations reeking of vodka and urine; the men prostrate in hallways and on sidewalks or weaving in and out of the street; the long lines at state liquor stores during work hours; the sharp smell of vodka on the breath of office workers in the morning as they crush into an elevator. In Moscow alone, about 1,000 seriously drunk people are picked up off the streets each day because they are judged to be a danger to themselves or others. About half of them are employed; one percent are women. Colonel Gunenkov acknowledges that even the figure of 1,000 is a bit arbitrary: the 28 drunk tanks in Moscow, including one for women, have about 1,000 beds. Everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's campaign -- which included a ban on sales of drink, and eau de cologne, in stores and restaurants before 2 P.M., an increase in the drinking age from 18 to 21, higher prices and cuts in liquor supplies -- had a perceptible impact in lowering the crime rate and at least stabilizing male life expectancy. Life Expectancy Falling There were 266,000 registered crimes by drunken people in 1984 in Russia. In 1990, they were up to 335,000, made worse, the police say, by price rises, instability and the general breakdown of social discipline. And Russian experts agree with Dr. Treml that renewed heavy drinking of vodka is the prime reason that male life expectancy is falling again in Russia, as it has for the last three years. "The problem with the 1985 campaign," Colonel Gunenkov said, "is that it was not a struggle against alcoholism, but against alcoholic drinks." Grand plans for more counseling and health care, youth clubs and entertainment centers and especially more and more attractive bars, where people could drink in a social setting with food and monitored by bar workers, all collapsed for lack of funds. Government revenues dropped, the Central Bank started printing rubles to cover the deficit, setting off inflation, and so much samogon was being made that sugar had to be rationed. The whole campaign against drink -- sometimes known here as zelyony zmei, the green serpent, both for the coils of pipes in home distilleries and the visions produced when drunk -- was abandoned in 1988. "Unfortunately we still have very few decent outlets for drinking in Moscow and Russia, and most are disgusting," said Anatoly V. Petrovsky, buying vodka from a sidewalk kiosk. "A normal person is afraid to go into a beer hall." It is these thousands of private kiosks -- selling cigarettes, clothes, cosmetics and vodka, domestic and imported -- that represent the sharpest change from the past. They serve as the real retail sector of the urban economy, while the state stores, very few of them privatized, have essentially become wholesalers. How the vodka gets to the kiosks, and who profits from it, provides an instructive primer on the new economy. The Distillery Even Bottles Are in Short Supply The Kristall distillery in the Lefortovo district of Moscow, built in 1895, has Doric pillars, ornate ceilings and some of the few clean windows in any Russian enterprise, complete with house plants. Moscow's only distillery, it remains wholly owned by the state, which continues to take nearly 90 percent of its profits in one kind of tax or another. Kristall now produces 100 million liters a year of eight brands of vodka, still down from its pre-Gorbachev peak of 120 million liters, but generating 20 billion rubles a year (about $59 million) in revenue. It also exports about 4 percent of production, including the well-known Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya brands, which are made with better grades of grain alcohol and purer water. Kristall's manager, Vladimir A. Yamnikov, would be familiar to any Westerner. Compact, efficient, a bit brusque, he has risen through the ranks and knows his business. He speaks bluntly about the difficulties and absurdities of state control, which deny him enough revenue and hard currency to update and expand, which would allow the state to make still more money. "We need more hard currency to modernize and replace our equipment," Mr. Yamnikov said. "But export taxes are too high, and we must sell our hard currency to the state. And given the rising costs of equipment and raw materials, our profits aren't enough to expand." Mr. Yamnikov works under thousands of restrictions, but the biggest drag on his production right now is the acute shortage of bottles. Part of the problem was the Gorbachev reform, when many millions of vodka and wine bottles were ground into dust by bulldozers. But the few big bottle factories in Russia -- the closest one to Moscow is in Kaluga, 250 miles away -- are themselves having trouble getting material from their suppliers. Mr. Yamnikov says his costs represent a little more than half his Government-fixed wholesale price of between 106 and 125 rubles, about 35 cents, a liter bottle. When Kristall had excess production for a while this summer because of cheap imports, it was allowed to sell to private dealers directly. But since vodka is once again regarded as in shortage with imposition of an export tax -- Vasily N. Doroshin, deputy minister of Moscow's Department of Industry and Trade, says Kristall now produces only 83 percent of Moscow's needs -- the factory may once again sell only to state stores and warehouses. Mr. Yamnikov throws up his hands. "Of course the criminals steal from trucks and buy vodka cheap from state stores with bribes. They try anything. But we sell at our fixed price, and we don't know where the vodka goes. It's not ours any more." The Private Market Lawbreaking Is Widespread By law in the Moscow region, stores may sell vodka only at a markup of 10 percent over their purchase price. Mr. Doroshin says the restrictions are supposed to prevent price gouging on a commodity that is in short supply but vital to social and political stability. But he acknowledges that he does not have enough people to enforce the restrictions, and that many state stores are selling vodka in bulk to private distributors, who then deliver the vodka to the kiosks they control. There, a liter of Kristall's Pshenichnaya, or grain vodka, which should be about 140 rubles at a state store, sells for 220 rubles or more, far exceeding the legal price ceilings. If asked, kiosk managers say that their cost was 200 rubles and they merely took their legal 10 percent markup. The manager of a commercial store on Chekhov Street, who asked for anonymity, said lawbreaking was widespread. In his store, he sold four Kristall factory brands: Pshenichnaya, for 220 rubles, and export-quality Moskovskaya and Limonnaya for 250 rubles. Export-quality Stolichnaya was 400 rubles a liter. He also sold two imported vodkas. One, called Rasputin, cost 600 rubles. American Smirnoff vodka, which is very chic here, was 2,000 rubles (about $5.90). "If we get vodka outside the state distribution system, it's a legal violation, so I can't discuss it with you," the manager said. When pressed, he said individuals and his "regular suppliers" come by with trucks and cars and offer some cases. "We don't ask how they get it and don't want to know. We just take some at the price they offer and sell it for a 25 percent markup." That itself is a violation. And where do these distributors get it? "People make deals with directors of the state liquor stores," he said. "If the store sells vodka for 100 rubles, say, you can get large quantities paying 120 rubles. Then you sell it for 250 rubles. That's why there's so little vodka in the state stores. But it's a huge violation." Vodka comes to state stores normally once a week, and immediately long lines of customers form to buy it at the state price. Often policemen stand at the entrances to prevent fighting and regulate the numbers of customers allowed in the store at any one time. Meanwhile, much of the vodka is going illegally out the back door. Mr. Doroshin, the Moscow trade official, says his job is nearly impossible. "I'm trying to regulate the market," he said, "but the market has its own laws. Real competition would be much better, with many factories competing and no shortages in the shops." One of his few real sanctions against the illegal trade from state shops is, ironically, privatization. Although only 270 of Moscow's 7,000 retail establishments are "fully privatized," Mr. Doroshin said, the others will be, transferred to the control of their current managers and employees. If he discovers violations of the markup limit, which also applies to private stores, he can fine a store 10,000 rubles ($30). But for a second or third violation, he said, "we can take the store away from the workers and sell it" at auction. "So the privatization process is crucial," he said. The Drunk Tank Beds Are Close To the Ground There are few more depressing places than the Sobering Station of the Sixth Regional Militia Department on Big Storchinovsky Lane in the Moskvoretsky district here. There are four wards containing 31 beds, all close to the ground so no one who falls to the floor will be hurt. On an average day, 29 men, most of them too drunk to stand, are brought here by the police. They are examined by Tamara G. Donskaya, 40 years old, a feldsher -- more than a nurse but less than a doctor -- who works a 24-hour shift, three days a week. She takes their blood pressure and examines their eyes, skin color and behavior, but does no blood test. If they are really sick, she phones an ambulance. Usually, however, they are like the old man in ragged clothing who needs help getting his trousers off. "Don't I have the right to drink?" he shouts. "Did you fall?" Mrs. Donskaya asks. "I've never fallen!" But he almost does as the police lead him, stripped to his underwear, to one of the wards. As they unlock the door, the smell of drink and stale sweat is overwhelming. Mrs. Donskaya keeps intermittent watch through a latched panel, and when her clients are sober, usually after four to six hours, she lets them go. 'It Saves Lives' "Actually, I hate this work," she said. "But it must be done, and in winter, especially, it saves lives." Drink is the Russian curse, says the acting director of the station, Lieut. Nikolai A. Vzhakin, 39. "Now that vodka is sold all the time, we get more clients. But at least we get fewer people drinking chemicals." The station charges its clients 150 rubles for its services, which can be deducted from salary if they work, plus fines ranging from 20 rubles for a first offense to 100 rubles. In the end, the Government gets paid by all but 23 percent of its drunken clients. Courts sometimes sentence repeat offenders to two months' labor at 20 percent of normal salary or put them in jail for 15 days. And the station must inform a client's workplace or family of his visit there. But everyone in this station knows that they are only bandaging a problem. Colonel Gunenkov of the Interior Ministry, who is in charge of the drunk tanks and almost everything else dealing with drunkenness, says, smiling, that the 150-ruble fee "is one of the cheapest services available now in Moscow, but somehow our clients aren't satisfied." He says that his budget has not gone up to match the increase in drunkenness and alcohol-related crime, but that the answer is not policing, but a change of mentality and attitude. It would help if this new democracy and freer market bring stability to people's lives instead of instability, he said. "I hope that capitalism will also bring more nice restaurants and bars, where people can drink socially and eat at the same time."

Meldrum & Fewsmith Inc. of Cleveland announced yesterday that it would acquire another northeastern Ohio advertising company, Hesselbart & Mitten/Arocom of Fairlawn, and combine operations. Each firm has about $65 million in billings and 100 employees. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. "I'm excited not so much for what it means immediately, but what it translates into in terms of future potential," said Chris N. Perry, Meldrum's chairman and chief executive. He will become chairman and chief executive of a new holding company, Meldrum & Fewsmith Communications Inc., as well as chairman and chief executive of the merged ad agencies, which will operate under the name Meldrum & Fewsmith Advertising. Meldrum's clients include Mr. Coffee, Libbey glass and Glidden paints, while Hesselbart's include General Electric's international lighting division, Genie garage-door openers and the Revco drugstore chain. All clients, with one exception, will become clients of the merged agency. In a conflict over tire clients, the merged agency will resign Meldrum's B. F. Goodrich Tire account, and retain Hesselbart's General Tire account. Leo J. LeFort, chairman of Hesselbart, will become chairman and chief executive of the holding company's two Arocom units, which will offer direct marketing and promotional marketing services. Other units will offer Yellow Pages advertising and media-buying services.

145-> Poland's Car-Tax Offer
Poland today offered Fiat, General Motors and Volkswagen the right to sell 10,000 cars each free of import tax this year provided they invest in the country. The Foreign Trade Ministry said that to take advantage of the offer the car makers would have to invest at least $50 million each in Polish car factories by mid-1992. The import tax on passenger cars in Poland is 35 percent.

147-> SPORTS PEOPLE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Cambridge Loses
The N.C.A.A. Eligibility Committee denied a second appeal by suspended Texas basketball player DEXTER CAMBRIDGE on Thursday, possibly ending the senior forward's college career. Cambridge played in Texas' first four games while under a temporary restraining order and hasn't played since. He was suspended in November for accepting a $7,000 check from a Lon Morris Junior College booster in 1990. It was alleged that Cambridge, who transferred to the University of Texas last season, received the money as a reward for being named a junior college All-American. (AP)

148-> Prison Escapee Caught
One of the two men who escaped from Somers State Prison on Dec. 31 was caught today outside a New York State hotel, Connecticut state police said Ronald Rutan was caught about 3:30 P.M. after a brief foot chase in Spring Valley, N.Y., about 85 miles southwest of Hartford, said Sgt. Dan Stebbins, a state police spokesman. A woman called New York authorities after seeing the syndicated television program "Hard Copy" on Tuesday night, Sergeant Stebbins said. The program profiled the other escapee, Frank Vandever, 37 years old, a transvestite serving a 40-year sentence for murder. Mr. Vandever remains at large.

149-> Police Account Offers Details of Critical Moments
While exonerating the officers at the scene of the fatal City College crush, the Police Department's preliminary report was far harsher on the organizers of the event than a review by the Dinkins administration. The police report included witnesses' assertions that the fatal stampede was triggered by two ticket-takers who fled their posts and that one of them later brandished a gun. In a nine-page letter to Milton Mollen, the city's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety who prepared the administration's report, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown provided a summary of the department's own investigation. The letter, dated Jan. 10 and made public yesterday, included a detailed chronology, almost minute by minute, of the events leading up to and immediately after the deaths. At 6:55 P.M., the letter stated, "The stairwell surge was triggered when, without warning to patrons still awaiting entry, a male and female at the ticket table at the top of the stairwell abandoned their post." The pair, whom the letter did not identify, went down the left side of the stairwell, which had been cordoned off, and went into the gym, the letter said. "The crowd followed, and in a matter of seconds filled both sides of the stairwell," the letter said. "The same male who left the ticket table shouted for someone to close the only door to the gymnasium that was still open. Apparently fearing that they would be locked out of the event, the crowd surged forward, with people at the back edge of the crowd climbing up and over the heads and shoulders of those in front of them." Commissioner Brown's letter reported that a witness said the same man then returned to the stairwell, "drew a revolver from a shoulder holster and chastised the surging crowd with expletives." In Mr. Mollen's report, no mention was made of the man with the gun.

150-> Armenians Gain in New Battle With Azerbaijanis
Armenian forces overran an Azerbaijani town today in a new explosion of fighting in a disputed enclave in the southern Caucasus region, news reports said. News agencies said Armenian forces had chased Azerbaijani units out of the town of Khojaly, leaving the city of Shusha as the only Azerbaijani stronghold inside the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan are in a bitter struggle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies within Azerbaijan but is populated mainly by Armenians. The news agency Interfax quoted the nationalist Azerbaijani Popular Front as saying that much of the town of Khojaly was "in ashes," with dozens of houses destroyed and many civilians killed or injured. Independent news agencies said Armenian fighters had also consolidated their hold on Nagorno-Karabakh's main airport, which had been under Azerbaijan's control. "It is a great victory for Armenians," a spokeswoman for the Armenian Parliament said from Yerevan, Armenia's capital. Azerbaijan's Interior Minister, Tofik Kerimov, said that almost 100 Azerbaijanis had been killed in the battle for Khojaly and that 250 had been wounded Armenian officials gave far lower figures but no firm estimate. Independent corroboration was not available. The republic of Azerbaijan responded to the capture of Khojaly with a fierce rocket attack on Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian center. The Azerbaijanis used launchers taken from the former Soviet Army, news reports said. -------------------- Soldiers Riot at Space Center ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan, Feb. 26 (Reuters) -- Three soldiers died when dozens of servicemen rioted and set fire to barracks at the former Soviet space center in Baikonur, officials and news reports said today. The independent Dana-Press agency said the trouble began on Monday, when a soldier from a military construction battalion at the former launching site for cosmonauts was detained in the nearby city of Leninsk. Fellow soldiers tried to free him from a military command post later that day and again on Tuesday. During the second raid, two dozen soldiers attacked the post and set fire to nearby barracks. The bodies of three soldiers were found later. About 500 members of the battalion met with their commanding general, officials and journalists to air grievances about ill treatment and poor food and demand the dismissal of officers, the news agency and a police official said.

151-> HOW TO END THE ABORTION WAR
Roger Rosenblatt's essay on abortion is timely and welcome ("How to End the Abortion War," Jan. 19). However, his belief that Americans can coalesce on a policy that "discourages" abortion without making it illegal is probably too optimistic. The polarization of Americans on this issue results from some pretty deep differences. Differences in life style, for one thing, can dictate profound political polarization. Many American women derive their most fundamental sense of self-worth from child-rearing and care of the family; many others find theirs in lives that include participation in the larger society, particularly the work place. For women in "traditional" families (and their husbands), untrammeled access to abortion constitutes a form of permissiveness that threatens the things they hold most dear. For women whose identities are tied to work outside the home, the right to control reproductive lives is essential. So I'm afraid these wars will continue. Rosenblatt and others should not tire in their efforts to find middle ground, but it would be unrealistic to think that we will be able to occupy it together anytime soon. PHILIP D. HARVEY Cabin John, Md.

152-> Woman in Abortion Dispute Ends Her Pregnancy
A North Dakota woman who was at the center of a bitter abortion battle quietly terminated her pregnancy Saturday, and opponents of abortion say state employees illegally assisted her. The woman, Martina Greywind of Fargo, is a desperately poor street person who is addicted to paint fumes. Her six children were previously taken away from her by the state. Opponents of abortion offered the 28-year-old Ms. Greywind food, shelter, medical care and at least $10,000 if she would have the baby, whether she kept it or gave it up for adoption. The offers were conveyed by the Lambs of Christ, a group whose members picket abortion clinics. The Lambs also came forward with five couples who wanted to adopt Ms. Greywind's baby if she decided she did not want to care for it. Meetings in Jail Members of the group who had been arrested in anti-abortion protests befriended Ms. Greywind in jail, where she had been serving time for sniffing paint, said Ronald Maxson, a spokesman for the Lambs. The Lambs have been in Fargo since last March trying to disrupt the the Fargo Women's Health Clinic and have been repeatedly jailed. The Fargo clinic is the only abortion clinic in the state. Mr. Maxson accused the public prosecutor in Fargo of pressuring Ms. Greywind to have an abortion by charging her with reckless endangerment of her fetus. If convicted of the charges, which have not been dropped, Ms. Greywind faces a year in prison and a $1,000 fine. An additional inducement, Mr. Maxson said, was an offer by an anonymous donor to pay the $340 that the Fargo clinic charges to terminate a pregnancy. North Dakota does not pay for abortions for indigent women. Members of the Lambs said Ms. Greywind had told them that she did not want an abortion, while an official of the abortion clinic said she had told the staff there that she did want one. "She is a woman of great ambivalence," Mr. Maxson said. He said that when the Lambs asked her about the abortion, she at first denied that she had had it and then refused to discuss it with them. Ms. Greywind, who is in a state mental hospital being treated for drug addiction, could not be reached for comment. To enable Ms. Greywind to have an abortion if she chose to have one, a Fargo judge wrote an order saying she could be released from jail for a medical or psychological procedure. Ms. Greywind was driven to Fargo from the mental hospital in Jamestown for the procedure. Jane Bovard, director of the clinic where the abortion was performed, said she could not comment on any aspects of it. Mr. Maxson said state employees had broken state law by assisting Ms. Greywind's abortion. He said the state used its sheriff's vehicles to transport Ms. Greywind more than 100 miles from the state hospital to the abortion clinic. North Dakota law prohibits the use of state money to promote abortions, Mr. Maxson said. He said the Lambs planned to sue North Dakota for abetting Ms. Greywind's abortion. But, he added, the group wished Ms. Greywind well and was continuing to visit her. Ms. Greywind, Mr. Maxson said, "is simply interested in going on now." "And we want her to do that, too," he said. "We want her to get on with her life."

153-> SPORTS PEOPLE: PRO FOOTBALL; Saints Get Pinkett
The New Orleans Saints acquired a veteran running back, ALLEN PINKETT, from the Houston Oilers yesterday in return for a fifth-round choice in the 1992 N.F.L. draft. Pinkett, a third-round Houston draft choice out of Notre Dame in 1986, is expected to fill a need created by the retirement of REUBEN MAYES and injuries which sidelined the starting tandem of DALTON HILLIARD and CRAIG HEYWARD for much of last season. In six seasons at Houston, Pinkett, 28, carried 567 times for 2,324 yards and rushed for 21 touchdowns. He also caught 119 passes for 921 yards and 4 touchdowns, and last season returned 26 kickoffs for a 19.5-yard average. (AP)

154-> Art Galleries, Old and Older
The Wadsworth Atheneum is a wonderful institution, and it seems a shame to splash a little cold water on its 150th anniversary (Jan. 12), but the honor of being the oldest art gallery in the United states belongs to another nearby Connecticut institution. The Yale University Art Gallery, known then as the Trumbull Gallery, opened its doors in 1832, a decade before the Wadsworth Atheneum. The new gallery was, interestingly, in part supported by a grant of $7,000 in bank stock from the Connecticut legislature. The gallery mainly, but not exclusively, displayed the Revolutionary War paintings by Col. John Trumbull that he had given to Yale College, "to be exhibited forever for the benefit of poor students, provided the College will pay me a competent annuity for the remainder of my life." The Trumbull paintings have been on display at Yale in one building or another ever since (with Mr. and Mrs. Trumbull always buried, as they had requested, nearby -- even when that meant moving the bodies). Thomas Sizer, a professor of art at Yale and director of the gallery, described the Yale Art Gallery as one of the oldest in the English-speaking world, having as its chief chronological rival the National Gallery in London. Even if the Atheneum's claim is that it is the oldest public art museum, I think Yale still is first, since I believe its gallery has always been open to the public. BROOKS MATHER KELLEY Guilford

156-> In China, as in Its Neighbors, Repression Pays
To the Editor: "Helping Hand, Heavy Foot: Both Are the Real China" (The Week in Review, Jan. 26) puzzles over the paradox of rapid growth amid political repression in China -- China's failure to "fit into a mold." You contrast China with other Communist countries, which "simultaneously repressed and impoverished their citizens." In addition to the Soviet Union, you compare China with Iraq under Saddam Hussein and with India. Almost the only countries you fail to mention are the rapidly growing Confucian societies in East Asia. To a student of these societies -- Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- there is nothing unprecedented about the combination of rapid economic growth and a political mailed fist. On a population-adjusted basis, more lives were sacrificed by far on the altar of political stability in Korea's 1971 Kwangju massacre than 18 years later in Beijing. On Feb. 28, 1974, the Taiwan government, transplanted from the mainland, crushed an uprising at a cost of at least 10,000 deaths; the Taiwan population has since been docile. Political repression in Hong Kong and Singapore has been less bloody, but no less effective. We in the West habitually allow the economic successes of these countries to overshadow the political side. How curious, then, that with China we focus on politics, ignoring the rapid growth. Over the last quarter-century per capita gross national product in China grew at the astonishing rate of nearly 6 percent; the only countries in the world that grew faster were its four neighbors in East Asia. That growth rate has accelerated sharply since 1980. We are now witnessing the emergence of the fifth East Asian superstar -- as repressive as the first four. Only when we see that all five were shaped in a single mold, will we clearly understand where their growth performance is coming from. BRUCE L. REYNOLDS Schenectady, N.Y., Jan. 29, 1992 The writer, a visiting fellow at Cornell University, is a professor of economics at Union College.

157-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Presenting '15 Best Ideas' For Ads That Work Better
A REPORT on how advertisers can make their ads work better -- one of the most discussed issues in the business -- contains several recommendations that are likely to be controversial. The report, called "The 15 Best Ideas for Improving Media and Marketing Effectiveness in 1992," is to be released next week by Myers Marketing and Research, a Parsippany, N.J., advertising and marketing consulting firm perhaps best known for its annual forecasts of growth in ad spending. The ideas were contributed by some of the nation's largest advertisers, and an advance copy was made available by the consulting firm's president, Jack Myers. The report "grew out of a point of view of looking to see how we can make advertising and media work better for all of us," Mr. Myers said in a telephone interview. A long-range goal, he added, would be "to bring advertising, as an industry, back onto a level playing field with promotion and direct marketing." Such methods of reaching consumers are continuing to compete with traditional advertising for clients' dollars. Of the report's recommendations, one that could possibly touch off the most debate was to "recognize product placement in movies as a new medium." Companies pay a fee for their products to appear on screen in a film, but consumer organizations have widely castigated such placements as commercials in disguise. Indeed, they are often cited as a primary example of the growing commercialization of American communications. Yet, Mr. Myers said of product placement, "it was really interesting to me how many clients mentioned this" as a worthwhile idea. For those marketers with products that are "very visible and identifiable," he added, "it's a real opportunity." "A.T.& T., for instance," he continued. "There's a telephone in every movie." Another potentially controversial suggestion, although Mr. Myers termed it "a very basic component of a company's marketing activities," was that marketers create minority review boards to evaluate "opportunities taken and missed" in regard to ethnic groups, the disabled and special audiences like the military. That could open marketers to charges of making targets of certain groups of consumers and trying to exploit them. In recent years, such charges, particularly involving products aimed at black consumers, have forced products like Power Master malt liquor and Uptown cigarettes off the market. Another recommendation likely to raise eyebrows was for marketers to review agency compensation agreements, exploring fee-based compensation for media buying and planning services. Agencies, already deeply disturbed by the erosion of their traditional 15 percent commission on total billings, would be expected to resist such a move. Mr. Myers, however, said fee-based compensation could include bonuses for devising especially effective media strategies. The report will be sent to the more than 3,000 members of Myers's Worldwide Marketing Leadership Panel, which represents executives at consumer-product companies and ad agencies around the country. Working on the report were members of the panel's board of directors, including Jeffrey Brooks, senior vice president of corporate advertising at the Sony Corporation of America; Philip Guarascio, the executive in charge of corporate marketing and advertising at the General Motors Corporation; Paul Mulcahy, vice president of marketing services at the Campbell Soup Company, and Peter J. Spengler, vice president of advertising services at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mr. Myers plans additional efforts to address advertising effectiveness. During this year's first quarter, he hopes to begin a feasibility study of better ways to measure traditional advertising's effect on product sales.

158-> Game-Tying Shot in Last Second Gives Turcotte Goal Medal
The Rangers had the manpower but they didn't have much time. Nevertheless, with two extra skaters on the ice, they got a goal from Darren Turcotte with just half a second left in regulation yesterday to salvage a 3-3 tie with the Vancouver Canucks at Madison Square Garden. Defenseman Gerald Diduck of the Canucks had been given a five-minute major for checking Kris King from behind with 3 minutes 8 seconds left in the third period. But the Rangers were doing little with the man advantage when Coach Roger Neilson called for a timeout with 50 seconds left. Neilson said afterward that he had no recollection of what was discussed at the Rangers' bench during the timeout. Still, he made one decision during that momentary breather: Goalie John Vanbiesbrouck would stay on the bench instead of in the net so the Rangers could put still one more attacker on the ice. 'No Idea How Much Time Is Left' With six skaters to the Canucks' four, the Rangers swarmed around Vancouver's goal as the clock wound down and it was Turcotte who, just in time, found a way to beat goalie Kirk McLean with a rising shot from close range in a crowded crease. "There were six or seven guys in front trying to get the puck and you have no idea how much time there is left," Turcotte said of his tying goal, which he celebrated to a standing ovation by the sellout crowd of 18,200 at the holiday matinee. Turcotte, and the rest of the Rangers, had a golden opportunity to win the game in overtime since the penalty to Diduck extended nearly two minutes into the extra period. But they came up empty in overtime despite four shots against McLean. "We were tired after playing four games in six nights, but we kept digging and digging," said Mike Gartner, who assisted on Turcotte's dramatic goal, his 24th of the season. Brian Leetch and James Patrick had the other goals for the Rangers (37-19-4), who took 43 shots against McLean and scored all their goals on the power play. Bure Leads Canucks Pavel Bure, a Russian who spent several seasons with the Red Army team, had two of the three goals for the Canucks, who took 38 shots against Vanbiesbrouck, all but one of them in regulation.. Vanbiesbrouck, who was making his eighth consecutive start, looked sharp throughout with several good saves. His best save came on a penalty shot by Bure: Vanbiesbrouck poked the puck away as the rookie forward tried to deke him from left to right. "He's got a whole arsenal," Vanbiesbrouck said of Bure. "I played against him in the world championships last year. One of his tricks is to fake you out and go to his backhand." The tie left Vanbiesbrouck undefeated in his last 14 games against the Canucks. The other 13 were all victories, including a 5-2 triumph last Wednesday night at the Garden. Neilson and several Ranger players blamed fatigue for their failure to come up with another triumph against the Canucks, who are now without a victory in their last six games (0-5-1). "I thought we looked tired," Neilson said. "Basically, we were going with three lines and that might have hurt us because they were going with four lines." Dumb, Says Diduck Pat Quinn, the coach of the Canucks, who finished their five-game road trip without a victory, refused to criticize the officials for calling the crucial five-minute penalty on Diduck. "They have a tough job and sometimes don't see everything," he said. "It was a dumb play on my part whether the call was right or wrong," Diduck, the former Islander, said of his penalty for checking King. On Sunday, in a game against the Devils, King received a game misconduct for the same type of infraction. "The important thing is we played the way the Canucks have played most of the year," Diduck said. Despite their horrendous trip, the Canucks are still atop the Smythe Division with a record of 30-19-9. Their 69 points are 4 more than they came up with in 80 games last season. SLAP SHOTS DOUG WEIGHT was recalled by the Rangers from Binghamton, where he was sent for two weeks of conditioning after suffering a broken right hand. He had 15 points in seven games with Binghamton, the Rangers' top affiliate in the minor leagues. Binghamton's 31-17-8 record is the best in the American Hockey League. . . . RANDY MOLLER was inserted for NORMAND ROCHEFORT on defense, the only change Coach ROGER NEILSON made after the Rangers' 4-2 loss to the Devils on Sunday. . . . Vancouver was awarded a penalty shot because JOHN VANBIESBROUCK threw his stick to intercept the puck 2 minutes 43 seconds into the middle period. . . . MARK MESSIER'S assist on the goal by BRIAN LEETCH extended his scoring streak to seven games. . . . The Rangers are 10-0-2 in their last 12 games against the Canucks.

159-> Canadian Troops to Pull Out of Europe by '94
Reflecting eased East-West tensions and Canada's severe budget constraints, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government has announced that it will pull out all its combat forces from Europe by the end of 1994. The decision, which was disclosed late Tuesday in the Government's newest budget, a fiscal blueprint for the coming 12 months, has stirred angry reactions from the Bush Administration and NATO headquarters, mirroring fears that it will increase Congressional pressures for faster American withdrawal and unravel the 43-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A State Department spokesman said Washington was "very disappointed" and would have "greatly preferred a continuing Canadian presence within the NATO force structure in Europe." The NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, noted Ottawa's action "with considerable regret, given the political and military importance of the presence of Canadian forces in Europe," according to a statement issued from his office in Brussels. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States, which had as many as 350,000 troops in Europe during the most intense phases of the cold war, has now cut back its force levels to 220,000 and plans to reduce still further to 150,000 by 1995, a Pentagon spokesman said. Canada has already announced significant force cutbacks. But a token level was still "psychologically very important," said Alex Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, an Ottawa-based public policy research group. He said that if troops are already in place, a decision to swell the ranks, should the need arise, boils down to whether or not to reinforce, while with zero forces, "a decision to send troops to Europe becomes one of a completely different political magnitude." Mr. Morrison critized the move as "a withdrawal of Canada into itself" and said it would "reduce the importance of Canada's voice not only in NATO but in general European security matters." Canada's Defense Ministry had already announced substantial cuts last September, the closing of two bases in Germany -- at Lahr and Baden-Sollingen, both in Germany's southwestern corner -- and the reduction of soldiers and fliers in Europe from 6,600 to 1,100 by the end of 1995. In announcing total withdrawal in his budget speech, Canada's Finance Minister, Don Mazankowski, said that "since September 1991, the world has changed a great deal." He insisted that the "peace dividend" was possible "without lessening our commitment to NATO solidarity." The move is part of $2.2 billion in cuts to Canadian military spending over the next five years. Canada now spends $12 billion a year on defense, less than 4 percent of the $307 billion President Bush proposes for the military in the current fiscal year. American military spending is more than twice the entire Canadian budget. But Canada's accumulated debt is proportionately as large as the United States, and higher Canadian interest rates mean proportionately heavier annual interest charges. While the Canadian withdrawal is expected to strengthen the voice of those in Congress who want drastic reductions of the $150 billion a year NATO military bill of the United States, it is also likely to influence attitudes in Europe. Prof. Simon Serfaty, a specialist in Atlantic relations at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said that for the Europeans "it will confirm the perception that all of the New World is going home, and it might increase European interest in developing an autonomous defense entity that would be distinct from NATO." Since the mid-1980's, he noted, the Europeans have been talking of reviving an aborted initiative of the early 1950's that called for a European Defense Community to exist along side the European Community. Still, many in Canada welcomed the Government decision and wanted the Government to go even further in trimming military outlays.

160-> Charles Nagel, 93, Former Head Of the Brooklyn Museum, Dies
Charles Nagel, a former director of the Brooklyn Museum and other art institutions, died last Thursday at a hospital in Wareham, Mass. He was 93 years old and had lived for the last seven years in Marion, Mass. He died of pneumonia, said his wife, the former Lucie Lull Oliver. An architect who turned to museum work, Mr. Nagel was director of the Brooklyn Museum from 1946 to 1955, where he was cited for his contributions to art education and industrial design. From 1955 until his retirement in 1964, he was director of the St. Louis Art Museum. After his retirement, he became the first director of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. He stayed in the post until 1969, overseeing renovation of the Old Patent Office Building in downtown Washington, which now houses the museum, and its opening in 1968. At the portrait gallery, Mr. Nagel became embroiled in a dispute over his purchase and intention to hang a portrait of President Lyndon B. Johnson, painted in 1966 by Peter Hurd. The President had pronounced the portrait "the ugliest thing I ever saw." Mr. Nagel bought the painting knowing it was unacceptable to Mr. Johnson. He cited it as "a good likeness" and "a serious picture." But he was overruled by Ladybird Johnson and Dillon Ripley, then the head of the Smithsonian, and a bronze bust of the President was substituted. Mr. Nagel, who was born in St. Louis, was the son of Charles Nagel, Secretary of Commerce and Labor in the Cabinet of President William Howard Taft. The younger Nagel graduated in 1923 from Yale, which awarded him a B.F.A. in 1926. He also studied at the American School in Fontainebleau, France, and in 1956 received a Ph.D. in fine arts from MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. Mr. Nagel practiced architecture in Boston and St. Louis from 1927 to 1942, taking time out, from 1930 to 1936, to serve as curator of decorative arts at the Yale Art Gallery. He was the author of "American Furniture, 1650-1850," published in 1949, and "Seven Letters to Counsel," a short novel, published in 1965. In 1936, he collaborated on "American Rooms," with Russell Kettell. He is survived by his wife.

161-> At a Standstill In Prague
After spending some time recently in Prague, we went to the main railroad station to go to (Marienbad) Marianske Lazne. Knowing the departure time of our train, but not the number of the track, we went directly to the information office. "Nobody knows, I don't know," was the answer. Going with my husband into the waiting hall to get some information, we thought we were in a science-fiction movie. People were standing there in the hundreds. Just standing there, all looking up, all staring into the same direction. Frozen. Their eyes glued to something. Nobody moved, nothing moved. No sound. Everybody just staring. Waiting for something to happen. Very eerie. It seemed time had stopped. We looked at each other. "That's Kafkaesque," we said to each other at the same time. I don't know how long we were there standing, too, when we noticed an empty electronic bulletin board up against the ceiling. Nobody budged. After waiting for about 45 minutes, suddenly the time and track number of our train appeared. Everybody became alive and started running to catch their train. I should say stampeding. A Czech student, going back to college, with whom we had become acquainted on our trip, told us people are familiar with Kafka, but the expression "Kafkaesque" is not known in Czechoslovakia. Just one more thing. Prague is a gem. Marianske Lazne (Marienbad) is one big blossoming park, pretty wooded area and newly renovated houses in Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) built at the turn of the century. GINA TURTIL SCHER New Hyde Park

162-> Books of The Times; 2 Justices Are Dead. Who Profits?
The Pelican Brief By John Grisham 371 pages. Doubleday. $22.50. At the opening of John Grisham's intriguing but ultimately specious new thriller, "The Pelican Brief," two Supreme Court Justices, one liberal and one highly erratic, are murdered in a single evening, one of them at home, the other at a pornographic movie theater for homosexuals. The President of the United States is delighted. As his chief of staff assures him: "This is the perfect crisis, Mr. President. Think of it. We didn't create it. It's not our fault. No one can blame us. And the nation will be shocked into some degree of solidarity. It's rally round the leader time. It's just great. No downside." The murderer, we know, is a super lone-wolf ex-terrorist named Khamel, who, as one character explains, is "the most proficient and expensive assassin in the world," "can kill with either hand, either foot, a car key, a pencil, whatever" and "speaks 12 languages." But why, the reader naturally wonders, would Khamel have it in for a couple of Supreme Court Justices, whose main claims to fame were defending the Second Amendment and protecting the environment? Switch scenes now to New Orleans, where a hungover Tulane University law professor named Thomas Callahan is awakened by Darby Shaw, the beautiful and brilliant student he is sleeping with, and told of the assassinations. Tom, who idolized one of the dead Justices, is so devastated that Darby goes to the law-school library and puts together a wildly speculative brief naming the powerful and politically connected figure who profited most from the assassinations. Tom is impressed enough by the brief to pass it on to an old friend, Gavin Verheek, who works for the F.B.I., who turns it over to the Director, F. Denton Voyles, who decides to show it to the President, who asks Voyles not to press the matter. A few evenings later, Darby and Tom eat dinner out. Tom drinks too much and Darby asks him not to drive home. Tom drunkenly insists and Darby hangs back from the car. Tom starts his Porsche, which explodes into a fireball. Darby, watching the burning wreckage, realizes that the car bomb was probably meant for her. Apparently her research, called the "pelican brief" for reasons that the reader will by and by learn, was not so wildly speculative. Mr. Grisham's novel has some clever fun with both the political thriller as a form and a plot that takes off on events of the past two decades in Washington. The F.B.I. plays hardball with the Oval Office, which is managed by an overzealous chief of staff who runs a heavily financed Committee to Re-elect the President. Unlikely people keep getting killed, potential heroes and potential villains. But though "The Pelican Brief" is diverting, it is rarely disturbing. The story keeps throwing away its opportunities. The main problem is that the characters are about as complex as so many lengths of lead pipe. Darby herself is brilliant and sexy and hunted, but there's no dimension to her. She isn't even as interesting as Mitch McDeere, the protagonist of Mr. Grisham's best-selling previous novel, "The Firm," with whom you could at least identify for feeling overworked on his first job. And whenever your heart begins to soften toward Darby, she utters sentences like these: "I left New Orleans a week ago today. Thomas and Verheek had dinner two weeks ago today. That, of course, was the fateful moment when the pelican brief changed hands." Hey, Darby! We know our fateful moments when they rear their portentous heads. Nor is "The Pelican Brief" really about anything in particular. If it takes as its premise that people in power are brutally cynical and manipulative and will do just about anything to get a leg up, it never questions that view or explores it even shallowly. Darby's main desire is to get away from it all to the Caribbean, which in her vision resembles an airline advertisement. All the novel really wants is to be exciting and violent. The deepest thing it has to say about itself comes up in a description of how the assassin Khamel went about learning English. "He had absorbed the language while hiding in Belfast, and the past 20 years had watched thousands of American movies. His favorite was 'Three Days of the Condor.' He watched it four times before he figured out who was killing whom and why. He could have killed Redford." Reading "The Pelican Brief," I could have put it down.

163-> 250 at CUNY Sue New York, Citing Racial Bias in Budget
In a case that will test a legal strategy already used with some success in the South, more than 250 professors and students at the City University of New York sued New York State today, contending that the way it finances public higher education is racially discriminatory. The suit aims to prove that the state gives significantly more money per student each year to the State University of New York, whose population is largely white, than to CUNY, two-thirds of whose students come from minority groups, and that this amounts to racial bias in financing. The plaintiffs want to force the state to give tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year more to CUNY, although a leader of the effort, Dr. Sheldon Weinbaum, a professor of mechanical engineering at CUNY, said they did not want to see it done simply by shifting more money from one university to the other. He said that recent budget cuts at both SUNY and CUNY, the largest- and third-largest university systems in the country, were "disgraceful" and that both systems should be financed more generously. But given the state's chronic budget problems, some lawmakers said today that the two systems were reduced to warring with each other over scarce funds and that the lawsuit reflected the phenomenon. The lawsuit mirrors bids by several historically black colleges, and by a group of Hispanic colleges near the Mexican border in Texas, to gain more money by charging racial bias in state financing. At least two of those suits have been successful while the longest-running one, in Mississippi, has reached the United States Supreme Court and is expected to be decided shortly. In papers filed in State Supreme Court this morning, the CUNY group charged that the state financing per full-time student last year was $7,653 at SUNY and only $6,927 at CUNY, a difference of more than $700. SUNY administrators, however, immediately dismissed those numbers as misleading, arguing that there were several differences that would account for higher SUNY spending. For one thing, they argued, SUNY runs several costly medical, dental and technical programs for which there is no equivalent at CUNY. But when SUNY officials were repeatedly asked today for their own set of comparisons of recent financing levels, they said they were unable to calculate such figures. They instead cited a state Education Department study of 1988-89 budgets that they said showed similar financing for comparable divisions of the two systems, like four-year colleges. These conflicting numbers -- which will now be argued over in court -- reflect the thorny question of allocating state resources between institutions in New York City and the SUNY system, nearly all of whose 64 campuses are outside the city. As with elementary school aid, transportation financing and a host of other areas, that battle often pits the Democratic-led Assembly that reflects the city's interests -- many Assembly officials say they agree with the plaintiffs in the CUNY suit -- against the more suburban- and upstate-oriented lawmakers in the Republican-controlled State Senate. The lawsuit names Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders as the defendants, since they determine state priorities every year when they put together the budget. 'The Court Will Tell Us' "I think they're wrong, but the law is the law," Mr. Cuomo said of the plaintiffs at a news conference this afternoon. "They'll go to court and the court will tell us what's right and wrong." The Governor said it was possible that SUNY did receive more than CUNY per student, but he noted, "There's a difference between disparity and illegal disparity." Beyond that, the matter of proving racial discrimination may be more complex than in some of the cases tried in the South, including the 16-year-old Mississippi lawsuit. In Mississippi, the racial divisions between university systems were almost total; In New York, the CUNY system does include many white students, and SUNY's student population is about 18 percent minority. 'An Equivalent Basis' Nevertheless, in language that echoes that of the famous Brown v. Board of Education case that outlawed mandatory school segregation, the plaintiffs' case asserts that the state has two "separate and unequal" university systems based largely on the racial makeup of student bodies. The CUNY faculty members and students are represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a public-interest law firm in Manhattan. In the wake of the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's, New York State assumed responsibility for financing CUNY's four-year colleges and graduate programs, essentially leaving it to the Legislature to decide how to divide taxpayers' money between SUNY and CUNY. But although Hugh L. Carey, who was the governor at that time, said CUNY campuses would be financed on "an equivalent basis" to SUNY schools, no formal mechanism was ever established for guaranteeing parity. Educators and lawmakers have quarreled ever since on whether the financing is fair, but the discrimination lawsuit represents a novel approach in the New York state courts in resolving the matter. SUNY officials said they believed that current financing levels were low for both systems but at least equitably divided. Although CUNY could obviously stand to benefit from a victory for the plaintiffs, administrators there publicly refrained from endorsing the lawsuit and focused instead on the broader question of financing for the public universities.

164-> In Minnesota, Pressure Builds for a Health-Care Insurance Plan
As politicians in Washington jockey for advantage in the debate over access to health care, Minnesota is working toward its own solution, a universal health-care plan that would subsidize the working poor, force insurers to cover people in high-risk groups and require greater cost efficiency. For weeks, Democrats and Republicans here in the Minnesota capital have been negotiating a compromise measure to introduce during the legislative session that opens Tuesday. Protests and opinion polls suggest that Minnesotans worry about health care more than about education or taxes, although only about 7 percent of Minnesotans are not covered by some sort of health insurance. And legislators fear that if they do not come up with some kind of plan this term, voters will get back at them in November, when all 201 seats in the Minnesota Legislature are up for grabs. "There is a sense that the Legislature has to act," said Lois Quam, an insurance executive and the chairwoman of a state advisory committee set up to recommend legislation. "There is enormous pressure to take something home for the '92 election. There is a sense of urgency from Minnesotans because people feel vulnerable and unprotected." About 200 people showed up Friday in the Capitol Rotunda for a rally demanding action on health care. Many told stories of losing coverage or facing premiums that had grown to half their income. About 30 other states have health-care legislation under consideration. Some measures would create state-run insurance programs and others would require employers to either buy coverage for their workers or contribute to a state insurance pool. Last Year, a Veto But Minnesota has come closer to enacting such a sweeping measure than any other state in the three years since Oregon created a plan, now awaiting Federal approval, to expand eligibility for Medicaid, ration medical services and require employers to buy coverage for their workers. Proposals in most other states are still being studied or are stalled in committee. But last year, the Democratic-led Legislature in Minnesota approved by fairly wide margins a bill that would have gradually introduced an optional state-run insurance program with a low-cost benefits package, put limits on private-market premiums and directly subsidized the working poor. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Arne H. Carlson, a Republican, who said it would cost too much. The first-term Governor is one of the few state politicians not up for re-election this year, but he has his own problems with the voters. A Minneapolis Star-Tribune poll taken last month found that he had a disapproval rating of 55 percent, the highest such rating of any governor in the 48 years the poll has been taken. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percent. Governor Carlson made it to the executive office by the quirkiest of circumstances. He became the Republican nominee in the final days of the 1990 gubernatorial campaign when the original nominee, John Grunseth, dropped out after accusations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Carlson campaigned for only nine days and defeated Rudy Perpich, the Democratic incumbent, 50.1 percent to 46.7 percent. With his own popularity slipping, Governor Carlson now appears willing to work out some kind of agreement on health care. The Governor's Goals He told the negotiators working on the bill that he wanted to increase access to the private insurance market rather than see the state go into the insurance business. He has endorsed subsidies and state income tax deductions for low-income Minnesotans and price controls on private premiums. He also has endorsed so-called healthy lifestyle discounts for people who, for example, exercise regularly or do not smoke. Otherwise, he has essentially left the Republican negotiators to represent his views and has left the legislators alone to do their job. "He's committed to getting something passed this year," said Jill Sammon, the governor's legislative relations director. "He feels there is a need to get health care to everyone but that we can't bankrupt the state to do it." The state Government is facing a $340 million budget deficit. Much of the bill he vetoed, however, is still on the table along with the more modest proposals from insurance groups and the governor. Whatever comes out of the session this year will not go so far as to put all health coverage immediately in the hands of the state, principal negotiators say. Although employers would be encouraged and enticed to provide insurance for their workers, the legislation is unlikely to require it, as Hawaii has done since the 1970's. The Minnesota plan will likely be a hybrid, negotiators say, one that involves state subsidies for low- to moderate-income people, strict cost controls and a prohibition of underwriting practices that either effectively lock out small businesses and very sick people. Under the Democrats' bill, insurance companies would no longer be able to refuse to cover people on the basis of such things as gender, occupation or preexisting condition, a provision that most of the negotiators agree upon. The emphasis on underwriting practices is a distinctive feature of the proposals in Minnesota. Speaking of last year's vetoed legislation, Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a consumer health advocacy group in Washington, said the state went further in trying to change health care insurance than any other state. "Minnesota is not just prohibiting the denial of insurance but is seriously trying to prohibit discriminatory pricing," he said. The loudest critics of such a plan are insurance companies who say that price controls will send many insurers out of the state and that assigning all residents to the same risk pool regardless of age or health status will make the healthy bear the burden of the sick. The private insurance lobby proposes a stripped-down benefits package for small businesses, arguing that most uninsured people are not covered because they work for small businesses that cannot afford to insure them. "The key is to help the Main Street merchants -- the bakery shop, the hardware store, the transmission shop with six to eight employees -- to buy insurance for their workers," said Ralph J. Marlatt, president of the Insurance Federation of Minnesota, a trade group of private insurers. The pressure for change is strong n a state that has a reputation for social innovation and already has one of the highest insurance participation rates in the country. The state has been a leader in the movement toward health management organizations and 93 percent of Minnesotans carry some type of health insurance, compared with a figure of 86 percent for all of the United States. But about 370,000 Minnesotans still are without health coverage at any given time. In 1990, 11,000 were denied treatment because they did not carry insurance. And many people with insurance are not adequately covered or cannot afford premiums that sharply outpace inflation and wage increases, legislators and health care experts say. Legislators say that because the state is already further ahead than most, it should be easier to fill the gap. The main question facing legislators is how to pay for the plan. The sense of urgency in Minnesota reflects the turns the debate has taken nationally. "We are no longer talking about whether we need a national health-care plan but rather what type is needed," said Dr. Joel Weissman, an instructor in health-care policy at Harvard Medical School. "We are no longer talking about mending the safety net, but rather providing more insurance opportunities for people so they don't fall in the net to begin with."

165-> A New Momentum at Mellon
Five years after a double slug of bad real estate and energy loans sent it reeling, the Mellon Bank Corporation has regained much of its strength. While problems remain, like the fallout from past real estate lending, the bank founded 123 years ago by the wealthy Mellon family has broken with its past as a corporate lender and managed to find profits elsewhere. Under Frank V. Cahouet, the folksy banking veteran who is chairman, president and chief executive, Mellon has sharply reduced its inventory of bad loans and curtailed its corporate lending, where the headaches are big and the profits small. The strategy, which Mr. Cahouet began putting into effect almost as soon as he joined Mellon in 1987, calls for lending to small companies and consumers, where the growth and profits seem limitless. Centerpiece of Recovery Most important, Mr. Cahouet (pronounced COW-et) has expanded Mellon's service businesses, like overseeing personal investments, managing cash for corporations and handling data-processing for smaller banks. While these businesses had been important to Mellon, under Mr. Cahouet they have become the centerpiece for the bank's recovery, contributing a rising share of revenues and the largest single portion -- an estimated 40 percent -- of Mellon's record 1991 profit. The business shift has also caused a big swing in the mix of Mellon's $29.4 billion in assets. Consumer lending, which at the end of 1986 accounted for 19 percent of Mellon's total, is now 34 percent. Meanwhile, lending to blue-chip companies, which earned Mellon the sobriquet "the J. P. Morgan of the Alleghenies," has fallen slightly since 1986, to about 46 percent of assets from 50 percent. "The momentum in Mellon's service business is tremendous," said Livia S. Asher, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Still, Mellon is not without troubles, nor its strategy without skeptics. With 31 percent of its real estate loans nonperforming, analysts say, Mellon may have to take additional write-downs against income to account for further declines in property values. Mellon's operating expenses have also been rising rapidly. And while profit margins remain rich in Mellon's service businesses, the margins are under pressure from price cutting. Mellon also has an investor-relations problem. A 1988 decision to sell $1.4 billion in bad loans at a loss chafed investors. Investors were also piqued by Mellon's step that year to build its capital by selling stock to a European investor group, E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, which diluted existing shareholders' ownership and gave Warburg 16 percent of Mellon's common stock, making it Mellon's largest single shareholder. "Mellon lost a lot of its core institutional shareholders after that transaction," said Kristina E. Andersson of Smith Barney. Coming Off a Record Year For 1991, Mellon reported record earnings of $280 million, or $4.66 a share, up from $174 million, or $2.83 a share, in 1990. Return on assets, a widely cited measure of a bank's profitability, stood at an impressive 0.96 percent of assets -- eighth best among the top 25 banks as ranked by assets, and in line with the industry's 1 percent goal. And Mellon's 15.8 percent return on equity exceeded the industry's 15 percent goal. Those profits earned Mellon's employees a paid day off this year in a thank-you gesture by Mr. Cahouet. Last year, by contrast, merit pay increases were deferred for all workers, and bonuses and vacations for top officers were slashed after a 1990 fourth-quarter loss of $99 million. In the last 10 years, Mellon has laid off more than 4,000 people. "Arguably, Cahouet saved the company from a dire fate," said Thaddeus W. Paluszek," the Mellon analyst at Kidder, Peabody. How Mellon Became 'Good' Mr. Cahouet's first big move, novel in 1988, was for Mellon to accept a few cents on the dollar on a bad loan to be rid of it, instead of waiting years to collect a little more. This "good bank/bad bank" strategy, as it is known in the industry, allowed Mellon, as the "good" bank, to keep its performing loans, and sweep away $1.4 billion in troubled loans by selling them to a "bad" bank called Grant Street National Bank. The sale cut Mellon's nonperforming asset ratio to 5.03 percent at the end of 1988 from its 8.01 percent peak in 1987, when rumors persisted that Mellon was in danger of failing. Since then, Mellon has been working with reasonable success to improve the quality of its remaining loans, with the nonperforming ratio at 4.78 percent at the end of 1991. Leading the effort has been Richard H. Daniel, a Mellon vice chairman and longtime friend of Mr. Cahouet's from the days when the two were colleagues at Security Pacific Bank in California. In banking circles, Mr. Daniel, who goes by the name Dick, is regarded as one of the industry's best loan-collection men. Squat and bespectacled, with a fire-plug physique, Mr. Daniel has an urn on his desk to hold, he says, "the ashes of customers who don't pay." Nonperforming Assets Mr. Daniel has kept Mellon's good loans in good shape. Excluding commercial real estate, Mellon's nonperforming asset ratio stood at a slim 1.3 percent last Dec. 31, one of the strongest ratios in the industry. The problem, though, is that Mellon continues to have a large number of real estate loans. Under David Barnes, Mr. Cahouet's predecessor as chief executive, Mellon lent heavily to developers in Texas, Colorado and Louisiana, trying to take advantage of the oil boom in the early 80's. While Mellon was able to sell some of these real estate loans to Grant Street, there was a limit to how much trouble investors would buy. The result: some $700 million, or 31 percent, of Mellon's approximately $2.3 billion in remaining real estate loans were nonperforming at the end of last year. The average for most banks of Mellon's size was 15 percent. Mellon's troubled loan ratio "is still too high," Mr. Cahouet acknowledged in a recent interview in his office in Pittsburgh. "It's partly a matter of where we came from and partly a matter of the economy." Consumers, Services, Computers So Mellon has been busy buying banks with significant retail and consumer business, like the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, better known as PSFS, which Mellon acquired in 1990. Mellon is also expanding its number of credit-card customers. More than anything, though, Mr. Cahouet has expanded Mellon's service businesses. Along with State Street Bank in Boston and the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, for instance, Mellon is one of the leading bookkeepers for thousands of corporate pension plans -- executing trades on behalf of the money managers who invest pension money, tracking the money managers' performance and keeping account records for pension plan participants. It is a business that analysts say produces giant profit margins -- anywhere from 35 percent to 50 percent before taxes -- and Mellon, with $120 billion in such assets under administration, is the nation's third-largest "master trustee." Mellon has also become a leader in cash management, the business of investing companies' idle funds day to day. That business, too, is said by analysts to produce 35 to 50 percent pretax returns, and Mellon's operation is almost as large as that of First Chicago, the cash-management leader. Mellon has also expanded its business of providing computer services to smaller banks: everything from processing credit-card transactions to running regional automatic-teller networks. The advantage of this kind of business is that customers tend to be loyal because it is cumbersome to transfer large volumes of data to another processor. Another edge is that service businesses are difficult to enter, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the necessary computer equipment and tens of millions of dollars more to program the computers. Squeezing Small Competitors William Gregor, the head of financial institutions consulting at the MAC Group, a Cambridge-based consultant, said that most of Mellon's service businesses "are not the sort of business that other people can come crashing into; it's just too expensive to start from scratch." Such thinking has allowed service businesses to become more important than ever at Mellon. In 1985, they generated $365 million in revenues, or 27 percent of the banking company's total. By last year, service revenue had leaped to $742 million, or 41 percent of the total. Mellon's management is convinced that as prices in the services area shrink, smaller players will be squeezed out of the business, leaving Mellon with an even bigger market share than it has at present. That would increase Mellon's profits further and help its stock price, which, in recognition of the strong returns from services, has outperformed most other bank stocks, and has climbed 86 percent from its 52-week low. [ On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Mellon's common shares closed at $40.125, unchanged. ] But analysts say the run-up in the stock price is due almost entirely to buying by a handful of investors and that most investors are still wary, wondering whether Mellon's fat returns in services can continue and whether new troubles could emerge from the bank's real estate group. George G. C. Parker, a Stanford University finance professor who studies banks, said: "The market remains skeptical. It's just not ready to believe that the returns Mellon has been reporting are sustainable."

167-> The Art Market
Barnes in Court The controversial administration of the Barnes Foundation is now being legally challenged. The assault comes in the form of a suit alleging that the trustees of the foundation, a world-renowned institution in Merion, Pa., that has a priceless collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, have taken advantage of the foundation's assets. The suit was filed by the De Mazia Trust, which was established by Violette de Mazia, a protegee and close companion of the founder, Dr. Albert C. Barnes. Miss de Mazia, who died four years ago, was a driving force in the institution, which she served as a vice president and the education director. The Barnes Foundation, established in 1922 by Barnes, a patent-medicine manufacturer, to perpetuate his art collection and his ideas about art education, has always been considered an eccentric, exclusive institution. Barnes, for example, was well known for refusing to allow important collectors like Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and distinguished scholars like Meyer Schapiro and Kenneth Clark to see any of his estimated 800 paintings and 200 sculptures. Before his death in 1951, the founder made another unusual decision: he gave Lincoln University -- a small, predominantly black college 45 miles west of Merion with no track record in art education -- the power to nominate the trustees of the Barnes Foundation. Both the foundation and its trustees made news last May when a lucrative contract was signed with Alfred A. Knopf to publish for the first time color photographs of the foundation's collection. The holdings include 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos. The deal was signed a month after the Newhouse Foundation made a $2 million donation to Lincoln University. The head of the Newhouse Foundation, and the son of its founder, is S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of the corporation that owns Knopf. In its petition filed on Jan. 21 in Montgomery County, Pa., the De Mazia Trust charges that the Barnes trustees used the catalogue contract as a lure for the donation to Lincoln University. (Three out of the five trustees of the Barnes Foundation are also on the board of Lincoln University, and the fourth, Richard H. Glanton, the president, is the university's general counsel.) The donation, they say, should have gone directly to the Barnes Foundation, which owns the artwork to be catalogued. The De Mazia Trust contends that because of the contribution to Lincoln, the Barnes trustees dismissed bids made by other publishers. They say other publishers would have given the foundation a contribution of several million dollars but that their efforts were ignored. Mr. Glanton's response was: "That's not true. We had four serious proposals. We asked each publisher for a minimum of a $500,000 advance and only one publisher met our request." He added that Harry N. Abrams, the New York-based publisher, submitted the "second best" proposal. But Paul Gottlieb, the president and publisher of Abrams, denies this. "The Barnes Foundation had no idea what they would have gotten out of us," said Mr. Gottlieb. Mr. Glanton said on Wednesday that Knopf had awarded the Barnes Foundation a $750,000 advance for publishing the collection, a sum Mr. Gottlieb called "staggering" for an art book. He added, "I don't really believe that's what the advance is." According to Susan D. Ralston, the editor of the catalogue at Knopf, "$750,000 is an erroneous figure." "The real amount is a private matter between the Barnes Foundation and Knopf," Mrs. Ralston said, adding that the contract was for two books. The first book, a selection of the Barnes Foundation's great works, is to be in bookstores by the fall of 1993. While Mrs. Ralston said that no writer had been decided on, a name that keeps surfacing is that of J. Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Mr. Brown announced his resignation last week but is to remain in the post through this year. The second part of the contract is a catalogue raisonne that may be published in more than one volume. Consulting with the Barnes Foundation on the selection of art are several institutions, including the National Gallery, the French National Museums and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. After the suit concerning the book contract was filed in Montgomery County Orphans' Court by the De Mazia Trust, the Barnes Foundation asked the court to withdraw a petition it made in March to ease visiting-hour restrictions, change investment policies, raise admission fees and allow the building to be used for social functions. But last week Louis D. Stefan, a Montgomery County judge, refused to let the foundation withdraw its suit. Instead, the judge asked the trustees to produce the foundation's financial documents as well as minutes of its board meetings. "The Attorney General also opposed the request to withdraw the petition," said Judge Stefan in a telephone interview. "He wants to enable the court to look into the allegations raised by the De Mazia Trust and to resolve the serious issues currently being raised." Judge Stefan said that a hearing was tentatively scheduled for March. Mr. Glanton called the allegations in the suit "very regrettable," and said the foundation's books and records would be open to the court. The de Mazia suit is the most explosive challenge to the Glanton-led board of the Barnes Foundation. It clearly draws the line between the trustees, who want change, and Barnes loyalists, who would like to preserve the status quo. The De Mazia Trust, along with a group of past and present students, is committed to preserving the 70-year-old foundation's emphasis on art education. The trustees say they are trying to modernize the foundation and make its outstanding but little-known art collection available to a wider audience. The trustees made their first move in this direction in April, when they petitioned the court for permission to sell up to 15 paintings from their collection to raise what they said was a badly needed $15 million to modernize the deteriorating galleries and to supplement the $10 million endowment that now generates only $1 million annually for operating costs. (It is normal museum practice to sell works of art only to acquire other art, not to use the proceeds for operating costs.) But three months later, the foundation changed its mind, citing adverse publicity as the reason for deciding not to sell works from its collection. Meanwhile, the board is considering other options that would go against the very strict indenture set up by the foundation's creator. Among the prohibitions laid down by the irascible Dr. Barnes was a stipulation that the collection may never be moved from the present 1926 building that houses the artworks. But the trustees would like to close the museum for renovations and send the collection on tour to other museums like the National Gallery of Art. "It is one of the options under consideration," Mr. Glanton said. "But I cannot really comment any further." A Shrinking Whitney The Whitney Museum of American Art is losing two of its three Manhattan branches. It has been asked to vacate by August its first-floor gallery in the Equitable Center, at Seventh Avenue and 52d Street, where the museum has been holding exhibitions for the last six years. By the end of September, the space at 33 Maiden Lane, which has housed the Whitney's downtown gallery since 1988, will be transformed into an I.B.M. marketing and education center. "It's another sign of the times," said David A. Ross, the director of the Whitney. "These branches were a way of keeping more of our collection on view." Mr. Ross also pointed out that the timing for the closings was particularly bad since the museum's expansion plans have been postponed until the economy picks up. Since their inception, the branches have always been well attended. During fiscal year 1991, for example, 40,000 people visited the Whitney's downtown branch; about 100,000 passed through the Equitable Center branch. "The branches fulfilled an important purpose," said Mr. Ross. "The Whitney has about 10,000 works of art in its collection and even when the entire third and fourth floors are used, there may only be about 200 artworks in an installation. Without these branches, fewer people will have a chance to see the depth of of our collection." In financial terms, Mr. Ross said, these branches were neither a drain nor an income producer. Admission to all of the Whitney's branches are free and corporations like Equitable Life Assurance, International Business Machines and Park Tower Realty financed their operating costs. Equitable, as well as I.B.M. and Park Tower Realty, which jointly own the building on Maiden Lane, said each company would continue to give the museum financial support, as they have in the past. But each corporation had different reasons for closing its branch of the Whitney: at Equitable, Mary Mannarino, the manager of public relations, said the company had decided to "support a wider number of institutions who would benefit from the good location." Ms. Mannarino also explained that Equitable would not be making any public announcement about future exhibitions until the spring. At the Whitney's Maiden Lane location, an award-winning space designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Paul Neuman, a media spokesman for I.B.M., said the decision to close the gallery wasn't an easy one since they were losing a mini-landmark. "We are downsizing and shrinking our real-estate holdings," he said. "We simply needed the space." Meanwhile, Park Tower Realty, in an effort to continue its association with the museum, is planning to help the Whitney find a new location. "We haven't actually begun the search," said Kate Coburn, Park Tower's director of marketing. "But we will be finding the Whitney a new downtown home."

168-> ON PRO FOOTBALL; After His Fall From Grace, Aundray Bruce Starts Over
The fall from grace for Aundray Bruce began just when grace had been obtained. In 1988, when the Atlanta Falcons made Bruce the first pick in the National Football League draft, he gained the money, the status and the opportunity for success that all rookies long for -- and that he especially had longed for, because his intensity for the game had always been questioned, because he had worked long and hard to overcome a speech impediment, because he grew up one of 14 children in the projects in Montgomery, Ala., and because his father had died when he was only a year old. Yes, in 1988, Aundray Bruce was on top of the hill after an arduous journey. But it seems as if he jumped on a sleigh after that draft and has been skidding downhill ever since. This is not lost on Bruce. Nor the Falcons. Fed up and worn down with someone they considered an underachiever at linebacker, the Falcons last month left Bruce unprotected on their Plan B free-agency list. He then signed with the Los Angeles Raiders. And as he starts his climb back up the hill, Bruce has had plenty of time to reflect on his four seasons in Atlanta and to ponder the future. The Falcons are at some fault for his troubles. But Bruce is to blame even more. This is clearly a man (he'll be 26 years old next month) who has been consumed recently by his own thinking. Listen: "Believe me," Bruce begins, softly, "I want to be on this earth at age 90 with my kids and my wife around and not at some nightclub or driving my car at 150 miles an hour, which I have done. What is important to me is establishing a reputation in this league, a reputation of being a dominant player. That is my childhood dream, that when it's all said and done to be in the Hall of Fame. There have been many obstacles that I have already overcome. I look at the way my career has started as just another obstacle to beat." Well, Bruce has a reputation all right -- for lacking smarts and maturity. In the 1990's, pro football schemes are too complicated and sophisticated and the responsibilites too great for a player lacking intelligence. And there Bruce was, the Falcons say, running right when he was supposed to run left, blitzing when he was supposed to drop back into pass coverage. Making tremendous plays, on occasion, in areas of the field where he was not assigned and hurting the defense too much in those instances when he was out of place and did not make the tackle or sack. The Falcons overlooked a lot with Bruce, but they could not turn the other way when it came to what they viewed as Bruce's lack of understanding of football. He is 6 feet 5 1/2 inches tall and weighs 255 pounds, and he runs the same 4.53 seconds for the 40-yard sprint that he did as a rookie. One look at Bruce and, no question, he looks like a football player, and a dominant one, too. But this may be all you need to know about how the Falcons viewed Bruce. From the former Falcon linebacker coach, Chuck Clausen, last November: "He's like a perpetual 5-year-old. You tell him he's not going to be a football player all of his life. He's the kind of guy that nods his head yes and a few days later it's kind of vanished." From Atlanta Coach Jerry Glanville: "If being a high-priced No. 1 draft pick is your only plus, we don't have room for you." Obviously not. The Falcons may go down in N.F.L. history as the only team to take a No. 1 overall draft pick and literally give him away so early in his career. Sure, they tried trading the No. 1 pick even before the '88 draft, which was considered a weak one, and attempted to trade Bruce the last two seasons. The Falcons even tried playing Bruce at defensive end and defensive tackle and last season at tight end and wide receiver. As far as Glanville was concerned, Bruce just couldn't cut it. Bruce played in 64 Falcons games, made 34 starts and produced 16 sacks. Hardly what the Falcons had in mind when they signed him to a five-year contract worth $5.1 million. Bruce acknowledges he had trouble catching onto the Atlanta schemes but said he surely wasn't the only one. "How can someone say you're in the wrong place when you're making plays?" he said. "Football is 70 percent instincts. I rely heavily on my instincts." "I can find the most fault with myself in how in the first two years I handled the money, the women, the attention of being the first pick in the draft," he continued. "In '88, there wasn't a morning that came up where I didn't meet the sun. I was hanging out in clubs and I turned to all the wrong places and people when things started going bad for me on the playing field. I never did drugs or alcohol. It was women, and a lot of them. You take a guy who had nothing and all of a sudden he has millions and it takes some getting used to." Cleveland, Houston and the Los Angeles Rams all showed interest once the Falcons did not protect him on the Plan B list, but Bruce said the Raiders were easily his first choice. He said that Bo Jackson, his former teammate at Auburn, told Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general partner, that if Davis lights the fire, Bruce will make the plays. Davis listened. Bruce was too much to pass on. The Raiders are aging at linebacker, they had rated him highly in their old college scouting reports, his speed-size ratio was too impressive to ignore, he had never missed a game because of injury and the cost of obtaining him was money, not draft picks. "When I went to Los Angeles, I walked into Al Davis's office," Bruce said. "He didn't want me to run or lift weights. I could see his interest in me personally. He said he was disappointed in my career. He asked me how I had held up over the way I had been treated, moved from position to position. He wanted to know my state of mind and said one thing that impressed me most: 'If you come here, you leave all of that there. There are no clouds.' It felt great." The Raiders have long enjoyed great success with taking troubled but talented players and watching them blossom. Will the Falcons regret that they gave up on Bruce? He says yes. "How many football schemes do Lawrence Taylor and Derrick Thomas know?" Bruce asked. "They line up and rush that passer and use their God-given talent. That's what I want to do with the Raiders. I've got a lot of people's mouths to close, including some of those 10-gallon-hat-wearing Atlantans who think I'm nothing. Oh, and one other thing -- it's nothing personal."

169-> HEADLINERS; On Her Toes
As Katherine Dunham weakens physically during her fast to protest the treatment of Haitian refugees, her spirit dances on. Miss Dunham, one of the pioneers of American modern dance, has subsisted on juice, tea and water for six weeks now at her home in East St. Louis, Ill., and says she will go on until the Bush Administration admits Haitians as political refugees. "The lives of those people who half drown in those little boats are being equated to animals," she said in an interview last weekend. "It means I have to declare out-and-out war." She has been advised on fasting by Dick Gregory, and has had telephone conversations with the deposed Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is scheduled to visit her tomorrow. The 82-year-old Miss Dunham, who has a home in Haiti, has rejected Mr. Aristide's past advice to curtail her fast. "Even though I'm losing my voice and feeling a little tired, I can't stop fasting until there has been some resolution in Haiti," she said.

170-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Chief at NatWest As Investigation Begins
The chief executive of the National Westminster Bank P.L.C. Britain's second-largest bank, resigned yesterday to devote time to a Government investigation of his role in the takeover of Manpower Inc., an American employment agency, by Britain's Blue Arrow P.L.C. in 1987. National Westminster said in a statement yesterday that Tom Frost, the company's 58-year-old group chief executive, would be succeeded by his deputy, Derek Wanless. Mr. Frost, who has been group chief executive since July 1987, will hold the title of deputy chairman until his retirement in August 1993. In his new position he will not be involved with the bank's daily operations. The Department of Trade and Industry said recently that it had started a new investigation of the takeover of Manpower, focusing on the roles of senior officers at NatWest. NatWest's chairman, Lord Alexander, suggested that the case be reopened because of new allegations in the news media that he considered damaging to the bank's reputation. "The board believes it is essential in the interests of the bank that Tom Frost should have time to deal with the investigation," Lord Alexander said. "We entirely agree with him that it is now time for his successor to be appointed." A spokesman for the trade and industry department said that the new investigation was not being made at NatWest's request but that new information had been discovered. In the original Blue Arrow case, 11 people and 3 companies -- County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips & Drew -- were charged with conspiring to cover up a failed $:837 million, or $1.67 billion, share rights issue. Blue Arrow planned the rights issue to finance its takeover of Manpower, based in Milwaukee. When only 38 percent of the issue was taken up by the deadline, County NatWest and Phillips & Drew bought shares, raising the level to nearly 49 percent. NatWest, County NatWest and UBS Phillips & Drew were acquitted in January. Mr. Frost was the only executive director to remain at NatWest after the Blue Arrow affair. Three directors -- Charles Green, Terry Green and John Plastow -- resigned when the department's first report came out. Mr. Frost's replacement, Mr. Wanless, is 44. He joined the bank in 1970 and was appointed general manager of the bank's branch business in Britain in January 1989. He became chief executive of the bank's financial services operations in October 1990 and was appointed a director of NatWest in May 1991. On Feb. 1 Mr. Wanless became a deputy group chief executive and group head of NatWest Markets, including investment banking and Treasury operations. Mr. Wanless is married and has four daughters and one son.

171-> Q and A
Calculating Co-op Tax Question: We are a small 16-unit co-op. As a non-profit corporation we have a small interest-bearing savings account and an account that holds maintenance money to cover the cost of repairs. If there is no money in our account at the close of our fiscal year can we avoid incurring either Federal or state tax obligations? . . . Isabel Hall, Jackson Heights, Queens Answer: No. Your tax liability would have less to do with the balance in your accounts at the end of the year than with how the income was earned. Robert Kobel, a spokesman for the New York office of the Internal Revenue Service, said Federal tax rules give residential co-ops options in calculating their income taxes. As a corporate entity you could elect to be taxed as a regular corporation according to a graduated scale based on income. Using this formula for calculating your taxes would require that you file forms 1120 or 112A. I.R.S. rules give co-ops the ability to exempt certain types of income like shareholders' maintenance from their taxable income. However, other income, such as rent from any commercial space, fees from building concessions or interest earned on savings accounts or investments, would be taxed at a flat 30 percent rate. A co-op taking these deductions would file using Form 1120H. New York state tax policy follows the Federal rules in what it allows co-ops to deduct for unrelated business income. The basic corporate tax rate in New York state is 8 percent on taxable income under $290,000 and 9 percent for income above that level. But the taxable income of most co-ops is so small that the majority end up paying only the minimum flat tax required of all corporations, which is $325. Currently in effect is a 10 percent temporary surcharge for tax years ending between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1993, as well as a 15 percent Metropolitan Transportation Business surcharge that would apply to co-ops in the M.T.A.'s 12-county commuter region. More information on New York State tax rules is available by calling 1-800-225-5829. Breaking a Lease Question: I am 23-year-old person in-between jobs. In an effort to cut down on expenses, I have considered finding a cheaper place to live. My lease runs for several more months. Would I face monetary penalties if I moved out? . . . Kevin Curton, Stamford, Conn. Answer: Not penalties, but the laws that govern residential leases in Connecticut make tenants responsible for the rent, during the term of their leases, until the landlord finds a new tenant. However, Victor Feigenbaum, the attorney who is in charge of the Housing Session in Connecticut State Court, said that in this situation a landlord has the obligation to mitigate the tenant's losses by making an effort to relet the apartment. The landlord would have to show, for example, that he had advertised the apartment or listed it with an agent. Some leases have an unemployment escape clause that would release a jobless tenant who moves out from responsibility for the rent, but they are rare. Nevertheless, you should check your lease for such a clause. SCRIE Eligibility Question: I am 67 years old and retired and living on a limited income. I have lived for more than 25 years in an apartment in a two-family house. Do I qualify for the city's Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption program? . . . Eugene Myer, Bayside, Queens Answer: No. According to Roz Post, a spokesman for Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the program is limited to tenants in rent-controlled, rent- stabilized and Mitchell-Lama apartments. Tenants in two-family houses are not covered. However, you might qualify for assistance under the Section 8 program, a Federal rent-subsidy program. In order to take advantage of it, your landlord would have to agree to participate. If he does, your rent could be reduced to no more than 30 percent of your income. For more information on Section 8 eligibility call 212-306-3000.

172-> Continued U.S. Embargo Harms Cuba and Ourselves as Well
To the Editor: The Jan. 25 meeting on Cuba at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City (news article, Jan. 26) focuses a light on one of the blind spots of American foreign policy -- the economic embargo of Cuba. Not only are all items of trade still prohibited, but so is travel to Cuba by United States tourists and even sending medical supplies and other humanitarian aid (with a few exceptions). During the cold war this policy did not make sense. Today, after the cold war's end and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it is an anachronism. What threat does Cuba offer the United States? On the contrary, our present policy of noncommunication is a threat to the Cuban people, particularly to the Cuban children, toward whom we have no hostility. Now that Soviet support has been withdrawn, the Cuban people are in a desperate situation. Whether our Government likes President Fidel Castro or not, our policy harms not only Cuba, but also the United States. Resumption of trade with Cuba would no doubt be of commercial benefit to us, not to speak of the desire of United States tourists to visit Cuba and enjoy its weather and facilities. If there are complaints by some about Cuba's human rights policies, resumption of relations would go a long way to correct that situation by direct diplomatic approaches. Robert S. McNamara, former Secretary of Defense, has called for a normalization of relations between our countries. His comments followed the final meeting, in Havana, of an American-Russian-Cuban conference series on the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when he was President Kennedy's defense chief. "If I had been a Cuban or Soviet official, I believe I would have shared the judgment," he told reporters in Washington on returning, "that a U.S. invasion was probable" (news article, Jan. 15). On United States-Cuban relations today, he is quoted by the Cuba Policy Project of the Nitze School at Johns Hopkins University as saying, "we must get beyond the fear and hostility that has shaped our relations for the past 30 years."

173-> U.S. Weighs Bigger Cut In Farm Trade Barriers
The Bush Administration may push for bigger cuts in agricultural trade barriers than are called for in the current plan to reform world trade, a United States trade official said today. United States trade officials, appearing before the House Agriculture Committee, endorsed a farm trade reform proposal from Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based trade organization. But Julius L. Katz, deputy United States trade representative, said the plan fell short of the Bush Administration's desire to slash farm export subsidies and trade barriers, and the United States might press for bigger reductions. "Another concern is that the reduction commitments for export subsidies do not go far enough," Mr. Katz said. "If modifications are made to Mr. Dunkel's text, we will seek improvements in export subsidy commitments." The Dunkel plan for an agricultural trade agreement calls for reducing export subsidies by an average of 36 percent over six years, starting in 1993. Those reductions "would be meaningful for a lot of commodities in the U.S.," Mr. Katz said. Richard Crowder, Agriculture Under Secretary, also at the hearing, said that by rough calculations, United States farmers' net income should increase by about $1 billion by 1998 as a result of a GATT agreement. Farm Program Spending Mr. Crowder said United States agricultural exports would increase by $4 billion to $5 billion, and Government spending on farm programs would drop by $2.5 billion. But Representative Thomas E. Coleman, Republican of Missouri, said: "American agriculture in general thinks it's very marginal whether the Dunkel text helps them or not. We hope that you won't look at the Dunkel text as a success and declare a victory." Mr. Dunkel offered his plan as a way to revive the talks, which have been deadlocked mainly by differences between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies. The talks, which are entering their sixth year, address a broad range of trade issues, but disputes over farm trade have been the sticking point. If negotiators reach a pact this spring, governments still would have to give final approval and pass laws to put the new trade rules into effect. Several United States officials said it was unlikely Congress could do that before 1993. A Reluctance to Compromise In another indication of French reluctance to compromise on reductions in agricultural subsidies, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Minister of Industry and International trade, accused the European Community's negotiators of exceeding their mandate. The European Community officials have been discussing the possibility of limiting the tonnage, as well as the financing, of subsidized grain exports. Yet the community's member countries have not endorsed the negotiation of any limits on tonnage, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said at a breakfast in Washington sponsored by the European Institute, a public policy group here.

174-> Mutual Funds; More to Come In the Upturn?
Recession or not, the Dow Jones industrial average reached another all-time high earlier this month, and the upward trend that began on Oct. 11, 1990 has far outlasted the median length of the 10 previous upturns, 384 days. But it is lagging in terms of performance. The current upturn -- measured by the Lipper Growth Fund Index, which charts funds much as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index measures stocks -- has returned 51.4 percent, about nine percentage points less than the median for the 10 earlier upturns. By historic gauges, then, there is room to grow. Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper in Summit, N.J., said, "We may stay in this up phase for a while."

175-> New Jersey Congressman Announces Retirement
One day after a Republican redistricting plan threw him into a potential race with another incumbent Democrat, 71-year-old Bernard J. Dwyer announced today that he would not run again for the seat in the United States House of Representatives that he has held for seven terms. Mr. Dwyer's surprise announcement appeared to give Representative Frank J. Pallone Jr., whose Third District was combined with Mr. Dwyer's Sixth in a redistricting plan adopted by a bipartisan commission Friday, a clear shot at renomination to keep his seat without an intraparty fight. In a statement released simultaneously in Washington and in his home district, Mr. Dwyer said, "A district in which nearly half the residents would be new to me, and I to them, certainly helped me to finalize my decision." Mr. Dwyer telephoned Mr. Pallone, with whom he has worked in Washington on legislation of mutual interests to their districts, and told him of his decision. 'No Immediate Plans' "He called me this morning, and I was surprised that he was not running," Mr. Pallone said at his office in Long Branch today. "I have been friends with him for some time. He's on the Appropriations Committee, the only New Jersey Democrat who is, and we always worked on things together." Mr. Dwyer announced his intention not to run again at a meeting of Middlesex County Democrats, who met to begin screening candidates in the wake of the announcement of the new district lines, and confirmed it later in a news release. He said he had "no immediate plans for life after Congress, although I expect to remain active in some manner." Mr. Dwyer's decision not to run clarified the political picture somewhat, leaving the state with seven Democratic and six Republican incumbents. The prospect that Mr. Pallone will be able to run in the reconfigured Sixth District without facing a bruising battle with Mr. Dwyer also appeared to diminish Republican chances of seizing the seat in November. But imponderables remain. Because of the uncertainty over what district lines would emerge, Republicans are just beginning to look at potential candidates to run in the Sixth. And while Mr. Pallone, 40 years old, will be a newcomer to much of the redrawn district, the new geography might prove more hospitable to a Democrat than was his old district, which tilted Republican (nearly two-to-one for George Bush in 1988) and provided both Mr. Pallone and his Democratic predecessor, James J. Howard, some tough races. In 1988, for example, Mr. Pallone was elected by a 52 to 48 percent margin both to the unexpired term of Mr. Howard, who died in office, and to his first full term. In 1990, he managed to hold onto his seat by a 49-46 percent margin, with minor candidates siphoning off 5 percent. Third District a Target The withdrawal of Mr. Dwyer was the first bit of political good news for Mr. Pallone in months. From almost the moment the state's political infrastructure began to gear up for the tortuous process of redistricting last fall, rumors began to circulate that the likely target to lose his district was Mr. Pallone, both because his tenure was regarded as shaky and also because he is regarded as an unreliable party stalwart by his fellow Democrats. Even before the new redistricting map was voted on in New Brunswick yesterday by a bipartisan panel of Democrats and Republicans, it was clear that regardless of which of two maps emerged, the Demoratic or the Republican version, Mr. Pallone's district would be gone, and he would either have to run against fellow Democrat Mr. Dwyer, or Christopher H. Smith, the Republican incumbent in the next door in the Fourth. The 6-to-6 deadlock along strict party lines was resolved when the redistricting commission chairman voted in favor of the Republican map as the fairer of the two. This threw Mr. Pallone and Mr. Dwyer together in the newly aligned Sixth, with the old Third District carved up among the two of them and two incumbent Republicans, Mr. Smith and Representative Dick Zimmer, serving his first term in the 12th District. With Mr. Dwyer out of the race, Mr. Pallone has a very short breather before he must plunge into what almost certainly will be a very aggressive and well-financed Republican effort in the summer and fall. And even that assumes that no strong Democrat will challenge him in the primary in June.

176-> School Officials Optimistic On Upcoming Budget Votes
After two years of widespread rejection, school officials will put their new budgets before the voters in towns across New Jersey Tuesday, and educators say they are hopeful that taxpayers will be less hostile this spring. Some officials sense a softening of the rabid anti-tax mood that dominated the last two budget votes, nearly toppled Senator Bill Bradley in 1990 and routed Democrats from the state Legislature last November. In addition, they say, state limits on school budget increases and a hold-the-line mentality by local superintendents may increase the number of approvals. Yet, they caution, voter anxieties about the recession may be counterbalancing. "I think a considerable number will pass," James A. Moran, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, said of the 560 budgets up for a vote. "Increases are very small in most places and within the range of what the economy is doing. You've got an era of contraction going on that's relatively unprecedented." Dr. Moran, a statewide spokesman for school superintendents, said local officials have tried to "present clear, straightforward" budgets in hopes of reversing the broad rate of rejection of the last two years. Forty-four percent of the budgets lost last year, and 48 percent were rejected in 1990 in the New Jersey's deepest wave of anti-spending sentiment since nearly 56 percent of school budgets were defeated in 1976, the year the state's income tax was created. Here in Paramus, one of the largest districts in Bergen County, the proposed $38 million budget is up only 1.2 percent, as opposed to increases of 6 to 8 percent in recent years. Taxes on the average home in Paramus will increase $70 under the budget, but there will be no new educational programs and no new school equipment in the 1992-93 academic year, said the superintendent, Harry A. Galinsky. "In the last two weeks, I've become much more optimistic," Dr. Galinsky said. "Given the economic times, I see a glimmer of hope out there." He said he was buoyed by that fact that a citizens' budget committee, which included senior citizens, many of whom are generally opposed to higher school taxes, had approved the budget and recommended it to voters. In nearby Mahwah, a growing community in the northwestern corner of Bergen County, the proposed $22.7 million budget contains $900,000 in new spending and has won the endorsement of the local taxpayers' association. This year's increase does nothing more than restore the $900,000 cut from the school budget by the town council a year ago after voters rejected it by a 2.5-to-1 margin, said Donald S. Hawkins, the school district's business administrator. "Everybody here is very hopeful this budget will pass," Mr. Hawkins said, in part because Mahwah's enrollment is projected to grow by 145 pupils to 2,175 in September. He said a recent reassessment led to a sharp increase in the value of commercial properties. These increased revenues, along with the small budget increases, mean that school taxes for 1992-93 would actually decline by 2.7 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation on residential properties, he said. In Wayne, a sprawling middle-class district with 6,200 pupils in neighboring Passaic County, the proposed $61.8 million budget is up 0.7 percent from the previous year. "It reflects the economic realities of our times," said the superintendent, Robert Winter. "I'm feeling positive. I think most people will feel that's reasonable." Wayne's proposed budget means retrenchment. Dr. Winter said no major programs will be started. Bus routes not mandated by the state will be scrapped. And because none of the elementary and middle school textbooks are more than three years old, none will be replaced, he said. Calm in Middlesex On the eve of the vote, Middlesex County, last year's hotbed of antitax sentiment in central New Jersey, appears to be calmer. Eighteen of the 22 budgets in Middlesex failed to pass last spring. "Things are extraordinarily calm this year," said John Namath, the county school business administrator. Tomorrow's vote will be held despite an attempt by the Republican-controlled Legislature to delay it. Gov. Florio has ignored a bill, passed by both houses, that would change the date. He is expected to veto the measure Thursday, hoping to remove any legal challenges to budgets that are approved Tuesday. Republicans wanted to delay the vote to give them more time to devise a spending formula providing wealthier suburban districts a larger slice of the $341 million in increased aid the Florio Administration is providing through a re-evaluation of state pension funds. Statewide education associations representing teachers, principals and superintendents all opposed the Republican move. Republican legislative leaders say they will not attempt to override the Governor's expected veto.

177-> Review/Music; The Living Traditions Of Northern India
There are times when music really is an art in play, when sound seems to come into being for the sake of pleasure, inspiring thrill at its difficulty and wonder at its powers. This was the sense I had listening to performances of Northern Indian music at Symphony Space on Saturday night, presented by the World Music Institute. Although this concert, titled "Masters of Indian Music," was supposed to last four hours, when I left after four and a half, the play was still proceeding. At that time, Sultan Khan was coaxing extraordinary sounds out of his sarangi, one of India's oldest bowed instruments, carved out of a solid block of teak, with goatskin stretched over its resonating chamber. Mr. Khan, a member of one of India's musical families, has a worldwide reputation (he was heard on the soundtrack of "Gandhi"), but there was no sense of commercialism in his playing. Using fingernails to change pitches of the instrument's gut and metal strings (not the pads of the fingers as in Western string instruments), sliding into and out of notes, he made the ancient instrument (held like a cello by a cross-legged player) sound like a supple human voice. Its slightly nasal whine, produced with a thick bow, was shaped into wiry, sinuous phrases. Mr. Khan created miniature arabesques, toying with the ear in exquisite, ornamented melodies of a Karnatic, South Indian raga. The tabla, providing rhythmic accompaniment to the raga, was just as virtuosically played. Zakir Hussain turned the two drums (one of copper and silver, one of hardwood) into pitched instruments by pressing down on the goatskin membrane of one with the heel of the palm and creating percussive consonants using the metallic center of the other. He answered Mr. Khan's gestures with improvisatory glee. In a series of duets with his father, Alla Rakha, a renowned tabla player who has appeared frequently with Ravi Shankar, the musical dialogue was between a poised master, too reflective to be too demonstrative, and a spirited son, who relished display, making his drums seem to flutter like bird wings or chatter in conversation. Mr. Hussain, not above a little flamboyance, always seemed to be inviting his father to join him in the pleasures of youth. Mr. Hussain, who has collaborated with a wide variety of Western musicians (ranging from Van Morrison to the London String Quartet), explained the structure of the music in good-natured comments to the audience. (He even jested about tabla players' obsessions with tuning their instruments, adjusting the drums to create proper resonances before a performance, regularly during a performance and often after a performance as well.) The duets with his father were accompanied by Mr. Khan, playing a repeated pattern on the sarangi, turning the pieces into passacaglias of sorts. One set of improvisations was based on a recurrent pattern of 14 beats, with subsidiary accents on the 6th and 11th counts. Mr. Hussain demonstrated the rhythms, marking them with claps, and then began to play within that structure. The playing sometimes used that rhythmic structure, adopting its accents, and sometimes opposed it, creating piquant syncopations. It was as if rhythmic counterpoint were taking place between two independent lines, each gaining strength from the other. Mr. Hussain relished the ways repetitions would set up expectations, only to be undercut with a sudden stroke of playful exclamation. This was also true when Mr. Hussain was joined by Ken Zuckerman on the sarod. Mr. Zuckerman teaches both North Indian classical music and European medieval and Renaissance music in Basel, Switzerland, and has studied with Ali Akbar Khan for nearly two decades. He and Mr. Hussain made for intriguing contrasts, with Mr. Zuckerman seeming to want to turn the play more contemplative. There are, in fact, times when Indian musicians can guide their improvisations into spiritual realms. At those times, this music can be profound and intimate; one gradually enters its world and is gradually released from it, sometimes without beginnings or endings even becoming clear. But in this concert, the emphasis was not on reflection and discovery, but on play and conversation. It was the conversation of brilliant and loquacious orators. The inventiveness began to seem a bit unrelenting after a while (and I was sorry instruments were amplified), but I would willingly hear it all again. Next time, it is bound to be different.

182-> Yields Lower On C.D.'s and Bank Funds
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit moved lower for the week that ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. Analysts at the interest rate publication note that the steady erosion of bank yields indicate that there has been no substantial start to economic recovery. "Without loan demands there is no need for banks to go out to drum up fresh deposits to replace cash that would ordinarily have been lent out," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "If the economy were to pick up, you'd see loans rise and bank deposit yields not far behind." At Monday's closely watched auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills, where many interest rate watchers view the results as a good barometer of what many banks could be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead, the average discount rates inched up after a four-week downward trend. The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.66 percent, up a basis point from the previous auction, while the six-month bill was up 2 basis points, to 3.77 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Over all, returns at New York area banks were off slightly again, with a money market account down 2 basis points, to 3.36 percent; a three-month certificate of deposit off a basis point, to 3.49 percent, and a six-month certificate off 3 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Commercial banks, which are part of the New York area average, were a little less aggressive this week than their savings-bank competitors. Commercial banks lowered the average money market account by 2 basis points, to 3.14 percent, and the average yield of three- and six-month C.D.'s was down a basis point, to 3.34 percent and 3.43 percent, respectively. The higher-paying savings banks cut their money market accounts by a basis point, to 3.59 percent and their three-month certificate by 2 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Most of the deep cuts were in the six-month certificate, which dropped 4 basis points, to 3.86 percent.

184-> Surpluses Up For Japanese
Japan's unadjusted worldwide current-account surplus reached $9.49 billion in May, more than double the $4.16 billion surplus in May 1991, the Finance Ministry said today. Japan's politically sensitive current-account surplus with the United States also rose, by 6.3 percent, to $40.03 billion in the calendar year 1991 from $37.65 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said. Its trade surplus with the United States in 1991, meanwhile, edged up 3.7 percent, to $43.44 billion from $41.87 billion in 1990, it said. The country's unadjusted trade surplus almost doubled to $10.09 billion in May from a $5.47 billion surplus in May 1991. Economists' estimates for the surplus in current account, the broadest measure of goods and services, had ranged from $6.3 billion to $9.3 billion, a Reuters survey said. The economists attributed the big rise to steady growth in exports while imports remained weak, and they said the surplus was likely to continue to grow. Japan's current-account surplus with nations in the European Community quadrupled to $25.22 billion in 1991 from $6.16 billion in 1990, while its trade surplus with the community doubled to $33.37 billion from $16.35 billion in the same period.

185-> COMPANY NEWS; EXXON IS EXPECTED TO ELIMINATE 1,500 U.S. JOBS
The Exxon Corporation is expected to announce a restructuring today, and analysts said it might eliminate 1,500 jobs at its Exxon USA unit. Exxon reported last month that its profits fell 40 percent in the first quarter, and Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman, noted at the time that the company's domestic profits had slipped to 25 percent of earnings, compared with 50 percent in earlier years. On Tuesday, Exxon announced that it was stopping retail sales in the Los Angeles area and would not accept its own credit card in California, Nevada, Oregon and Utah effective Sept. 1. Articles suggesting that 1,500 jobs might be lost were published yesterday in The Houston Post and The Houston Chronicle. Henry Beathard, an Exxon spokesman, said the company had summoned its 20,000 American employees to meetings today. "Until then, we will have no further statement," he said.

186-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; On TV, Clinton Finds an Audience That Listens
Listen to Bill Clinton on the morning talk shows. No saxophone. No sunglasses. He is serious, concise and eager to repeat his claim of outsider status in an election year suddenly gone screwy. As an elected Democrat in a year when voters want almost nothing to do with politicians, the winner of the Democratic primary race spent yesterday morning pursuing his new mission: trying to persuade voters to keep an open mind about his chances of becoming President. In one vital respect, Mr. Clinton's appearance on the CBS News program "This Morning" was a breakthrough of sorts: Only one questioner aside from the co-host, Paula Zahn, mentioned Ross Perot, and no one mentioned President Bush except to criticize current Administration policies. Instead, the studio audience of 81 friendly people recruited by CBS employees from interest groups and acquaintances, and other voters connected by satellite links from five cities, allowed Mr. Clinton to expound upon his favorite topics. Finding the Right Word A saleswoman in the New York audience asked about restoring confidence. "One word," Mr. Clinton said, "investment. Change the tax system so there is more incentive for people to invest, corporation and individual. Spend more of the tax dollars you give the Government investing instead of just squandering. Invest to create jobs, generate wealth. That's the best way to build consumer confidence." Mr. Clinton returned to this theme repeatedly, following the advice of campaign strategists who say he needs to drive home a few select points. Mr. Clinton said for the first time that he would not rule out imposing an import fee on oil, a measure supported by the domestic petroleum industry but opposed in the areas of the country where residents are dependent on oil. He also said he would recommend "significantly modifying" the 1986 revision of the tax code because it focused too little attention on investment tax credits and other provisions that he said would help the economy. A New Kind of 'Badge' At the same time, the Arkansas Governor used his status as leader of a small, poor state, a status he once described as a liability in national politics, as a badge of honor. "I've been on the outside of this," Mr. Clinton said. "I've been in Little Rock, Ark., balancing my budget, developing a partnership with business, creating manufacturing jobs, educating, doing the things that we as Presidents should do. And I understand the frustration people have." Mr. Clinton has scheduled taped or live appearances on the Cable News Network, ABC, NBC and MTV within the next week. Yesterday, the Governor told almost everyone what they wanted to hear. He advocated tax relief as well as new tax incentives. He said he favored expanding education programs but pledged to streamline government bureaucracy. He promised that he would maintain a strong defense while reducing military spending. And he told a representative of B'nai B'rith that he opposed the creation of a Palestinian state. A Need for Discipline He said the initiatives he has proposed could be paid for out of a combination of budget cuts and new investment. "The economic investments would logically be paid for by being very disciplined about what you do with defense cuts," he said. But the Governor also said that he was not yet ready to call for a repeal of the luxury tax unless it was tied to increased tax rates on corporations and the wealthy, and that he was not "prepared to embrace" a plan to help the domestic automobile industry by reinstituting Federal tax deductions for interest on consumer loans. Most of the two-hour program was warm and appeared to be dominated by representatives of interest groups or questioners who were familiar with and friendly toward Mr. Clinton. He received applause twice: when he said that he favored a woman's right to choose abortion and when he said that he would lift Federal regulations that prohibit federally financed clinics from dispensing abortion advice. Mr. Clinton and his aides said they were happy that the candidate had begun answering real questions from real people who care little about issues that have preoccupied the press. "It's different," Mr. Clinton said as he was leaving the West 57th Street studio. "They asked questions which to you are old news, but to them are new. The American people are still just, a lot of them, digesting this election." By using his televised forums to focus on what he plans to do to revive the economy, Mr. Clinton hopes to demonstrate that he has the ideas he says Mr. Perot lacks, and the ability to take action that he says President Bush has not shown.

187-> Man Accused In Sex Assault Is Sentenced
A Superior Court judge has accepted a guilty plea from one of the eight Glen Ridge men accused of sexually assaulting a retarded girl in March 1989 and sentenced the man to 60 hours of community service. Judge Burrell I. Humphreys today accepted the plea agreement that the man, Peter Quigley, 21 years old, had struck with the Essex County prosecutor. Mr. Quigley, who had been indicted on nine counts of sexual assault and misconduct, pleaded guilty to the lesser count of endangering the welfare of a mentally incompetent person. He entered pretrial intervention, a program in which the records of first-time offenders are expunged after they complete probation. Mr. Quigley must regularly report to a probation officer. Mr. Quigley and seven others were charged in the assault on the girl in the basement of a house in suburban Glen Ridge. The girl, whose name has not been released because of the nature of the charges, has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old, prosecutors have said. Lured Into a Basement Prosecutors said a group of at least 12 young men, many of them high school athletes, lured the girl, then 17, into the basement. She was surrounded by some of the men, who then sexually assaulted her, coercing her to perform sexual acts, prosecutors charged. Mr. Quigley has made a sworn statement of the events to prosecutors and can be called to testify at a trial. Judge Humphreys originally declined to accept Mr. Quigley's guilty plea, saying it did not provide a sufficient factual basis for the plea. He accepted it after reading the statement Mr. Quigley made to investigators. "Peter Quigley and his family are relieved this ordeal is almost over," said his lawyer, Vincent J. Nuzzi. "They've asked me to express their appreciations and gratitude to Essex County Prosecutor James Mulvihill for exercising his prosecutorial discretion in consenting to Peter's admission into the P.T.I. program."

188-> SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; HIGH COURT BACKS SEIZING FOREIGNER FOR TRIAL IN U.S.
The Supreme Court ruled today that the United States can kidnap a criminal suspect from a foreign country, over that country's objection and without following the procedures set out in an extradition treaty, to put the suspect on trial in a Federal court. The Mexican Government sharply denounced the decision, calling it "invalid and unacceptable." It said tonight that it was suspending the activities of American drug agents in Mexico and ordering its agents in the United States to return home. [ Article, page A19. ] The 6-to-3 decision reinstated a Federal case against a Mexican gynecologist accused of taking part in the torture and murder of an American narcotics agent outside Guadalajara in 1985. Two lower Federal courts had ruled that they had no jurisdiction to try the case because the Mexican, Humberto Alvarez Machain, had been improperly brought to this country through a United States-sponsored abduction. The lower courts, the Federal District Court in Los Angeles and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ordered the dismissal of the indictment and the return of the doctor to Mexico on the ground that the abduction violated the 1978 extradition treaty. 1886 Decision Cited In overturning that ruling today in an opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court relied largely on a Supreme Court decision from 1886 that permitted the abduction of a man from Peru to stand trial in Illinois on a larceny charge, even though the man's abductor had ignored the extradition treaty that was then in effect. [ Excerpts from the decision, page A18. ] Unlike Peru, which did not criticize the abduction, Mexico has objected to the kidnapping of Dr. Alvarez, lodging protests with the State Department and telling the Supreme Court in a brief that the violation of the extradition treaty and "the infringement of Mexico's sovereignty" has "cast a pall" on relations between the United States and Mexico. But Chief Justice Rehnquist said today that there had in fact been no violation of the extradition treaty. He said the treaty did not explicitly prohibit kidnapping, and that it should not be interpreted to include such a prohibition implicitly. Although the court did not address the subject of reciprocity, the decision would appear to mean that the Mexican government is equally free to kidnap an American citizen for trial in Mexico for a crime committed in the United States. In any event, the Chief Justice said, the treaty "does not purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution." By the time the treaty was adopted in 1978, he said, the Mexican Government had been aware for decades that the United States interpreted the 1886 Supreme Court decision, Ker v. Illinois, as permitting international abductions outside the terms of extradition treaties. The United States has extradition treaties with 103 countries. Since none of those treaties specifically bar kidnapping, the analysis in today's decision would appear to apply to all of them. The Bush Administration defended the validity of prosecuting Dr. Alvarez. Three years ago, William P. Barr, then an assistant attorney general, wrote a legal opinion advising the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it could seize foreign fugitives without the permission of the foreign government. Today, Mr. Barr, now the Attorney General, said he was "gratified" by the ruling, which he called "an important victory in our ongoing efforts against terrorists and narcotraffickers who operate against the United States from overseas." He said the prosecution would now go forward. The decision will also apply to the case of Rene Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, another defendant in the slaying of the Federal drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar. Mr. Verdugo's conviction for taking part in the murder was set aside last year by the Ninth Circuit, which ordered a hearing on how he was brought to the United States. In the Alvarez case, there was no dispute about the circumstances of the doctor's capture. Dr. Alvarez, who is accused of using his medical skills to keep Mr. Camarena alive while the agent was tortured and interrogated by narcotics traffickers, was seized in his Guadalajara medical office by Mexican bounty hunters and flown to El Paso, where he was arrested. The kidnappers, who were seeking a $50,000 reward that the Drug Enforcement Administration had offered through Mexican informants, received a payment of $20,000 plus money for themselves and their families to live in the United States. While the Court today viewed the case as governed in a fairly straightforward way by the long-ago Ker decision, it also had to take account of another, seemingly contradictory Supreme Court decision that was decided on the same day in 1886. In that case, United States v. Rauscher, the Court ruled that a man extradited from England under an 1842 treaty could not be tried for a crime other than the one for which he was extradited. Chief Justice Rehnquist said that ruling applied only when an extradition treaty provided the means of gaining custody, and did not require the treaty be used. 'Shocking' Attitude In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said that a "fair reading" of the extradition treaty with Mexico, in light of both the Rauscher decision from 1886 and principles of international law, "leads inexorably to the conclusion" that the lower courts were correct in ordering Dr. Alvarez returned to Mexico. Justice Stevens said that the treaty with Mexico was a comprehensive document that should not be viewed as simply optional. "It is shocking that a party to an extradition treaty might believe that it has secretly reserved the right to make seizures of citizens in the other party's territory," he said. The majority opinion, United States v. Alvarez Machain, No. 91-712, was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, and Clarence Thomas. Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor joined the dissent. Dr. Alvarez has been in Federal prison in Los Angeles since the 1990 kidnapping. His lawyer, Robin Toma of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Associated Press that her client called the decision "a slap in the face of the people of Mexican and the Mexican Government." The A.C.L.U. said lawyers were considering additional appeals on other legal issues. No Effect on Noriega The most prominent foreign citizen to stand trial in the United States recently was Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former leader of Panama, who was arrested during the United States invasion of that country and brought to Florida to face Federal narcotics charges. He was convicted earlier this year. Although the United States and Panama have an extradition treaty, the status of General Noriega's prosecution did not depend on the outcome of the Alvarez case because the Panamanian Government installed by the United States did not object to the general's arrest. In its drive to conclude its term by the end of this month, the Court will issue more decisions on Thursday and Friday. These were among the other developments today: Families in Federal Courts The Court ruled, 9 to 0, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to try suits for damages between family members who live in different states. While Federal courts, under what is known as "diversity jurisdiction," ordinarily hear cases between parties in different states, they are barred from hearing such cases that concern "domestic relations," such as divorce or child custody. The Court reaffirmed that prohibition today. The specific question in this case, Ankenbrandt v. Richards, No. 91-367, was whether that prohibition was broad enough to exclude suits for damages -- in this case, damages from child abuse -- that do not require a judicial evaluation of the status of a marital or child custody issue. In an opinion by Justice White, the Court said that because such cases can be resolved like any other tort case, the prohibition against jurisdiction should not apply. The decision overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans. Juries in Capital Cases In a significant victory for the defense in death penalty cases, the Court ruled that defendants have a constitutional right to have prospective jurors questioned on whether they would automatically vote to impose the death penalty if they decided the defendant was guilty. In a 6-to-3 opinion by Justice White, the Court said that judges must ask such a question if defense requests, and must dismiss any juror who answers yes. The decision, Morgan v. Illinois, No. 91-5118, overturned the death sentence of a man convicted of killing a narcotics dealer for a $4,000 payment. Under the Court's decisions concerning the death penalty, imposition of a death sentence may not be automatic, but must be preceded by a weighing of the facts of each case. Justice White said that while it was clear that anyone facing a death sentence is entitled to an impartial jury, that right would be meaningless if jurors who would automatically vote for death could not be discovered and removed. The prosecution has the right, under a series of Supreme Court decisions, to remove jurors who indicate their opposition to the death penalty would prevent them from ever imposing it. In effect, the Court today said the defense is entitled to the same guarantee of impartiality. The majority opinion was joined by Justices Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter. Justice Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas. They denounced the majority opinion in biting terms. "The Court strikes a further blow against the People in its campaign against the death penalty," Justice Scalia said, adding: "Not only must mercy be allowed, but now only the merciful may be permitted to sit in judgment." He said this result "not only is not required by the Constitution of the United States; it grossly offends it." Death Sentence Appeals Without comment, the Court refused to hear two challenges to an Idaho law that gives prisoners who are sentenced to death 42 days in which to appeal through a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Other state prisoners, by contrast, have five years from the date of conviction in which to file a petition. Two convicted murderers argued that the disparity violated the constitutional guarantees of both due process and equal protection. Idaho defended the law on the ground that the short deadline was an effective and legitimate way of combating undue delay in death penalty appeals. The prisoners lost before the Idaho Supreme Court. The cases were Fain v. Idaho, No. 91-5550, and Rhoades v. Idaho, No. 91-6732.

189-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Reactions to Quayle Split on Party Lines
The response from elected officials in New York to Vice President Dan Quayle's remarks yesterday divided sharply along party lines. Republicans accepted Mr. Quayle's criticism that the party in power in the city -- the Democrats -- had been responsible for its mounting woes. But Democrats said Mr. Quayle and his fellow Republicans in Washington had abdicated their responsibility to the nation's cities in general and to New York City in particular. A sample of the reactions follows. Mayor David N. Dinkins, a Democrat who has been a strong advocate of Federal aid for cities: "America's cities and farms need resources. But all the Vice President has to offer is rhetoric, rhetoric and more rhetoric. Simply put, the reason our nation is in such trouble is because our national leaders have spent more time pointing fingers than proposing realistically designed and adequately funded solutions." Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, who is a former Republican Representative: "He's not alone in making those accusations. You don't have to go to Washington to get New York bashing. You can go to Albany. It's a popular thing to do. New York City is not terribly well liked throughout our state or throughout the rest of the country. "Over the years we haven't done much to create a better image for New York City. We have demonstrated a certain degree of arrogance. We're known as a spendthrift city." City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, a Democrat who is seeking her party's nomination to run against Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato: "I think it's quite clear the Reagan-Bush priorities have been city-bashing since the time President Reagan took office. Since the Reagan-Bush tenure in office, New York City has lost more than $7 billion in Federal aid. We have problems of homelessness directly related to the Federal cutbacks for housing." Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, a Democrat: "Dan Quayle has become the attack dog of the Bush re-election effort, a modern version of Spiro Agnew. I predict Dan Quayle's ideas are going to be just as discredited in the 90's as Agnew's were in the 70's. Once again the victimizer is coming to New York to blame the victim. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn: "George Bush fiddles while America's cities burn, and his response is to send his pit puppy, Dan Quayle, to bash New York again. Dan Quayle is hardly an expert on urban affairs."

190-> All It Takes Is a Ruble And a Dream
A California company has won a contract to provide a lottery and keno system to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Under the terms of the agreement announced Tuesday, International Totalizator Systems would receive 6 percent of the gross revenues from the system, a share that could yield $3 million to $12 million in annual profits, company officials said. James Walters, president and chief executive, said the project would involve a $1.5 million investment from the company and $1.5 million from a private-government joint venture company, with which International Totalizator has the lottery contract. October Beginning Set The initial phase of the lottery calls for a 500-terminal system, with growth to 1,000 terminals by next year. Plans call for the system to begin operations in October. The lottery would eventually be operated from street kiosks, Mr. Walters said, with additional sites in train stations and other gathering areas. The games would accept both hard currency and rubles. Mr. Walters said negotiations for the system began 18 months ago when his company was approached by a New York City X-ray equipment company already doing business in Georgia. The company, which is the Georgian Government's partner in the joint venture matching the International Totalizator investment, was looking for a lottery equipment supplier. Negotiations had to be restarted, Mr. Walters said, after fighting in Georgia. "Once the fighting was over, we had a whole new group of people to negotiate with," he said. International Totalizator will be responsible for supplying two managers to oversee the systems operations. "It's a 15-year contract and we hope over the life of the contract to replace them with local people," Mr. Walters said. Under the agreement, the Georgian Government will allow the company to repatriate hard currency profits, untaxed by the Government. In addition, Georgia will allow the company to bring its equipment into the country duty-free, officials said. Mr. Walters said the company was also negotiating to bring such games to Russia and other former Soviet republics.

191-> Au Pair's Lawyer Blames 2 Men for Fire That Killed Infant
For the first time in court today, the defense lawyer for a Swiss au pair named a convicted felon as the man who she said really set the fire that took the life of a 3-month-old girl last December. The lawyer also asserted that the boyfriend of the infant's half sister arranged the arson and acted as the lookout. But after hearing the arguments with the jury out of the courtroom, Judge Donald N. Silverman said the defense lawyer, Laura A. Brevetti, had based her theory on "wild speculation" and "a whole lot of nonsense." Then, in a major setback for the defense, the judge barred any evidence of other possible arson fires from being mentioned to the jury. Following two hours of what amounted to an outline of the defense's shadow case against other potential arson suspects, Judge Silverman said he would not permit Ms. Brevetti "to throw supposed facts and many theories before a jury and invite a jury to speculate on all sorts of things that are not warranted by the evidence." Ms. Brevetti has based her defense on the theory that someone entered the house in Thornwood where the au pair, Olivia Riner, was alone with the infant, Kristie Fischer, and set three separate fires. Miss Riner is charged with arson and murder. After dropping hints about another suspect for weeks, Ms. Brevetti charged today that the fire was set by Eric Trimpe, a 29-year old Thornwood resident with a history of minor arrests and a burglary conviction, describing him as a "pathological fire setter." She said Mr. Trimpe, who was questioned by the police about two other arsons six weeks after the fire at the Fischer home, "was used" by John P. Gallagher 3d, the boyfriend of 22-year-old Leah Fischer. But the defense lawyer did not provide any evidence of any link between Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Trimpe. And the prosecutor, George L. Bolen, said Mr. Trimpe had never been arrested for arson. Mr. Trimpe could not be reached for comment today but he has previously said he had nothing to do with the fire. Mr. Gallagher, under oath, denied any connection to the fire. 'Troubled' but Not Convicted The prosecutor, Mr. Bolen, said there was no evidence Mr. Gallagher had anything to do with the fire at the Fischer home and that there was "absolutely nothing" to tie Mr. Trimpe to the fire. He called Mr. Trimpe a "troubled man" but said he had never been convicted of any arson. Mr. Bolen also attacked Ms. Brevetti for what he called a baseless attack on Mr. Gallagher. In Ms. Brevetti's presentation, she said defense investigators uncovered 20 arson fires in the area of the Fischers' home between March 1991 and February 1992. She called that a more than 200 percent increase from prior arson rates. The fire that killed Kristie Fischer occurred on Dec. 2, 1991, one month after Miss Riner arrived. Ms. Brevetti listed similarities between some of those fires and the one at the Fischer home, which is a quarter-mile from Mr. Trimpe's home. The police obtained a search warrant in February to search Mr. Trimpe's home for evidence after the two other arsons in Mount Pleasant six weeks after the fire at the Fischer home. Mr. Trimpe was not arrested for those arsons, but was charged with harassment, the defense lawyer said, after he "sicced his dog" on a police officer. Ms. Brevetti said her investigators had also discovered a police memorandum from the same time that directed officers to make hourly checks at the home of Mr. Trimpe and at the then-vacant home of the Fischers. The memo, she suggested, indicated the police believed that Mr. Trimpe might set a second fire in the Fischer home. Under questioning by the judge, Ms. Brevetti said her evidence that Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Trimpe were acquainted came from two sources. One, the defense lawyer said, was a televised interview in which Mr. Trimpe said he knew Mr. Gallagher, 26, from high school and, like Mr. Gallagher, was involved in auto racing. Ms. Brevetti also said she had "a source" who is a former Mount Pleasant police officer who had told her he had seen Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Trimpe "in each other's company" and at the police station. Ms. Brevetti then said Mr. Gallagher had a motive because he was upset after he was told by the Fischers that he had to stop a regular pattern of sleeping at the Fischer home after Kristie was born. But Judge Silverman said no evidence yet supported that theory and called it "a whole lot of nonsense." Judge Silverman said to introduce such evidence the defense would have to prove a "clear link," not mere suspicion that someone other than Miss Riner committed the arson. Ms. Brevetti, he said, had not done that. "You're conjuring up a fantastic story that has a lot of interesting elements," the judge said, "but what proof is there that anything you have just said has any credence?"

192-> A Clue to Longevity Found at Chromosome Tip
HUMAN chromosomes, shaped like cinch-waisted sausages and sequestered in nearly every cell of the body, are famed as the place where human genes reside. But now some scientists are finding that a few small architectural details of the chromosomes are at least as tantalizing as the 100,000 genes they harbor. Biologists have discovered that at the very tips of the chromosomes are extraordinary structures built of six DNA letters repeated over and over, thousands of times, like monotonous molecular chants. They are learning that these structures, called telomeres, are profoundly important at every stage of the cell's life, protecting the chromosomes against harm, organizing them into their proper position and, most provocatively, possibly serving as a sort of timekeeping mechanism that tells the cell how old it is. The work has broad implications for the study of aging and for understanding the perverse sort of cell immortality that is manifested by cancerous cells. Scientists have determined that human telomeres are shaved down slightly whenever a cell divides, and they believe the length of the chromosome tip could offer the cell a measure of how many times it has divided -- and how many divisions remain before the cell's innate life span is spent. And though individual cells die and are replaced throughout a person's life, some researchers suspect that there is a strong correlation between telomere length and the aging of the entire human being. On average, the telomeres of a 70-year-old are much shorter than those of a child, and biologists propose that once the telomeres of most cells in the body fall below a certain length, death is likely to follow. The results could point the way toward developing new treatments to help shore up elderly cells, particularly in parts of the body where wear and tear are most relentless, such as along the coronary arteries. But scientists emphasize that many components of the body change with time, and that the puzzle of aging and death is surely more complex than telomere status alone. Other studies have shown that telomeres undergo a dramatic transformation during the genesis and progression of cancer. When a cell becomes malignant and begins dividing out of bounds, its telomeres at first become shortened, whittled down with each illicit cellular split. Presenting their results in San Diego at a recent meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, several groups of scientists said that telomere length could be used to determine the stage of a cancer cell: the more diminutive the tip compared with the patient's healthy cells, the more advanced the malignancy. More intriguing still, new experiments suggest that at a very advanced and highly aggressive stage of tumor development, the telomere shrinking may cease, and may even reverse itself. Reporting in the current issue of the European molecular biology journal EMBO, Dr. Carol W. Greider of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, Dr. Silvia Bacchetti of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and their colleagues have found that most cancer-like cells growing in the laboratory eventually die, but that a fraction of those cells will become immortalized, essentially able to divide forever. The scientists have found that in those immortalized cells an enzyme called telomerase, which is normally quiet in adult cells, has swung into action and has started rebuilding the telomeres, a skill that may prove deadly for a cancer patient. If telomere length is the timepiece designed to tell a cell to expire gracefully, and if that length fails to dwindle from one doubling to the next, no internal signal may remain to prevent the cell's ambitions from overwhelming the entire body. But the new insights into telomerase also suggest a way of blocking late-stage cancer. The researchers propose that if a drug could interfere with the activity of the telomerase enzyme, the immortal cancer cells could be destroyed without damaging most normal cells. Searching through a variety of healthy tissue types, the biologists so far have been able to detect hints of telomerase activity only in sperm cells, where the enzyme seems necessary to keep chromosomes at the most youthfully elongated length possible. Thus, an attack targeted at telomerase may have no more severe effect than to cut back sperm production. Designing telomerase blockers may not be difficult. Other work suggests that the enzyme somewhat resembles reverse transcriptase, the molecule at work in the virus that causes AIDS, and biologists are testing drugs known to block reverse transcriptase to see if they are effective against telomerase and hence are a potential remedy for advanced cancers. Affects Cell Mutation Many basic researchers are passionate about telomeres for what they believe the structures will reveal about the fundamental nature of chromosome design. Regions of the genetic material that lie adjacent to the telomeres seem to be particularly prone to recombining, able to mix and match with other chromosomes during the creation of eggs and sperm cells. Because they shuffle around so much, these chromosomal regions, in theory, are more likely than other zones of the chromosomes to mutate in ways that could start cancer tumbling. . Scientists are seeking to determine whether the telomeres might protect the genes that directly abut them, perhaps by attracting the zealous attention of the cell's repair enzymes, and in so doing whether they help counterbalance the risk that comes with living next door to a telomere. "There's no end to the interest of the scientific community" in the study of telomeres, said Dr. Elizabeth H. Blackburn of the University of California at San Francisco, described by her colleagues as the queen of telomeres. "They're turning out to be quite intriguing, and to be made in such a funny way." That intrigue began in the early 1970's, when one of the greats of modern genetics, Dr. Barbara McClintock of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., observed during her studies of corn that broken chromosomes were extremely unstable, and she proposed that normal chromosomes must possess protective structures to prevent their degradation. Those structures turned out to be the telomeres. Clues in Pond Creatures Dr. Blackburn's laboratory took up the detailed investigation of these chromosomal rail guards, turning to single-cell organisms similar to the paramecia that swim through pond water. Such creatures are equipped with tens of thousands of extremely tiny chromosomes, rather than the mere 46 matched pairs found in human cells. More chromosomes per cell means that many more telomeres that can be isolated and deciphered. Dr. Blackburn and her student, Dr. Greider, and others described the peculiar telomeres in great detail, finding that they were composed of a sequence of only six DNA bases, or molecular subunits, repeated thousands of times at both ends of every single chromosome. In human cells, the sequence is TTAGGG, and it is repeated anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 times depending on the cell type and its age. The sequence does not mean anything on its own, but it serves, among other tasks, to stabilize the chromosomes. "The telomeres are like bookends," said Dr. Blackburn. "They hold everything in place." Dr. Greider then found how those telomeres are created and maintained, particularly in organisms like the pond creatures and yeast cells, which divide indefinitely. She discovered the enzyme, telomerase, and found that it had an outstanding property, observed in no other enzyme. Within the enzyme complex is a little template made of the chemical RNA, a sort of rubber stamp of the six necessary letters that can be used to add new sequences to the chromosome ends whenever they are required. "The enzyme carries this template sequence along with itself," she said. "This was something completely new that had never been seen before." Researchers have since observed that while the telomerase rubber-stamp enzyme works in paramecia and other simple species full time, it does not seem to be active in most human tissue, or in that of other mammals. Instead, mammalian telomeres seem to shrink with age, a result of the way the linear chromosomes are duplicated whenever a cell divides. Normal human cells divide between 70 and 100 times, and with each split they lose about 50 letters of their telomeres from both chromosomal ends. Before the telomeres vanish altogether, the chromosomes sandwiched between them become warped and sticky, attaching themselves to other chromosomes in such twisted configurations that the cell eventually dies. Scientists are still trying to figure out whether the gradual loss of telomeres actually causes the cell to age and die, or is merely an incidental byproduct of the passage of time. Some believe that telomere degradation is no more responsible for the aging of the cell than graying hair is for the aging of an entire human, and they await evidence to the contrary. . Dr. Calvin H. Harley of McMaster University, who collaborates with Dr. Greider, believes that such proof is forthcoming. In studies of cells proliferating in laboratory dishes, he and others have found that the shrinking telomeres keep the chromosomes remarkably stable until right before the cell's allotted time is through, rather than everything falling apart in a gradual, piecemeal fashion. He suggests this is no coincidence but that the extremely short telomeres could somehow signal other molecules in the cell to stop cell division in preparation for death. "The genetic stability of the chromosomes remains very normal until the cells get very close to the end of their life span," he said. "At that point, there's a dramatic increase in chromosomal aberrations. This suggests a functional purpose for the telomeres," as the cell's clock. But the link between chromosome tips and aging remains slippery, he said, and no miraculous telomeric anti-aging potion is likely to emerge from the research any time soon. Intriguing Cancer Link More therapeutically promising are studies of telomeres and cancer. Beyond the possibility of blocking the aberrant telomerase enzyme at a late stage of cancer, researchers also believe there are applications of telomere research to treating early phases of a tumor. Dr. Bradford Windle of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center in San Antonio, Tex., is working on an approach he calls chromosome healing, to help repair chromosomes that are splintered through mutational blows by radiation or other environmental assaults. As scientists have seen, a broken chromosome is likely to recombine mistakenly with other chromosome bits it is not meant to encounter. That sort of degradation usually leads to cell death, but every so often a misguided chromosomal fragment rearranges itself in a way that switches on a cancer gene and a tumor is born. Working with hamster cells, Dr. Windle and his colleagues have explored whether or not artificial telomeres can be applied to broken chromosomes to prevent their perilous entanglement with the wrong sort of genetic partner. They have found that by flooding the cells with the magic sequence of molecular letters, TTAGG, they can cap off the snapped pieces and thereby forestall any perilous chromosomal rearrangements. Dr. Windle suggests that the approach could be most useful in those people with a predisposition to cancer, whose chromosomes may have a tendency to break and who therefore are in need of molecular healing. Whether the approach will work in human patients remains to be demonstrated. For now, the study of telomeres offers yet another graphic demonstration of how cell death and malignant growth are closely intertwined, and that sooner or later, if one doesn't get you, the other one will.

194-> Albany Seeks More Money for Child Health Insurance
For Flavia M. Torres, a 28-year-old Bronx mother, a new state program to provide health insurance for the children of the working poor has been nothing short of "a godsend." Until April, when she was able to enroll her previously uninsured children in the Child Health Plus program, Ms. Torres had to constantly weigh the cost of a doctor's visit against the condition of the child's health. Now she and her children illustrate the success of a program that is quickly outgrowing its $20 million budget and that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Democratic legislators hope to expand. Before joining Child Health Plus, Ms. Torres would delay visits to the endocrinologist and ophthalmologist for her 10-year-old daughter, Christina, who has diabetes. She would put off the annual checkups recommended for her 3-year-old son, Andrew, who has bone growths that could become malignant. And as she fretted about her children's health, she struggled to pay off hundreds of dollars in doctors' bills, often $10 at a time. That all changed when administrators at Ms. Torres's health clinic told her that she qualified for Child Health Plus. The program, which started last year, provides insurance for primary and preventive health care at low or no cost for poor children up to the age of 13. "When they offered me this program I told my husband that somebody's really looking out for us because we were really at our deep end," said Ms. Torres, whose husband is disabled and who makes $20,000 a year as a doctor's aide. "I thought we were going to have to spend everything we saved on health care." Similar testimonials are being heard across the state. After a slow start, largely because few people knew about the program, Child Health Plus now covers 27,000 children. It is attracting 3,500 applicants a month and has a waiting list of 1,800 children. State officials said the program's budget would force them to cut off enrollment at between 30,000 and 35,000 children, far below the estimated 55,000 children who qualify. Now Mr. Cuomo and the Democrats who control the Assembly want to double the program's budget by passing legislation that would allow them to raid the state's Bad Debt and Charity Care pool. That fund exists to compensate hospitals for the cost of indigent health care and is financed by fees added to hospital bills. The Hospital Association of New York, while praising Child Health Plus, opposes the financing plan. And the Republican-controlled Senate, which traditionally has protected the interests of hospitals and other health-care providers, has serious concerns about the bill. The chairman of the Senate Health Committee, Michael J. Tully Jr., Republican of Roslyn Heights, L.I., supports the concept of the program, but has "problems with continually raiding the Bad Debt and Charity Care pools," said Daniel Curran, his spokesman. Mr. Curran said that negotiations were continuing on the bill, but that the Legislature was expected to recess by the end of next week. The prospect of seizing money from the Bad Debt and Charity Care pool is particularly offensive to the hospital association because the Governor's budget division seized about $14 million from the insurance program earlier this year. That money went unused in the program's first year because of low enrollment and was used to help fill the state's budget gap. Lobbyists for children's health groups maintain that the program will save the state money in the long run by providing primary health-care services -- everything from immunizations to flu treatments -- for a large segment of the state's uninsured children. That type of care diminishes the burden on public hospital emergency rooms, which often provide such care for the poor, and on the state's social services and public health bureaucracies. The program is restricted to the children of parents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but who either have jobs that do not offer health insurance or who are too poor to afford it. It is available at no cost to children under 13 whose families have incomes below 160 percent of the Federal poverty level. That level is currently $10,930 for a family of three, so the cutoff is $17,488. Families with incomes between 160 percent and 222 percent of the poverty level, which is $24,264 for a family of three, pay $25 a year to enroll each child, up to $100.

196-> Utilities Say '81 New York Law Is Proving Costly
New York State consumers will pay $4.5 billion or more in extra costs in the 1990's, according to the state's utilities, because of a law passed in Albany at the tail end of the last energy crisis. The law was intended to nurture competition in electricity generation and improve efficiency by offering a minimum price to independent producers. Now those prices look extremely generous because of an unexpected drop in utilities' own costs. The Cuomo administration is seeking a repeal of the law. But the industry that the law helped to create, independent power production, is lobbying hard to keep its provisions, at least for the time being. Changing Conditions The conflict illustrates the pitfalls of long-term energy policy, with a law enacted at a time of high fuel prices and perceived shortages creating unexpected problems a decade later, after the energy market took an unexpected turn toward cheaper, more abundant supplies. The law was meant to incubate small projects that use "renewable" fuels or that use oil and gas efficiently. It promised entrepreneurs who built generating stations that they could sell to utilities for a minimum price of 6 cents a kilowatt-hour. The utilities would then resell the electricity to their own customers. The Consolidated Edison Company, which won its first rate increase in a decade in April, said one reason it needed to charge more was the expense of buying power from independent generators, even though its peak demand for power was falling. The recession and an unexpected dip in fuel costs have left New York with a surplus of electricity and produced a crash in the wholesale price. Consequently, the utilities now say that they are required to pay 6 cents for power from the independents that they could make themselves for 3. "We're being locked into contracts well above market levels," said Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority, who has been lobbying for a repeal. "The law was enacted back in 1981, and it was a different world in those days. We projected then that electricity prices would continue to rise." Carol E. Murphy, the executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying group in Albany, acknowledged that future projects should not be guaranteed 6 cents. But if existing contracts were abrogated, she said, no one would ever build another independent plant in New York. And the new plants are cleaner than the cheaper older ones owned by utilities, she said. Still, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which serves a huge area of upstate New York, says that its deals with the independents will cost its customers an extra $3 billion. Customers of Con Edison, which serves New York City and most of Westchester, may pay $1 billion more and customers of the Long Island Lighting Company may pay $500 million, by those companies' estimates. About 1,900 megawatts of independent power production is now on line, with another 4,700 megawatts under contract, according to Ms. Murphy, at a cost of about $10.6 billion. The total capacity of these plants is roughly 10 times the size of the abandoned Shoreham nuclear plant. Demand Is Down One reason for the utilities' saying that the cost is excessive is that the demand for power is stable or shrinking because of the recession and because of aggressive promotion of conservation by utilities. If demand was rising, then the choice would be between new capacity built by the utilities or by the independent producers. But the utilities say that currently if it were not for distortions of the energy market caused by public policy, no new capacity would have to be built at all. Ms. Murphy, speaking for the independent producers, said "what we have here is a very temporary energy glut." She added, "If you assume that some part of the utility system is going to have to be shut down or retired, the best guess of everyone is that we're going to need more power by the end of the century." Ms. Murphy's position is that the cost of complying with the Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 will sharply raise the utilities' cost estimate of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. She added that the public would probably be willing to pay a premium for cleaner power. "If you ask people if they'd rather spend 6 cents for hydropower or 5 cents for a coal burner or a foreign-oil burner, most people would probably pick 6 cents," she said. Nearly 500 megawatts of the 8,500 megawatts of existing and planned capacity is hydroelectric. Most of the rest is fired by natural gas, often generating steam for industrial use along with electricity, raising total efficiency. Under a Federal law, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, such co-generators and generators using clean sources have a guaranteed market for their power with the utilities. Not everyone is convinced that the state contracts are such a bad deal for consumers. Another analyst, Christopher O. Ward, the assistant commissioner of energy policy and programs in New York City's Department of Telecommunications and Energy, said that the independent projects had another advantage, providing diversity of fuel in the electric system. He added that in utility planning, because of continuously changing circumstances, "you can't not take a risk." Proposing Changes Mr. Flynn, however, said he would like a reorganized system for signing contracts, with the price not being set until late in the process, and a requirement that construction start soon after the contract is signed, to reduce the risk posed by changing conditions. For her part, Ms. Murphy said that without a firm price in hand, financing such a project would be impossible. The utilities, she said, have never liked independent generators, and Mr. Flynn, she added, wanted to scuttle the contracts in retaliation for the demise of his agency's contract to buy power from Hydro-Quebec. That contract was canceled as uneconomic earlier this year, an action the independent producers had lobbied for. Mr. Flynn said that just as the Hydro-Quebec contract had been canceled as uneconomic, other such contracts should be terminated.

197-> Talks Focus on Environment In Push for Free Trade Pact
Canadian, Mexican and American trade negotiators labored over the environmental section of a North American free trade agreement today, trying to put the finishing touches on a deal that President Bush could announce Friday, people involved in the negotiations said. But a Canadian spokesman, Yves Gagnon, said tonight that the three nations' trade ministers stopped talking at 9 P.M. and would resume negotiations before 9 A.M. Friday. Democrats have strongly criticized the planned accord on labor and environmental grounds, forcing a review of the environmental provisions in a last-minute effort to make the pact more palatable politically. The White House has long been said to want President Bush to have a free trade agreement to boast of at the Republican Convention, which opens in Houston in 10 days. Some Democrats have openly worried that the Administration might make costly concessions for the sake of a quick deal. "I don't think there is any question they are trying to rush this thing through, and the Mexicans and the Canadians have very good negotiators," said Representative Robert Matsui, Democrat of California. "I'm afraid we may get the short end of the stick if they become aware of our political considerations." But Administration officials were quick to insist that Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, would not accept a poor deal for political reasons. "She knows there are certain things that have got to be in the deal, and if they're not there, then they have to keep going," an American official said. Campaigning in Davenport, Iowa, this morning, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas suggested to a group of hard-hatted workers at the Nichols Home Shield Company that he could strike a better deal than Mr. Bush, while repeating his support for negotiating an agreement. The Democratic Presidential candidate said he believed that a free trade pact with Mexico would be good for the United States. "But I don't know if it would be the kind Mr. Bush would sign," Mr. Clinton said. The House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 tonight in favor of a nonbinding resolution calling for the accord not to jeopardize American health, safety and environmental standards. After initial opposition to such specific wording, the Bush Administration reversed course to support the resolution. The White House, which has come slowly to agree that the environment had a place in the accord, appears ready to accept the creation of a trilateral panel on the environment, along with detailed rules to prevent countries from lowering their environmental standards to attract foreign investment. Still under discussion are the powers of the panel and the extent to which the agreement will allow trade disputes involving environmental issues to be appealed to special arbitration panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade, has called for the trilateral panel to have enforcement powers, a position that Canadian officials briefly backed. But the Bush Administration has ruled this out as involving excessive regulation. The broad outlines of the free-trade agreement were set by Tuesday evening, but many technical details are still being worked out, people involved in the negotiations said. These involve rules for the settling of commercial disputes and trade in autos, beer and glass. But an American official said tonight that the odds of a deal on Friday were "somewhat less than 50-50." Discussions on Autos Progress on rules for settling disputes left the key details still unsettled in the auto trade. The negotiators have reached a rough understanding that cars and trucks will only qualify for duty-free treatment under the pact if slightly more than 60 percent of their value is produced in North America, but continue to discuss how to calculate this figure. The possibility remains that some remaining details may prove contentious and that a pact may not be ready for an official announcement before Mr. Bush leaves for Kennebunkport, Me, on Friday afternoon. If the trade ministers decide that too many details remain unresolved for them to announce a pact, the negotiations might be suspended for the weekend to allow the participants to recover. Friday will be the sixth straight day of talks for the ministers, who often worked until late at night, and the 10th straight day of work for their chief negotiators. But negotiators for all three countries have been reluctant to adjourn for fear that their counterparts may backtrack on concessions made so far.

198-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Behind the Scenes; The Other Albert Gore Watches Proudly From Tennessee
After a lunch of clam chowder and crackers today Albert Gore Sr. sat at his kitchen table and watched the television in proud silence as his son and namesake accepted an invitation to become the Democratic nominee for Vice President. But when Senator Al Gore, who does not use the "Jr." after his name, proclaimed that the Democratic ticket represented a new generation of leadership in American politics, the white-haired man erupted, "Now that's a powerful statement." His wife, Pauline, 79 years old, patted him on the back. Generational change flows through the kitchen of the Gores' farmhouse in the Cumberland Valley about 40 miles east of Nashville. All around there are memorabilia from two political careers, the father's and the son's. A Poster from '76 On one wall is a fan Mr. Gore handed out during his first Congressional campaign, in 1938. It bears a black-and-white picture of him looking grimly serious in a stiff collar, his hair carefully slicked in waves. Next to it is a color poster from his son's first Congressional campaign, in 1976, showing a smiling, well-coiffed candidate. All around there are pictures of the elder Mr. Gore, who served seven terms in the House of Representatives and three in the Senate with the likes of Adlai E. Stevenson, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. And, as he watched his son and Gov. Bill Clinton make their speeches from Little Rock today, Mr. Gore, 84 years old, thought they might resurrect the great coalition that brought Democrats so many victories in his day. After the television was turned off he said, "I looked at these two very talented young men and I thought they might just succeed in reunifying the Democrats of the South and forming a bridge to the Democrats of the East and North and West and that it might just last for more than one administration." The passage of political generations was noted once before on this hilltop farm overlooking the dark green waters of the Caney Fork River as the great Democratic coalition born in the New Deal era was finally dissolving. Opposition to Vietnam War It was 1969, and the elder Mr. Gore was already in political trouble because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. His son had just come home after graduating from Harvard and was facing an almost certain summons from the draft board. "I was one of those who believed it was not a justifiable cause," Mr. Gore said. "We discussed it, but I don't know what effect my views had on Al. He told me he had a decision to make, and he took a long walk alone around the farm. When he came back, he told us he would fulfill his legal duty, that in fact he would volunteer." While his son was in Vietnam, Mr. Gore had to defend his anti-war position in the toughest campaign of his career, and he was defeated for re-election in 1970. Mr. Gore then began to divide his time between a Washington law practice, teaching law at Vanderbilt University and the farm. He later became a vice-president of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and only retired as a corporate officer eight years ago, though he remains a member of the board. The younger Mr. Gore grew up with politics all around him, and today, after he left for Little Rock, his father said, "We raised him for it. I taught him to work hard and to do his duty and his mother made sure he studied his lessons. But, the father says he never pushed the son to seek elected office. Mr. Gore recalls that it came as a complete surprise when his son announced he would run for Congress in 1976. "I kind of offered to roll up my sleeves," Mr. Gore said, "but Al told me, 'Dad, I'm very grateful, but I must not be my father's candidate.' " Mr. Gore was pleased with his son's performance today and after talking to the Vice-Presidential candidate by telephone, he said, "I told him it was a very good speech." And then laughing, he added, "I told him nobody would call him 'wooden' today." It was a reference to the poor reviews of Senator Gore's campaign style during his unsuccessful run for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. In this campaign Mr. Gore said that his role would be parental not political. "Unless somebody wants me to give a couple of country boy speeches, Pauline and I are going to Washington to look after our grandchildren," he said.

SEEMA BOESKY says in a television interview that she never suspected her husband, IVAN, the convicted stock speculator, of doing anything illegal on Wall Street but sued him for divorce when she learned he was cheating on her with another woman. After Mr. Boesky, the arbitrager convicted of filing false stock-trading records, sued his wife for $1 million a year in temporary alimony last month, Mrs. Boesky agreed to talk to BARBARA WALTERS on the "20/20" program on ABC-TV tonight "to correct the record." In a transcript provided by ABC, she denies that the money Mr. Boesky is seeking came from his illegal activities. "We didn't commingle our money," she says. "My money is clearly my money." She says her father made "a small fortune" in real estate and left it to her and her sister. Mrs. Boesky says that when her husband told her of the crime he had committed, her first reaction was "to reach out to him." But 10 days later, she found out there was another woman, in the same Manhattan apartment building where they were living, "and that was it for me."

Bruce Coslet spoke, but the San Francisco 49ers apparently weren't paying attention. The victory Coslet predicted for the Jets this week did little more than raise a few eyebrows here. "He said that?" asked 49er safety David Whitmore. "That's a pretty bold statement for the guy to make. I can't understand his basis for making it. The Jets have a good team, but we've got a good team, too. For him to say something like that, he must know something we don't." Coslet, the Jets' coach, likely knows that an 0-3 start to the season would create a difficult springboard for the weeks that follow. But the 49ers seem preoccupied by their own problems, specifically how to come back from a 34-31 loss to the Buffalo Bills last Sunday. They are still talking about that game. Coslet's comments could have been tacked up to the locker-room wall in anticipation of Sunday's Jets-49ers game at Giants Stadium, but most of the players here either hadn't heard about them or didn't much care. 'It's Kind of Refreshing' "I'll keep my thoughts on that to myself," said cornerback Eric Davis. But linebacker Mike Walter smiled when they were relayed to him. "Didn't Joe Namath do that a long time ago?" Walter said. "Coaches say all kinds of different things. It's kind of refreshing to hear one come out and say they're going to win instead of bringing out his fiddle and talk about how he doesn't know how they're going to line up against us. "If you're 0-2 like they are, it's a make-or-break game. It is for us, too." The 49ers (1-1) return to the Meadowlands for the second time in three weeks, but there is a collective sense among them that preparing for the Jets is less troublesome than playing the Bills, whose no-huddle offense gave them fits. "The Jets are basic in what they do," said Whitmore. "When they want to pass, they get three or four receivers on the field. When they want to run, they get three or four tight ends on the field. Last week, the Bills ran and passed with what they had in the game, and that made it hard to adjust defensively. "I'm not saying the Jets are easier to prepare for, but they take the guessing out of it." Bad Day for the Defense The 49er defense, typically rated among the best in the National Conference, gave up 510 total yards to Buffalo, including 403 passing yards to Jim Kelly. "As a defensive player, I feel like we let our offense down," said Whitmore. "It's terrible to lose a game like that. You want to come back and redeem yourself." The Jets' offense has produced just two touchdowns, neither of them rushing, and now Ken O'Brien will replace Browning Nagle at quarterback. The less mobile O'Brien has been sacked 328 times in eight pro seasons, and the offensive line has recently been spotty. Left guard Dave Cadigan was called for two holding penalties in last Sunday's 27-10 loss to Pittsburgh, and right guard Dwayne White missed a practice this week because of a sprained ankle. With instability in front of him, O'Brien could face problems standing in the pocket. "He's a veteran, and he's been around the league for a while," Walter said. "You don't expect him to move around back there as much as some quarterbacks. I don't think it's in their game plan to have him scramble. We'll let him if he wants to and take our chances." O'Brien might not be capable of striking as quickly as Kelly, said Walter, but the Jets do create their own havoc. Play-Action Worries "They're different," Walter said of the Jets and Bills. "Last week, the big thing was the no-huddle offense. This week, we've got a great play-action team. These guys might be more predictable, but that doesn't always make it easier to adjust." And perhaps the Jets have motivation, as well. But even discounting Coslet's prediction, so do the 49ers. "They're 0-2 and it's their first home game," said Whitmore. "It's not going to be a tough game for them to get motivated for. For two weeks we played two great teams with great players. The approach we're taking now is that we had a terrible game defensively last week. We've got to come back now and get these guys stopped."

202-> City Council Gives Horses Freer Rein
After intense lobbying by the horse-drawn carriage industry, the City Council voted yesterday to allow carriage drivers to operate their rigs around much of Manhattan and not just through Central Park. The vote, to amend a 1989 law that restricts the carriages to the park for most of the day, followed months of battling that pitted the tiny carriage industry against animal lovers and those who feared that expansion would create traffic hazards. After the 32-to-18 vote by the Council, aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was leaning toward vetoing the amendment, which would also expand the carriages' hours of operation. To override the veto, the supporters of the amendment would need the votes of two-thirds of the Council, or two votes more than the amendment received yesterday. A Raucous Debate In a raucous debate before the vote, Council members invoked George Washington, Edmund Burke and Rodney G. King. They weighed the relative hazards posed by dog and horse droppings. And they scrambled to assert their credentials as lovers of animals, the Irish (who own or drive many of the carriages) and jobs. Supporters and opponents of the amendment packed the gallery of the Council chamber, cheering their champions and booing and hissing their foes. After the vote, one woman in the gallery stood and stuck her tongue out at the carriage-driver camp. Several Council members said they hoped that the same energy that went into yesterday's debate would be applied to issues affecting greater numbers of New Yorkers. There are only 68 city-licensed horse carriages in New York City. The amendment was hotly debated because animal-rights advocates had made it a test of Council members' concerns for animals, while supporters of the amendment contended that the survival of the horse-carriage industry was at stake. In addition, Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens, suggested that some opponents of the measure were biased against the Irish. That prompted many Council members to go to great lengths to emphasize their support of the Irish. "I love the Irish," declared Israel Ruiz, a Democrat from the Bronx, once he finished describing how much he liked riding horses. "I have a lot in common with the Irish." Noach Dear, a Democrat from Brooklyn and a sponsor of the amendment, said that he owed the Irish a great debt because they had supported the founding of the state of Israel. He also confessed that though he did not own a cat or a dog, he was sympathetic to animal-rights causes. Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said she supported the amendment out of concern for both horses and the carriage drivers' jobs. "If these horses are not working," she said, "they become dog food." Carriage drivers said they were delighted with the vote. "Tonight I come to work very happy," said John Vallona, a 22-year-old Italian immigrant, as he stood beside his carriage on Central Park South last night. Patrick McIlroy, an Irish immigrant who was helping harness a horse at the Bicentennial stable on West 37th Street, said, "Business has definitely been hurt, especially with the recession. It doesn't help when you have people trying to take the bread away from your table." More Appeal to Tourists The carriage drivers say they can increase their earnings with longer hours and increased areas of operation because this would have more appeal to tourists and others who hire the carriages. To out-of-towners enchanted with the city, to couples enchanted with each other, a ride in a horse-drawn carriage is as much a part of the New York experience as that first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty or that first trip to the top of the Empire State Building. The lopsided vote surprised both supporters and opponents of the amendment, who were uncertain of the outcome going into yesterday's debate, although it is extremely rare for a bill, once passed by a Council committee, to fail on the floor. Kathryn E. Freed, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposed the measure, said: "There was a lot of pressure. Some people switched at the last minute." She said Mr. McCaffrey's raising of the Irish issue contributed to the pressure. Aides to the Mayor did not detail his objections to the amendment. "The bill is under review, but he casts a negative eye toward it at this moment," said Martha Hirst, the Mayor's chief legislative representative. "He's simply saying, 'I'm coming down on the side of restricting the horses.' " A veto of this amendment would be the Mayor's third, and the first of legislation passed by the expanded City Council. Horse-drawn carriages are now restricted to Central Park during daytime and forbidden to operate at all during the weekday rush hours of 7 to 10 A.M. and 4 to 7 P.M. They are excluded from midtown from 7 P.M. to midnight. The amended law would shave an hour off each of the rush periods, forbidding the carriages to operate from 7 to 9 A.M. and from 4:30 to 6:30 P.M., Monday to Friday. Under the amended law, the carriages could roll throughout Manhattan, with some exceptions: They could not operate from 7 A.M. to 12 midnight between 42d and 23d Streets and Third and Ninth Avenues. On most afternoons and evenings, the carriages would be banned from the area bounded by 42d and 57th Streets and Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue, and from the area bounded by 60th and 65th Streets and Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues. The 1989 law doubled the fare for a carriage ride to $34 for the first half-hour and $10 for each additional 15 minutes. That fare is unchanged by the Council's vote. The lopsided vote surprised both supporters and opponents of the amendment, who were uncertain of the outcome going into yesterday's debate, although it is extremely rare for a bill, once passed by a Council committee, to fail on the floor. Kathryn E. Freed, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposed the measure, said: "There was a lot of pressure. Some people switched at the last minute." She said Mr. McCaffrey's raising of the Irish issue contributed to the pressure, as did what she called lobbying and public-relations efforts by a group called Putting People First.

203-> July Output Increased 0.4%, Erasing the Decline of June
Production by the nation's industrial plants rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July to erase an identical drop in June, the Federal Reserve Board said today. But it noted a marked weakness in important manufacturing areas. The Fed attributed the rise to increased output from mines and utilities, which offset weakness in the more significant manufacturing sector. Manufacturing was unchanged after declining two-tenths of 1 percent in June. Private economists warned that the economy was losing steam after a burst of activity in the spring and early summer, much the same as happened a year ago. "The economy is not gaining momentum; it is coasting to a stop," said Jack Albertine, an analyst for Albertine Enterprises Inc. "The manufacturing sector, once the proud engine of growth in the American economy, is barely breathing." Also, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in June to the highest level in 16 months at $833.37 billion. The rise in inventories was the largest since an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in May 1990 and followed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in May. The bulge in supplies of goods on the shelves may cause retailers and wholesalers to hold back on placing new orders until they see signs that consumers are more willing to buy. The Fed said a second straight monthly cutback in auto production, as well as steadily weakening output in military industries, restrained manufacturing activity last month. "Much of this weakness is attributable to curtailed motor vehicle production, but output in some other major industries such as textiles, furniture, instruments and electrical machinery also dropped back," the Fed said. Consumer confidence has been undermined by high unemployment and poor opportunities for increasing incomes. Recent signs are that average wage earners' hopes for the future are growing more pessimistic rather than brightening. A private study called the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which is released to paying subscribers, showed a drop in its preliminary August reading to 75.3 from 76.6 in July, people in the financial markets said. There was evidence in the Fed's report on industrial output that manufacturers already were responding to weak consumer demand by scaling back their production plans. "Output of consumer durable goods, which includes motor vehicles and appliances, declined for a second straight month in July," the Fed said. "In addition, output of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment, which has been weak for some time, fell further in June and July.'

204-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Debut; Mrs. Clinton Introduces Mrs. Gore At Children's Hospital Ceremony
In the first "family values" tableau of the Clinton-Gore ticket, Hillary Clinton took Tipper Gore with her to visit the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. After the two couples and their children had lunch at the Governor's mansion, the candidates' wives left their families and spent half an hour together at a ceremony for Dr. Betty A. Lowe, a pediatrician who had just become vice president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Mrs. Clinton, who is on the hospital's board, introduced Mrs. Gore to the crowded, jostling audience of hospital employees and board members as someone with a commitment to "doing whatever she can do to try and strengthen the family." 'Extra-Added Benefit' She added that she was "doubly glad" that the Gores had joined the ticket because of an "extra-added benefit:" Two of the Gores' daughters, Kristen, 15 years old, and Sara, 12, are close to the age of her daughter, Chelsea, 12, and she said that gave her "a real extra good feeling." Mrs. Gore acknowledged the applause by staying seated and modestly nodding her head, still wearing the frozen smile and slightly dazed expression she had worn at the announcement that her husband, Senator Al Gore, was the choice of Gov. Bill Clinton as his Vice-Presidential running mate. Though often boldly outspoken in her crusade to curb obscene rock lyrics, Mrs. Gore today looked awed and slightly overwhelmed by the hoopla, and mostly kept silent, leaving the limelight to Mrs. Clinton. The hospital event, which had long been on Mrs. Clinton's schedule, turned out to be a fortuitous photo opportunity, placing the lawyer and the housewife side by side, bending over small, sickly patients at the site of one of Mrs. Clinton's favorite causes. The original star of the show, Dr. Lowe, spoke warmly of Mrs. Clinton's support for the hospital and recalled a fund-raising trip they took to New York even though Mrs. Clinton was eight and a half months pregnant and"most uncomfortable on the entire trip."

205-> SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY; Rangers Sign Swede
PETER ANDERSSON, a Swedish defenseman, signed a contract with the Rangers yesterday, the club announced. Terms were not disclosed. Andersson, 26 years old, just completed his third year with Malmo in the Swedish Elite League. "Peter was considered by many hockey experts to be the best defenseman in Sweden last year, and he played spectacular hockey in leading his team to the Swedish Elite League championship," General Manager NEIL SMITH of the Rangers said. Andersson was the Rangers' fourth-round choice in the 1983 entry draft. Last season, he had 12 goals and 20 assists in 40 games, with 80 penalty minutes. In another personnel matter, an arbitrator, K. ALLAN HINNEGAN, has decided that the Rangers will receive a third-round draft choice in the entry draft next year as compensation for Tampa Bay's signing of the free agent ROB ZAMUNER. He played 61 games with Binghamton of the American Hockey League in 1991-92, with 19 goals and 53 assists. He had a goal and two assists in nine games with the Rangers. (AP)

206-> Robbers Take Gems and Cash At Gunpoint
The owner of a Los Angeles jewelry company and seven employees were robbed of $400,000 in gems and $250,000 in cash yesterday by two gunmen just as they were preparing to leave a midtown Manhattan hotel, the police said yesterday. The eight robbery victims had participated in a trade show in Manhattan that ended on Wednesday. As they stepped into the hallway yesterday morning, the waiting gunmen forced them back into the owner's room, taped their hands and mouths and fled with the jewelry and money, the police said. Detectives said that Sin Jit Lau, the owner of S. J. Lau Inc., and the employees assembled with their luggage at 8:30 A.M. in Mr. Lau's room on the 29th floor at the Sheraton New York Hotel on Seventh Avenue between 52d and 53d Streets. Opening the door, they were met by two robbers. Ordered to Lie on Floor The thieves, speaking in English and Chinese, ordered the six men and two women to lie on the floor and not to look up, said Detective Brian E. McCabe of the Midtown North Precinct. The gunmen, he said, bound the victims with duct tape and spent 30 minutes searching their pockets and luggage. The stolen jewelry included rings, bracelets and precious stones, Detective McCabe said. Ten minutes after the robbers fled, one employee wriggled free and called the police. Both robbers were described as Asians, 20 to 25 years old with thin builds. One wore a black sports jacket, a black cap and black trousers. The other was dressed in a light-colored jacket and wore gold-framed eyeglasses. Mr. Lau and his employees were exhibitors at the International Jewelry Show from Saturday to Wednesday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on 34th Street, the police said. "Mr. Lau said he sent some of their jewelry back to Los Angeles on Wednesday," Detective McCabe said. "In the jewelry business, it's not that unsual to carry around $250,000 for a trade show." A spokeswoman for the hotel, Leora Halpern, said, "We have a very strong security program," and declined further comment.

207-> SUMMIT IN MUNICH; 7 Leaders Promise $1 Billion for Moscow
The leaders of seven major industrial democracies promised a "comprehensive partnership" with Russia and $1 billion in new aid to Moscow today. But in a meeting with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, they signaled that the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union should expect no further injections of aid until they restructured their economies. In a communique issued today at the end of their three-day economic summit meeting, the seven leaders said future aid to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe "will be tailored to their reform progress and internationally responsible behavior, including further reductions in military spending and fulfillment of obligations already undertaken." The seven leaders -- from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- said they would refocus future aid efforts toward the developing world. "We shall direct official development assistance more toward the poorest countries," the communique said. "Poverty, population policy, education, health, the role of women and the well-being of children merit special attention." No Accords on Key Issues The seven lamented the continuing war in the Balkans, but offered no formula to stop the fighting there. They also pledged "rapid and concrete action" on environmental issues, but were accused by environmentalists of failing to address urgent global problems. The participants were unable to reach important new accords on pressing economic and political issues. Germany resisted pressure to reduce its interest rates, France refused to cut farm subsidies and Japan made no move to lower its trade barriers. The leaders agreed to help rebuild unsafe nuclear power plants in central and Eastern Europe, but the United States and Japan effectively vetoed creation of a new international fund for the purpose. "You certainly cannot talk about any great achievements or successes here," said a senior European diplomat who took part in the talks. Several of the heads of government who gathered here said their greatest regret was that no breakthrough had been made on a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. All agreed that a new GATT accord, opening markets to international trade, would be a major stimulus to the global economy. Kohl Expresses Sorrow "In this summit, there were some achievements and also some disappointments," said Prime Minister John Major of Britain. "If we had been able to achieve a decisive breakthrough on a GATT agreement, it would have been a huge bonus for this summit." Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he was "very sorry that there was no breakthrough" on trade issues. Like Mr. Major, he expressed optimism that a final agreement could be reached by the end of this year. President Bush said he would "keep pushing" for an agreement, but added that he was not willing to accept a compromise that would be "a bad deal" for American farmers. He flew to Helsinki late today for a meeting of the European security conference. Most Emotional Item In a pointed reply, Mr. Bush's chief antagonist on trade matters, President Francois Mitterrand, said he hoped "that our partners will make the same efforts that we have already made" to reach an agreement. The most emotional item on the agenda was the violence wracking the former Yugoslavia. British delegates said they would not support any military action there unless it was sponsored by the United Nations, and the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said his country's Constitution forbade the use of its troops in any mission that might involve combat. Mr. Bush said the United States would only become militarily involved in the former Yugoslavia as part of a NATO force. "If NATO undertakes a role, of course the United States of America is going to be involved in it," Mr. Bush told reporters. "But in terms of Yugoslavia, our interest is in trying to get humanitarian support in there, and it is not -- I have no plans to inject ourselves into a combat situation there. We have naval power, we have air power, and we are a part of the security -- obviously a key and critical part of NATO." He added: "But nothing in that should be read that I would commit United States forces into combat. I am just not saying what we are going to do on all that." Russian Offers a Swap Today's meeting between the Group of Seven leaders and Mr. Yeltsin came after the summit meeting was officially ended. Mr. Yeltsin proclaimed himself "very satisfied" with the result. "I didn't expect more," he said, "and I didn't want less." Mr. Yeltsin said for the first time that Russia would consider equity-for-debt swaps with private Western creditors, allowing them to take over oilfields, mines, plots of land and buildings in exchange for forgiveness of debts. An American official later called this "a very appealing idea." Mr. Kohl said industrial nations would offer Russia export credits, technical aid, training for public and private managers, help in creating private banks and other financial institutions and a "grace period" for the repayment of some debts. According to an American official who monitored the meeting, Mr. Yeltsin vowed to press ahead with fundamental economic and political changes in Russia. Mr. Yeltsin pledged to continue servicing the foreign debt his country inherited from the Soviet Union. He said he was not seeking a moratorium on repayments, but added that he would ask creditors for agreements to postpone some payments. The Group of Seven communique endorsed an immediate $1 billion credit for Russia from the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Yeltsin said the credit agreement would be signed Sunday. Part of the reason for the lack of major accomplishments at the Munich meeting, diplomats said, was the domestic trouble that faces each of the assembled leaders. All seven countries represented here are in varying degrees of economic difficulty and nearly all of their leaders are unpopular among voters.

208-> SPORTS PEOPLE: BASKETBALL; Enough Complaints: Pistons Trade Salley
Power forward JOHN SALLEY, who last month complained that he wanted a new contract, was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the Miami Heat last night. In exchange, the Pistons got the rights to the Heat's second-round draft choice, ISAIAH MORRIS, a 6-foot-8-inch, 288-pound forward from Arkansas, and Miami's No. 1 draft pick in 1993, unless it is in the top five. In that case, the Pistons get Miami's second-round 1993 pick plus the club's top 1994 pick. The 6-11 Salley averaged 9.5 points and 4.1 rebounds in 72 games last season, his seventh with the Pistons. Salley, 28 years old, will be a free agent next year. Last month, he complained that the Pistons had missed his deadline to negotiate a new contract for him. "John wanted a new contract and our hands were tied because of the salary cap and we couldn't do anything," Pistons spokesman MATT DOBEK said.

209-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail; POLL SHOWS BLACKS WIDELY FAVORING CLINTON
A new poll shows that blacks favor Gov. Bill Clinton for President by a wide margin. But at a forum today, black elected officials and others said that the results mainly reflected a distaste for the alternatives. "There's nowhere else to go," said Mayor Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, Mo. "With all of his warts, Bill Clinton is far above George Bush in matters of civil rights." In the nationwide poll of 750 blacks, 43 percent favored Mr. Clinton, 14 percent favored Ross Perot, 13 percent favored President Bush and 11 percent said they would not choose any of the candidates. Twenty percent were undecided. The poll was conducted in June by Home Box Office and the Joint Centers for Political and Economic Studies. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.

211-> There's Still Time to Save U.S. Shipbuilding
To the Editor: Those who want to know how committed Congress and the Bush Administration are to saving United States manufacturing and American jobs will get their answer when a bill designed to end the foreign subsidies that are annihilating an important American industry goes to the floor of the House of Representatives. This is H.R. 2056, the shipbuilding trade reform bill. Introduced a year ago by Congresman Sam Gibbons of Florida, it was first intended to give an incentive to industrialized countries engaged in multilateral trade talks to quit stalling and terminate their subsidies for shipbuilding and repair that have shut United States shipyards out of the commercial ship construction market in the last 10 years. When that objective failed, the bill became a piece of legislation to be taken seriously in its own right. What H.R. 2056 does is make shipbuilding and repair subsidies illegal under United States trade law. Although subsidies connected with construction or repair of ships in the current fleet would be grandfathered, subsidies provided after the date of the bill's enactment would have to be repaid before the ships concerned could dock in United States ports. Once a country signs an agreement with the United States to terminate its shipbuilding repair subsidies, the requirement goes away. In addition, H.R. 2056 defines a ship as a product subject to the same trade laws as airplanes, trains, trucks and other manufactured goods, thereby ending the special exemption enjoyed only by shipowners that allows them to take advantage of dumped ships without penalty. Despite strong opposition from ship owners and operators, H.R. 2056 has undergone the unusual procedure of being scrutinized and approved by two House committees, first by Ways and Means and then by Merchant Marine and Fisheries. No doubt, the reputation of Sam Gibbons has helped to keep this tough trade bill from being buried. It is difficult to label the legislation as "protectionist" when it was introduced by a Representative with impeccable antiprotectionist credentials, who is a staunch advocate of free and fair trade. Another reason the bill has gotten so far is that the subsidies case is compelling. In no manufacturing industry in the world today is the evidence of direct government intervention to capture market share so clear and irrefutable as in foreign shipbuilding. Government support policies in the 1980's allowed shipyards in Japan, South Korea and Europe to charge ship prices that covered as little as 45 percent of production costs. There have been examples of commercial ship construction subsidies as high as 60 percent of contract price. Foreign shipbuilding subsidies still distort the market. Is it any wonder then that United States shipyards -- which had their subsidies cut off in 1981 -- were forced out of the commercial ship construction market? One-third of American shipbuilding capacity was shut down, and 120,000 American shipyard and shipyard-supplier jobs were lost. Now the situation is even more critical. With the end of the cold war, the United States Navy does not require a sufficient number of new ships to keep American yards in business. Consequently, it is projected that by 1998, 180,000 more Americans working in United States shipyards and related supplier industries will lose their jobs. Unfortunately, ship owners and operators, who are fighting to retain construction and repair subsidies for their ships, have generated fears that H.R. 2056 will harm other American business segments (such as the ports), despite the lack of evidence. However, there is plenty of evidence that other segments of the American economy would be harmed by the loss of the American shipbuilding industry, which includes more than 1,000 associated shipyard supplier companies. This is not hyperbole. It is the grim reality that passage of H.R. 2056 can avert. JOHN STOCKER President Shipbuilders Council of America Arlington, Va., April 3, 1992

212-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Clinton Secures Rivals' Support And Considers Gore for Ticket
Gov. Bill Clinton worked today to narrow his list of potential running mates, sending the head of his Vice-Presidential search team to Tennessee to meet with Senator Al Gore Jr., and interviewing Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in a post-midnight meeting. Mr. Gore appeared to be getting the most intense attention from the Arkansas Governor as the search for a running mate neared its end. As he prepared to go to New York to accept the Democratic Presidential nomination next week, Mr. Clinton finally secured the endorsement of Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator who for a time was his chief rival for the nomination. In an announcement from his Boston law office, Mr. Tsongas invoked party unity and praised Mr. Clinton's support for abortion rights. Jackson's Nod Expected "The recent controversy over the Supreme Court's decision Roe versus Wade should provide ample evidence as to why Bill Clinton would be a far superior occupant of the White House than George Bush," Mr. Tsongas said. And though Ross Perot has praised Mr. Tsongas's economic proposals, the former Senator said he did not know what Mr. Perot stood for. In another sign that next week's convention will be relatively free of intraparty dissension, people at the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign said the Rev. Jesse Jackson was expected to offer his endorsement this weekend as well. The next 48 hours will be a crucial decision-making time for Mr. Clinton, who told reporters while traveling in his home state today that he had still not settled on a running mate. "I have not made a final decision as of this hour," he said. "I have not made a decision as to when an announcement will be made." The Short List In recent days, Mr. Clinton has spent most of his private time reviewing his choices and interviewing the men who are thought to be the finalists for the job, all of them members of Congress. Mr. Gore, thought to be at or near the top of Mr. Clinton's list, canceled his public schedule to seek refuge at his home in Carthage, Tenn., from the fray in the news media. Warren M. Christopher, Deputy Secretary of State in the Carter Administration and now the head of Mr. Clinton's search team, met with Mr. Gore today and then traveled to Little Rock to talk with Mr. Clinton tonight. Based on meetings Mr. Clinton or Mr. Christopher have held in the past week, the final list of prospects appears to include Senators Kerrey, Bob Graham of Florida, Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia and Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana. Mr. Clinton said he was pleased with Mr. Tsongas's announcement, saying he thought his former rival would "make a major contribution to the campaign and hope he will be involved in the campaign and in the Administration." The week has been a fruitful one for Mr. Clinton as he and other Democrats have sought to consolidate the party before the convention. Governor Clinton has also lined up a convention speaking slot for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, another primary foe, and gained Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's agreement to place his name in nomination on Wednesday evening. Mr. Jackson, who fought bitterly with Mr. Clinton only weeks ago after Mr. Clinton criticized him for allowing a rap singer who had advocated violence to speak at a meeting of the Rainbow Coalition, has also decided to come around. "I'm certain he'll endorse before the convention," a party official said. A Jackson adviser confirmed that there would be an endorsement this week, but said it would be a grudging one timed to minimize the spotlight such an announcement would draw during the convention. Mr. Jackson could not be reached for comment. Mr. Jackson is scheduled to address the convention Tuesday night. Fraying Secrecy Senator Graham, who would have to give up his Senate seat to join the Democratic ticket, met with Mr. Clinton in Washington for two hours on Wednesday. He has until noon on Friday to file for re-election. Among the other probable candidates, Representative Hamilton violated the code of what has been a secretive process when he discussed his disagreements with the likely nominee over the weekend. All signs point to an announcement sooner rather than later: the secrecy of the Clinton campaign's selection process has been unraveling as first Mr. Wofford, then Mr. Kerrey and then Mr. Gore emerged as leading contenders. And the horde of reporters that has descended on Little Rock has thrown the campaign's press operation into disarray. The campaign also risks exposing candidates to the embarrassment of prolonged consideration and public rejection. The Clinton campaign had been largely successful in controlling its running-mate search, dampening speculation and plugging potential leaks at nearly every turn. In conducting the vetting process out of the public eye, Mr. Christopher followed the model set up by Paul P. Brountas, the top aide to the 1988 nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. Mr. Brountas said today that the Clinton headhunters had performed their task well, but he warned that waiting until the convention to announce a running mate could create problems for the nominee and the party. "I wouldn't rush him, but I think it's important for him to do it, certainly a week before the convention," he said. "There are a number of things you're trying to accomplish at the convention. If you're waiting to do it at the convention, it's disruptive." But everyone is not happy at what appears to be Mr. Clinton's final list of candidates, who are all white, male and based in Washington. "We are very much disappointed that there are no women, and we are very much disappointed that there are no minorities on this short list," said Ginny Montez, national secretary of the National Organization for Women, which was instrumental in lobbying for election of Geraldine A. Ferraro in 1984 when she ran on Walter F. Mondale's ticket. "And this year, when elections are clearly not business as usual and women are winning across the country in races that the inside-the-Beltway crowd believed we couldn't win, we would have thought that Clinton might have looked at that."

213-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Agencies to Merge In New England
In the latest in a series of agency mergers in New England, Lawner Reingold Britton & Partners and Arnold Fortuna Lane & Cabot in Boston said yesterday that they would combine, creating a shop with estimated billings of $200 million. Lawner Reingold, with about $70 million in billings from clients like Foot-Joy shoes, Titleist golf balls and the Stanley Works tools, will be acquired by Arnold Fortuna, with about $130 million in billings from clients including New England Telephone and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts. The merger was not unexpected; Lawner Reingold has been owned by Euro RSCG in Paris, which is reorganizing its American holdings, including the agencies Della Femina McNamee and Tatham/ RSCG. "It marries two strong organizations -- one more national in nature and one more regional," said Michael H. Reingold, president of Lawner Reingold, in a telephone interview. He added that while organizational details, like a name and executive titles, would be worked out in the next 60 to 90 days, Ed Eskandarian, chairman and chief executive of Arnold Fortuna, would hold those positions at the new agency. The merger, which follows by two and a half months Arnold Fortuna's acquisition of Cabot Communications in Boston, creates some client conflicts. Mr. Reingold said that Arnold Fortuna's Fleet/Norstar banks and regional McDonald's restaurants accounts would be retained, meaning that Lawner Reingold's Bank of Boston and regional Wendy's restaurants accounts must seek new agencies. Industry executives said Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston was likely to be awarded the Bank of Boston account. Also, Mr. Reingold added, Lawner Reingold's Kinney Shoe account would be retained, meaning that Thom McAn, which had been at Arnold Fortuna, must seek another shop.

216-> Motorman Is Convicted In '91 Crash
Rejecting charges of murder, a Manhattan jury yesterday convicted a motorman of manslaughter in last year's Union Square subway crash. Five passengers died when a speeding Lexington Avenue express jumped the tracks after the motorman, who had been drinking, fell asleep at the controls. The prosecution had argued that the 39-year-old defendant, Robert E. Ray, should be convicted of second-degree murder because he showed "depraved indifference" by operating the train, as he told detectives, after drinking about 20 ounces of whiskey. Witnesses described a harrowing ride through the Bronx and Manhattan in which Mr. Ray overshot station platforms and sped wildly before derailing just north of the 14th Street station shortly after midnight on Aug. 28, 1991. But the 12 jurors in State Supreme Court in Manhattan found Mr. Ray guilty of only second-degree manslaughter. The two jurors who spoke to reporters after the verdict said that while Mr. Ray showed a reckless disregard for the lives of the victims, his actions did not evidence the "depraved indifference" that the law requires for a conviction of second-degree murder. Faces a Minimum of 5 Years As a result, Mr. Ray will face a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 15 years in state prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 5 by Acting Justice Daniel P. Fitzgerald. If convicted of murder, Mr. Ray would have faced a sentence of 15 years to life in prison. As the verdicts were read, Mr. Ray, thin as a rail and standing just as straight, never moved an inch, his eyes fixed on a flag next to the judge. Relatives of Jimmy Robles, a 31-year-old night porter who was killed in the crash, vehemently insisted in the corridor that he should have been convicted of murder. "He murdered five people!" they chanted; "He murdered five people." Yvette Lewis, whose brother Victor was killed in the crash, said she wasn't happy with the verdict. "But manslaughter," she said, "he'll do time and I can live with that." More than 200 people were injured in the crash, the worst in 63 years in the subway system. The hundreds of rescuers who worked through the night to rescue riders described a nightmarish scene of tangled wreckage underground, and horrified New Yorkers found themselves confronting a new kind of fear about their daily commuting. Led to Random Drug Testing The crash led to major changes in the safety policies of the Transit Authority, and the start of random drug testing for bus drivers and subway motormen and conductors when the Transit Workers Union felt compelled to drop its longstanding opposition. Of the 2,076 employees tested between November 1991 and last month, 63 tested positive for marijuana, cocaine or heroin and 12 percent for alcohol. The verdict came at 1:23 P.M. after two days of deliberation. In addition to convicting Mr. Ray of second-degree manslaughter, the jury found him guilty of 15 counts of assault on charges of causing the injuries of 15 victims. Moments later, Mr. Ray's lawyer, Michael B. Parson, said that the verdict was "no surprise" and that Mr. Ray "had been prepared for a sentence of incarceration since August." "But we always contended this was not a murder case and the jury agreed," he said after Mr. Ray's $100,000 bail had been revoked and the Bronx man had been led away. Two of the 12 jurors agreed to discuss the verdict, but refused to give any details of their deliberations. Robin T. Webb, a 35-year-old music therapist, and Julie Mulholland, 25, an advertising executive, said the most crucial evidence was testimony that Mr. Ray had operated the train in a dangerously erratic manner and that a toxicologist said his alcohol blood level was twice the legal limit. Reckless, but Not Depraved "But we didn't believe his actions were depraved," Mr. Webb said. "We agreed he was reckless." Mr. Webb said it was his opinion that evidence that Mr. Ray was drunk at the controls of the train "was not a deciding issue in the verdict." Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said that while the trial and verdict were "a fair proceeding," the grand jury was still justified in having brought a charge of murder against Mr. Ray. The most serious questions raised by the crash concerned the monitoring of drug and alcohol use by motormen. Mr. Ray had a history of alcohol trouble, and several co-workers said after the crash that it was well known that he sometimes drank before taking the controls of a No. 4 train. Mr. Ray told detectives after the crash that he was late to work that night because he had stopped for a couple of drinks on his way to the Woodlawn station, where he began the fatal run at 11:38 P.M. He said he had spent the previous day drinking. Conductor Failed to Act In addition, investigators said the crash could have been averted by the train's conductor, who admonished Mr. Ray for overshooting stations on the run but failed to take the train out of service. The five who died were a diverse group, bound by hard work and odd shifts, whose schedules forced them to rely on the late night train. Besides Mr. Robles, the victims included a hotel housekeeper, a nurse's aide, a nurse and a security guard. Mr. Robles's wife, Lydia, showed bitterness at the verdict. "They are charging him for manslaughter," she said. "Our family, we're not satisfied with the verdict. It should have been murder. He took the life of my son's father. For my son, it's very rough." The trial's most emotional point came when photographs of the victims were shown to the jury. Mr. Ray first turned away in horror and then broke down in tears. The main evidence against Mr. Ray during four weeks of testimony came from the train's conductor, David Berram, and from several Transit Authority detectives who questioned the defendant on the day after the crash. Missed Stop by 5 Cars The conductor, who has been dismissed by the Transit Authority for failing to stop the train in the Bronx and report Mr. Ray, testified that Mr. Ray overshot his first stop in the Bronx at Mosholu Parkway by the length of five cars and the next stop by half the length of the first car. After jumping the tracks, the first car of the train rammed into a subway pillar and was cut in two toward the rear, leaving Mr. Ray and other passengers in the extreme front of the car uninjured. The five victims who were killed had been seated toward the rear of the car. In his statement to the police, Mr. Ray said he walked through the throngs of dead and injured upstairs to Union Square Park, where he said he drank a six-pack of malt liquor. Mr. Ray was arrested at 5:30 that morning as he walked to his apartment building. He was given blood tests eight hours later. An assistant City Medical Examiner testified that his measured blood alcohol level then was 0.21 percent, more than twice the legal limit. The prosecution contended his drinking showed his "depraved indifference" to the death and destruction he caused. But the defense said Mr. Ray drank to "drown his shock and sorrow." In his closing argument, Mr. Ray's lawyer, Mr. Parson, contended "there was no murder here, only a horrible, horrible accident." "Robert Ray is guilty of no more than a tragic mistake," he said yesterday above the cries of the Robles family members. An adjoining article and a picture caption about the jurors in the case misidentified one. He is Robin T. Webb.

217-> 1st Death in U.S. in 5 Years As a Result of the Plague
A man infected by a cat has died of pneumonic plague, becoming the first person to die of plague in the United States since 1987, Federal health officials said today. Doctors must realize that the plague has not been eradicated and must test for it in people who have symptoms, even if they do not live in areas where plague is present, the Centers for Disease Control said in a report issued here today. "When people think of plague, they think of the Middle Ages and all the people who died in Europe, and everyone thinks it's gone now," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, an epidemiologist with the agency in Fort Collins, Colo. "It's not." Plague is an often fatal but usually treatable disease caused by bacterial infection. Its different names describe what part of the body is infected: pneumonic plague attacks the lungs, bubonic the lymph nodes and septicemic the bloodstream. Plague is common among rodents in parts of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Utah It is usually spread by fleas on the rodents, though pneumonic plague may also be spread through the air. Hospitalization Was Delayed So far this year, 10 cases of plague in people have been reported in the United States. Nine were bubonic, with some becoming septicemic, but the patients recovered, Dr. Ettestad said. In the 10th case, a 31-year-old Tucson, Ariz., man became infected when he breathed the same air as an infected cat, the C.D.C. reported. It said the man he had taken the cat from the crawl space of a house in Chaffee County, Colo., about 80 miles southwest of Denver, on Aug. 19. Three days later, after he had returned to Tucson, the man began suffering abdominal pain. The next day he had a high fever and diarrhea and was vomiting. He was not hospitalized until Aug. 25, when his fever was 104 degrees, and he died 24 hours later. Puzzled doctors treated him for gastrointestinal disease, sepsis and pneumonia. They did not know he was suffering from the plague until they did an autopsy. The cat, which also died, apparently contracted the plague from a chipmunk. Last month, health officials in Colorado dusted the entire area for fleas to control the plague's spread. Officials in Arizona tested friends of the dead man and his doctors, but no one else has been infected, said the C.D.C., which is based in Atlanta. The man, who was not identified, waited too long to obtain treatment for doctors to have saved him even if the plague had been diagnosed, Dr. Ettestad said.

218-> Top-of-the-Line Drapery At Bottom-Line Prices
A NEWLY married young man who wanted to surprise his wife went into the Drapery Exchange Inc., in Darien, Conn., one afternoon and bought a large blue valance for the living room, a balloon shade that matched the wallpaper border in the kitchen and floral chintz bedroom draperies. He spent less than $500, and they were installed by the time his wife came home from work. A newly divorced woman not only bought window treatments for her new home but also outfitted her ex-husband's residence and bought things for the fantasy house she doesn't have yet. She spent $2,700. These are consigned draperies that once decorated designer showhouses, were created for a magazine layout, came through in the wrong dye lot or were simply rejected by a designer's client. A few in excellent condition were no longer needed in private homes. And all cost about a third of their original retail value. Although the fabrics are described on price tags, the sources are not. "Confidentiality is strictly adhered to," said Waller R. Walker, a partner of the Drapery Exchange. But among designers who have consigned showhouse window treatments at the Drapery Exchange and who didn't mind being named are Timothy Macdonald, Kevin McNamara, J. P. Molyneux, R. Brooke Ltd., Decorators Workshop and Ann Mullen Interiors. "We quietly opened our doors Memorial Day weekend," Mrs. Walker said. "It's been extremely busy ever since, just by word of mouth." Katherine S. Gogolak, another partner, says one customer called from Martha's Vineyard after getting a fax of the shop's brochure from a friend in Pennsylvania who had heard about it from a friend in New Jersey. Marilyn M. Frank, the third partner, said customers have also come from Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. Additional shops are planned, with Washington and Atlanta heading the list. The Darien shop, which has the ambiance of a design boutique, at any given time displays full-length draperies, valances, cornices, balloons, swags, jabots, designer pillows, table skirts, comforters and a limited amount of fabric sold by the bolt only. A 13-yard bolt of Scalamandre silk, which would retail for $4,875 according to the original owner, is tagged at $740. Three large Burgundy and gold tassels used in a fashion designer's display and originally valued at $1,200 each are priced at $250 each. Prices are set according to condition and style of the draperies. Many major fabric houses are represented. A gray Fortuny valance and jabot ensemble is priced at $750 a pair. Three pairs of F. Schumacher red, gold and green silk draperies with buttoned goblet header and elaborate tassel trim, lined, interlined and blackout lined are priced at $1,700 a pair. A Cowtan & Tout powder blue balloon shade with fringe is $300. When hunting for draperies, the partners suggest coming in with window measurements and swatches in hand. Because a perfect fit is not always the case, the shop provides a list of names for alterations and installation. If the fabric is current and the customer needs more to complete the decorating scheme, the style number will be made available. If the merchandise is acceptable (clean and in perfect condition), the consignor and the shop agree on a price. The shop insures the merchandise, displays it and, after selling it, takes 40 percent commission. The Drapery Exchange is situated at 1072 Boston Post Road, Darien; telephone (203) 655-3844. It is open Monday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., and by appointment.

220-> Police Dept. Ready to Charge 4 With Violation of Rules
Four New York City police officers have been placed on modified duty and are expected to be charged with violating departmental regulations by failing to come forward and volunteer what they knew about the killing of two men on a Queens street, high-ranking police officials said yesterday. Police officials have said previously that the four are not believed to have witnessed the killings, but were nearby while off duty and frequenting a popular strip of nightspots in Bayside where the fatal shootings took place. One of the victims was an off-duty Housing Authority police officer. Patrick Bannon, a 25-year-old bouncer at one of the bars on the street is charged in the shootings. For nearly six weeks, the police searched for Mr. Bannon before he turned himself in. Two of the four officers who were placed on modified duty in connection with the case were socializing with Mr. Bannon shortly before a brawl that prompted the killings, police officials have said. The officials have said those two officers tried unsuccessfully to calm Mr. Bannon between the time of the brawl, in which he was hit on the head with a bottle, and the time of the killings, which the authorities say he committed in a rage at those he believed responsible for his injury. If the officers are charged and found guilty of violating departmental procedure, they could be fined, suspended for a month or more without pay or removed from the force, one high-ranking police official said yesterday. Like the other officials who spoke about the case, he did so on the condition of anonymity. The officials said they did not know when the charges might be filed, but they said that in anticipation of them, the four officers were placed on modified assignment on Wednesday meaning their guns were taken from them and they were transferred from patrol or enforcement duties to clerical work. The officials said they were continuing to investigate reports that still more off-duty officers, members of the regular city police and the Housing Authority police, had been in the vicinity of the shootings -- on a strip of Bell Boulevard early on the morning of July 18 -- and had left the scene without coming forward to tell investigators what they knew about the events leading to the lethal gunfire. Charged With Murder The acting Police Commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said last month that as many as 10 off-duty officers had been in the vicinity and, rather than coming forward on their own to volunteer information or help gather information -- which he termed their obligations under departmental regulations -- had had to be tracked down by investigators who learned of their presence in the area. The two men slain were Paul Heidelberger, 28, the off-duty Housing Authority police officer, and John Camarda, 33. A third man, Steven Moran, 25, was wounded. Mr. Bannon has been charged with murder and attempted murder in the case. His lawyers say he acted in self-defense. Police officials confirmed that two of the four officers placed on modified assignment and likely to face departmental charges are Diana Narducci and Karen Garcia, both assigned to the 47th Precinct in the Bronx. Both have been previously identified by police officials as the off-duty officers who socialized with Mr. Bannon and sought to calm him down after the brawl. Officials have said that when investigators finally questioned the officers, both women denied reports that they had heard Mr. Bannon threaten to retaliate against those who caused his injury, and that both women also said they had not witnessed the shootings. A man who answered the door at Officer Garcia's home in Queens last night said he would have no comment, and a woman at Officer Narducci's home in Queens, who said she was the officer's sister, said the officer would not comment. Officials declined to identify the two other officers, both men, placed on modified duty.

222-> At the Bar; New York's transit agency says lawyers are taking it for a very expensive ride.
Of all the feelings one can muster for the New York City Transit Authority, solidarity must be pretty low on the list. But that is precisely what the organization is seeking to foster these days, by choosing a target even less popular than the Broadway Local at rush hour: lawyers. "LAWSUIT ABUSE!" shriek the more than 20,000 posters that began popping up on the city's buses and subways in March. "Guess who picks up the tab? You do!" This month the notices, now found alongside advertisements for acne specialists and beauty academies, will spread to Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. Every year, 3,000 new claims are made against the authority, and it pays out $50 million in damages. That is to say nothing of the cost of paying 125 staff members, including 50 lawyers, to handle such suits, which are especially tempting in bad economic times. "People view it as a chance to hit the lottery," said the authority's executive general counsel for torts, Wallace D. Gossett. Transit officials say they hope strap-hangers who are tempted to take on the much-maligned agency will realize that the deep pocket they are digging into is actually their own. They add that they hope to cultivate a new crop of whistle-blowers, who will report instances of fraud to them. There are plenty of legitimate beefs with the T.A., including 145 claims stemming from last year's fatal accident at the 14th Street station. At the same time, there are at least some people who hobble into court asserting they have suffered crippling injuries, only to be spotted later changing tires or painting houses or running marathons, sometimes with their lawyers jogging alongside them. At first blush, weeding out such fraud seems as beyond reproach as Mother's Day. But personal injury lawyers say the effort is a particularly pernicious form of jury tampering. They assert that while the posters have been plastered everywhere, they seem to pop up more frequently in those subway stations closest to courthouses, where potential jurors are likely to see them. Bert Bauman, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, saw one in the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, directly beneath the State Supreme Court. "I saw it and I fumed because of the poison that it instills in the minds of jurors," he said. "Every juror gets off at that stop." He took his gripe to the New York Law Journal. In a recent letter to the publication, he wrote, "The ad suggests that jurors should microscopically scrutinize each plaintiff's case to a greater extent than the court might charge them to; all plaintiffs are tarred with the same brush of presumptive fraud." Mr. Gossett called his charges "absolutely ridiculous." An even sorer subject for the trial lawyers is the sponsor of the campaign: the American Tort Reform Association, a consortium of corporations, insurance companies and trade associations that include Dow Chemical, the Boy Scouts of America and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. The tort reform group supplied the posters, which cost $10,000 to produce. The authority donated the space and labor. Last year, a similar campaign in Philadelphia reduced new claims against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority by 18 percent. At least four more cities are considering similar efforts, while placards declaring "Put the Brakes on Fakes" will appear on all buses in Richmond later this month. The group has also had hundreds of thousands of "Lawsuit Abuse" bumper stickers printed. The Philadelphia campaign aroused barely a whimper from personal injury lawyers there. But as Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential contender, discovered not long ago, the rules of engagement are slightly different in New York. Mr. Bauman asserted that it was improper for a public agency to give free space to an interest group to advance a partisan message. After consulting with the American Trial Lawyers Association, he said he had decided not to challenge the advertisements on constitutional grounds, but he said he might go to court to demand equal time and space. The tort reform group's president, Martin F. Connor, complained to the National Law Journal, "Here we are protesting litigiousness, and he wants to sue." Mr. Bauman said he had little use for the phonies and frauds of the bar. "Take away their licenses, for all I care," he said. But he called the alliance between the authority and the tort reform group "outrageous" and "an impermissible use of public funds." "I'm looking around for a good firm of attorneys to take this on pro bono," he said. Thus far, he added, there have been no volunteers within the trial lawyers group, which has nearly 4,000 members.

223-> BASEBALL; Hitless-Wonder Yanks Lose Again, 6-0
Does it matter anymore who the pitcher is? Apparently not. The Yankees, caught in a hitting slump that seems to keep growing worse, lost another game tonight because their struggling offense never materialized. The previous two nights, they were thwarted by left-handers. Tonight, it was Julio Valera, a right-hander, one-time Met and current rookie, whose five-hit shutout carried the California Angels to a 6-0 victory at Anaheim Stadium. The Yankees are reeling. They totaled just 10 hits and two runs in losing two games to the Angels, and they've now dropped three straight, five of six and seven of nine. And there are still three games left before they return home. Valera, acquired from the Mets by the Angels for shortstop Dick Schofield, gave up three hits after the first inning in picking up his second victory and his first career complete game. He defeated Yankee starter Scott Sanderson (2-2), who pitched into the seventh and allowed four runs. Lee Guetterman gave up the other two. Four games into their trip, the Yankees were still without outfielder Danny Tartabull, who was eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday but remains bothered by a pulled left hamstring. It's possible Tartabull won't play on the remainder of the road swing, which moves to Oakland for three games starting Friday. Matt Nokes and Kevin Maas made their first starts of the trip with Valera pitching for California. Also in the lineup: Dion James, who started ahead of the slumping Jesse Barfield (.138) in right, and second baseman Pat Kelly, who came off the disabled list today. But all the changes didn't seem to make much difference to the Yanks' faltering offense. They got singles by Don Mattingly and Roberto Kelly in the first inning, a walk to Kelly in the fourth and a triple by Randy Velarde in the fifth. The result was a 3-0 Angel lead as the game entered the seventh. Sanderson's Woes Continue Sanderson, without a victory since the season's first weekend, had problems from the first inning. He gave up a leadoff triple to Luis Polonia, walked Von Hayes and induced Junior Felix to bounce into a force play, giving Felix a league-leading 25 runs batted in. Hubie Brooks followed with a double to the gap in left-center, and it was 2-0. Sanderson, who seemed to have trouble placing his curveball, opened the second inning by serving up a home run to Mike Fitzgerald, who hit the first pitch over the fence in leftfield, putting the Yankees in a three-run hole. It was Fitzgerald's third home run of the season, all coming in a span of 13 times at bat. For Sanderson, the homer extended a distressing trend. It was the 12th home run he has allowed this season, and it came five days after he tied a major-league record by giving up four home runs in one inning to the Minnesota Twins. Sanderson, who has had just two homerless games this season, permitted 22 homers in 1991. He began this year with two straight victories, but he lost his third start, to Cleveland, on April 17 and did not have a decision in his next three starts. His earned run average in his last four starts was 8.27. Sanderson didn't make it through the seventh. Rene Gonzales led off with a single and took second on a sacrifice by Gary DiSarcina before Polonia lined a single to left. Mel Hall missed the cutoff, allowing Polonia to take second and removing a chance for a double play. Manager Buck Showalter brought in left-hander Lee Guetterman to face the left-handed-hitting Hayes, who was walked intentionally to load the bases. Felix lofted a sacrifice fly to center, and it was 4-0. Sound familiar? INSIDE PITCH The Yankees sent outfielder MIKE HUMPHREYS, 1 for 7 in three games, to their Class AAA Columbus farm affiliate. The team chose to keep shortstop DAVE SILVESTRI as a backup because infielder ANDY STANKIEWICZ is continuing to experience tightness in his right thigh. It wasn't a good time for Stankiewicz to get hurt. He resides in the area and left more than 30 tickets for family and friends to each of the two games here. But he spent both nights on the bench. . . . One week after he was named pitcher of the week in the Florida State League, left-handed phenom BRIEN TAYLOR sustained his worst defeat of the season. Taylor, pitching for Class A Fort Lauderdale, gave up three hits and six runs in four innings of a 6-4 loss to Clearwater. Taylor (2-2) walked four and struck out five.

224-> Blacks' Woes In Borrowing
Blacks have a much harder time than whites getting a home mortgage, a symptom of the deep-seated racism that is splitting the nation, members of Congress said today. "People are being discriminated against by mortgage lenders based on the color of their skin," said Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland. "Banks have a long way to go for meeting the legitimate needs of neighborhoods." The head of the nation's largest investor in mortgages, while acknowledging differences in bank lending for whites and minorities, said the reason was unclear. "The issues of discrimination and availability of home mortgage funds for lower-income and minority households are ones that we must try harder to solve," said James Johnson, chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association, which is known as Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae served 1.7 million families last year, making it the biggest player in the mortgage market.

226-> THE PLAYOFFS: ON BASEBALL; Oh Canada, the Land of Major League Angst
The nice Canadian gent sat at his desk, jotting a note. Having just learned that his customer was a reporter in town for Toronto's almost annual American League playoff elimination, he dared ask the question that's undoubtedly on the minds of millions north of the border. "What happens if the Blue Jays go to the World Series?" he said without looking up from his note pad. "What do you mean," the reporter replied, warily. "Well," he explained, "won't the Americans be angry?" Oh, dear. Oh, Canada. Oh, come now. There is no reason for Canadians to fear an American backlash against a non-American team making it to the World Series for the first time. Unfortunately, that does not mean the sentiment is not real, even if the perception proves to be false. And, indeed, in a walk through conversations, in perusals of news clippings, the theme that Americans would care or even disapprove runs strong. Even worse, all kinds of reasons abound about why the Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos will never be permitted to advance to baseball nirvana, some based on humor, others on a rather paranoid belief that the two teams have somehow been plotted against for a long, long time. Among the villains that would seem make-believe to others but very real here are the following: *Major League Baseball and CBS. Xenophobia and fear of zero ratings fuel this theory. And baseball does possess both; just ask the Japanese and poor, poor CBS. By the way, just why has CBS bumped the Jays-A's games from prime time this weekend, but not the Pittsburgh Pirates against America's team, the Atlanta Braves? Hmmm. *Umpires. Former Blue Jays outfielder George Bell fueled this one by once accusing umpires of being both anti-Dominican and anti-Canadian after a call went against him. This doubled the paranoia for sure, since the Jays employ a great number of players from the Dominican Republic. *The Mafia. (The argument: What red-blooded American would bet with his bookie in a World Series involving Canadians? But no one bets on baseball, anyway. Right?) The questions, the suspicions, the angst sometimes land right in the lap of official baseball. For instance, just over a month ago, when the Expos and Blue Jays were very much involved in division races, Fay Vincent, who was then the commissioner, was asked during a news conference here what he would do if the two teams actually advanced to the World Series. One expected a punch line, but when it went unspoken, Vincent assured the earnest questioner that he and the rest of baseball would merely be happy for two hard-working franchises. (What the 26 owners who now run baseball would have done remains a mystery, but that's a scene from another conspiracy.) It's all such a shame, for three very good reasons. First, Canada truly seems to be a most beloved neighbor. After all, here it sits, on the other side of the longest unarmed border in the world, never hissing at us, never snubbing or embarrassing its friend and ally for the sake of embarrassment alone. Patrick Buchanan has never suggested the United States build a big wall to keep Canadians out. How many other so-called friends of the United States have been described with so little acrimony in those quarters? Canada, earning the everlasting gratitude of Americans, saved United States citizens in Teheran during the Iran hostage crisis. And if there's any doubt about which move touched Americans, just remember which episode inspired a made-for-TV movie. To the best of our knowledge, the networks aren't beating down George Bush's door to talk scripts about that hostage thing. The most serious gripe in recent decades seemed to be a battle over beer. And since Canadian beer trucks are again being spotted south of the border, peace must have been restored. The second reason Canadians should just stop worrying about Americans and concentrate on their Jays is this: Americans are probably not worrying about them at all, for the simple and unfortunate reason that a lot of Americans, having signed off on subjects like geography and social studies long ago, don't know enough about Canada to have an opinion. At every turn this week, Canadians have shown an eagerness to discuss the coming Presidential race. That little drama occurs every four years and is not nearly as unprecedented as what is occurring in Canada. For Canada is on the verge of voting, in non-binding fashion, whether or not to let French-speaking Quebec be a distinct society. A yes/oui vote in what is known as the Charlottetown Accord will mean Canadians approve; a no/non vote means all provinces remain equal. In the end, an evolution of any sort could signal the beginning of the end of the Canadian nation as it is known. But do Americans know or even pay attention to such an important referendum? Apparently about as much as vox populi paid to the currency crisis and European Economic Community vote in France (wasn't there something close to an economic meltdown over there?) Sad truth is, more attention has been paid stateside to whether Ross Perot and the New York Jets could win their respective races than to the yes and no votes in France and Canada. Now that probably won't do much for any inferiority complexes Canadians might feel, which apparently exist if the words of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson are any indication ("Look at us too long and we feel uncomfortable. Don't look at us at all and we will feel worse.") But most of all, Canadians should just stop fretting for the third and most compelling reason: America has been bracing for years for one or even two World Series sites outside the United States. After all, the Astros and the Rangers could lasso this thing one day and take it to the Lone Star state of Texas.

227-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Tsongas Picks Up Speed But Loses Some Control
Before his victory in New Hampshire, Paul E. Tsongas got by with a campaign staff that consisted mostly of old friends and a band of young volunteers who called themselves the "Tsongi." Now, he has been discovered by political professionals as a potential meal ticket, and with scores of paid employees and volunteers joining the staff, Mr. Tsongas is being buffeted by the loss of control that goes with the move to prime time. For example, the former Senator from Massachusetts learned from reporters on his plane headed for Sioux Falls, S.D., recently that he was going to be speaking in a stockyard, not to the State Legislature. Mr. Tsongas bolted up to the front and warned his staff that he wanted to be part of the discussion about any scheduling changes. "In my head, I was preparing to make a speech to the Legislature," he said, a little stunned. No Place for High Heels Later, Brad MacKenzie, a member of the original staff who once put together by hand the few press kits the campaign needed, admitted that the stockyard event had not been a triumph. The candidate's wife, Niki, who was dressed up to meet the legislators, was left "standing in a pigpen in high heels," he said. In the days since New Hampshire, there have been more money and more offers of help. Nicholas A. Rizzo, the campaign finance director, said that until the New Hampshire primary, raising money for Mr. Tsongas had been "difficult at best" because his home base, Massachusetts, was in an economic depression and because Mr. Tsongas had been out of public office for eight years. In all of 1991, the campaign raised $1.1 million. The day after the New Hampshire primary, it took in $350,000. Mr. Rizzo said the funds coming into the campaign after Mr. Tsongas won the primary increased by 400 percent. "Money follows a winner," Mr. Rizzo said. But, he said, "We are still the underdog financially and politically to Bill Clinton." Help Is Appreciated The financial help is appreciated by Christine Naylor, who puts together fund raisers for the campaign. "Before, I would go in to staff the events, get the person to hold the fund raiser, drag in donors, arrange for tickets, and place," she said. "Now I have help." Ms. Naylor said she would like to bring in at least $500,000 a week from fund raisers now, money that would be used in primary states, particularly on television advertising. "I'm getting fund-raising calls now from people in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and North Carolina," said Ms. Naylor. "We're even getting feelers from people from other campaigns. They are not jumping ship, but they want their names in the loop." Like many others on the Tsongas campaign, Ms. Naylor had either known or worked for Mr. Tsongas during his years in Congress. Busy but Not Complaining "We've gotten a lot of calls, more than we can process," said Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager and longtime friend. "It's an embarrassment of riches, but not something we're going to complain about." In the week after New Hampshire, the staff has gone from 40 paid members to double that number. "Now it is more departmentalized," said Dennis Newman, one of two national field directors. "Before, I knew everything. Now an event happens, and I hear about it second or third hand. Everything is moving." The number of telephone calls to Mr. Tsongas's headquarters here in Boston surged with requests for the candidate's presence, copies of his economic booklet, press kits and offers of help from ordinary citizens and campaign veterans. Since the primary, the campaign headquarters has expanded onto another floor and now has a telephone cable line and two switchboards. Mr. Tsongas's victory also gave his candidacy the kind of legitimacy that attracts political professionals. Gerald J. Austin, who helped Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, in his long shot 1990 victory and was manager for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign in 1988, recently joined the Tsongas campaign in an as-yet undefined role. Ted Van Dyke, a longtime Democratic organizer who once dismissed Mr. Tsongas's candidacy, wrote a recent article for the Op-Ed page of The Washington Post praising him. Mr. Kanin said Mr. Tsongas had also received calls from several high-profile state and national politicians who are flirting with the idea of working for Mr. Tsongas. The Original Team But Mr. Kanin said, "Even if we got somebody else involved, we'd still keep our original team." That team includes Niki Tsongas; Mr. Kanin; Nicholas Rizzo, who handles fund raising; Michael Kail, a lawyer in Washington; Barry White, a managing partner in the law firm in which Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Kanin are partners; Edward Jesser, a White House aide in Jimmy Carter's Administration, and Peggy Connolly, former communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Weekly logistical arrangements that once could have been mapped on a napkin now require meetings and daily schedule shifts. "It was rare I made a call outside New Hampshire's 603 area code," said Ms. Connolly, the press secretary, showing a visitor a two-page, tightly spaced list of people across the country that she will soon be in in touch with. Andrew Paven, who worked in the 1988 Presidential campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, once doubled as both Mr. Tsongas's advance person and as the staff member traveling with the candidate to keep him up to the minute on arrangements. Mr. Paven was fond of the enthusiastic but youthful New Hampshire volunteers who worked for Mr. Tsongas, but once the candidate began to get an entourage of reporters and attract large audiences, he turned to more experienced friends who had done advance work for other candidates. One of them was James King, chief of staff of Senator John Kerry's Massachusetts office and a veteran of several Presidential campaigns. He was on loan to the Tsongas campaign for several days during the primary week to shepherd the press. Mr. Paven said the change has affected the way he enters events. Instead of "crossing my fingers and walking through the door," Mr. Paven said, he now goes in with some confidence that things will run smoothly. Still, the Tsongas campaign does not yet have a fully professional gloss. That was apparent at a fund-raising event here Saturday. Mr. Tsongas told the $25-a-person audience of cheering supporters in Boston that in Baltimore he had been given what he thought would be the symbol of his campaign: an oar. Mr. Tsongas waited for an aide to get it for him. "Where is the prop?" he said. A staff aide called out that it could not be found. "That's a former staff person," said Mr. Tsongas with his trademark deadpan expression.

228-> Officials Say Fatal Crash Might Have Been Avoided
New York State transportation officials acknowledged today that a July bus accident that killed six people might have been avoided if the bus had been inspected within the previous year, as required under state law. But the state's bus industry is largely self-regulating, the officials said. Without major new expenditures of taxpayers' money, they said, regulators can do little more to bring operators into compliance. "He was an unscrupulous operator," Matthew J. Ryan, director of the state commercial vehicle safety bureau, said of Robert Campbell, who owned the Brooklyn-based bus and who has been charged with aggravated manslaughter in the accident. "It's like a drug dealer, a murderer, a thief. It's hard to catch them." Six people died and 48 were injured when the 20-year-old bus careered out of control on a steep hill in Vernon, N.J. The bus, which had been carrying families from Brooklyn to an amusement park, collided with two cars and burst into flames. 'This Accident Was a Fluke' In more than two hours of often sharp questioning by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, Mr. Ryan was repeatedly asked whether the accident had exposed inadequacies in New York State's bus-monitoring system. "This accident was a fluke," Mr. Ryan said. "Look at the millions of people in New York City who are transported by bus daily. From a practical standpoint, this system is working excellently." But safety board officials said the crash had raised questions about the effectiveness of programs intended to catch unsafe bus companies. Only two of the five state and Federal agencies that regulate charter buses knew of the company involved in the July crash, Sensational Golden Sons, said Susan M. Coughlin, vice chairwoman of the safety board. "I'm concerned this was not a fluke," Ms. Coughlin said. She said the safety board will issue a report on the accident in the spring. Failed to Get Inspections In testimony yesterday, state officials provided information about how Sensational Golden Sons had repeatedly escaped regulation, even though some parts of the government were aware it was doing business. When a new bus company comes into existence, it is required to have its buses inspected after they have been registered with the state. Once the bus has been inspected for the first time, it is entered into a log, and state inspectors follow up to make sure it is inspected every six months. But in the case of Sensational Golden Sons, Mr. Campbell never had his 1972 coach bus inspected after he started the company in 1989, Mr. Ryan said. As a result, the bus was never logged into the inspection records and there was never any follow-up by state officials. By the time of the crash, the bus's brakes were corroded, out of adjustment and missing parts, investigators said. A Fine but No Payment On two occasions in 1989, state regulators were alerted to problems with the company, but both times they failed to bring it into compliance with state regulations. In June and again in September 1989, a state inspector who noticed Mr. Campbell releasing passengers on Manhattan streets gave him summonses for operating a bus that had not been inspected. After Mr. Campbell failed to pay a $250 fine, the Department of Transportation mailed him a letter in January 1991 demanding payment. He has yet to pay the fine. But there was no attempt to suspend Mr. Campbell's registration. And there was no follow-up to insure that Mr. Campbell had his buses inspected. "People don't like to hear it, but there are limits to what we can do," said Mr. Ryan, adding that his agency makes 110,000 bus inspections a year. Changes in Laws Considered Mr. Ryan said the Department of Transportation is now considering changing state laws to require new bus operators to have their buses inspected before they are licensed. In New Jersey, bus companies are required to have inspections before they register their buses, New Jersey officials testified yesterday. In addition, state troopers make roadside checks for valid inspection stickers. Last year 8,010 buses were given roadside examinations, and 1,155 were put out of service on the spot because they violated state regulations, said George Georgeles, a New Jersey state trooper. New York State officials said roadside inspections were less common in New York City because it can be difficult or dangerous to force buses out of service in the city.

230-> FASHION; Designers Demonstrate How the West Was Fun
FOR spring, fashion resembles an haute hoedown. Many designers went Western or American Indian this season, including Isaac Mizrahi, Rifat Ozbek, Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis, and Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi, possibly in subconscious communion with the film "Dances With Wolves." The buckskin, fringe and concha belts have been flying. While prairie designer styles can be pricey -- and in their runway incarnations, a bit too costumey to wear east of Laredo -- a lot of smaller manufacturers have picked up the trail. The ideas have filtered down through the various clothing and accessories markets in affordable Western accents for spring, like pony-skin mules, long gingham or calico dresses, and denim that goes from the corral to the ballroom.

231-> Officials Defend Policies To Protect Bond Market
Government officials who oversee the Treasury securities market asserted at a Senate committee hearing today that the changes they mandated on Wednesday would not disrupt trading and that they would move slowly before imposing the more contentious proposals. A key goal of the regulators was to preserve the $2.2 trillion Treasury market as a place where speculators and investors can easily and quickly trade hundreds of millions of dollars of securities without causing a ripple effect on prices. The intangible value of the Treasury market is great enough that David W. Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the committee that it was "a national resource." It is a market that has no trading floor but attracts tens of billions of dollars of speculators' money from around the world and in effect sets interest rates for other securities and home mortgages. While the Securities and Exchange Commission favored broader changes than were supported by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, the three agencies, which issued an outline of their plan on Wednesday, agreed that the new practices should go a long way toward preventing rigged auctions of Treasury securities, and other abusive trading tactics like those that Salomon Brothers admitted using last year. Salomon, whose heavy-handed trading was the catalyst for the broad study that led to this week's changes, remains the subject of an investigation by the S.E.C. Richard C. Breeden, head of the S.E.C. said about 150 witnesses had been interviewed and more than 25,000 pages of testimony collected, with more interviews scheduled. The time needed to finish the investigation will depend on the cooperation of various witnesses, he said. Mr. Breeden said the difficulty of piecing together exactly what happened at Salomon was one reason that he supports the proposal of giving regulators the authority to require Treasury securities firms to provide records of all their trades, as is now the case in the stock and options markets. Securities dealers in New York gave the changes and proposed changes in regulation of securities dealers and Treasury auctions mixed reviews today. "It was a pretty decent effort that balanced the need for some changes in the market, but still preserves its efficiency," said Jon S. Corzine, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the largest dealers. Mr. Corzine and several other dealers said they doubted that one proposal to establish a new method of auctioning Treasury securities would reduce the interest rates the Government pays. The Treasury, which is promising to automate its existing system of written bids, is also planning a new kind of auction in which the Treasury will poll dealers until it finds an interest rate at which all its securities could be sold at a single price, rather than various prices as is now the case. Dealers warned that prices and market conditions change minute by minute, and that the new system would be cumbersome because they fear it would take at least several minutes to complete. The auction is now conducted with a single deadline for all bids. "It is an idea that needs a lot of study," said Stephen G. Thieke, president of J. P. Morgan Securities. "It may not cause any decline in participation at the auctions, but it may cost the Treasury some money." Dealers dislike the proposal, favored by Mr. Breeden and the S.E.C. but not supported by the Fed or Treasury, to require large dealers to report their trades to regulators. "A lot of customers would find that intrusive," Mr. Thieke said. Other dealers said traders could shift their activity overseas or to other markets. Another S.E.C. suggestion, that the amount and price of all trades be made public, was widely criticized by dealers who said the information would make them less willing to take the risk of trading large blocks of securities. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where trades are disclosed and securities dealers generally act as agent executing trades for customers at prices set by stock specialists on the floor of the exchange, Treasury dealers buy and sell mostly from their own inventory. Dealers approved of the Treasury's plans to issue more securities in cases where traders might have cornered the market in a particular issue. "It is an excellent idea," said Rafe de la Gueronniere, chairman of the Discount Corporation, a government securities dealer.

234-> Olden Tunes By Fiddlers With the Lilt Of the Celts
Back in the early days of this century, an Irish fiddle player named Michael Coleman left his home in County Sligo and came to America. Coleman was revered in Sligo as one of the best fiddlers the county had ever produced; he was famous for jigs and reels, and his name was synonymous with a kind of local pride. When Coleman arrived in New York, he was exposed to all kinds of ethnic music through the city's vast immigrant population: German polkas, Italian love songs, Harlem jazz. These new forms must have had subtle influences on his playing. Coleman became one of the first Irish musicians to make recordings. His disks found their way back to County Sligo, where he was celebrated yet again for bringing Irish music to the land of opportunity. Kevin Burke, a Celtic fiddle player celebrated in our own day for his work with the Bothy Band in the 1970's and the group Patrick Street in the late 80's, remembers hearing Michael Coleman while he was growing up. Mr. Burke's family hailed from County Sligo, and his father owned several of Coleman's records. Tomorrow night, in a concert at Symphony Space with another traditional fiddler, Johnny Cunningham, Mr. Burke will pay tribute to Coleman by playing one of his tunes. "There's a piece of music that he recorded that I've always liked," Mr. Burke said recently in a telephone interview from Portland, Ore., where he is now based. "I've been dabbling with it for a long time. It's a very simple piece of music, a kind of hornpipe. I've put it on a new record I'm making, with a clarinet line underneath, so there's a slight jazz influence." Mr. Burke and Mr. Cunningham will perform a variety of traditional Celtic tunes tomorrow, some hundreds of years old, others relatively new like the Coleman piece from the 1920's. Unlike some European countries, America frequently disposes of its culture, confining Frank Sinatra and Johnnie Ray to oldies' stations and Elmore James and Bill Monroe to blues or country specialty shows on public or college radio. But the Irish and Scottish cling to their traditional music, recognizing in its ancient rhythms and airs the key to national identity. Both fiddlers are highly conscious of a spirit of adventure and discovery that has informed Celtic music since its beginnings, and still fuels the songs today. 'Social and Political Music' "The roots of this music go back so far, and there's an inherent honesty in these cadences that people respond to," said Mr. Cunningham in a separate interview at his New York hotel. "It's part of people's lives. It's a social and political music, and a lot of it is a commentary on how people feel from day to day. Most of these lyrics are written about real events and real episodes in people's lives. So it's basically true stories. And that sense of adventure is a sense of history. It's a sense of things that have already happened, and because they've happened they've shaped the way that a whole nation of people feel." Mr. Cunningham was born in Scotland, with parents of Scottish and Irish descent. His entire family was musical -- his mother played piano, his brother accordion -- and after unsuccessful ventures with both those instruments, Mr. Cunningham took to the violin at age 6. "There was always music in the house," he said. "We were inundated with stuff from all over -- from the Shetland Islands, from Ireland, from Scotland. When I was a kid, my mother used to sing me to sleep with 'The Skye Boat Song.' It's about Prince Charles being sported away from the Isle of Skye: 'Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing, over the sea of Skye/Carry the lad that was born to be king/over the sea of Skye.' " "I loved to hear that song," he continued. "My mother said I always used to shout for her to stop, because I knew it would put me to sleep. But again, at any given time, any given air could make me feel the same way. It's not so much the melody itself but the heart that it's played from." An Early Start on Folk Music Mr. Burke was born in London, although his parents were Irish. "I grew up hearing this music, and I always liked it," he said. "When I was going to school in England, I was the only person of my age who had any interest in it. When I got a little bit older, I met loads of Irish kids who were into it. It spread through young people. If you go to any part of the world where there's an Irish population, you find them playing folk music at a real early age. I started when I was 7 or 8." Both fiddlers have been at the forefront of the traditional scene for years. Mr. Burke was a member of the Bothy Band, a group credited with the revitalization of Celtic music in the 1970's, and Patrick Street, a more urban-oriented ensemble that blended Irish and American folk styles. Mr. Cunningham was a member of the Scottish traditional group Silly Wizard, and for the past four years performed with a Boston-based rock band, the Raindogs. He is currently writing the score for "Peter and Wendy," a theatrical production to be staged at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights at the end of January. Each has recorded solo albums, like Mr. Burke's "Up Close" in 1984 and Mr. Cunningham's "Fair Warning" in 1983, both on the Green Linnet label. Though both have worked on projects outside traditional music, each said he never strayed far from it for long. "This music will always continue the way it has for years and years and years," Mr. Cunningham said. "There's a hard core of people who keep it alive the way it has been for a long time." As Mr. Burke put it, "Irish music was never resurrected, because it never died." Johnny Cunningham and Kevin Burke will perform tomorrow night at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, in Manhattan. The show, a presentation of the World Music Institute, begins at 8 P.M. Tickets are $15. Information: (212)- 864-5400.

236-> PRO FOOTBALL; Walls Gets a Look-See; McMillan Feels Left Out
The Jets are going to have cornerback Everson Walls, cut by the Giants on Wednesday, in for a workout on Saturday. That decision left Jets cornerback Erik McMillan wondering today about his role on the team. Jets defensive coordinator Pete Carroll said the Jets' invitation was one they would make when any player with Walls's background was waived. "With his past history he's worth checking out," Carroll said. "It's just a pretty routine thing." How might the Jets use the 32-year-old veteran defensive back? Carroll said the team would have to see how Walls would fit in. "He's had a great career," Carroll said. "He's obviously an interceptor and has a knack for making plays." McMillan, who lost his starting job at free safety last season and is now a backup cornerback, has some similar qualities. Among active Jets, he is the leader in interceptions with 22. He has returned five for touchdowns. "They might waive me," said McMillan, a five-year Jet who is in the last year of his contract. "It wouldn't surprise me a bit. If that's what they were thinking, they wouldn't tell me about it ahead of time." Carroll said the Jets aren't looking at Walls as a replacement for McMillan, who is 27. "I don't see that at all," Carroll said. "I don't see anybody coming in and jumping in ahead of anybody. If we made some major trade for a starter on somebody else's team, then it would be a consideration. But picking guys up off the wire like that, they've got to earn their way. "We've been real healthy in the secondary. There's no big hole that needs to be filled right now." McMillan Feeling Shortchanged McMillan has been feeling shortchanged again this season. He's the nickel back in a formation that has been been deposited on the bench. "The nickel is always in the game plan," McMillan said. "We put the nickel package in one week and didn't run one play of it. It depends upon what the offense has been doing." Usually, teams go with their nickel package -- the insertion of a fifth defensive back -- when offensive teams have a third-down-and-long-yardage situation and put in an extra receiver. Carroll said that the Jets have not really had cause to use the nickel extensively. "It's dictated by down and distance some and it's also dictated by the personnel that the other team plays," he said. They may use the nickel package against the Bills on Monday night because Buffalo deploys three wide receivers and sometimes splits running back Thurman Thomas out as a wide receiver. But don't count on it. The Jets haven't played an extensive amount of nickel defense since facing Atlanta, which employs a run-and-shoot offense, featuring four wide receivers. Against the Falcons, McMillan picked up a sack on a cornerback blitz. On special teams, McMillan returns kickoffs and is one of the rushers on the punt-coverage team. He is averaging 23.5 yards a kickoff return, third in the American Football Conference and sixth in the league. But for a player who craves being on the field all the time, it's not enough. Last season he lost his starting free safety job to Lonnie Young. In training camp this year he was switched to cornerback, a position he had never played in his five seasons in the league. He lost a competition for left cornerback to Mike Brim. And McMillan said that as long as he remains with the Jets, "there's no chance of me being a safety again." EXTRA POINTS Running back BLAIR THOMASreturned to practice after sitting out a day with a twisted knee. . . . Bills quarterback JIM KELLY, who has played with a ruptured bursa sac in his right elbow for the last two games, said he felt fine. "It's just a matter of keeping the pressure wrap on it to keep it from swelling and getting a lot of fluid built up," he said.

237-> SPORTS PEOPLE: TRACK; Low Profile for Mile
LUIS FRANCISCO is the man to feel sorry for when the New York Road Rubbers Club stages the men's Metropolitan Mile down Fifth Avenue this afternoon. Francisco, who won the 1991 event in 4 minutes 6.32 seconds, figured to be the favorite again, but he has stiffer competition this year. The Road Runners failed to find a 1992 sponsor for the series of mile events known as the Fifth Avenue Mile. So the elite races, which had attracted some of the world's top milers, were scratched. And the Road Runners' president, FRED LEBOW, decided to seed the Metropolitan, once limited to local runners, with some second-tier runners from beyond the metropolitan area. That means that Francisco's competition in the men's race, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art at 82d Street to the Knickerbocker Club at 62d Street, will include SYNDEY MAREE, a Philadelphia resident, who set the course record (3:47.52) in the inaugural Fifth Avenue Mile in 1981.

238-> Police Captain Under Inquiry in Crush
An internal New York City Police Department investigation has been opened into the conduct of the police captain at the fatal City College basketball game after a college administrator said the captain had resisted his appeals for help for more than five minutes before finally calling an ambulance. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown announced the investigation by the internal affairs division, which handles charges of misconduct by individual officers, at a news conference yesterday. He also said he had seen no evidence that the police had acted improperly in not calling the Fire Department for help, as some Fire Department officials have asserted. "If we had thought we needed more help, we would have called for it," he said. "No protocol that I'm aware of calls for us to call the Fire Department in that kind of situation." Commissioner Brown said he ordered a separate inquiry by the department's Internal Affairs Division into the conduct of Capt. Daniel J. Carlin on Friday after he learned of an account of the fatal crush given by John P. Araouzos, City College's associate director of athletics. The department is already conducting an inquiry into its overall handling of security for the Dec. 28 game at which nine people were crushed to death on a crowded staircase leading to the Nat Holman Gymnasium. An Important Witness Milton Mollen, the Deputy Mayor for public safety who is leading a city inquiry, yesterday described Mr. Araouzos as an important witness, and Mayor David N. Dinkins also expressed some concern over what Mr. Araouzos said. Mayor Dinkins said: "I would think a desperate plea for help that is deemed to be genuine, as opposed to some crank or whatever, that there ought to be a response. But I just don't know enough further to say who's right and who's wrong." Mr. Araouzos's account is regarded as significant because it might shed light on the attitude of police commanders at the scene as more than 60 police officers stood outside the building housing the gym. Mr. Araouzos was in the gymnasium on Dec. 28 and noticed that two people in the crowd waiting to enter the gymnasium had fainted. He said he wedged open a steel door pressed closed by the crowd's sheer force and knifed his way through the staircase crowd to the police. There, he said in an interview Tuesday, he pleaded with Captain Carlin to intervene. But the captain, he said, reproached the college for five to seven minutes for overselling the event and mismanaging the crowd. Details in Mr. Araouzos's account would indicate the conversation took place about the time the human crush developed. "I begged, 'Please, captain, we need help,' " Mr. Araouzos said in the interview. " 'People in the crowd can't breathe down there.' " He also said the captain was standing next to plate glass windows that have a broad overhead view of the staircase where the deaths occurred. Remains on Active Duty Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the police department, said she could not make Captain Carlin available for comment and officers at the 34th Precinct in Washington Heights, where he is the executive officer, said he had gone home yesterday. They would not release his home number. The captain remains on active duty. The 34th Precinct's boundaries do not normally embrace City College. But Ms. Trazoff said Captain Carlin, a police veteran of more than 20 years, was at the scene as the duty officer for all of Manhattan north of 59th Street that night. William Kelly, president of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents police captains, has disputed Mr. Araouzos's version of events. Any restraint on Captain Carlin's part, he said, was prompted by his ignorance of the gravity of the crush and his knowledge that City College has long been reluctant to permit the police on campus except in cases of crime or personal danger. Mr. Araouzos also disclosed that a senior City College official, George McDonald, the vice president for student affairs, was in the gymnasium as the crowd began gathering for the game. One issue under investigation is why college officials did not cancel the event when they learned that rap performers would be present in contravention of a tacit college policy. Mr. Araouzas's account was the first to place a senior college official at the gymnasium who clearly had the authority to cancel the student-organized event.

240-> HOCKEY; New York, Detroit: Matchups Abound
Many years ago, before the proliferation of cable television and the invention of the San Jose Sharks, the National Hockey League appeared on a regular basis on free network television in the United States. First on CBS, later on NBC, the league and the networks presented a game of the week on winter weekend afternoons. It was in the best interest of all to choose an attractive match, often pitting good teams from different regions, to offer the best show to the widest possible audience. This sort of exposure ended in the mid-1970's, although this kind of game still occasionally shows up on the Sunday schedule. Such an event occurs tonight at Madison Square Garden when the Detroit Red Wings visit the Rangers. Both teams are division leaders, the Rangers atop the Patrick, the Red Wings atop the Norris. Both historic franchises think they can contend for the Stanley Cup this spring, although the Rangers haven't won it since 1940 and the Red Wings haven't won it since 1955. The All-Star Captains On the ice, there are some intriguing matchups. They include the two captains, New York's Mark Messier and Detroit's Steve Yzerman, both veteran centers and All-Stars who rank among the league's scoring leaders. Behind them come the two Sergeis, Nemchinov of the Rangers and Fedorov of the Wings. Both are centers and recent arrivals from the former Soviet Union who show advanced technical skills and a willingness to work at both the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. Each team also has a candidate for rookie of the year. New York's is Tony Amonte, a right wing from Boston, who has 21 goals and 21 assists. Detroit's is Nicklas Lidstrom, a defenseman from Sweden who has 8 goals and 39 assists and a plus-minus rating of plus-29. Both teams are coming off Friday night defeats that left them irked. Both are relatively healthy and rested after a day off. Both rosters are sprinkled with players who used to play for the other team. In the dreams of the fans of both sides, this interconference collision is a dress rehearsal for the Stanley Cup finals in May. In the reality of early February, it's a pretty good way to spend a cold Sunday night. "I'm looking forward to playing in that building, they have great fans," said Kevin Miller, traded by the Rangers to Detroit last March. "Who knows? I may even be a little nervous." Another former Ranger is Ray Sheppard, who scored 24 goals last season with New York, but signed with Detroit as a free agent over the summer. This season, he has 27 goals and fond memories of his former team. "It's going to be different playing against them," he said. "It was my decision to come to Detroit, but I enjoyed playing in New York." Brian Murray, Detroit's coach and general manager, noted that the Rangers' winning streak ended at 5 and their undefeated streak ended at 8 Friday night when they lost in Washington by 6-2. "They're going to be madder than hell and waiting for us Sunday," Murray said. That could be the case. After Friday night's defeat, Messier said: "The good thing is that everybody is genuinely disappointed. Detroit is right among the top teams in the league. They've got great offensive power. We've got to play a solid game to beat them." Red Wings Have the Punch Although the Rangers have respectable offensive production from Messier, Amonte, Nemchinov, Mike Gartner, Brian Leetch and James Patrick, the Red Wings have more firepower. Yzerman has 31 goals and 40 assists. Fedorov has 20 goals and 42 assists. Paul Ysebaert has 26 goals and 26 assists. Jimmy Carson, the third-line center, has 22 goals and 23 assists. Although the Red Wings get toughness from players like Bob Probert, Shawn Burr, Gerard Gallant, Brad McCrimmon and Alan Kerr, the Rangers probably have the harder hitters, with checkers such as Adam Graves, Kris King, Paul Broten, Tie Domi and Jeff Beukeboom. King and Graves both began their careers in the Detroit system. Joe Kocur, another Ranger ruffian who once wore the winged wheel, remains idle with a shoulder injury. John Ogrodnick, who also started his career in Detroit, has not dressed for the last three games. Another missing player for New York has been goalie Mike Richter, who hasn't played in 10 days because of a right-thigh injury. Richter skated yesterday but won't be available to play today. John Vanbiesbrouck, who grew up as a Red Wing fan on Detroit's East Side, has played the last five games in the Ranger net. Tim Cheveldae, Detroit's overworked first-string goalie, was rested during Friday night's 4-3 loss to Toronto. His replacement, Greg Millen, expressed irritation over the effort of his team, which is a mere 6-6-4 since the first of the year. "I don't think our effort as a group was acceptable," he said. "Let's not kid ourselves. In the second half of the year, you have to play better. The league gets closer."

241-> Nassau Is Urged to Hold Fiscal Crisis Talks
The president of Long Island's biggest business organization called on Nassau County officials today to conduct round-the-clock talks to end the county's 10-month fiscal crisis. The official, James L. Larocca, warned that the deadlock was damaging the Island's image as a place to conduct business. "We're even prepared to buy the sandwiches and provide the coffee or anything else that would facilitate the process of getting this job done," said Mr. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association. This week Moody's Investor's Service dropped the county's credit rating two levels, to Baa, the lowest investment-grade level. The change cost the county an estimated $2 million in additional borrowing costs for a bond issue on Tuesday. Moody's cited a "protracted and contentious political stalemate" that had led to months of inaction and said the county was within six to eight weeks of running out of cash to pay its bills unless it acted soon. Mr. Larocca's challenge was quickly accepted by Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, a Democrat. "There is no reason for us not to meet and reach some sort of agreement," Mr. Yevoli said. He accused Mr. Gulotta, a Republican who is expected to seek re-election next year, "of being either unable, incapable or unwilling to come to grips with this problem." Mr. Gulotta said he had faxed a letter of his to Mr. Yevoli, inviting him to "bring his jammies and lunch pail" to a Board of Supervisors meeting on Monday and to "be prepared to spend the night, or however long it takes to find a solution."

242-> DINING OUT; An Italian Menu With Intriguing Spins
EVERY town deserves at least one really good Italian restaurant. Fortunately Avon now has Max A Mia. An offshoot of the popular Max on Main in Hartford, Max A Mia has converted a triangular corner storefront into a lively, inviting dining space with enlarged, tinted photographs of Italian scenes. One mustard-color wall is lined with booths; the opposite brick wall, behind the bar area, has a wood-burning pizza oven and is decorated with strands of garlic bulbs and wooden piels used for removing pizza from the oven. Despite a no-reservations policy (except for six or more), with consequent inconvenience for potential customers, the staff is a welcoming one, and service, once we were seated, was brisk and helpful. Following a recent trend of Italian restaurants to feature pizzas, pastas and grilled meat dishes, Max A Mia has given its menu some intriguing spins. There's a risotto of the day and a printed menu of daily specials that includes a sauteed or pan-fried item or two. In short, there's plenty of variety for anyone who likes Italian food in hearty, almost gargantuan portions -- and, it should be added, at surprisingly reasonable prices. Certain starters, for example, were ample enough to double as entrees for those with small appetites. Such was the case with polenta con salsiccia, which consisted of two large wedges of grilled polenta served with an exuberant melange of oak-grilled sausage, porcini mushrooms, garlic and tomato. Two of us split a single portion happily. Other appetizers were as bountiful as they were delicious. Carpaccio, which of late has been seriously misinterpreted in some restaurants, was perfection: tissue-paper-thin slices of sirloin lightly sprinkled with shavings of aged grana parmigiana cheese, with dribbles of extra virgin olive oil, served with a sprightly arugula salad. Spiedini consisted of chunks of coarse, wood-fired bread alternating with fresh mozzarella and basil enhanced by extra virgin olive oil with a salty whisper of anchovy. A more standard starter, calamari fritti, was expertly fried, light and greaseless, and enhanced by two dips: garlicky aioli and spicy marinara. There are a dozen stone pie (pizza) choices, each with a thin, chewy, wood-smoky-flavor crust and an imaginative array of toppings. We found the smoked chicken excellent in combination with scallions, green and red peppers, two cheeses, mushrooms, corn and pancetta with a roasted pepper coulis. Shrimp and pesto pie deserved equal praise, as did one called Max amore, a tempting mixture of goat cheese, mozzarella, prosciutto, onion, tomato and grana parmigiana. Pastas held up their end of the menu, too, notably linguine spagliate (an inspired, garlic-driven medley of shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes, calamata olives, toasted pine nuts and grana parmigiana) and black pepper fettuccine (peppery, eggy pasta tossed with mushrooms, bitter greens, shavings of cappicola and grana parmigiana). Lasagne follemente, one of three baked pasta dishes, consisted of unusually light egg pasta amply layered with three cheeses, thick slices of mushrooms, roast chicken strips and a tomato-butter sauce and proved a generous and pleasing main course. One evening's risotto special was a luscious miscellany of grilled strips of veal, sweet Italian sausage, basil, gorgonzola and radicchio. Desserts are as satisfying as the other courses. A big square of tiramisu was richly chocolate, while a somewhat dry chocolate polenta cake had fine flavor and looked terrific sitting in a pool of chocolate-etched cappucino sauce. Best of all was the torte di mele, a warm apple tart, flat and round, with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream in the center and thin ribbons of butterscotch painted over the apples. Only crema bruciata was a letdown; though the custard was firm, the caramelized sugar crust was overly sweet. Max A Mia's prices enhance the pleasure of the dining experience. A three-course dinner for two came to $39 before tax, tip and beverages. But three courses are really one too many. The Italian wine list has about two dozen entries with a range of prices.

International A2-11 WORLD LEADERS GATHER Thirty years after Khrushschev banged his shoe on a desk at the United Nations, President Yeltsin of Russia joined world leaders in New York for a United Nations summit meeting signaling a new era of cooperation. Mr. Yeltsin is probably looking beyond the meeting to talks with President Bush on nuclear arms cuts and financial aid. A1 On a stop in Britain, Mr. Yeltsin appealed for help with reforms. A8 RUSSIA'S ENIGMATIC LEADER Seven months after becoming President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin remains an ambiguous figure: a democrat who rules by decree, a populist who risks draconian reform.

A9 ENVISIONING A VIGOROUS U.N. When the United Nations opens its first Security Council summit meeting on Friday, world leaders will ask the new Secretary General to propose ways of improving the U.N.'s peacemaking role. One suggestion is to create what would amount to a standing United Nations army. A8 Japan told Mr. Bush it "will deliver" on promises to import more. A8 CHINA SELLING MISSILE PARTS Intelligence reports indicate that China continues to sell missile technology to Syria and Pakistan despite statements by Beijing that it is willing to curb missile exports, Bush Administration officials say. A1 CROATIA BALKS ON PEACE PLAN A United Nations proposal to send peacekeeping forces to war-ravaged Croatia edged toward collapse after Croatian leaders demanded fundamental changes in the plan, Western diplomats said. A1 PYONGYANG SIGNS NUCLEAR PACT After years of promises, North Korea signed an accord calling for international inspection of its nuclear plants. But the Government left it vague whether inspectors would gain access to the installations any time soon.

244-> Dinkins Replaces Finance Chief
Moving to reshape his fund-raising team for next year's election, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday announced the appointment of Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes & Noble Bookstores Inc., as the new finance chairman of his campaign. He succeeds Arnold I. Biegen, who pleaded guilty last month to stealing $158,000 from the campaign funds. The Mayor also said that Kenneth E. Glover, a senior vice president at RJR Nabisco Inc., would become the campaign treasurer, replacing Dr. Kevin C. Greenidge, the Mayor's ophthalmologist, who agreed to fill the post temporarily last month. Mr. Riggio, 50 years old, is chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble, which also operates the B. Dalton and Doubleday chains and is the nation's largest bookseller. He is a trustee of the Democratic National Committee and was active in fund-raising for Mr. Dinkins's mayoral campaign in 1989. Asked why he had taken the post, he said: "You know, the Mayor asked me, and I am a combination of delighted and perhaps obliged to serve. It's time New York starts looking to some positive things again, and I hope to be involved with Mayor Dinkins in working to accomplish that." Despite the publicity over Mr. Biegen's theft of campaign funds by writing checks to himself and his theft of $850,000 from the estate of a mentally ill elderly widow in Brooklyn, Mr. Riggio said he was confident that the campaign would be able to raise money, beginning with a dinner scheduled for April 27 at the New York Sheraton. Harold M. Ickes, the campaign counsel, said Mr. Riggio, Mr. Glover and Dr. Greenidge, even though he would no longer be treasurer, would all have authority to sign checks. In a safeguard imposed after Mr. Biegen's thefts, two of the three men's signatures would be needed on campaign checks of $500 or more.

245-> Malcolm Arth, 61, Anthropologist and Educator
Malcolm J. Arth, a retired anthropolgist and innovative museum educator, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 61 years old. His relatives said he died after a long illness.. Dr. Arth, who retired last fall after 21 years as chairman of the Education Department at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, disdained the idea of museums as "repositories of the musty and dusty." He started the museum's overnight "camp-in" for children and founded the annual Margaret Mead Film Festival to gain a wider audience for anthropological documentaries. He created the People Center, where museum visitors see live performances of native music and dancers and do such things as put on costumes, handle indigenous tools and try to start fires by spinning sticks against blocks of wood. He helped arrange an exhibit of Tibetan butter sculpture and created an urban ecology exhibit explaining how concrete and asphalt are made and the habits of roaches. Dr. Arth encouraged the use of the museum by the city's many races and ethnic groups to explore their heritage. He also promoted minority training, help for small museums, training of museum edcuators and foreign exchanges. As an anthropologist, he did field research in New Mexico, Nebraska, China, India, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Mali, Ghana and Uganda. He worked part time for the Getty Trust Museum Management Institute at Berkeley, Calif., and taught at New York University, Manhattanville College and Harvard. He was an officer of American Association of Museums and won its educator's award for excellence in 1986. Dr. Arth was born in Boston and earned a bachelor's degree from Boston University and a doctorate from Harvard. He worked three years on a project with geriatric patients at Boston State Hospital and nine years as an anthropology professor and department chairman at Adelphi University before joining the museum staff. Surviving are his father, L. Robert, of Quincy, Mass.; a brother, Donald, of Randolph, Mass., and a sister, Betty Jacobs of Sharon, Mass.

246-> TENNIS; Agassi Fulfills Hero's Role for U.S.
For the second time in his checkered career, Andre Agassi was asked to come to his country's rescue and unravel a deadlocked Davis Cup contest. And once again, he wound up waving an American flag and completing a victory lap by the end of the day. Last year, Agassi played the anchorman in a 3-2 semifinal defeat of Germany. Today, in a plot tailor-made for the drama-loving Las Vegas patriot, Agassi turned a 2-2 Davis Cup stalemate into a 3-2 victory for the United States, ending a roller-coaster quarterfinal against Czechoslovakia. In the first singles match today, Pete Sampras was upset, 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, by Petr Korda, a loss that provided more anti-momentum to an American bandwagon badly rocked by the defeat of John McEnroe and Rick Leach in Saturday's doubles. But Agassi then played savior with a bravura performance against Karel Novacek, winning by 7-6 (6-5), 6-0, 6-0. Riding a Losing Streak Again, Agassi's Davis Cup heroics came on the heels of some personally traumatic results. Last year, Agassi had just taken a nosedive in the first round of the United States Open. This time, he had to overcome the worst start of his professional career, along with the indignity of seeing his ranking slip to No. 14, the lowest among the four singles players here. The pressure, said Agassi, was nonpareil. "You feel like you played a Grand Slam tournament in a weekend," he said, insisting that the importance and pressure of pulling through in a sudden-death Davis Cup encounter surpasses even the glory of reaching a Grand Slam final. "A Grand Slam final doesn't even come close. There's not even a question," said the 21-year-old Agassi, who has reached three such matches and not yet prevailed. This afternoon, after a tight opening set where he fumbled away three set points against the Czechoslovak's serve in the 10th game and needed four more in the tie breaker before his opponent finally succumbed to a backhand winner, Agassi put himself into overdrive and smothered the 12th-ranked Novacek. Next Up: Sweden The United States, now 14-12 in Davis Cup competitions that have gone to a fifth and deciding match, will next face Sweden in the semifinals at Minneapolis, Sept. 25-27. Led by No. 1-ranked Stefan Edberg, Sweden swept Australia, 5-0. In another quarterfinal, Switzerland prevailed over France, which had defeated the United States in the 1991 cup final. Agassi felt he pushed Novacek to the breaking point by claiming the first-set tie breaker, where he went up, 4-2, on a forehand volley winner that might or might not have touched the sideline. In all, Novacek, who later admitted he felt he didn't have a chance in the last two sets, committed 64 unforced errors to just 14 by Agassi, now 16-4 in Davis Cup. As usual, it was the serve that told the story in the fourth-ranked Sampras's match, a dismal four-set performance that dropped his Davis Cup record to 3-3 and further dimmed his chance of being retained for the semifinal, which will probably be played on clay. "The whole day came down to my serve," said Sampras, who fired 13 aces against the 10th-ranked Korda but suffered from a 52-percent first-service efficiency. "I was missing by inches, and when I'm not serving well, my whole game isn't quite as good." MATCH POINTS The United States Tennis Association is expected to announce this week that it has reached an agreement in principle with New York City over the proposed reconstruction of its United States Open site at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The new center, the cost of which has escalated $30 million from the original $150 million estimate, will feature three stadiums and is already a year behind schedule. The U.S.T.A. had hoped to use it for the 1995 Open but probably will not meet that deadline. . . . With Sunday's victory came a record for TOM GORMAN, Davis Cup captain for the last seven years. Gorman, at 15-4, has more series victories than any other captain of a United States squad. Aware that JOHN McENROE, the 12-year Davis Cup veteran, is campaigning for his job, Gorman said he hopes to return for an eighth term in 1993. Swiss Eliminate the French NIMES, France, March 29 (AP) -- France's brief reign as Davis Cup champion ended this afternoon. After winning the cup for the first time in 59 years by upsetting the United States last December, the French lost to Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Jakob Hlasek clinched the victory and lifted the Swiss into the semifinals for the first time by beating Thierry Champion, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5, in the first singles match here today. Arnaud Boetsch of France beat Marc Rosset, 6-4, 6-4, in the last match, making the final score 3-2. Switzerland will next play either Italy or Brazil. In Maceio, Brazil, the Brazilians took a 2-1 lead over Italy today as the doubles team of Fernando Roese and Cassio Motta outlasted Omar Camporese and Diego Nargiso, 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 3-6, 6-3. The final two singles in the rain-plagued series will be played on Monday.

248-> Centel Offers Itself for Sale
The Centel Corporation put itself up for sale today. The Chicago-based company, which provides local telephone service to parts of Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina, also manages cellular phone systems in 44 markets in 14 states and has minority interests in cellular systems in 32 metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Houston, Kansas City and New York. The company announced on Jan. 23 that it had hired investment bankers to find ways to raise its stock value. Centel's directors voted today to solicit bids after hearing expressions of interest. Analysts have said that the company, if sold in one piece, could be worth as much as $5.5 billion, or about $65 a share. Centel's stock closed at $44.50 Friday, down 25 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's chairman, John P. Frazee, said in a statement that the board would not decide whether to sell all or part of the company until it had reviewed the proposals, which are due by April 16. He said some of the expressions of interest were attractive. Mr. Frazee said last month that Centel might sell itself because it wanted to manage its own destiny during the predicted consolidation of the telecommunications industry.

249-> CAMPUS LIFE: Iowa State; An Inventive End To a Daily Grind: Do In the Dishes
If two Iowa State University chemists have their way, the phrase "clean your plate" will someday take on a whole new meaning. Jay-Lin Jane, a food scientist and an assistant professor here, and Seung-Taik Lim, postdoctoral research associate, have invented an edible plastic they say may eventually be used to make dinnerware. The plates are made from corn and soybean starches and proteins, which cost 12 cents a pound, so the plastic should be inexpensive to produce, Ms. Jane said. The thin, thermally molded plastics are still being developed, but Ms. Jane said several businesses in the United States and abroad have expressed interest. She said McDonald's, for example, has spoken to her about possibly using the plastic in packaging. It may be a couple of years, though, before people have the chance to eat their plates, said Lawrence A. Johnson, the director for the Center for Crops Utilization Research, which focuses on food products. The center's financing comes from Iowa's corn and soybean promotion boards, state legislative appropriations and the United States Department of Agriculture. Research support for the edible tableware is approximately $500,000. Mr. Johnson said the new plastic may someday be recycled by compacting it for feed. "It's feasible to ship it off to livestock-feeding companies," he said. Similar research is being conducted by Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., and the National Starch and Chemical Company, based in Bridgewater, N.J. In addition, a company in Taiwan -- Taiwan Sugu -- has developed edible bowls and plates made of oatmeal. But the Taiwanese product may leak several hours after coming into contact with boiling water. By contrast, the Iowa State researchers say their product is not only edible, but water resistant and durable. The plastic was soaked in water for two weeks and did not deteriorate, Ms. Jane said. When the project began in 1987, it was devoted to creating a durable plastic film, similar to the kind used for garbage bags. But in 1990, Ms. Jane and Mr. Lim began experimenting with thermally molded products. And how does the edible plastic taste? "It's not bad," Ms. Jane said. "It has the flavor of popcorn."

250-> Concord Loses Its Credit Line
The Concord Camera Corporation has announced that its senior lender, the Midlantic Corporation, will not renew the company's $15 million credit line. Concord disclosed the termination of the credit line in a financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter that ended on Dec. 31. The company said last month that it had reached an agreement with its senior lender to restructure a $2.5 million payment on its line of credit. Andrew Jeske, a spokesman for the camera maker, said the payment had to be restructured because Concord could not pay the full amount. Concord is negotiating with several financial institutions to obtain new short-term credit, it said in the S.E.C. filing. The company has not yet completed negotiations for a new credit line, Mr. Jeske said Friday. Concord Camera's shares jumped $2, or 23 percent on Friday, closing at $10.625. Christopher Marlett, an analyst at Drake Capital, said the stock rose because the company planned to hold a news conference this week to discuss its disposable-camera products.

251-> PRESIDENT'S PLANS FOR MEDICAL CARE OUTLINED TO A.M.A.
President Bush's election-year prescription for the nation's health-care system is likely to include new incentives for people to enroll in prepaid group health plans, tax credits for the purchase of medical insurance and restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, told doctors this week. Mr. Skinner outlined the Administration's ideas at a White House meeting with top executives of the American Medical Association on Tuesday afternoon, as he sampled the doctors' reaction to major proposals being drafted by the Administration for submission to Congress later this month. Administration officials and medical association executives gave details of the meeting in separate interviews today. Trying to Control Costs A Federal budget official present at the meeting told the doctors they might dislike some of Mr. Bush's proposals. That referred to measures that would prod people, especially Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, to join health maintenance organizations and health-care networks, said a medical association official who was at the meeting. Proponents of such managed care say it controls cost, reduces paperwork and maintains the quality of care, but doctors often complain that it reduces their autonomy and their income. The health-care networks pay doctors less than they usually charge for an office visit, service or procedure. For example, a family doctor might receive $25 for an office visit that normally costs $40, and an obstetrician might be paid $3,000 instead of $4,500 for the care of a pregnant woman and delivery of her baby. The American Medical Association, which once resisted any expansion of Government health programs as a form of socialized medicine, has in the last year become a chief advocate for change and has urged the Government to help guarantee health care for more the 34 million people now lacking health insurance. Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the medical association, said he told Mr. Skinner that the group supported the idea of giving people tax credits to help them buy health insurance. But he said "tax credits alone would not solve" the nation's health-care crisis. Mr. Skinner told Dr. Todd that the Administration was keenly interested in managed care arrangements under which patients band together and buy medical services at a discount from selected doctors and hospitals. Dr. Todd said he told Mr. Skinner the doctors recognized that managed care was "a fact of life and probably will increase." But he also emphasized that doctors needed to retain bargaining power so they could negotiate fees with such groups. Otherwise, he said, doctors feared that big groups buying health care on behalf of consumers would fix prices and dictate terms to doctors. Administration officials confirmed Dr. Todd's account and said they felt sure that prepaid group health plans like health maintenance organizations, which provide a wide range of medical services in return for a fixed monthly premium, would provide better care at lower cost. One proposal being drafted by the Administration would reduce Medicare premiums for people who enroll in health maintenance organizations or other networks of doctors and hospitals supplying managed care. The discount could be as high as 30 percent of the Medicare premium, now $31.80 a month. Medicare finances health care for 34 million elderly and disabled people, of whom 2 million are enrolled in health maintenance organizations. Federal health officials say a discount on the Medicare premium would substantially increase the number of people enrolled. Administration officials said other proposals would help control costs from malpractice claims and litigation. One proposal would limit damages that could be paid for "pain and suffering" of a person injured as a result of negligence by a doctor or hospital workers. A Change From Sununu Since Mr. Skinner replaced John H. Sununu as White House chief of staff three weeks ago, he has immersed himself in the politics of health care and has supervised the preparation of Mr. Bush's budget and health proposals. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has also been involved, but did not attend the meeting with the medical association's officials. Mr. Skinner's role contrasts with the attitude of Mr. Sununu, who severely criticized the medical association in June. "Sununu registered his displeasure in the strongest possible terms," Dr. Todd recalled. "He clearly did not want us stirring the pot on health-care reform." The Commerce Department estimates that the United States spent $738 billion on health care last year and will spend $817 billion this year. The department says the 1992 figure represents a record 14 percent of the expected gross national product. Many people who favor comprehensive change in the nation's health-care system say the Administration proposals are inadequate. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, a research and advocacy group, said: "The President's health tax credit plan will not guarantee medical care for a single American child. Tax credits do not treat strep throat. Tax credits do not immunize babies, put eyeglasses on schoolchildren or provide cost-effective care for children with treatable disabilities."

BASKETBALL Rockets Hold Off Bulls Hakeem Olajuwon had 24 points and 11 rebounds and blocked Michael Jordan's last-second 3-point attempt as the Houston Rockets held on to defeat the Chicago Bulls, 105-102, last night in Houston. The loss was the second in succession for the Bulls and only the seventh in 44 games. It also was the Bulls' fourth consecutive defeat at the Summit. Vernon Maxwell, fined $7,500 and suspended for a game because of his conduct in Chicago's 114-100 victory over Houston Saturday night, finished with 23 points. (AP) Lakers 106, Nuggets 96: Byron Scott scored 28 points, including a controversial 3-point goal with 1:33 left, and the Lakers won their fourth consecutive game, this time over host Denver. Scott's 3-pointer was protested by Reggie Williams, who said Scott released it after the 24-second clock expired. Replays confirmed the error. (AP) Cavaliers 115, Magic 98: Larry Nance scored a season-high 33 points, making eight successive floor shots in one stretch, and also grabbed 13 rebounds as Cleveland beat Orlando in Richfield, Ohio. (AP) HORSE RACING Smith Rides 6 Winners Mike Smith, who rode six winners at Aqueduct Jan. 13, duplicated the feat there yesterday, guiding six of his seven mounts to the winner's circle. Smith rode both halves of the early daily double -- Dressed Shipper ($6.60) and Eenie Mennie Miney ($6.20) -- then scored four straight times, in the fifth on Triple Sox ($11.20), the sixth on Miss Mimsi ($16.20), the seventh on Bomb Stopper ($7.20) and the eighth on Nines Wild ($7.40). He was third on his only other mount, Six for the Road, in the fourth race.

The women's first tournament of the year, at Wycliffe Golf and Country Club, was delayed for 2 hours 15 minutes because of heavy fog, resulting in an incomplete first round. Daniel (34-32), who is tied with the Swedish rookie Helen Alfredsson (31-35), was one of 90 golfers in the 144-player field to complete their opening round. Nancy Lopez, playing in her first tournament since August, grabbed a late-afternoon piece of first place, before bogeying No. 8 (her 17th and final hole) to come in at five under, before play was suspended. (AP) Richardson Takes Lead Steven Richardson of England tied the course record with a nine-under-par 63 -- nine birdies and nine pars -- yesterday in the opening round and took a two-stroke lead in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Bangkok, Thailand. Seve Ballesteros of Spain and Mats Lanner of Sweden were tied for second, while Ian Palmer of South Africa and Adam Hunter of Scotland were another stroke back at 66. Bernhard Langer was among eight golfers at 67. Ian Woosnam of Wales and the defending champion, Nick Faldo, both shot 71. Woosnam suffered from stomach distress midway through his round but carried on after a brief rest. Later, he went to a hospital, where his problem was diagnosed as food poisoning. Woosnam was released after three hours and said he hoped to play in the second round.

253-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Seton Hall Goes Click, Pittsburgh Goes Clang
There were slicing drives by Terry Dehere, pinpoint passes by Bryan Caver and a typically gutsy performance by Jerry Walker. There was even an extraordinary 0-for-22 dry spell by Pittsburgh in the first half during which Seton Hall ran off 15 uncontested points while the visitors clanged the rim for more than 11 minutes. But the moment that confirmed the fact that Seton Hall might be on a permanent upswing came with 5 minutes 26 seconds to play in tonight's 82-63 victory by the Pirates. With Seton Hall up by 23 points, the crowd at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena began chanting for Jim Dickinson, a seldom-used backup center who only gets into games that are hopelessly lost or solidly in hand. Coach P. J. Carlesimo obliged. What was significant was that the player Dickinson replaced was Luther Wright, the 7-foot-2-inch center who, not so long ago, might have been playing a role similar to Dickinson's. In the Pirates' last five games, however, Wright has become a force, using his bulk and surprisingly light touch to round out a Seton Hall team that's beginning to look sharp at a critical point of the season. Tonight, Wright had 8 points, 5 rebounds and 3 blocked shots as Seton Hall rolled to its fifth straight victory and its seventh in eight games. A Quick Lesson The Big East triumph avenged a 9-point loss that Seton Hall suffered in Pittsburgh earlier in the season. More than that, the game represented the completion of a cycle for Wright, who sat out last season because he didn't meet N.C.A.A. academic standards. Pittsburgh was Wright's first Big East game, and according to Walker, a contest that may have served as a wake-up call for Wright. "When Eric Mobley spun around and dunked on him," Walker recalled with a smile, "I told him: 'Don't have that blank look on your face. It's going to be like that all year if you don't turn yourself around.' "The thing was, we all had high expectations for him -- he was big, a high-school All-American. But he took a lot of things for granted. But he worked hard and did what he was supposed to do, and now he's coming around. Just at the right time." Caver Adjusts to Role Indeed, Seton Hall was hitting on all cylinders tonight, thanks in great part to Caver, the 6-4 sophomore point guard who scored 12 points but more importantly, ran the Pirates' offense to near-perfection. For all the talk about Wright's improvement, Caver's maturation in Seton Hall's last eight games is what has made the Pirates an explosive team. Earlier this season and practically all of last season, Caver, a high-scoring point guard in high school, couldn't adjust to his role as a floor leader for whom scoring was suppposed to be secondary to running the team. This season, he had been looking back over his shoulder at Danny Hurley, the freshman point guard who was getting a lot of playing time -- sometimes at Caver's expense. "He was too concerned about the atmosphere around him instead of just concentrating on his game," Walker recalled. "I think, finally, he just began to focus." "I'm just reading the game better," Caver said. On a Roll In any event, with Caver running the team, Dehere free-lancing and Walker playing his more familiar power-forward position, Seton Hall (16-6 and 8-5) is accelerating. Ask Pittsburgh. The Panthers (15-11, 7-6) were out of the game before it unfolded, falling from an early deficit of 9-7 to 35-16 at the half. The Pirates also missed Sean Miller, their senior guard and leader, who played only 9 minutes because of the flu. For Seton Hall, Dehere had 13 points, Arturas Karnishovas added 12 and Walker had 10. Darren Morningstar led Pittsburgh with 11. The Panthers shot a miserable 36.7 percent for the game. Missouri 87, Nebraska 61 COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Anthony Peeler set a school record with six 3-point shots and finished with 34 points as No. 9 Missouri crushed Nebraska. Peeler scored 24 points in the first half, making all four of his 3-point attempts, as Missouri scored the first 9 points of the game to start the runaway. In all, Peeler connected on 6-of-8 3-pointers, breaking the record of 5 set by Lynn Hardy against St. Bonaventure on Jan. 5, 1987.

256-> Technology Hasn't Kept Its Promises
To the Editor: In "Cut Off from the New Reality" (Op-Ed, Feb. 23), David Gelerntner laments the decline of science and technology as American ideals: artists and visionaries nowadays ignore the glamour of new inventions, students avoid science courses, commercial desktop computers sit idle, and no one looks forward anymore to a future made brighter by jet planes, atomic power and robots. He's right. In the 1950's, atomic scientist ranked with cowboy and fireman as typical responses when boys were asked what they wanted to be when they grew up. In 1957 Sputnik added paranoia to fascination as fuel for our romance with science. As late as 1980, when the computer made the cover of the major news magazines, there was a widely shared expectation that computers would rapidly revolutionize educational and domestic life in the United States. No such revolution has happened. On the contrary, far from bringing us to a utopia where, for example, electricity is too cheap to meter, our scientific achievements have become objects of suspicion. People ask why, if our computers and machines are so proficient, we have 33 million poor, faltering schools, 20,000 toxic waste sites, a $3.5 trillion national debt and this lingering recession. There is a growing intuition, more unspoken than articulated outside of academe, that the technology-dominated textures of our culture are poisonous to people's deepest sense of the richness and worth of their own lives. The chief benefits of most domestic technology are efficiency and pleasure. Both, though addictive, quickly reach a point of diminishing returns when pursued to satisfy the needs of the spirit. The youngster who spends a fine spring day playing computer games alone admits to a certain unspoken rage, in that the day was not spent bicycling country roads with friends or building a treehouse. Children who witness parental divorce in a household full of state-of-the-art appliances wonder what real human purpose, finally, all those machines have. Mr. Gelerntner is right about the effects of our apathy toward technology, but wrong about the causes. It does not proceed so much from laziness or ignorance as from a sort of desperate wisdom.

258-> San Marino Journal; After 1,600 Years, Is It Time to Join the World?
It has taken some time for the winds of change to sweep from the Caucasus and the Carpathians to this rocky redoubt that forms a graceful mole on Italy's thigh. But now San Marino, which prides itself on being the world's oldest and the world's smallest republic -- and once prided itself, too, on its aloofness -- is on its way to joining the United Nations, just like some of the newly independent former Soviet republics. In New York today, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved the application, possibly raising some eyebrows among cynical students of the organization. After all, does a 24-square-mile chunk of crag and valley, topped by medieval fortresses, home to a resident population of 24,000 and surrounded by Italy, meet the criteria of statehood? Here, along cobbled streets, in a place of stone stairways and crenelated battlements, the answer among Government officials is a resounding yes. And the Security Council obviously agreed in voting on San Marino's application to transform its observer status at the United Nations to full membership. But other questions seem to persist. One is: why now? Another is: why at all? 'Reaffirmation of Sovereignty' "It's no big story," said Vittorio Cecchi, who runs a cafe and bar. "There's no great interest in it here." As Foreign Minister Gabriele Gatti explained it today, the United Nations application was one more sign of this place adjusting itself to a changing world where ideological divides have dissolved and this neutral territory feels it "has to be present in the international scene." "The fact of sitting around the table with the most important states in the world is a reaffirmation of sovereignty," he declared in an interview. "Now," said Giovanni Zangoli, a reporter who covers the republic for an Italian newspaper, Il Resto del Carlino, "they are trying to adapt to the new reality and they are emerging from their splendid isolation." Isolation, of course, is a relative term, restricted to diplomatic niceties. Last year, some three million tourists walked through the alleyways of San Marino, ate at its eateries, bought the postage stamps and coins that flow from its official mint and clambered the paths and stairways that lead to its three castles. They are lured, moreover, by relatively lower prices on liquor, electrical goods imported directly from Japan, perfumes and furs. And while the border with Italy is clearly marked, there are no passport or customs formalities for visitors and tourists. "Italians no longer consider San Marino a foreign country," Mr. Zangoli said. The republic was not always so at ease with outsiders. "Up until 20 years ago," Foreign Minister Gatti said, "San Marino conducted a very closed policy. But since then, it's been very open." Since its founding in the fourth century -- according to legend, by a Dalmatian stonemason who took refuge here from persecution by the Roman Emperor Diocletian -- the miniature state has survived as a political entity, despite the attentions of an assortment of visitors. They included Napoleon, who seemed sympathetic to it, Cesare Borgia, who virtually ran it for three years at the beginning of the 16th century, and the expansionist Giulio Cardinal Alberoni from the Vatican, who occupied it for four months in the 18th century. But it never lost its claim to statehood. A further intrusion came in World War II, when Italy's fascists installed a puppet Government that lasted until 1943. San Marino claimed neutrality in the war. In the latter stages of the war, 100,000 Italians took refuge here, living in railway tunnels. Despite its neutral status, Allied planes bombed the republic in 1944, killing 60 people, and German troops crossed the territory before the war ended in 1945. San Marino's ability to survive as an independent state, Mr. Gatti said,"is a mystery for San Marino, too." "San Marino is very small, on a mountain," he said. "It was not an easy place to conquer, but it had no strategic value." These days, some here say, the value is of a different kind. While around one-third of its citizens -- some 11,000 in addition to the 24,000 living here -- are outside the country, predominantly in Italy, New York and Detroit, those who have remained seem largely to prosper. "San Marino was once a very poor country," Mr. Gatti said, "now it's much richer." Cheaper and Cleaner For some outsiders, the state, with its capital of 4,000 people, seems no more than an adjunct of Italy and, privately, some here acknowledge that the authorities would not depart too abruptly from Italian policies and practices. "The Republic of San Marino is completely independent from Italy," the Foreign Minister said. The mini-state has its own Government, Parliament, elections, judiciary, bureaucracy, license plates, laws, fiscal practices and police force. It is, say San Marinese like Mr. Cecchi, the cafe owner, cheaper and cleaner than Italy. It even has separate garbage bins on the street for used batteries and discarded medical dressings." On the other hand, it has no newspaper or port of its own, recruits policemen in Italy and uses Italian money even as it mints its own for sale to collectors. Possibly the closest affinity with Italy, though, lies in its politics. Since 1986, the country has been run by an unwieldy coalition of Christian Democrats and Communists, who retitled themselves Democratic Socialists after the fall of the Berlin wall. On Monday the Christian Democrats quit the coalition to build another one with old-time Socialists. "Crisis in San Marino," small headlines in Italy read.

259-> Making a Difference; Fox Television's New Mr. News
As a vice president for acquisitions at the News Corporation during the mid-1980's, Stephen Chao helped Rupert Murdoch put together his deals to acquire Twentieth Century-Fox and the seven television stations that became the core of the Fox television network. He then went on to develop entertainment programming for Fox, including "Cops" and "America's Most Wanted." Last week, Mr. Murdoch tapped the 36-year-old Mr. Chao for another important job in Fox's effort to build a true competitor to ABC, CBS and NBC. Mr. Chao was named president of Fox News, a newly created division of Fox Inc. that will oversee the news broadcasts of the stations owned by Fox and the development of a network-quality national news operation. "We want to be completely competitive in all aspects of the news," said Mr. Chao. Six of the seven stations owned by Fox -- including Channel 5 in New York -- already have local news shows, and Mr. Chao said his first priority is to help them strengthen those broadcasts. But he will also be developing a national prime-time news magazine that will be offered to the 138 Fox affiliates in a year or so. And he will be expanding Fox's fledgling national news operation. Mr. Chao said it is still too early for him to discuss his news philosophy or any of the details of how Fox News will operate. But he said that by developing a strong news feed for the affiliates, Fox can help them strengthen their market position. Mr. Chao, who holds a Harvard M.B.A., has no prior experience in television news. He plans to draw on the expertise of the Fox-owned stations, but at the same time to assemble a separate operation for the news magazine. "There's no blueprint," he said.

260-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Pirelli Chief Plans To Relinquish Control
Leopoldo Pirelli, a baron of Italian business, has announced his decision to relinquish day-to-day control of his Milan-based cable and rubber company after the expensive failure last year of his attempt to merge the company with its European rival, Continental A.G. Pirelli S.p.A. unexpectedly announced over the weeked that Mr. Pirelli, who is 67 years old, would remain as chairman but would yieled operational control to his 44-year-old son-in-law, Marco Tronchetti Provera, who becomes executive deputy chairman and managing director. The company did not comment yesterday on reports in a Milan newspaper that the changes were at the insistence of bankers financing Pirelli S.p.A.'s restructuring after losses last year of more than $600 million. Part of the restructuring involves the sale of businesses worth more than $800 million. After talks with Continental broke down in November, Mr. Pirelli indicated that he planned to oversee the restructuring himself. The company was founded by his grandfather 120 years ago, but suggestions that he might hand over power to his 38-year-old son, Alberto, seemed to have been quashed years ago when Mr. Pirelli reportedly told friends he would be the last of the dynasty. Mr Tronchetti Provera's ties with the family are both personal and financial. While he is thought to be a substantial shareholder, he was said to have been unenthusiastic about the proposed merger with Continental. But he was not well known outside the company until the Continental bid collapsed last year. He is married to Cecilia Pirelli, and they have three children. The principal challenge facing the new chief executive, Italian business analysts said, is to pull the company through the restructuring program, set to run until 1995.

261-> Minnesota Death Trip
OVER THE EARTH I COME The Great Sioux Uprising of 1862. By Duane Schultz. Illustrated. 307 pp. New York: A Thomas Dunne Book/ St. Martin's Press. $21.95. FROM the early 17th century to the late 19th century, the behavior of white settlers in America toward the native American tribes they encountered, as well as toward the land they expropriated from those tribes, was conditioned by one overriding factor: settlement was generally their last hope. Propelled by experiences of religious, ethnic and economic turmoil, the settlers had staked not only their fortunes but also their very lives on the hope of building new lives in untried country. For the Indians the settlers displaced, the terms of the conflict were, in the beginning, slightly less mortal, but that mortality grew as the tribes saw their lands shrink drastically with the passing of generations. These circumstances alone would suffice to explain the extraordinary savagery that generally marked hostilities between the settlers and the native Americans; when we add the fact that both sides had made important cultural rituals out of heinous violence long before they ever encountered each other, it becomes clear that an almost unlimited potential for nightmarish behavior existed. Duane Schultz's capably researched and tautly written "Over the Earth I Come" reminds us that responsibility for the abominable events that occurred during the Indian wars cut across ethnic boundaries. Mr. Schultz successfully resists the pressures of political correctness that reached their apogee with the release of the movie "Dances With Wolves" and offers vivid evidence that barbarity and treachery are qualities that characterize all groups, tribes and nations. Mr. Schultz -- the author of several books on the Second World War, including "The Doolittle Raid," as well as "Month of the Freezing Moon: The Sand Creek Massacre, November 1864" -- uses a journalistic narrative style to bring to life the great Sioux uprising of 1862 in Minnesota, an event that cost the lives of hundreds of white settlers and eventually led to the largest mass execution in American history (38 Indians were hanged simultaneously), as well as to the expulsion of nearly all native Americans -- not just the guilty Sioux -- from their lands in that state. Clearly, this was not a situation similar to the enslavement of black Africans or the genocidal extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany, two false analogies often cited in studies of American expansion. Rather, Mr. Schultz paints the Minnesota encounter as what it was: a war, a total war between rival nations for control of territory both groups were willing to die for. Each side receives Mr. Schultz's muted disapproval: the whites for the way they forced and finally resolved the conflict, the Indians for the way they conducted it. Without overstating his case, he cites the causes of Sioux dissatisfaction, which are all familiar: "the broken treaties, the routine cheating by traders, the near-starvation conditions." By midsummer 1862 the Sioux living on their tribe's principal reservation were desperate, and some were turning to violence. But their chief, Little Crow, resisted calls for an armed insurrection. He confronted Tom Galbraith, the reservation's new Indian agent, and a collection of traders, notably the exploitative and successful Andrew Myrick, with his people's plight. Little Crow demanded food. The essential white reaction was summed up by Myrick: "So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry, let them eat grass or their own dung." As Mr. Schultz comments with typical and admirable understatement, "Andrew Myrick would pay for that remark." Unfortunately, not only Myrick but scores of innocent white men, women and especially children paid as well. Throughout the summer, Sioux warriors engaged in atrocious behavior that often had little to do with righting wrongs or even with ritualized violence: it was simple sadism and blood lust, usually aggravated by whisky. The settlers were most often done in not by their hatred of the Indians but by the seeming friendships they had formed with them: approached by old Sioux acquaintances they had befriended with food and shelter, many settlers were murdered in the coldest of blood, the native Americans exhibiting a particular penchant for torturing infants and children. Mr. Schultz does not fail to find individual as well as general parallels between the white and Indian sides: both Little Crow, the leader of the uprising, and Henry Sibley, the popular former Governor of Minnesota who eventually put it down (he was chosen to lead the campaign against the Sioux because of his extensive personal dealings with them), are drawn as three-dimensional, deeply flawed characters, each of whom pursued his appointed task reluctantly but relentlessly. In the fall of 1862, having lost a string of battles, Little Crow led most of his "hostiles" out of Minnesota, leaving behind a large group of white hostages and many "friendlies," Sioux who had opposed the uprising but who were punished by the whites anyway. Hundreds of Indians were sentenced to death that winter, though President Abraham Lincoln approved the execution of only 38 of them. At least some of those 38 were not guilty of any crimes; one had even saved a white woman and her family at great personal risk. But the innocent had made the terrible mistake of throwing themselves on the mercy of the revenge-obsessed whites. Historically, the uprising represented the overture to the Plains Wars, during which the Sioux would fight the whites far more skillfully and with far greater success. Yet the essential terms and tone of the conflict, judiciously brought to life by Duane Schultz in "Over the Earth I Come," were set in 1862. If it is a less than inspiring story, it is certainly necessary to any balanced understanding of our nation's expansion.

262-> An Industrial Comeback Story: U.S. Is Competing Again in Steel
The American steel industry, long a symbol of decay in industrial America, has undergone a transformation in the last decade that has drastically sharpened the industry's competitive position. Now, after the Government has provided a decade of protection from imported steel, the Bush Administration has decided not to extend quotas on imported steel that expire today. The move reflects the industry's improved condition and the Administration's preference for using existing laws to fight what it sees as unfair trade practices. American steelmakers have so improved their productivity that the industry now often rivals -- and in ways outperforms -- its competitors in Germany and Japan. Japanese auto makers, like Toyota, Honda and Subaru, are using American steel in their plants in the United States. Thanks partly to the lower value of the dollar, foreign steel shipments into the United States have fallen in recent years to the point that they are below the limit the Government had set. And the industry's bellwether efficiency measure -- the man-hours needed to produce a ton -- is at a record level. Exports, which in the last 20 years have rarely accounted for more than 2 percent of all the steel shipped from American mills, soared last year to 6.3 million tons, or about 8 percent. And customers contend that the quality of American steel is better than ever, comparable with that from foreign steelmakers. Quality and Efficiency "The steel made in the United States is equal in quality to steel made anywhere in the world now," said James M. Glazebrook, director of the General Electric Company's trading operation. "And the industry is now being recognized more and more throughout the world, not only for having top quality, but for being among the best in the world in efficiency. You could never have said that 15 years ago." Trade protectionism gets some credit for the comeback of the big steelmakers, but so does domestic competition from low-cost nonunion mini-mills that pushed the big mills to change their ways. The value of the dollar played a big role, too. When the dollar was strong in the mid-80's, American producers recognized that they had to become more efficient to block inroads by imported steel. When the dollar later weakened, foreign steel prices rose and imports fell. Over all, the effectiveness of protectionist measures is mixed. Protection has been a boon to some industries, like motorcycle makers, who have been rejuvenated after four years of tariffs on foreign makes, but it has backfired for the automobile industry, where Japanese manufacturers got around the import limits by building plants in the United States and capturing still more market share from Detroit. The steel import quotas "have been an important help to the industry's recovery," said the Rev. William T. Hogan, a professor of economics at Fordham University and the author of a number of books on the steel industry. "The agreements have given them an opportunity to catch up." He added that the steel industry spent $23 billion in the 1980's to modernize plants and buy efficient equipment. Some of the money came in the form of joint ventures with Japanese and Korean steel companies. "Without the agreements," Father Hogan said, "we would have a high influx of imports, and I doubt they would have been able to invest as much." The decision by the Administration, which was confirmed yesterday by Gary R. Edson, the general counsel for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, suggests that American trade negotiators and some steel industry executives would prefer to open the market to steel imports but would insist that foreign governments commmit themselves to wiping out subsidies for foreign steelmakers. Trying to Curtail Reliance on Quotas The Administration is negotiating in Geneva for a multilateral agreement with steel-producing nations, hoping to determine levels of imports through a more flexible policy centered not on import quotas but on restricting government subsidies. "The foreign producers are not using their quotas, and demand in the United States is down," said John I. Griffin, president of the Maurice Pincoffs Company, a Houston-based steel-trading company that buys both domestic and imported steel. Mr. Griffin, who is also president of the American Association for International Steel, said the voluntary-restraint agreements that produced the steel quotas were "designed to give the American steel industry time to catch up with foreign steel." He added, "But the industry in the United States is certainly catching up, if it has not caught up already." American steelmakers still have weapons for trade battles. They can file legal cases against foreign producers accusing them of selling steel below cost or of benefiting from government subsidies; several of these legal cases have already been prepared. Exercising Their Options "We have to do whatever we have to do to protest unfair trade practices," said Frank W. Luerssen, chairman and chief executive of Inland Steel Industries, the nation's fourth-largest steel company. Under the terms of the steel import limits, American steel companies had given up some rights to battle the pricing practices of foreign steel manufacturers. Despite the emergence of big steel companies as more efficient, trimmer operations, they are still plagued by the effects of continued overcapacity. There is more steel than demand, and that has caused prices -- and profits -- to remain in the doldrums. In fact, a ton of the sheet steel that goes into cars is priced at about $440 now, compared with $504 in 1980. And while the lower cost of producing steel has meant that steelmakers have profited in good times -- the six largest producers earned $1.2 billion in the robust economy of 1989 -- they have been ravaged by economic downturns and those same companies lost a combined $2.3 billion last year. A Partial Comeback At a Classic Big Mill Nowhere have the industry's changes been more pronounced than in Gary, Ind., where the USX Corporation operates a sprawling plant along a five-mile strip on the shores of Lake Michigan. For decades, the mill operated by the company -- formerly known as United States Steel -- epitomized the vastness of big steel. Whatever steel product a customer desired could be manufactured here, from nails to railroad tracks to sheets for automobile hoods. The Gary Works, or the Big Mill as it was known inside the company, is still the largest steel plant in North America, but it has shrunk considerably. At one time in the 1970's, more than 28,000 people worked here; today there are fewer than 8,000 employees. In earlier decades, the Gary plant housed everything from a hospital, a railroad and a cement plant to a factory that made bridge parts. But now, most of that has been closed or sold, scores of buildings are empty or were demolished and much of the site's 3,400 acres sit idle. A Shrunken Product List The mill's production is now confined principally to two types of steel: flat-rolled steel used in automobiles and appliances, and plate steel used in construction and in heavy machinery. What is made here, however, is produced more efficiently than ever. At the Gary Works, it takes 2.7 man-hours to produce a ton of steel, compared with a USX average of 3.6, and 7.1 man-hours 10 years ago. The national average for the steel industry is about five hours a ton. With the opening last fall of a new caster that converts molten steel into slabs, the Gary plant now produces all its steel by the more cost-efficient continuous casting method rather than the conventional method of producing steel from ingots. The big plant is primarily a maker of sheet used for automobiles and appliances, tin for food and beverage cans and plates for construction and shipbuilding. Labor and Managers Make Adjustments After a bruising labor dispute that shut the plant for six months in late 1986 and early 1987, relations between the union and management have become noticeably less hostile. A steelworker here is no longer confined to one specific duty, like pipefitting. Workers in the highly automated and computerized plant are likely to be assigned to teams to discuss their tasks and determine more efficient ways of working. "I would say we've seen a complete turnaround from the way things used to be," said Cary B. Kranz, president of Local 1066 of the United Steelworkers union here. Mr. Kranz, whose father worked at United States Steel and was also president of the local, said that union members have a far greater role now in making decisions. "They now involve union people and make us feel that we are a part of something," Mr. Kranz said. "They meet with us and they recognize that we have all the knowledge in the world within these gates. It's not happening as fast as we would like, but it is happening." Analysts and steel industry historians suggest that the changes in Gary mirror the changes in the industry as a whole. The 5.3 man-hours per ton for the steel industry in the United States compares with 5.4 in Japan, and 5.6 in both Germany and Britain, according to statistics by the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. And the American figures look even better when compared with 6.4 man-hours a ton in South Korea, 7.2 in Taiwan and 8.9 in Brazil. Global Factors Get More Emphasis In part, analysts attribute the changes in the mills to a new generation of steel managers whose views have been shaped by global competition in the steel business and a proliferation of joint ventures between American steel companies and partners from Japan and Korea. In fact, a total of $3 billion of foreign capital mostly from Japan and Korea has been invested in the American steel industry. Many American executives have been exposed to foreign steel companies' methods of operation and labor relations. "Many American managers, particularly the younger ones, have started to criticize themselves now rather than blindly defend themselves," said Kiichi Mochizuki, president of the United States arm of the Nisshin Steel Company of Japan. "And that is healthy. It is the first step to improvement. They are developing the courage to say that they have problems and that they need to be attacked." While the large steel companies have scaled down, their smaller competitors, the mini-mills, have become far more significant challengers, having systematically usurped markets once dominated by big steel. These mini-mills, with names like Nucor, Birmingham Steel and Oregon Steel, typically operate with far lower costs because they melt scrap to produce steel and have largely nonunion work forces with wages about a third lower than those of the unionized steelworkers at the big mills. Big Players Learn Nothing Is Sacred Mini-mill companies, too, are gradually changing the competitive balance of the industry. Once these smaller companies were confined to producing such lower-quality items as reinforcement bars for concrete used in highways and bridges and material for fences, wires and nails. Today, they have a virtual lock on items like beams that support buildings. And some are moving toward the big companies' bread and butter: the flat-rolled steel used in automobiles and appliance parts. As a result, big steel companies consider the mini-mills to be as much a competitive threat as foreign steel is, perhaps even more so. "Nothing is sacred any more as far as the big integrated steel companies' monopoly," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "Mini-mills had to get into different pastures to continue their growth, and flat-rolled steel is the new area of opportunity." The importance of steel produced by these smaller steel companies has grown sharply. In 1980, the five largest steel producers accounted for more than 60 percent of all of the domestic industry's shipments. By 1990, that figure had dropped to slightly more than 40 percent. And mini-mills now account for about 21 percent of domestic consumption, slightly more than the 18 percent accounted for by imported steel. Unlike big steel, mini-mills have weathered the current economic recession robustly. Last year, the six largest steel producers posted operating losses of about $27 for every ton of steel they shipped, nearly $1 billion. But the 10 largest mini-mill companies earned, on average, $10 a ton, or about $100 million. Some in the industry contend that the big American steel producers will bounce back with vigor once the economy rebounds, noting that despite the improvement in efficiency, steel remains a highly cyclical business. "They will always have ups and downs," Mr. Jacobson said. "But, because of the improvements among the big steel companies, their ups will be a little brighter, and they will be able to sustain themselves better during the down periods."

264-> C.I.A. Dug for Moles but Buried the Loyal
Three years ago the Central Intelligence Agency gave S. Peter Karlow a small bronze medal, a citation in a blue leatherette binder and a check for close to $500,000. It was the agency's way of saying there had been a terrible mistake. More than two decades earlier, the C.I.A. had falsely branded Mr. Karlow as a suspected mole, a spy within the agency's ranks. "I walked down the street and a flower pot fell off the roof and landed on me," Mr. Karlow, who is now 71 years old and lives in Northern California, said in an interview. His case, and those of other agency employees who became victims of the agency's hunts for moles in the 1960's and early 1970's, are detailed in a book by David Wise, "Molehunt: the Secret Search For Traitors That Shattered the C.I.A." The book will be published by Random House on March 16. Into Professional Exile After 10 years of research and more than 650 interviews, Mr. Wise writes that the agency paid Mr. Karlow and two other former employees a total of more than $700,000 to compensate them for having wrongly accused them of disloyalty. The payments were made under an obscure law that became known within the agency as the "Mole Relief Act." Paul Garbler, the C.I.A.'s first station chief in Moscow, who also received a payment from the agency, spent years in professional exile after he was suspected of being a mole. Richard Kovich, who recruited Soviet spies for the C.I.A. until his career slid into limbo, also received compensation. Three other unidentified C.I.A. employees sought payments, but the agency rejected their claims. Mark Mansfield, a C.I.A. spokesman, said agency officials declined to coment on Mr. Wise's book because, they said, they not yet seen it. But he added, "Several agency employees did receive compensation under what has often been referred to as the Mole Relief Act." The cases of the three former officials were known from news reports and previous books about the period. But Mr. Wise, a longtime Washington reporter who has written several books on espionage and intelligence, documents the mole investigations and their impact on the employees involved. With detailed reporting, he portrays paralyzing distrust within the C.I.A.'s Soviet Division, which was responsible for spying on Moscow. Mr. Wise says that the files of up to 120 employees were reviewed in the hunt for Soviet agents at the C.I.A. More than 50 employees were actually investigated, and at least 16 were treated as serious suspects, although former Directors of Central Intelligence, like William E. Colby, say no Soviet penetration was uncovered. Christmastime in Helsinki Mr. Wise's account, which was confirmed by other current and former intelligence officials in interviews, begins shortly before Christmas in 1961, when Anatoly M. Golitsin, a K.G.B. officer who became one of the best-known Soviet defectors, turned up on the snowy doorstep of the C.I.A.'s station chief in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Golitsin touched off panic, telling C.I.A. officials that he had seen information at K.G.B. headquarters that came from high in the C.I.A. "The mole, he told his C.I.A. interrogators, was someone of Slavic background whose name might have ended in 'sky,' " Mr. Wise writes. "He had been stationed in Germany. His K.G.B. code name was Sasha. And there was something else: the mole's true last name began with the letter 'K.' " The defector's account seemed to confirm the worst suspicions of the C.I.A's top counterintelligence official, James Jesus Angleton, the reclusive orchid-grower, fly-fisherman and graduate of Yale who, in the depths of the cold war, operated with icy suspicion. Mr. Angleton scoured the agency for K.G.B. spies from 1954 until 1974, when Mr. Colby dismissed him. Although some agency officials dispute it, others like Mr. Colby say the counterintelligence excesses of the Angleton period nearly paralyzed the C.I.A.'s efforts to spy on the Kremlin. Mr. Angleton died in 1987. A Master Gadgeteer To Mr. Angleton and his investigators, the book goes on, Mr. Karlow appeared to neatly fit Mr. Golitsin's profile of "Sasha." His last name began with the letter "K." His last name at birth had been Klibansky. His father had been born in Germany but sometimes said he was from Russia. And Mr. Karlow had worked for six years in West Germany for the C.I.A. And there was more. At one time, Mr. Wise writes, Mr. Karlow was the closest thing the C.I.A. had to "Q," the master gadgeteer of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Mr. Karlow had worked to develop a tiny eavesdropping device like one the Soviets planted in a carved replica of the Great Seal of the United States that hung on the Ambassador's wall at the American Embassy in Moscow from 1945 until it was detected in the early 1950's. The mole hunters suspected that the Soviets had obtained information about the project, because when Mr. Golitsin defected he brought with him a technical paper suggesting that the Soviets knew of a United States-British program to duplicate the bugging device. As the head of the American effort, Mr. Karlow quickly became the mole hunters' prime suspect. His case was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for possible prosecution. In early 1963, the book relates, two agents questioned Mr. Karlow for five days, gave him a polygraph examination and finally accused him of being a spy. His career in a nightmarish descent, Mr. Karlow resigned from the agency at the age of 42, insisting on his innocence to an intelligence agency that no longer listened. He seemed trapped in a maze. Once, he demanded specific allegations to rebut and was given two dates in 1951 and 1952 when he was supposedly in East Berlin secretly meeting his Soviet contact. After reconstructing his whereabouts, Mr. Karlow showed that he had been elsewhere on both occasions. But a C.I.A. security official asserted that only a spy could establish such a solid alibi. Mr. Wise discovered that the F.B.I. interrogators had cleared Mr. Karlow, although he was never officially told that. And Mr. Wise said that Mr. Angleton learned from British officials that the Soviets had been tipped off about the C.I.A.'s attempt to copy their miniature bug from George Blake, a British intelligence officer who was caught spying for the Soviets, was sentenced to prison in 1961 and later escaped and fled to Moscow. Mr. Garbler was a decorated Navy dive-bomber pilot in the Pacific during World War II. In 1961, he was named the C.I.A.'s first station chief in Moscow, a prestigious and delicate job that included handling the agency's important Soviet spy, Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel in the G.R.U., the Soviet military intelligence service. Mr. Garbler returned to C.I.A. headquarters, his star on the rise until 1966, when his promotion to head the agency's clandestine operations in Europe inexplicably fell through. He was ordered to report to the "Farm," the C.I.A.'s training base near Williamsburg, Va. Two years later, the book goes on, he was transferred to another outpost, Trinidad, where he was station chief in Port-of-Spain. Suspicion Upon Suspicion A friend told Mr. Garbler that his career had dimmed because he, too, was under suspicion as a mole. His last name did not begin with the letter "K," but his father had emigrated from Russia and his mother from Poland. And years earlier in West Berlin, he had supervised Igor Orlov -- a contract employee whose cover name began with a "K" and who had been nicknamed "Sasha." Years later, when Mr. Garbler had retired and was working in the land-investment business in Arizona, he learned that the C.I.A., guided by Mr. Golitsin, had come to suspect Mr. Orlov of being a Soviet plant who had turned Mr. Garbler into a double agent. Eventually, Mr. Golitsin was permitted to read secret agency files, and in 1964 the defector found another "Sasha." He was Richard Kovich, the son of Serbian immigrants, who had worked in West Berlin, and whose last name began with the telltale letter "K." At the agency, he was regarded as a skilled agent who would go anywhere in the world to persuade a Soviet to spy for the United States. Mr. Kovich's career skidded into an irreversible stall. In 1974, when he was 47, he retired and moved to North Carolina. By the counterintelligence logic of the time, the C.I.A. had come to view the Soviet agents Mr. Kovich had cultivated as conduits that he might have used to pass information to Moscow. Eventually, all three former C.I.A. employees learned they had been investigated, but that the agency had turned up no proof of their disloyalty, and that they were no longer under suspicion. Subsequent studies concluded that Mr. Golitsin had been a genuine defector, but that his claims were overblown. A High Cost in Pain Even so, the mole hunt had cost Mr. Karlow, Mr. Garbler and Mr. Kovich their reputations and damaged their careers. Mr. Kovich and Mr. Garbler hired lawyers who lobbied Congress for a compensation bill, which was signed into law in October 1980 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Garbler and Mr. Kovich sought and received compensation in 1981. But Mr. Karlow, who became an executive at the Monsanto Corporation after he left the agency, was turned down. That decision was reversed in 1988 by William H. Webster, then the Director of Central Intelligence, and a second bill was quietly passed.

265-> Drought Shrivels Farms and Hope in Zimbabwe
Across the southern swath of this African nation, the rains have failed this season, leaving farmers like 32-year-old Lismart Matsilele staring in disbelief at barren fields that should be lush with six-foot corn. "Two weeks ago it was so hot the birds were dying, the animals were dying, everything existing was dying," said a despondent Mr. Matsilele, kicking the earth that hasn't felt any rain for three months and has been further dried by searing winds and sun. "We planted, but some of the crops never germinated. Some were burned. The remains we pulled up a few weeks ago to feed the cattle." At a nearby school 300 miles southeast of the capital, Harare, in the heart of Zimbabwe's lowland, malnourished children faint during their outdoor morning assemblies, and every afternoon, teachers gather their food scraps to sustain the weakest students. The lowland is the country's hardest-hit region. The rainfall is generally low here, but ordinarily it is sufficient to allow farmers to grow enough to at least feed themselves. This season, there were a couple of drops in October, and then nothing. Entire Region Afflicted Down the road from the school at Gonarezhou National Park, a place where wildlife ordinarily thrive, dead hippopotamuses slump on the parkland and buffalo carcasses rot in the sun. Zimbabwe has been among the handful of African nations able to feed itself and to export to its often hard-pressed neighbors. But this year, this country of nearly 11 million is at the center of a southern African regional drought that meteorologists and food specialists say is the worst this century. While individual countries, including Zimbabwe, have experienced serious droughts before, experts here do not recall a time when all the countries from South Africa north to Zambia, Angola and Malawi were hit at once. Zimbabwe's leaders have invested in irrigation, agricultural-extension services and farmer education in an effort to show that this country is different from Africa's beggar nations. So the drought's economic and social consequences are particularly devastating. Last week, President Robert Mugabe bowed to the obvious and declared a national disaster. With only a month's supply of food on hand, more than two million tons of food -- corn, wheat, soybeans, sugar -- will have to be imported during the next year, Government officials say. But the officials do not know if the food, which must be hauled by creaky trains and trucks from ports in South Africa and Mozambique, can get here on time to prevent deaths. South Africa is importing an unprecedented four million tons of food because of its own severe drought and has designated a well-equipped port, Durban, for itself, leaving the less modern Port Elizabeth for food shipments for Zimbabwe. "Even if things work perfectly, people will die as a result of this drought," the United States Ambassador, Gibson E. Lanpher, said. In addition to the peril of starvation, the effect of the drought on Zimbabwe's economy threatens to be devastating. Since independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has been a fairly solid economic performer. The country inherited schools, roads and other basic services from the British and has retained a diversified economy that grew by 3 percent a year in the 1980's. The high food import bill now -- in a period when the best export earners like sugar and tobacco are affected -- is likely to flatten the economy. "Our feeling is that this could result in a minus 5 percent growth rate," said Christiaan J. Poortman, the World Bank's representative in Zimbabwe. On the small farms like Mr. Matsilele's, a sense of desperation is setting in as people realize it is too late for rain. "The 15 cattle I've got left are useless," he said. "They're just loitering in the bushes. You can see their bones. They are so weak they can hardly move from one point to another." His herd had been cut in half during 112-degree heat several weeks ago. Aid Is Undermined The father of six children, Mr. Matsilele said his family was living off food aid. But the portions were getting smaller each day, he said, with shipment troubles delaying delivery. At the Nyahanga Primary School, the principal, Albert Gombemuvngo, said enrollment had dwindled as malnourished children became too weak to walk the two miles to school. At the southeastern regional capital, Chiredzi, a sugar estate known as Hippo Valley has dried into brown grass, and storage dams that are dependent on rain lie empty like vast red earth saucers. Zimbabwe's sugar crop is ordinarily about 450,000 tons a year, half of it for export. With its collapse, there will be no exports, the World Bank says. In the southwest at Bulawayo, the industrial hub of Zimbabwe, a billboard in the center of town reads: "Twelve Weeks Left in our Dams. Conserve Water." Factories have drilled bore holes to keep up water supplies and homes are on a ration of slightly over 100 gallons a day. Already "water restriction" disks, which slow a house's flow to a trickle, have been inserted on the water pipes of 6,000 houses that have repeatedly exceeded the limits. Like everywhere else in the drought area, small farmers, like Sylvia Ncube, who grew enough to feed themselves and a little extra to pay for school fees, seem the most disappointed. Mrs. Ncube, who has a certificate from an agricultural college, has been successful in the last four years -- so much so that others have been brought to her farm to learn about crop spacing, fertilizer and yield. She has increased her yield from two bags of corn, beans and groundnuts to 50 bags. This year, though, she said, she has "hapana" -- Shona for nothing. Her corn plants lay shriveled on the ground, the leaves the color of parchment. The groundnut plants managed a pale green, then died. The bean plants poked through the soil and withered. The skies looked promising and laden with gray as Mrs. Ncube spoke, although a hot wind whipped through her field. "I don't trust the clouds anymore," she said. "They're been like this for weeks." Mrs. Ncube said she had four bags of corn left over from last year's harvest. That would last four months. After that, she said, "I will have to buy, but what do I buy with?"

266-> Montgomery Journal; Leaping Into the Fray Over Gay Group at Auburn
Montgomery residents say this lovely river port has always been genteel except when the Alabama Legislature was in session. The legislators, many of them small-town lawyers, used to spit tobacco, engage in noisy debates and throw their peanut shells onto the floors. But even the legislators are models of decorum now. The spittoons and peanut shells have disappeared, and many of the lawmakers, some of whom have nicknames like Noopie, Skippy, Crum and Jabo, have traded in their plaid sport coats for tailored gray suits. Some lawmakers are even taking a measured approach to an issue that in Legislatures past would surely have incited streams of invective: A measure on the current calendar of the Alabama House, Bill 454, seeks to limit gay groups on the campuses of the state's colleges and universities. It would "prohibit any college or university from spending public funds to sanction any group that promotes a life style prohibited by the sodomy and sexual misconduct laws" that the state enacted in 1977. Supporters of the bill said it would prevent universities from recognizing groups like the Auburn Gay and Lesbian Association, whose charter was recently approved by administrators at Auburn University, about 50 miles east of here. The bill's chief architect, Representative Pete Turnham, Democrat of Auburn, hesitates to insert his religious beliefs into the debate. "Sometimes you should not let your religious and personal views get involved in your clear thinking," he said. "My objective has never been to keep somebody from meeting and marching on campus, but simply to prevent state money from being used to promote the breaking of state laws." Nonetheless, deep feelings underlie both sides of the dispute. "If the charter of this group is allowed to stand," said Representative Mark L. Gaines, a Homewood Republican who is a co-sponsor of the bill, "you've opened the door for organizations that promote bestiality and wife-swapping." But Carol Daron, an assistant professor of English at Auburn, said, "It's an absurd bill, an absolutely outrageous and embarrassing bill." The House bill, which was approved by the Judiciary Committee in early March, is but one development in four months of debate about the gay group at Auburn. The group's faculty adviser, Donna Sollie, said it was granted a probationary charter from the university's Student Government Association in 1990, and noted that the group won an award from the student government as the outstanding new organization. But when time came for a vote on the group's permanent charter last November, sentiment within the student government had changed. The vote was 23 to 7 against granting the charter. The student government president, Jon Waggoner, 21, attributed the change to advice given by the Rutherford Institute, a Christian legal defense organization. "We found, because we were dealing with state laws, that we had legal grounds to deny the charter," he said. In January, however, the vice president of student affairs at Auburn, Patricia Barnes, overruled the student government and granted the charter. Mr. Waggoner asserted that the university was pressured by threats of legal action. Dr. Barnes has refused to comment on her decision. Whatever the reasoning behind the university's action, the members of Auburn Gay and Lesbian Association felt vindicated. But reaction was swift and virulent. Students opposed to the group collected 21,000 signatures, 4,000 of them from students, on a petition asking the Auburn board of trustees to rescind approval of the charter. Demonstrations by these students and by supporters of the gay group have led to heated words and at least one incident in which a pellet gun was fired near the gay demonstrators. The debate has continued to widen, with the national Auburn Alumni Association endorsing the students' petition. The trustees will meet on Monday to consider the matter. And then there is House Bill 454, which would spread the controversy to include all the colleges and universities in Alabama, some of which also have gay groups on campus. The House sponsors preparing to debate the bill were heartened by a favorable advisory opinion that the state attorney general issued today. Complicating the debate, the state's anti-sodomy and sexual misconduct laws are unclear because the specific activities outlawed are never listed. Critics of the law say activities like oral sex between married heterosexuals could be considered crimes. At a recent reception, some lawmakers suggested that the Legislature was stepping into territory where it should not go. "I don't think the Legislature ought to be involved in something like that," said State Senator James Bennett, Democrat of Homewood. "We've got a lot of important work to do down here." Others say they would support the bill out of a simple matter of religious conviction or legal interpretation. But for some, support for the bill, like a slavish adherence to fashion, may be rooted in a fear of ridicule. Representative David Barnes, Democrat of Birmingham, said that the bill will "pass in a minute." "People are saying if you vote against the bill," he said, "people will think you're a homosexual, and that'll send the wrong message back home."

267-> Newman T. Halvorson; Accountant, 84
Newman T. Halvorson, a former partner of the Ernst & Young accounting firm, died on Oct. 19 at University Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. He was 84 years old. His death was reported yesterday by a spokesman for Ernst & Young, Marc Eiger, who said the cause of death was congestive heart failure. Born in Blair, Wis., Mr. Halvorson joined the Detroit office of Ernst & Ernst, a predecessor to Ernst & Young, as a certified public accountant in 1930 after graduating that year from the University of Wisconsin. He moved to the firm's Cleveland office in 1954 and retired in 1972. Mr. Halvorson was a consultant to the firm after his retirement.

268-> Where Was the Crime in House Bank Affair?; Akin to a Club
To the Editor: The facility established for the House of Representatives was anything but a bank -- it was not chartered as such, did not hold itself out to the public as a financial institution, nor was it created as a profit-oriented enterprise. Instead, it was a cooperative convenience, a pool, established by and for a most restricted group of members, something akin to a club. Sums were deposited into the fund's coffers without any expectation of earning interest; against these deposits members expected to make withdrawals as circumstances warranted. And then the rules, expressed or implied, permitted members to make withdrawals in anticipation of deposits. That this arrangement appears to have worked to the satisfaction of the members may be inferred from the fact that no one has come forward to assert that funds on deposit were not available on demand. So it is that the purported "bad checks" were but loans owing to other members of the pool who at the time had favorable balances. Then there is the hullabaloo about "interest free" -- what nonsense. Each day millions of us are engaged in just such transactions. I have a First National Bank of Chicago Visa card, permitting me to acquire goods or services by signing vouchers. Technically, these vouchers are the equivalent of "bad checks," except the bank is willing to honor them. I have thereby become indebted to the bank; as it happens, these loans are interest free because I pay up promptly when receiving the monthly reckoning. ABRAHAM J. BRILOFF New York, March 16, 1992 The writer is a retired accountancy professor at Baruch College, CUNY.

269-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; Book Lists Dwindling As Publishers Cut Fat
Publishers are trimming the fat these days and not just by ordering plain pasta with chopped tomatoes when they have lunch at the Four Seasons. They are looking at their bottom lines and at the array of proposals and manuscripts being offered to them, and, with a sense of restraint forgotten in the acquisitive 80's, they are learning to say, "No, thank you." As a result, lists are leaner at most publishing houses, with fewer titles being printed. Publishers say they are looking with greater discretion at book outlines, turning away things they probably would have accepted a few years ago. Important Changes This appetite control prompted important changes at three publishing houses in the last few months. Simon & Schuster dissolved Summit Books and dismissed the imprint's founder and publisher, James Silberman. Farrar, Straus & Giroux cut about 15 percent of its staff, including its executive editor, Linda Healey. And the company's president, Roger Straus Jr., said it was no longer expanding its journalistic nonfiction as it had planned. And just last week, Bantam Books announced that its publisher, Linda Grey, was leaving her job to start her own imprint within Bantam that would emphasize best sellers, while the house as a whole would be cutting back its book list. "The better you can focus and spend your creative energy on your books, the better you publish them and the better they sell," said Jack Hoeft, president and chief executive at Bantam, Doubleday, Dell, the parent company. "I think we can do that better with a tighter list. I think everyone is seeing that now." Like many other industries, publishing went through an age of gluttony in the 1980's. Editors and publishers say they were often not sufficiently discriminating in the books they bought. They piled up acquisitions like so many trophies, sometimes without being sure what exactly they had won. 'Too Many Books Out There' "Before, people used to ask, 'Why shouldn't I publish this?' " said Harold Evans, publisher of the Random House Adult Trade division. "Now the question they are asking is, 'Why do I have to publish this?' People say there are too many books out there, and it's probably a fair observation. The conventional wisdom is that all publishers should publish fewer titles." Talk of cutting lists usually provokes talk of the worthy books that will go unpublished as a result. But Phyllis E. Grann, the president and chief executive of the Putnam-Berkley Group, said bluntly, "The books that suffer are the ones you don't need." "I don't think good books are hurting," said Mrs. Grann, who made her publishing house a success in part by cutting the number of hardcover titles from some 225 when she first arrived in 1976 to about 75 titles in the early 80's, a number that she has kept fairly steady. "I really believe a book that is really good will be published, even if it's a print run of only 4,000 or if it ends up with a smaller house," she said. "But there's a lot of junk that won't get published, and I think that's good." Barry Lippman, president of the adult trade division at Macmillan, said his company also started trimming its list four years ago, going from more than 400 hardcover titles to 300 across five different imprints. This move, he said, has led to increased profits in each of the last three years. "There are just so many books one can edit and sell effectively," he said. "People talk about all the books and authors that lose out when you trim lists, but I think they suffer more when you take on too many books and can't publish them well." All of this is not to say that the entire publishing industry is on some communal crash diet. What is going on is mostly nipping and tucking, and several houses have combination austerity and growth programs, with certain divisions shrinking while others are expanding. Random House Adult Trade is trimming its list, but its subsidiary, Times Books, is growing. Another Random House division, Pantheon, is reorganizing and expanding, now with the help of Ms. Healey, who joined there as a vice president and senior editor. HarperCollins is trimming its adult trade, or general-interest, hardcover list and its Zondervan religious book department, but Harper Business and Basic Books are adding titles. William S. Shinker, publisher of the adult trade division at HarperCollins, said his company's procedure for trimming involved keeping meticulous computerized records of books that were bought, by category and expected delivery date. Then at the weekly acquisitions meetings, where editors discuss new books they want to buy, they consult the list and see if, for example, there is a hole on the list for a big nonfiction book being proposed for the spring of 1993. If there is room, the book is analyzed more intensely than before for its merit, the track record of the author and the competition. If there is no room and an editor still feels the book is one that the company should publish, "then we still might go after it," Mr. Shinker said, "but the standards are pretty high, and we simply have to say no more than we used to." Despite the recent upheaval at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the publishing house's managing director, Roger Straus 3d, discounted all the industry talk about cutting back and said he had "no deep religious belief in downsizing." "This is one of those trends that everyone always starts talking about when times get tough," Mr. Straus said. "The trouble with downsizing as a concept is if someone could tell up front which books would sell and which wouldn't, it would be brilliant. But since most of us can't really tell, it becomes a dangerous idea that could make things worse." But while nearly everyone in the publishing industry seems to want to lose the literary equivalent of 5 to 10 pounds, not everyone has the willpower. Donald S. Lamm, chairman and president of W. W. Norton, said that although he began an effort to scale back three years ago, the house's list this fall would grow by some 5 hardcover and 10 paperback titles. "I thought we were cutting back, but it seems I don't know how to do it," Mr. Lamm said. "There are still a lot of interesting manuscripts out there, and it's hard to break the habit. If something good comes down the road, I just can't say, 'Sorry, we already filled our quota.' You don't slam the door on a good manuscript."

270-> Is Japan Out to Get Us?
"WE are definitely at war with Japan," says John Connor, the venerable detective in Michael Crichton's "Rising Sun," as he guides his junior officer through the intricate web of Japan's evil conspiracy to take over America. Here is the latest, and least subtle, of a great tide of recent books demonizing the Japanese. Almost all are classified as nonfiction; a few, like "Rising Sun," as fiction. But in this genre the distinction blurs. Mr. Crichton's characters frequently deliver short lectures on the subject of Japan's insidious design, mixing established fact with fantasy. The result is a thriller that doubles as a crude polemic. Just in case the reader misses his point, Mr. Crichton warns in an afterword of Japan's "adversarial trade, trade like war, trade intended to wipe out the competition," and encourages readers to verify the claims his characters make by consulting several recent works of nonfiction, which he lists. But the nonfiction books Mr. Crichton cites also tend to mix factual analyses of Japan's economic strength with hyperbolic visions of Japan's plot to run the United States. High on the list is "Agents of Influence" (1990) by Pat Choate, which is partly a thoughtful examination of influence peddling by all large corporations, but also partly a paranoid fantasy about Tokyo's alleged payoffs to influential Americans to achieve "effective political domination over the United States." Another is "Trading Places" (1988) by Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. -- a useful and detailed chronicle of the frustrations of negotiating trade with Japan, leading to an implausible and unsupported argument that because of our failure to respond adequately to the Japanese challenge, "the power of the United States and the quality of American life is diminishing rapidly in every respect." A third is "The Enigma of Japanese Power" (1989) by Karel van Wolferen. It combines an insightful analysis of Japan's governing structure with a stereotyped and ahistorical view of Japan as a rudderless, amoral society "in which good behavior is constantly determined by individuals' views of how others expect them to behave . . . and in which conformity to social expectations is not an unfortunate compromise but the only possible way to live." MR. CRICHTON might have added many other recent works to his list, books that similarly blend fiction and nonfiction as they conjure up a Japan intent on controlling America: William S. Dietrich's "In the Shadow of the Rising Sun" (1991), claiming that Japan "threatens our way of life and ultimately our freedoms as much as past dangers from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union"; Robert Zielinski and Nigel Holloway's "Unequal Equities" (1991), arguing that Japan's big corporations have rigged their capital markets in ways that undermine American corporations; Daniel Burstein's "Yen! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to America" (1988), asserting that Japan's growing control over our financial markets puts the United States at risk of falling prey to a "hostile Japanese . . . world order"; and William J. Holstein's "Japanese Power Game" (1990), contending that Japan is motivated by raw power and parochialism, which threaten the United States. I have located over 35 recent books in this genre -- many with bellicose titles like "The Coming War With Japan," "Zaibatsu America: How Japanese Firms are Colonizing Vital U.S. Industries," "The Silent War," "Trade Wars" and so on. There are several possible explanations for this outpouring, but Japan's recent behavior is not one. Japan still has a long way to go before its economy is truly open, and it can be (and should be) faulted on many grounds, but the big story since the mid-1980's is how far Japan has come in so short a time from its protectionist ways of the 1960's and 1970's. By 1990, Japan was the world's third-largest importer with each Japanese citizen purchasing, on average, about $1,900 worth of imports -- not much less than the average American's purchase of $2,050 of imported products. Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed steeply, from less than a quarter of the total in 1980 to over 60 percent last year -- including many high-tech items like space satellites and telecommunications equipment. Since 1985, manufactured exports from the United States to Japan have almost doubled. Nor do Japanese investments in the United States suggest a conspiracy. For the most part, those investments have been big losers, which is one reason why Japan is cutting back on them. The Treasury bills the Japanese have liked to acquire have declined in value as the dollar has dropped since 1985; the prices of real estate, another Japanese favorite, have fallen since 1989. Only a tiny portion of Japan's total investment has gone to successful American companies; more has been directed at relatively un successful companies in Rust Belt industries like tires and steel. Other investments have taken the form of new factories, where American workers are learning to become more productive and create higher-quality goods than in many American-owned factories. It is hard to find much of a plot in any of this. Mitsubishi's purchase of a substantial interest in Rockefeller Center, Sony's purchase of Columbia Pictures and Nintendo's recent flirtation with the Seattle Mariners make the headlines, but in almost every controversial case, it has been the American owners who have initiated the deal. The British still own more of the United States than the Japanese do. Far more significant to Japan's growth than either its trade policies or its American acquisitions has been its willingness to save and to invest in its own productivity. Since the mid-1980's, Japanese companies have invested more money in new factories, capital equipment and products than have American companies -- even though Japan has half our population. And Japan has been investing heavily in education and infrastructure, and will be investing the equivalent of trillions of dollars more over the next decade. That all this investment enables Japan to make products of high quality, which American consumers want to buy, does not constitute a vicious plot. Before going farther, it is necessary for me to reassure the reader that I am not now, nor have I ever been, an employee of a Japanese company, nor do I receive any research funds from the Japanese, consult for the Japanese or hold an academic chair donated by the Japanese. I feel compelled to issue this disclaimer because so much of the literature under review casts suspicions on any academic who dares suggest that a Japanese plot may not be under way. Pat Choate, in "Agents of Influence," warns darkly of Japan's infestation of American universities in order to distort research in its favor. One of the few characters in Mr. Crichton's "Rising Sun" who is not yet bought off by the Japanese explains that American professors "deliver the Japanese propaganda line. They don't really have a choice, because they need access to Japan to work." Were these professors to sound critical of Japan, they would "lose speaking engagements and consulting jobs. They know that's happened to their colleagues who step out of line." These passages are not only nonsensical, since Japanese funding accounts for a minuscule fraction of professorial incomes, they are uncomfortably reminiscent of suspicions during the 1950's of the loyalty of American university professors and their vulnerability to foreign conspiracy. But if Japan is not really plotting against us, what accounts for this wave of fearmongering? Perhaps American sensitivities are running high in light of the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Memories of the attack can be detected in the metaphors with which the Japanese challenge is described in many of these books: Japan is "targeting" our key industries (Holstein); it is "raiding" our technologies (Dietrich); we are "outgunned . . . in the battle for control of world financial resources" (Burstein); Japan is mounting a "planned attack" on the United States through a "new kind of invasion" (Crichton). SOMETIMES the Pearl Harbor analogy is explicit. In "Pearl Harbor Ghosts" (1991) Thurston Clarke journeys to Hawaii to discover the legacies of the attack, and draws "lessons . . . too depressing, or simply too terrifying" to be faced by most Americans. "In a Japanese victory more enduring than Pearl Harbor," Japan has won the "trade war," and is turning Hawaii itself into an "economic colony" -- with "paler shadows haunting the mainland." The detective John Connor, in "Rising Sun," counsels his protege to "remember Pearl Harbor." Yet memory of the disaster 50 years ago is only a small part of the explanation. The fears expressed in these books would not be as intense as they are were it not for America's own economic doldrums. Although several of the books were published before the current recession, low productivity gains and deepening debt have been eating away at the foundations of the American economy for years. The reasons for these long-term ills have been well chronicled: a capital market that resembles a casino and demands immediate profits; an educational system that leaves almost 80 percent of our young people unable to comprehend a news magazine and many others unprepared for work; managers who award themselves princely sums while laying off their workers at the slightest hint of a downturn; a collapsing infrastructure of unsafe bridges and potholed roads; and, more generally, a social norm -- which reached its zenith during the 1980's -- of overconsumption and underinvestment. None of these failings are readily remedied without considerable sacrifice. It is far easier to blame others. It has been this way through history. When the British economy began to sag at the beginning of this century, British citizens were treated to a series of lurid exposes, such as Frederick MacKenzie's "American Invaders," about the American economic onslaught and its baleful consequences. Seventy years later, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber issued similar warnings to Europe in "Le Defi Americain" ("The American Challenge"). That these American invasions helped their victims prosper in subsequent years is not now in dispute. Yet at the time they served to distract public attention from domestic problems. Japan plays a similar role for us today. But I think there is something else going on here as well. Most of these books seek not only to explain our problems in terms of Japan's aggressiveness, but also to incite a response from the reader. These books are calls to arms. Their authors want America to join together against the perceived threat. Join together : American government, American business, American labor. Join together : wealthy Americans, poor Americans, Americans of every creed and ethnicity. In "Trading Places," Clyde Prestowitz asks rhetorically whether the American motto will be " 'every man for himself,' or 'all for one and one for all?' " and answers that " E Pluribus Unum (out of many, one) needs to be reaffirmed." William Dietrich urges us to "develop a national consensus of our own." JAMES FALLOWS, a Washington-based journalist and among the most thoughtful critics of Japan, develops the unity theme most fully in his book "More Like Us" (1989). After surveying the differences between Japanese and American society, Mr. Fallows urges us to "revive the idea that America is one coherent society, with bonds that are stronger than its internal differences. We understood this instinctively during World War II, but not often enough since then." The ostensible purpose of joining together is to meet the Japanese challenge. But I think that the real logic -- the deep message of these books, hidden perhaps even from the purveyors of the warnings -- is precisely the reverse. The purpose of having a Japanese challenge is to give us a reason to join together. That is, we seem to need Japan as we once needed the Soviet Union -- as a means of defining ourselves, our interests, our obligations to one another. We should not be surprised that this wave of Japan-as-enemy books coincides exactly with the easing of cold-war tensions. As the 21st century approaches, we can see, I believe, a profound unease about the coherence of American society reflected in these books. The global economy is tightly linking our citizens to the citizens of other nations -- with ties as strong as, if not stronger than, the economic connections binding us to one another within our borders. Talented and well-educated Americans grow wealthier as the emerging world market rewards them for their problem-solving skills. Unskilled Americans grow poorer as they are forced to compete with millions of unskilled workers from around the world who are eager to work for a small fraction of American wages. The same technologies of worldwide communication and transportation that have nourished the global economy are creating cultural linkages across borders and threatening the dominance within the United States of a single American culture. An affluent native of Brazil who lives in Miami can now read a Sao Paulo daily newspaper beamed by satellite to a computerized press a few miles away, watch Brazilian television via satellite, send and receive facsimile messages within seconds, telephone Brazil at the touch of a finger and fly home frequently to visit family and friends. Ease of worldwide transportation also means an ever larger number of illegal immigrants. And unlike the great tide of immigrants at the end of the last century, most of the people in this new wave are not European. The recent movement toward multicultural ism in American schools and colleges, and the sharp reaction to it, can be understood in the same terms: at once a sign of the nation's increasing diversity, and also a warning of the growing power of its centrifuge. At least one Presidential candidate now trudging through New Hampshire, Pat Buchanan, is sounding the nativist alarm, not heard so loud in this country since the 1930's. This is the real specter haunting these Japan books: not the specter of Japan's dominance, but of an America that no longer coheres. Japan's extreme homogeneity -- racial, cultural, linguistic -- intensifies, by contrast, our feared loss of identity. They do join together; they do seem tightly bound to one another. They know who they are. But who are we? Yet an economic war with Japan is not necessary to help us find a national self-definition. At best, such a war could function as a pretext for directing America's resources, newly freed up by the end of the cold war, toward health, nutrition and schooling (we must invest in the future generation of Americans, lest the Japanese overtake us!), and toward our infrastructure (Americans must be linked together by fiber-optic cable, so that we can meet the Japanese challenge!). But an economic war with Japan could also be as wasteful and destructive as was the cold war with the Soviet Union -- causing us to restrict Japanese trade and block Japanese investment, engage in a mounting series of economic retaliations and thus substantially diminish our standard of living and theirs. It could also ignite racism and jingoism of the ugliest sort. The central question for America in the post-Soviet world -- a diverse America, whose economy and culture are rapidly fusing with the economies and cultures of the rest of the globe -- is whether it is possible to rediscover our identity, and our mutual responsibility, without creating a new enemy. The authors under review may think not. I hope they are wrong.

271-> On My Mind; Call In the D.A.
Now we have it plain and clear: the complete denial of the Bush Administration to accusations that its policies helped strengthen Saddam Hussein before the gulf war. President Bush put forward part of his case in the last Presidential debate. He said that international investigations had found not "one single scintilla of evidence" that any U.S. technology had been involved in the creation of Iraq's nuclear capability. Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger went further. He entered this blanket defense denial in a letter to The New York Times accusing its columnists and editorials of distortion about American policy toward Iraq before the war: No use by Iraq of American grain credits to buy weapons or trade off American-subsidized commodities to third-world countries. No American weapons or other exports found in the battlefield. No U.S. technology found by international investigators that could "significantly" have helped Iraq militarily. No secrets about U.S. diplomatic policies on Iraq, no cover-up. Nothing. Good: that slams the door on hedging and defines the confrontation. Members of Congress, U.N. inspectors and journalists, including this one, have written, said and demonstrated that the U.S. was on the long list of countries that did help Saddam Hussein economically, militarily and diplomatically. So either they or President Bush and Mr. Eagleburger are fools, manufacturers of disinformation or liars. Or perhaps they suffer from severe self-delusion. Why else would Mr. Bush tell a story that could be flatly contradicted within hours by the American who headed three international nuclear inspections in Iraq? David Kay told the Center for Security Policy in Washington that U.S. equipment and nuclear technology had indeed been found as "components of Iraq's nuclear program." And on the day Mr. Eagleburger's letter appeared, the State Department denied that the U.S. had issued a license for the export of an electronic-beam welder that could be used to produce nuclear weapons. A few hours later, State said it was wrong. Was the Department blindfolding itself, which in government is even more dangerous than lying? If the Bushbaker Administration is right, we do not have to worry about loopholes in regulations supposed to protect us from arming dictatorships that are potential enemies. Forget it -- any fears that we are starting down the road to building up countries like China, Syria and Iran. But if the Bushbaker Administration is deluding itself, or lying through its teeth, we better start protecting ourselves now with tighter regulations, tougher anti-proliferation laws. And instead of who-me? bureaucratic fanny covering we need clear-cut responsibility, with public accountability -- before the next dictator moves, not after. For the sake of the future we need an official look into the past -- how the U.S. role in the Iraqi buildup worked. It has to be done by somebody trusted by the public, with a knowledge of the laundry business -- how arms, drugs and connections are washed into nice crisp money. Two jobs are critical -- the Attorney General and the special prosecutor. Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, is the obvious choice for any Administration intent on finding and tracking the truth. Mr. Morgenthau did the whole country a service by breaking open the B.C.C.I. scandal. It is a link in the chain of Middle Eastern money and politics that leads from Karachi and Riyadh to Washington to Atlanta to Rome to Baghdad, and back. If Governor Clinton is elected, the appointment of Mr. Morgenthau as Attorney General would mean immediate change -- a cleansing break with the tradition of appointing a pliable subordinate or crony to the most important law enforcement job in the country. If Mr. Clinton will not take that deep a breath of fresh air, here's a suggestion for special Iraqgate prosecutor: Robert Morgenthau. Mr. Morgenthau, in that case, would want to keep the elected job of District Attorney. But he and his top aides could be empowered as special Federal attorneys. Either way, putting Mr. Morgenthau on the job would be a fine way for a newly elected President to say thank you to the country, very fine.

274-> Art in Review
Shirley Jaffe Holly Solomon Gallery 724 Fifth Avenue (near 57th Street) Manhattan Through May 30 The American painter Shirley Jaffe left New York for Paris in 1949 and has lived there ever since. Although she was originally affiliated with the so-called New York School, her early gestural style changed over time to the kind of large, airy geometric abstractions this show comprises. Ms. Jaffe's work has been compared to that of Matisse and Stuart Davis, although neither comparison is exact. Her paintings don't possess Davis's jazzy chromatic panache. Their fresco-like colors are alert but never sharp, and they are toned down to a degree that sometimes stops just short of pastel. (She also makes wonderful use of earth colors, and one painting here consists largely of a rich chocolate brown.) Nor does Ms. Jaffe emulate Matisse's relaxed and seemingly effortless approach to technique. Apparently using small brushes, Ms. Jaffe covers every inch of her paintings with short, meticulous strokes. Mondrian worked his surfaces in a similar way, although in a far smaller space, and the effect is to lock the colored forms into the ground so that a kind of vibrant stability rather than movement is exercised. Ms. Jaffe has said she is pursuing a direction in American painting that Abstract Expressionism more or less closed off. Mondrian and Miro were crucial to these alternative routes, and in Ms. Jaffe's work one finds the spirit of some of their American followers -- Fritz Glarner in a loosened-up, antic mood, or Alice Trumbull Mason just being her marvelous self. At the same time, in its deft and pointed transformation of influences, Ms. Jaffe's work is striking for its contemporary feel. The half-organic, half-industrial forms of "Sand Wind and Stripes" and the spiky helix of "Crisscross Center" would be at home in any show of new abstraction today.

275-> ASTRONAUTS MAKE A NEW SPACE WALK AFTER RESCUE FEAT
Buoyed by their last-minute triumph in capturing an errant satellite, astronauts of the shuttle Endeavour took a fourth walk in space Thursday, staying out almost eight hours to rehearse constructing NASA's planned 350-foot space station. And as the satellite they saved on Wednesday blasted toward its correct orbit, aerospace experts praised and debated the high-stakes rescue that featured history's first satellite capture by astronauts using nothing but their gloved hands. The space walk began at 5:07 P.M. Eastern daylight time Thursday and ended at 12:53 A.M. today. Two astronauts, including America's second woman to walk in space, rehearsed building techniques for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's $30 billion space station and practiced ways that astronauts could rescue themselves should they ever become lost in space. Eighth Day of Inaugural Flight "It's another day, another E.V.A.," mission control radioed the crew Thursday morning. E.V.A. is an acronym for extra-vehicular activity, or space walk. "That's the type of game plan we like," replied the commander of Endeavour, Capt. Daniel C. Brandenstein of the Navy. It was the eighth day of Endeavour's inaugural flight, which has been extended to Saturday. Late Wednesday, three of Endeavour's astronauts stepped into space to grab the 4.5-ton, 17-foot-long communications satellite by hand, wrestle it into the payload bay and attach a rocket engine to push it from the uselessly low orbit where it had been stranded for two years. Early Thursday morning the $150 million satellite was nudged back into space. Final Leg of Journey Thursday, controllers at Intelsat's headquarters in Washington radioed a command to the Intelsat-6 communications satellite that fired its new engine at 1:25 P.M., beginning the final leg of its journey. "We saw the burn and it was really kind of neat to look at here," Captain Brandenstein told ground controllers. "It left a kind of a reddish glow around it as it took off." Endeavour was some 500 miles away at the time. At 2:51 P.M., the speeding satellite shed its depleted engine. In a few days, after complex orbital maneuvers, the craft should arrive in its correct position 22,300 miles above the Earth, where it is to relay about 120,000 telephone and television signals simultaneously. The craft is owned by the 122-nation International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. It joins an orbiting fleet of Intelsat satellites, and company officials say it will result in an increased number of circuits for international calls and eventually a lowering of costs. The latest milestone was the Endeavour astronauts' making their fourth space walk, a first in the 11-year history of shuttle missions. The record tied one set by space walkers during the Skylab-4 mission, flown from November 1973 to February 1974. Making the fourth space walk were Lieut. Col. Thomas D. Akers of the Air Force, one of three astronauts to grab the wayward satellite on Wednesday, and Dr. Kathryn C. Thornton, a physicist. Their work was delayed about 20 minutes Thursday as ground controllers analyzed an unexpected reading from Dr. Thornton's spacesuit as she emerged from the airlock into space. "Fantastic!" she exclaimed at 5:30 P.M. when she got the go-ahead from mission control to continue. Dr. Thornton continued assembling parts of a space-station truss that had been put together on Wednesday as a platform Colonel Akers as he helped pluck the Intelsat satellite from orbit. She also lifted and swung the truss to help scientists learn more about how large objects behave in weightlessness. Thursday night, Colonel Akers, firmly tethered to the shuttle at all times, tried out some ideas for crew rescue, including flying around with a hand-held gas gun. Nitrogen in his gun inflated a tube that lengthened to about 15 feet. On its end was a grapple hook that he used to latch onto nearby objects. The crew-rescue techniques are important for the station era since the shuttle would not always be available to rescue an astronaut who was drifting away from the outpost. More broadly, the mission's four space walks are considered an important trial run for the hundreds of space walks needed to assemble and repair the sprawling space station in the 1990's and the next century. The planned outpost, on which nearly $8 billion has already been spent, is to have its first parts lofted into orbit in late 1995 and its first use in 1996. Thursday, friends and critics of NASA praised and faulted Wednesday's satellite-rescue success, which nearly everyone agreed was risky and path-breaking. "We've rewritten the book on a number of things," the flight director, Al Pennington, told reporters early Thursday morning at the Johnson Space Center. Wednesday's space walk was America's longest and perhaps its most dangerous. Space is filled with threatening forces. Micrometeorites and speeding debris can smash objects and hurt or kill astronauts. Space junk the size of a marble, traveling a few miles per second, packs the explosive power of a hand grenade. Temperatures are extreme. A man-made device facing the sun can reach temperatures of 400 degrees Fahrenheit on one side, and minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit on the other. NASA officials said Thursday that the temperature of the wayward satellite, on the part facing the sun, was well within the 250-degree-Fahrenheit range of the astronauts' suits and gloves. Hamilton Standard, maker of the suits, said the gloves had five layers of material, including Kevlar, Teflon and aluminized Mylar. John Mayo, a company spokesman, said the front of the fingers are coated with silicone rubber applied in ridges to aid gripping. The suits are also extremely clumsy. Astronauts report fatigue and even bruises after space walks. The difficulty, experts say, is that the suit behaves like an inflated balloon, with its fingers, arms and legs tending to stay straight. Perhaps the biggest danger on Wednesday was the risk of a crash between the 100-ton shuttle and the 4.5-ton satellite, perhaps brought on by a false step or fatigue. Objects in space are weightless, but they have mass and can crash forcefully into one another. The astronauts were thus careful to hold the satellite steady for a long time, getting a feel for its mass and momentum, eager to avoid giving it an acceleration that would send it crashing into the winged spaceship. The astronauts held the drum-shaped satellite steady for 90 minutes, one full orbit of Earth. The last-ditch rescue success, after failures on Sunday and Monday with a balky capture bar, came as many members of Congress want to whittle away money for manned space flight and the Bush Administration has replaced NASA's leadership, viewing it as too wedded to shuttles and big, expensive projects. The space agency needed a success. Thursday, NASA's new Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, seemed to be reveling in the success, calling it "a triumph for the American people." The rescue, he told reporters in Washington, "brought the magic back to our space program." The quick improvisation that arrived at the idea of using three space-walking astronauts, he said, "demonstrated the wonderful brilliance of the human mind that was able to adapt and react and do the things that machine's just can't do." He added, "It's was just a wonderful feat." John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the rescue represented "NASA at its best and worst." The drama of the rescue, he said, "is what the public pays for -- for a heroic space program, for adventure, for people doing great things in space, things that machines can't, for personal courage in the face of danger." The worst of it, he said, included "spending $800 million to rescue a $200 million satellite, and spending all that money on elaborate planning and discovering it didn't work." Up Next: the Space Station He cautioned that the problems of this mission could be a foretaste of bigger ones with the sprawling space station. After all, he said, the same ground testing and development techniques that were used to develop the capture bar are also being used to develop the equipment that space-walking astronauts will use to assemble the space station. On the other hand, NASA officials say that the hardware troubles on this mission will prompt greater care in the future as the nation enters the space-station era. "Our planning for the space station must be precise," Mr. Goldin of NASA said, "but even the building of the space station is going to be a learning experience." NASA has twice extended Endeavour's mission, which began May 7 and was supposed to last seven days. The landing was changed from Thursday, to today, and then to Saturday, because of the satellite rescue and to give the crew time to relax before heading home. Endeavour is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

276-> 2 Big-Party Candidates Concede in Manila
The presidential nominees of two of the largest political parties in the Philippines conceded defeat today as partial returns continued to show a tight race between a pair of candidates from outside traditional politics. The battle between the front-runners -- former Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos and a former immigration chief, Miriam Defensor Santiago -- seemed unlikely to be decided for several more days because of a glacially slow vote count. Both candidates have claimed victory in the race to succeed President Corazon C. Aquino, who did not seek a second term. Unofficial, partial vote counts gave Mr. Ramos, who has Mrs. Aquino's endorsement, and Mrs. Santiago, an anti-corruption crusader, 20 percent to 25 percent of the vote each. Concessions were made by the House Speaker, Ramon Mitra, whose Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party is the nation's largest, and Vice President Salvador Laurel, the presidential nominee of the Nacionalista Party.

277-> Peru Suspends Democracy, Citing Revolt
The President of Peru has dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution, imposed censorship and arrested politicians in what he called an offensive against rebels and drug traffickers. But others said today that the crackdown amounted to a coup as troops surrounded the Congress building and took up positions around the city. "The country cannot continue to be weakened by terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption," President Alberto K. Fujimori said in announcing his decisions in a televised speech on Sunday night. "The political corruption and the infiltration have reached such a degree that it can be found in all levels and rulings of the judicial power." President Fujimori's action was condemned by President Bush and by leaders of South American nations. [ The Bush Administration suspended all aid to Peru except for humanitarian assistance. Page A16. ] Since taking office in 1990, President Fujimori has struggled with a stagnant economy and the Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla movement. He asserted in his speech that Congress and the courts had blocked his efforts to fight the drug trade, put down the guerrillas and end privileges for the political elite. Cabinet Resigns The President said that he was suspending some articles of the Constitution to allow him to form a "government of emergency and national reconstruction" and that his Cabinet would temporarily assume congressional powers. Mr. Fujimori said some political reforms would be put before voters in a plebiscite but did not say when that might occur. He summoned key members of his Cabinet today to discuss plans for new executive decrees, officials said. But Prime Minister Alfonso de los Heros announced that he and the rest of the Cabinet were resigning in what appeared to be a protest against the decrees, local radio reported. Mr. de los Heros, whose power was second to that of the President, was not told in advance of Mr. Fujimori's decrees, officials said. In a ceremony at the presidential palace tonight, Mr. Fujimori moved quickly to put a new Cabinet in place by swearing in Housing Minister Oscar Solar de la Puente Raygada as the new Prime Minister. The military Joint Chiefs of Staff had earlier issued a statement giving their "most decided suppport" to the measures announced by Mr. Fujimori. The leader of the Senate, Felipe Osterling, who has been placed under house arrest, called the decrees "totally unacceptable" and said they amounted to a coup. His view was shared by Valentin Panagua, a constitutional expert. "This is a coup d'etat carried out from Government Palace," Mr. Panagua said in a radio broadcast. The President of Argentina, Carlos Saul Menem, said he "condemned the change in constitutional order." But Mr. Fujimori said in his address that his actions were "not a negation of real democracy," but "the starting point of the search for an authentic transformation that assures a legitimate and effective democracy." Assails Judiciary System In his speech, which was unannounced, President Fujimori said Peruvians could not wait the three years it would take Congress to carry out the legislative changes he sought. The President has criticized the judiciary system as corrupt, accusing judges of releasing suspected guerrillas and drug traffickers in exchange for bribes. Peru is the world's leading producer of coca leaf, which is the raw material for cocaine. Former President Alan Garcia managed to escape from his home before troops surrounded his home and was in hiding today, said Hugo Otero, Mr. Garcia's closest adviser. Mr. Otero said security forces had detained Augustin Mantilla, a former Interior Minister; Myrta Larrauri, Mr. Garcia's secretary, and Abel Salinas, another former Interior Minister. The crackdown has also reportedly led the arrest of prominent Peruvian journalists as military troops were deployed to nearly all newspaper, television and radio offices. Only the text of the President's address was published today in the opposition La Republica newspaper, whose first two pages were blank. Troops also closed down two radio stations that had been interviewing opposition leaders. Despite the heavy presence of troops in Lima, citizens seemed to be going about their business normally. Many Peruvians condemned the measures but others, in call-in radio shows, said they supported them. President Fujimori has kept most of Peru under state-of-emergency measures since taking office to give security forces greater leeway in combating the Shining Path guerrillas.

278-> Helmsley's Last Legal Bid to Elude Prison Fails
Leona M. Helmsley's final legal move to avoid prison failed yesterday when a Federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld an order for her to surrender today to the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Ky. Underscoring her desperate attempt to remain free, her lawyer, Alan M. Dershowitz, said outside the courtroom that Mrs. Helmsley would give her hotel holdings to New York City for housing the homeless in exchange for escaping prison. She and her husband, Harry, own the New York Helmsley and the Park Lane and have interests in the other Helmsley hotels, including 51 percent of the Helmsley Palace. "She has offered to solve the city's problem of the homeless singlehandedly," Mr. Dershowitz said. But Mrs. Helmsley's spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, said later that she had not authorized such an offer and that the proposal was more of "a metaphor" used in bargaining for her freedom than a concrete proposal. 'Buy Your Way Out' Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said that the idea "was broached some time ago," but that "It didn't go anywhere, because the assumption was it was between the judge and Mrs. Helmsley." Even Mr. Dershowitz said he knew of no legal rule that would allow the appeals court to entertain such a proposal. And Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, said: "You can't buy your way out of prison. It's something the courts simply cannot accept." Mrs. Helmsley had sought a sentence of performing community service for her conviction on income-tax fraud. Mr. Dershowitz said yesterday that she "was not prepared to go to prison." But when Mrs. Helmsley was informed of the court's ruling at her residence in the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South, she said through Mr. Rubenstein, "I accept the court's judgment, and I'm prepared to abide by the law." Mr. Rubenstein said Mrs. Helmsley's husband, Harry, who was also indicted for tax fraud but was ruled incompetent to stand trial, took the news of his wife's impending imprisonment "very hard." At Least 16 Months Barring any last-minute development, like another admission to New York Hospital, where she was taken last month after losing in court, the 71-year-old self-styled hotel queen will begin her four-year sentence on the day of the Federal income tax filing deadline and two and one half years after she was found guilty. She must serve at least 16 months before becoming eligible for parole. Federal prosecutors say they expect that Mrs. Helmsley will fly in her private jetliner to Lexington and then be driven by limousine through the rolling bluegrass countryside to the front entrance of the prison, which is reserved for female inmates who require either hospitalization or medical treatment. Mr. Dershowitz, arguing yesterday before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, contended that because of what he described as Mrs. Hemlsley's deterioriating cardiovascular condition, her imprisonment amounts to a death sentence for both her and for her ailing 83-year-old husband, who Mr. Dershowitz said would die without her. Her lawyer also said Mrs. Helmsley had received death threats from a group he described as Aryan Brotherhood, a splinter group of the Ayran Nation, to be carried out after she is imprisoned. Janet Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the prison, said any threat would be investigated and "appropriate measures would be taken if necessary." Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of evading $1.7 million in Federal income taxes. Both she and her husband were indicted on charges that they purchased furnishings and decorations for their Greenwich, Conn., home and for their Park Lane residence and fraudulently deducted them as business expenses for the Helmsley hotel chain.

279-> PRO BASKETBALL; It's Their Day Off, But Nets Win Again
Mookie Blaylock and the rest of the Nets have a good thing going. Blaylock was named the National Basketball Association's Player of the Week yesterday after leading the Nets to victories in their last four games. The 6-foot-1-inch point guard averaged 19 points, 10.5 assists and 3.5 steals in that four-game stretch while shooting 54 percent from the field. Meanwhile, the Nets (35-39) have improved their chances of making the playoffs for the first time since 1986. If the season ended today, New Jersey would qualify for the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs and face the Knicks in the first round. "I like our chances of making the playoffs, but we have to finish out the season playing the same as we've been playing," said Willis Reed, the Nets' general manager. "As for Mookie, he has probably benefited from Kenny Anderson's presence more than anyone this season. He knew he'd have to earn his playing time. That kind of competition is good. Mookie's quiet, but we always knew he was a competitor. And he has really shown that this year." Of the seven teams fighting for the last three Eastern Conference playoff spots, the Nets' chances look as good as anyone's. New Jersey has eight games left, four at home and four away. But only one of the games is against a team that is above .500 (Cleveland). The Nets are hosts to Atlanta on tonight, which is a crucial game for both teams. Atlanta currently holds down the eighth playoff spot, one-half game behind the Nets. The Hawks and Nets have split their first two games this season, and they play again on Saturday. In the Nets' 128-120 victory over Indiana on Sunday, Drazen Petrovic poured in 38 points, Blaylock had 21 points and 14 assists and Derrick Coleman had 22 points and 10 rebounds.

280-> What's So Funny? Ask The Young
EVEN in the schoolyard, the adult world of the White House is a favorite target of ridicule, with the Vice President the butt of many jokes. "Like Dan Quayle said, 'The mind is a terrible thing not to have,' " said 11-year-old Clarissa Wolf of Public School 9 on West 84th Street in Manhattan. She paused for effect. "He should know!" Although knock-knock jokes, chicken-crossing-the-road jokes and elephant jokes are perennial favorites, more and more children seem to be getting their punch lines from the news, bringing a new sophistication and sometimes a cynical edge to their humor. "Kids today are so sophisticated, much more than I was as a kid," said Jim Davis, creator of Garfield, the comic-strip cat. "They don't need jokes explained to them. What makes me laugh makes kids laugh." Child psychologists say the things children find funny reveal a great deal about their level of development and what is on their minds, whether it is something heard on television or around the dinner table. "If they make jokes about authority, it tells us something about what they're thinking," said Dr. Rebecca Edder, a developmental psychologist who is an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis. "To the extent they're making jokes about Dan Quayle and not Gorbachev says something about their attitude and how they view those two figures. Gorbachev may be seen to be more serious or sympathetic." So if, as the experts suggests, jokes are a window to children's thoughts, what's on their minds? Politics, school, eating, parents, dating, friends and sex. But parents will be pleased to know that sex takes a back seat to current events. Informal child-on-the-playground interviews at three New York City elementary schools uncovered these insights: Wayne and Garth, the wacky characters in "Wayne's World," are seen as "really funny," "kind of funny" or "not funny at all." A joke is just a joke, so one should not be offended if one is the butt of a joke. Garfield the cat is funny because he's cool, lazy, fat and eats a lot. And knock-knock jokes are for "kids," or so say the 11-and-older set. "What do you call a bunch of bunnies in a line moving backward?" Bruna Babic, 11, asked a visitor to Public School 144, the Jeromus Remsen school, in Forest Hills, Queens. "I don't know," the visitor said. "A receding hare line. Now that their children's humor has become more worldly, many adults are proudly passing the jokes on to co-workers and neighbors. At social gatherings, parents have been known to egg on children: "Honey, tell everybody that wonderful joke you know about . . ." Alex Korman, 9, who attends the Dalton School on East 89th Street in Manhattan, responds on cue. "There's a new movie out I want to see," he said. "It's called: 'Boys in the Hood: The David Duke Story.' " Not to be outdone, his friend Jake Steinberg, also 9, told this one: "During the New York primary, this little girl asks her father who he's going to vote for, Mickey or Goofy. Her dad says Mickey. When he comes out of the voting booth, the girl asks, 'So did you vote for Mickey?' Her dad said, 'No, I voted for Goofy, but his name was spelled C-L-I-N-T-O-N.' " One winning entry in a children's joke contest sponsored by Ballantine Books also used a political figure as a target. As Lauren Castroll, 11, of Bridgewater, N.J., told it: "Pablo Picasso dies and goes to Heaven, and God says: 'To get into Heaven, you must prove to me you are who you say you are.' So Picasso draws a picture, and God lets him in. Next Martin Luther King Jr. dies, and God says, 'Prove that you are Dr. King.' So he makes a long speech about civil rights, and God lets him in. Then Dan Quayle dies, and God says: 'Prove you're Dan Quayle.' Mr. Quayle asks why, and God says: 'Because Pablo Picasso and Martin Luther King had to.' And Dan Quayle says, 'Who are they?' And God lets him in." While funny children have always been a staple of the entertainment industry, the impish pranks of a top star like Shirley Temple often made adults smile affectionately. More recently, 11-year-old Macaulay Culkin achieved fame by using his smarts to cause pain to inept adults in "Home Alone," and the cartoon fourth grader Bart Simpson has earned rebukes from politicians with his underachiever cool. In November, Macaulay even crossed into late-night television as a guest host on "Saturday Night Live." (How many children stayed up late that night? The show's ratings that night were about the same as usual, NBC said.) With these examples, it seems only natural that almost every child fancies himself or herself a real comedian. Dina Dominguez, 8, of P.S. 144, said she really doesn't know any jokes; she does routines. Without missing a beat, she said: "I just broke up with my boyfriend. I got tired of him sitting around the house all day playing Nintendo on my television set. I finally told him: 'Hey, it's either me or the Mario Brothers.' He'd sit there all day playing Nintendo and complaining about being hungry. I asked him, 'What do you want me to do, fix you lasagna in my Easy Bake Oven?" Sydell Kane, principal at P.S. 144, said she is constantly surprised at the caliber of jokes children tell today and how well they're able to tell them. "For many of these kids, English is a second language," Mrs. Kane said, adding that the children at her school represent 31 native languages. "To be able to master the nuances of humor and to be conversant with the humor shows a command of the language that is very good. It's a part of their Americanization." But some grown-ups lament the steady maturation of children's humor as a kind of end of innocence. "They're exposed to so much so much sooner in life, which in a way is sad because they have to grow up quicker and become cooler and more sophisticated quicker," said Mike Thaler, an author known as America's Riddle King. Mr. Thaler, who visits schools around the country, said he teaches the art of riddles to "bring out the child in children." "Riddles are silly," Mr. Thaler said, "and once the kids get into the riddle-making process, it brings out their playfulness. And the giggles come out."

281-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The President; Bush Uses Fishing Demonstration To Speak About Urban Problems
President Bush ventured into Southeast Washington today to the fringes of a poor neighborhood to plant a tree, cast a fishing line with schoolchildren and express concern for the urban agonies that exploded in Los Angeles two weeks ago. It was the fourth time in a week that Mr. Bush had toured troubled urban areas, starting in Los Angeles on May 7 and moving to Philadelphia on Monday, Baltimore on Wednesday and just a few miles from the White House today to an area known as Anacostia. At each stop, events have grown more disjointed, with odd juxtapositions of symbolism that seem to reflect the uncertainty in the White House as Mr. Bush tries to come to grips with the aftermath of the unrest in Los Angeles. Addressing Urban Distress Mr. Bush, who included an announcement of $600 million in housing and business loans to Los Angeles in a speech on health care on Wednesday, was originally supposed to have appeared today at a fishing demonstration to make a few casts and talk about the importance of sun and fresh air. But the White House is aware that the violence in Los Angeles has forced the issue of urban distress to the top of its agenda. So as he swatted away a bumblebee with a muttered "whoops-a-daisy, look at this gigantic thing," Mr. Bush found himself sliding from his Great Outdoors Speech into his Los Angeles Riots speech. "The outdoors is a perfect playground for the entire family, and this country's greatest natural resource," he said. "This summer can also be a time for lots of families, for whole communities to come together. We all saw what happened out there in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago, a community that was divided and torn apart, and then turning on itself in despair." 'Stop Making Speeches' For some in the audience, the segue seemed awkward at best. "Now, that's a stretch," said Dianne Slaughter, who brought a group of third and fourth graders from Stevens Elementary School to hear the President. A few hundred yards down the river, Kenneth Clark, a resident of Anacostia, an isolated section of Washington with pockets of poverty, dropped a line for catfish and said: "It doesn't mean a thing to me that he's here. If he really wants to hear us, he should stop making speeches and come to my neighborhood. We won't hurt him. We just want the man to get out and really hear the public." Mr. Bush's expedition today was a mixture of his gangly informality, the symbols of his power and his evident desire to keep hammering home the point that he is engaged on domestic issues and cares about the poor. While sharpshooters in bullet-proof vests stood on the roof of a park pavilion, Mr. Bush stood in a gray business suit trying to cast a lead weight into a cardboard target. His first cast landed a tree. The next two dozen or so did not come close, even though Mr. Bush, who considers himself an accomplished angler, tried three rods and cast overhand, underhand and sidearm. Later, the schoolchildren fidgeted and yawned, but Mr. Bush seemed bent on making his points. "We've got to come together," he said. "We've got to rebuild the hearts of our nation's cities and we've got to renew that spirit of community." He added: "So I am just delighted to be here, very appreciative, once again, of the volunteers, those who live by that feeling: one American must help another, hold out the helping hand to another. And the volunteers do it, and the result of that is cleaner and better parks, more and more hope and opportunity for young people."

282-> The Breakfasts of Asia: The Food of Long Ago Is This Morning's Feast
WHEN an Asian wakes up in the morning and wants to eat the breakfast of his dreams (and of his ancestors), it's usually not bacon and eggs. A Chinese reaches for a bowl of porridge of soybeans or rice, a Japanese sips miso-thickened broth and a Korean might eat beef dumplings in broth. On the side are little dishes of pickled cabbage, lettuce and radish. Breakfast, washed down by tea, is savory, not sweet; seldom greasy, and to an Asian palate tasty. It is a meal thousands of years old. But to the Western palate, an Asian breakfast is an acquired taste. After 24 years of marriage, Stuart Bloch, a lawyer in Washington, is still astonished by what his Chinese-born wife, Julia Chang Bloch, has for breakfast. Watching Mrs. Bloch, the American Ambassador to Nepal, eat Chinese rice soup with pickled lettuce and slivers of dried pork, he said, "I wouldn't touch that stuff with a 10-foot pole." But by noon, he was ready for Chinese food. Theodore Bestor, an associate professor of anthropology at Columbia University and a specialist in Japanese culture, said: "It's a personal observation, but people's food preferences are the least flexible parts of their culture. People will experiment with dress and child rearing, but with food, when they haven't woken up yet, they want something familiar." In Manhattan, at the Essex House Hotel Nikko, Japanese guests order a foreign -- Western, that is -- breakfast on the first morning of their visit, said Kazunobi Takita, the assistant general manager. "Then on the second day their ethnicity comes out, and they order a Japanese breakfast," he said. "They must talk to the rice. They cannot talk to the bread." In Manhattan, a traditional Japanese breakfast is also served at the Plaza, Hilton, Marriott Marquis and Rihga Royal hotels, as well as at Menchanko-Tei, a restaurant. What Japanese eat in restaurants and in their homes, whether in New Rochelle, N.Y., or in Tokyo, is what their ancestors ate at least as far back as the seventh century, said Elizabeth Andoh, an anthropologist and cookbook author whose books include "An Ocean of Flavor: The Japanese Way With Fish and Seafood" (Morrow, 1988). The typical breakfast, she said, is soup, rice and pickles. "Anything you have in addition, like grilled fish, relates to circumstance -- wealth or geography -- rather than an era," Ms. Andoh said. The soup is usually miso based, and may include cubes of soft bean curd, slivered seaweed and scallions. The pickles include white radish, cucumber, cabbage, seaweed and carrots. Beyond those basics, Essex House also serves grilled salmon; a dumpling filled with minced carrots, seaweed and fish cake, and side dishes of Japanese omelet, seaweed flavored with sesame oil, and julienne strips of burdock and carrot. At Menchanko-Tei, the basic dishes are augmented with grilled mackerel and fresh bean curd topped with shaved bonito flakes and sprinkled with soy sauce. On the side is a tiny packet of five slices of seaweed to wrap around rice and pickles. China has two traditional breakfasts, northern and southern, dictated by local agriculture. The breakfast of northern China, where soybeans and wheat grow, is eaten in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan and, authenticity intact, in Flushing, Queens. On a recent Sunday morning, Chinese families were lined up at the People's People Restaurant in Flushing to eat a northern Chinese breakfast, served Tuesday through Sunday. The restaurant, which seats 90, was packed. Most of the patrons were from Taiwan; it was for them that Chung King, the owner, opened the restaurant in November. Until he opened his restaurant, Mr. King said, "they ate Western breakfasts, fried a couple of eggs, or ate dim sum." (Dim sum is southern Chinese steamed, boiled and fried dumplings and buns.) But what they really wanted, Mr. King said, was soy-milk soup. And so each day his chef makes 100 gallons of it. The bowls of soy-milk soup being served at People's People had flecks of white soybean curds drifting in a broth whose surface was dappled with floating droplets of hot chili oil. An assortment of fried and baked breads was served alongside. What looked like a bread-and-bread sandwich was a deep-fried nonsweet cruller tucked in a toasted envelope of bread sprinkled with sesame seeds. The crisp sesame bread was flaky, while the cruller was soft, airy and faintly chewy inside and crisp outside. It is best piping hot. There was su bing, flaky buns filled with slivered cooked white radish, or with scallions lightly sauteed in lard. A fried bun contained chives and scrambled eggs; other buns had minced pork and cabbage. The food, Mr. King said, can be made at home, but making it is time consuming. Peter Kwong, the author of "The New Chinatowns" (Hill & Wang, 1987), said that "in China, you dash out, and stop at shops, and eat it on the way to work." The southern Chinese counterpart of soy-milk soup is congee or jook, a soup made by cooking rice for two hours, until the grains amalgamate into the broth. Because rice is scarce in the north, the soup there is served thin, but in the south, where rice is plentiful, the jook is thick. Jook is to the southern Chinese as chicken broth is to Jews. "Jook is truly ancient, and dates at least to 171 B.C.," said Bruce Cost, the chef and owner of the Monsoon restaurant in San Francisco, and the author of "Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients" (Morrow, 1988). He added this somewhat bland soup, sometimes cooked with chicken broth, is a medium in which the Chinese boil bits of beef, chicken and pork balls. Some people eat the jook by itself; some with side dishes of peanuts, pickled lettuce or slivered ginger. "What's great is that even in one simple little meal, you get different little taste sensations," said Nina Simonds, the author of "China's Food" (HarperCollins 1991). Although dim sum is part of a southern Chinese breakfast, the starting point is jook, served at tea parlors from huge cauldrons on rolling carts. It is made plain, but diners add to it tiny balls of fish, pork or beef; slivers of beef or chicken, or sliced preserved duck egg. Condiments to sprinkle on top include flakes of dried preserved pork, pickled lettuce, pickled cucumber and finely slivered scallions and ginger. By 11 A.M. the jook is usually sold out, confirming its place as a breakfast food. In Manhattan, devotees of jook can be found at the two Big Wong restaurants in Chinatown, where people line up five deep at the takeout counters, shouting out their orders. The jook is offered with preserved duck egg as well as pork, chicken and beef balls. Long twists of fried dough are eaten with the jook, either cut up and dropped into the bowl, or on the side. Although the Chinese and Japanese have special breakfast food, Koreans do not. "We eat the same food for breakfast, lunch and dinner," said Young Choe, the manager of Woo Chon Restaurant in Manhattan, which is open 24 hours a day. What makes Korean meals special is not the foods, but the ritual, where family hierarchy prevails. "The eldest person takes the first dish," Mr. Choe said, "and then it's passed." The meal can be as simple as a bowl of steamed rice, a side dish of pickles and a bowl of beef broth. Or it can be more elaborate, with dumplings floating in the broth, and many little dishes of pickled vegetables. "If you have breakfast in a Korean inn, you get the rice, the soup, a bit of fish, often grilled, and as many side dishes as people have the imagination to give you," said Laurel Kendall, the associate curator of Asian ethnographic collections at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. In Korean kim chi, or pickles, she said, "there are pickled cabbage and, in the summer, pickled cucumbers, little red beans preserved in sugar and soy, and pickled bean sprouts." Not to mention radish, bell flower, carrots and seaweed. Then there are the soups, which come with beef or pheasant dumplings, beef ribs, crab, clams or fish. But when Mr. Choe eats a Korean breakfast, he eats an austere dish, seol rong tang, a beef broth with thin wheat noodles and rice. Why? "It is very gentle and soothing," he said. TO FACE THE RISING SUN THESE are some restaurants and hotels that serve Japanese, Chinese and Korean breakfasts in New York. Chinese BIG WONG, 67 Mott Street (Bayard Street), (212) 964-0540, and 157 Mott Street (Grand Street), (212) 966-6808. These restaurants offer takeout containers of excellent rice congee, or jook. It can be ordered seven different ways, with things like pork balls, fish balls, beef, chicken or preserved duck egg, for $2.25 to $2.85 a quart. Fried crullers of unsweetened dough, 70 cents each, can be dipped into the congee. MANDARIN COURT, 61 Mott Street (Bayard Street); (212) 608-3838.

283-> Sovereign South Draws Little Interest in Survey
One in 12 adult Southerners say their region would be better off as a separate nation if it could be done without war, according to a new university poll released today. The University of North Carolina said its Southern Focus Poll, conducted in telephone interviews with 819 adults in 13 Southern states, also found that one in six polled agreed with the notion that their region would be better off today if the South had won the Civil War. The poll found 8 percent of Southern adults surveyed agreed with the idea that "if it could be done without war, the South would be better off as a separate country today." Five percent were uncertain and 87 percent disagreed.

284-> SPORTS PEOPLE: TRACK AND FIELD; Reynold Says He'll Run
BUTCH REYNOLDS said he would defy an international ban and compete in the Bruce Jenner Classic at San Jose, Calif., today. "I'm running, and I'm going to run fast," Reynolds said. The international governing body for track and field had warned Reynolds, the world record-holder at 400 meters and the 1988 Olympic silver medalist, not to run at San Jose for fear of "contaminating" other competitors in the meet. At the same time, the United States governing body, The Athletics Congress, said it would support Reynolds's right to run under a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by an Ohio court. Reynolds was suspended in November 1990 after testing positive for anabolic steroids. The International Amateur Athletic Federation said it still considered Reynolds suspended, and any athlete who competes against him also faces suspension. (AP)

285-> Young Bear, Picked On, Heads for Paramus Mall
It was not a hallucination. A young black bear today popped up in this mecca of malls and busy highways. And the chase was on -- as the chases are in New Jersey almost every spring when bears' age-old territorial instincts collide with man's need to put up buildings on any available land. The bear, probably a befuddled yearling, wandered across some yards, the campus of Bergen Community College and a golf course fairway. It then took shelter from about eight police cars, the state's two-man bear-response team, and a small horde of onlookers in the best, and only, patch of woods around. "Compared to where he should be, this is an urban center," said Bob Eriksen, a state wildlife biologist dispatched with Rich Goszka about 8 A.M. to tranquilize the bear and take it to normal bear habitat in the mountains of Sussex County, at the northwestern tip of New Jersey. Since the mid-80's, more and more black bears have wandered each May, June and July into the spreading outer edges of suburbia in northern New Jersey. But few have been spotted this far east. And certainly none has poked this close to the whiz of traffic at Routes 4 and 17, the busiest crossroads in Bergen County. Outwitting a Stakeout The object of today's bear hunt was last seen in late morning, darting across a bicycle path and into trees in Saddle River County Park off Grove Street, about a mile from the Paramus Park Mall, two miles north of the Garden State Plaza and about 10 miles west of the George Washington Bridge and Manhattan. Mr. Eriksen and Mr. Goszka waited by their pickup outside the thick woods at the northern end of Saddle River Park for the bear to re-emerge. It never did, and they left, empty- handed, just before 1 o'clock. "Bears are nocturnal," Mr. Eriksen said. "He's probably got a shady spot and will wait for darkness before moving again. If we went in looking for him, he could run circles around us." Based on his experience chasing wayward bears around north Jersey, Mr. Eriksen said this one was probably less than 2 years old, weighed about 150 pounds and had been forsaken by its mother and chased away by a territorially dominant male. Residents need not fear, he said. "Black bears are shy and they don't look at human beings as potential food." Nonetheless, he said, people should not approach, annoy or feed them. He said New Jersey's bear population had "more than doubled and probably tripled" to about 300 in the last decade. Where the bear came from was anybody's guess. Mr. Eriksen thought it was the same one he and Mr. Goszka had tried to tranquilize behind a chemical company on Wednesday in Haledon, about seven miles southwest of Paramus. Police Chief Joseph Delaney figured it had wandered down the Saddle River from New York State. Stranger in Her Backyard Once breeding season ends and older males become friendly again, the bear will probably head west, Mr. Eriksen said. Male black bears need at least 10,000 acres of woodland for normal range and this one was hiding in about 100 acres, he said. Florence Bauknecht spotted the animal in her backyard on Midland Avenue about 6:30 A.M., moments after walking her dog. "I never dreamed I'd see a bear like that here," she said. "He was huge -- big legs, furry. He was loping along the lawn. He was beautiful the way he loped along." Police Officer Andrew Rizzo responded to her call and spotted the bear sitting in the yard of a former town councilman, Joseph Coniglio. From his patrol car, Officer Rizzo watched it wander across a few yards and then climb a six-foot cyclone fence. "I swear to God," Officer Rizzo said. "I couldn't believe he was climbing that fence."

287-> Bids Opened For Altering Of Shoreham
The Long Island Power Authority received bids today from three consortiums to convert the Shoreham nuclear power plant to a natural-gas-fired plant by the mid-1990's. Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the authority, said, "The fact that the consortiums consist of well-respected energy firms from all over the country shows that the state was prudent in reaching out to determine if there was an alternative use for the plant. "And if we can show that converting Shoreham will allow us to be economically competitive, it will also allow us to move ahead and reduce our dependence on foreign oil," he said, adding that the agency hoped to make a decision this year on whether to convert the plant and if so, which of the bids to accept. A month ago, the two-year process of decommissioning began. Expected to cost $186 million, it involves the partial dismantling and removal of radioactive parts from the $5.5 billion plant, which is on the North Shore about 55 miles east of Manhattan. If feasible, Mr. Kessel would like to convert Shoreham to a natural-gas plant and help make Long Island less dependent on the imported oil that fuels Lilco's generators. Three Bids The first bid opened, for $274 million, came from a group made up of the New York Power Authority, United Engineers and Constructors Incorporated of Philadelphia, the Enron Power Development Corporation of Houston and Siemens Power Ventures Inc. of Manhattan. The second bid, for $347 million, was submitted by the Phoenix Shoreham Repowering Partnership of Brooklyn, consisting of Gas Energy Incorporated, a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, and Union Energy Incorporated of Toronto, Ontario. The third bid was submitted by the Peconic Energy Venture of Holtsville, L.I., a consortium of subsidiaries of the Bechtel Group Incorporated of San Francisco, the CMS Energy Corporation of Dearborn, Mich., the General Electric Company of Schenectady. N.Y., and the Panhandle Eastern Corporation of Houston. It included three options, priced at $346 million, $343 million and $218 million. Each bidder also offered to complete the conversion, operate the plant, supply the natural gas and sell the electricity to Lilco.

289-> SIDELINES: BELMONT STAKES; Uptown Girl Cuts Loose
She wore a designer home-on-the-range outfit: floor-length trail coat, chaps, a broad-brimmed hat. But CHRISTIE BRINKLEY came to Belmont Park to work yesterday, giving an exhibition aboard her cutting horse. There were many such events around Belmont Stakes week, dubbed Horsefair '92. This was serious business for the model, who performed in a mini-stadium erected near the paddock. Last year, she won the celebrity cutting-horse national title in Texas, defeating such other personalities as MARILYN QUAYLE and TANYA TUCKER. Brinkley's husband, singer BILLY JOEL, watched yesterday and said he prefers "just old-fashioned Western riding." Some years ago, explained Brinkley, an accomplished rider, "I was asked to help out on a ranch on Long Island and cut some cattle." It is a skill that dates from the post-Civil War cattle drives, when horse and rider moved groups of animals by using "cutting" movements. "I said if I'm going to help out, then I need a Western horse," Brinkley said. "I watched the competition on TV and I thought it was wild. I bought the learn-to-cut video and learned something about it. Now my dilemma is finding cattle on Long Island." And what about her national title? Was the competition tough? "Mrs. Quayle didn't have a lot of cow sense," said Brinkley.

290-> Tighter Bank Rules Sought
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, under orders from Congress, proposed sweeping rules today to curb the activities of weak banks or shut them down. The F.D.I.C. voted unanimously to seek public comment on the stiff rules, which are supposed to take effect by year's end to meet the terms of the 1991 Bank Safety Act. Seventy-nine banks with $27 billion assets in March were listed as critically weak and would face being closed under the proposed rule unless they could strengthen their capital within three months, F.D.I.C. staff members said. But the majority of banks would face no problems meeting the new standards. The bank regulatory agency also proposed new limits on real estate lending, capping for the first time banks' exposure on each loan. Congress last fall required these tough rules as part of a sweeping overhaul of bank regulation intended to prevent a financial disaster on the scale of the savings and loan debacle. Under the F.D.I.C.'s proposals, the weakest banks could be closed if they failed to strengthen their finances in 90 days. Other restrictions could limit pay and bonuses, force the election of new directors and the sale of units, limit dividends and asset growth and impose curbs on activities.

291-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record; Perot in Navy: Dynamic and Popular
Within days after they arrived at the United States Naval Academy in the summer of 1949, plebe classmates recall, a pint-size kid from East Texas started to sweep them up in an organizational tornado. First as coxswain of a winning whaleboat crew, later as head of the honor committee and then as class president, Ross Perot, his classmates say, displayed the same hard-charging attitude that has propelled him to the top of Presidential public-opinion polls. "Perot was the smallest one in the boat as the coxswain, but we won every race with him yelping at us," said Frank Adorney, a classmate who served 21 years as a Navy pilot and is now a volunteer for the Perot campaign in Annapolis, Md. He was "a very energetic guy," recalled another classmate, Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, a former chief of naval operations who had to settle for class vice president at the time. His classmates, as well as Mr. Perot's shipmates aboard the destroyer Sigourney, where he served for two years after graduation, recalled him as a disciplined straight-arrow young officer. But they said that his fast-track spirit bridled at the rigid promotion hierarchy and that his enthusiasm for the Navy seemed to sour after he clashed with a commander he considered too loose with the rules. No Record of Rules The young officer's unsuccessful efforts nearly 40 years ago to have his service obligation shortened to two years instead of four, which were recently found in the files of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Tex., have focused attention on Mr. Perot the candidate. Midshipmen agree to the obligation in return for their appointments and free four-year educations. Mr. Perot has said he thought that the obligation was two years when he entered Annapolis and that it changed to four years by the time he graduated. The Navy said it could not determine the obligation for incoming midshipmen in 1949, and classmates' memories vary. Critics contend that Mr. Perot's efforts to obtain an early discharge, spearheaded by his father's petitioning a congressman from Texas, suggest the use of improper political influence and raise doubts about his character. And some have challenged Mr. Perot's contention that he sought the discharge because a former commander had asked him to violate Navy rules. Mr. Perot's supporters deny wrongdoing or improper motivations, and they view the action as an example of how he deals with situations that he finds intolerable. Determining the truth of the matter is difficult. Some records cannot be found, memories have faded and important figures have died. Officials of Mr. Perot's undeclared campaign did not return calls. In an interview on C-Span last month about the different accounts of the end of his Navy career, Mr. Perot said: "I am sick and tired of having everybody want to know what my positions are. It's not for the people. This is for the media who apparently can't breathe without it." But the interviews with former classmates and shipmates offer glimpses into Mr. Perot's life during and shortly after the Korean War. It was a time when "everyone was focused on military life," said Josh Morriss Jr., a Naval Academy graduate and neighbor of Ross in his hometown of Texarkana, Tex. It was Mr. Morriss who inspired Mr. Perot to apply to the academy. By all accounts, young Mr. Perot thrived in the spit-and-polish life. By his senior year Mr. Perot was a battalion commander, the third-ranking leader of midshipmen. He graduated 453d in a class of 925, and in his senior yearbook his classmates wrote, "What Ross lacked in physical size, he more than adequately replaced by his capacity to make friends and influence people." Which is exactly what the newly minted ensign did in 1953 on his first ship, the Sigourney. The by-the-book commander, Capt. Bernard Lienhard, was quickly impressed with Mr. Perot and named him chief engineer, a position usually reserved for more seasoned junior officers. Popular with the crew and his superiors, Mr. Perot enjoyed shining fitness reports. "In short order at inspections Perot's group always made top or near top of the presentations," said Glenn C. Stock, a retired Navy captain who was second in command. Firing From the Bridge Shipmates recall that Mr. Perot's comportment never wavered, not even during rowdy shore leaves. "Perot was the permanent Shore Patrol," said Richard H. Madden, a stockbroker in San Francisco who was a seaman on the Sigourney. "He didn't drink, didn't swear and didn't mess around with women." But the ideal Navy life changed abruptly in late 1954, when Captain Lienhard was transferred and replaced by Comdr. Gerald J. Scott. Crew members say his style was more relaxed than Captain Lienhard's. An enlisted sailor on the Sigourney, Blaine Irvin, said Commander Scott would entertain the crew by firing his .45-caliber gun from the bridge at empty cans tossed over the bow. Another sailor, Michael Conti, recalled that Commander Scott formed an "anchor pool" in which crew members bet $5 on the ship's next mooring time. The money went into the ship's recreation fund, and the winner received 10 extra days of shore leave, Mr. Conti said. Neither activity broke any rules, but sailors who served under both captains said Captain Lienhard would not have condoned wagering or an impromptu marksmanship display, attitudes that Mr. Perot quite likely shared. Navy records are not clear about what incident pushed Mr. Perot to seek the early discharge. But clearly he and his new skipper did not see eye to eye. Denial by Commander Without specifically naming Commander Scott, Mr. Perot said in a recent interview in Newsweek that he clashed with the commander of the Sigourney when Mr. Perot was ordered to divert the recreational fund for the commander's personal use. "I was in charge of the crew's recreation fund," Mr. Perot told Newsweek. "He ordered me to give him part of that money to redo his cabin. I wouldn't do it. I was also in charge of narcotics and liquor. If we were at sea any length of time, he wanted liquor." In a telephone interview from his home in Sunnyvale, Calif., Commander Scott called the accusations "hogwash." "I have no specific recollection of him or any other specific junior officer," he said. "That was 37 years ago." In April 1955, Mr. Perot, by then a lieutenant (j.g.), officially requested an end to his service obligation. In a letter to his father he wrote, "I have found the Navy to be a fairly Godless organization." "I do not enjoy the prospect" of "being subjected to drunken tales of moral emptiness, passing out penicillin pills and seeing promiscuity on the part of married men," he wrote. Mr. Perot's father wrote to Representative Wright Patman and Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, both Texas Democrats, for help. The Navy ultimately rejected Mr. Perot's request, and he completed his four years. In October 1955, Lieutenant Perot was assigned to the carrier Leyte. One duty was to escort prominent visitors, one of whom was an executive from International Business Machines, who suggested that Lieutenant Perot interview for a job when he completed his service. Lieutenant Perot left the Navy in June 1957. Navy records show that he served in the Naval Reserve until 1961. In an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1971, Mr. Perot said: "I loved the Navy, loved the sea, loved ships. But I always find that whatever I'm doing, I'm thoroughly involved in it. In the Navy, the promotion system and the seniority system and the waiting-in-line concept were just sort of incompatible with my desire to be measured and judged by what I could produce."

292-> Pope's Stitches Are Removed
Doctors today removed Pope John Paul II's stitches from his intestinal surgery and said he would be leaving the hospital in a few days. "Little by little, he's getting better," said Dr. Corrado Manni, the anesthesiologist on the surgical team that removed a benign colon tumor eight days ago. Dr. Manni said the Pope, who is 72 years old, would like to give his noontime blessing in St. Peter's Square on Sunday but that doctors preferred that he remain in Gemelli Hospital until early next week.

293-> Market Place; Newspapers Start To Rebuild Profits
SECOND-QUARTER earnings reports from newspaper companies paint a picture that seems so rosy as to be hot pink. For instance, the Gannett Company's earnings per share increased 13 percent; net income at The Washington Post Company was up 35 percent; Knight-Ridder Inc. reported an 11 percent increase in earnings; net income at The New York Times Company jumped to $15.2 million from $5.4 million, and Dow Jones & Company said net income for the quarter rose 25 percent. But while such solid increases may suggest a return to the fat and happy newspaper profits of the mid-1980's, they actually reflect a toughened industry able to wring profits out of a business environment that is still flat. In most cases, the profit increases come from significantly reduced newsprint costs, bare-bones cost controls and advertising rate increases. For many newspaper companies, advertising volume -- the key indicator of the industry's fiscal health -- actually decreased for the quarter compared with a year earlier. And the quarter's profit gains, though certainly welcome, represent only a first step in recovering ground lost during the last several years. "The best way to show strong earnings growth is to climb out of a deep hole," said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. "We're trying to get back to 1990's earnings levels, for God's sake, and 1990 wasn't a great year." Indeed, in advertising linage, many papers would be pleased to get back to 1991's weak level. Advertising at The Washington Post fell 3.8 percent for the quarter, compared with a year earlier. Advertising for The New York Times declined 2.4 percent, and total linage for the Gannett chain declined 1 percent, though USA Today's linage increased 3 percent. Analysts said display advertising, like that from department stores, continued to be depressed, reflecting the slow economic recovery. In most areas, help-wanted classified advertising has also showed little improvement, because hiring usually lags behind any recovery, as companies generally prefer to pay overtime until they are certain a recovery is under way. Among the few bright spots has been automotive advertising, because the American passion for new cars is usually one of the first cravings to be satisfied when consumers have money to spend. In some areas, a second passion -- home buying -- has led to more vigorous real estate advertising, particularly in the Midwest and South. But in general, newspapers have raised advertising revenues through rate increases, a move that probably demonstrates the essential strength of the industry better than anything else. For two decades, most newspapers raised their advertising rates every year, generally by a percentage higher than the rate of inflation, and advertisers were willing to pay the price because newspapers were regarded as the best way to reach a community's consumers. In the last couple of years, newspapers have become more timid about raising rates for fear that advertisers would defect to other media, like direct mail and cable television, or significantly reduce the newspaper advertising they would buy. This year, newspapers have generally gone back to raising their rates somewhat more than the inflation rate. And though this has hurt advertising volume, overall advertising revenues are generally higher. Kevin R. Gruneich, an analyst of newspaper stocks at the First Boston Corporation, said newspapers generally increased rates by 4 to 5 percent this year. He noted that the inflation rate was expected to be about 3 percent. "Newspapers are still dominant as to local print media, and there is still no better place to put help-wanted ads or an ad for a sale at a big retailer," Mr. Gruneich said. Should the economy improve, increased advertising volume would probably follow, and the new advertising would be purchased at the higher rate. But such a potential windfall would be offset somewhat by higher newsprint costs, as more paper would be needed to print the ads and as increased demand would undoubtedly prompt newsprint companies to increase their very depressed prices. Mr. Gruneich estimates that newsprint is selling at a discount of about 40 percent from the list price of $685 per metric ton. Newsprint companies had announced that they would raise rates Aug. 1 by about $35 a ton, but such an increase now seems unlikely. Labor negotiations this summer at the newsprint mills in British Columbia had been expected to reduce the oversupply of newsprint, creating a chance for newsprint companies in the United States to make a price increase stick. But the negotiations were concluded earlier this month and the prospects of a shortfall have declined. This means that any increase in newsprint costs will probably be driven by increased demand, which in turn will be prompted by more advertising. And if advertising increases, newspapers will be delighted to pay for the added newsprint. Newspaper stock prices, which moved sharply higher earlier this year, have since leveled off. Yesterday, Gannett was up 12.5 cents, to $46.25; The Washington Post Company was up $1, to $220.50; Knight-Ridder was unchanged at $60.875; The New York Times Company was up 37.5 cents, to $28, and Dow Jones was up 50 cents, to $33.

294-> Review/Music; American Opera Finds a Home at the Nightclub
"Casino Paradise" at the Ballroom on Sunday night took American opera off the stage and put it in the nightclub, where it belongs. Set in the middle of eating and drinking customers, without props and sets, using three performers at three microphones, a piano and a synthesizer, words and music achieved a symbiosis that the usual copies of European tradition never quite do. In this story of corruption, capitalism and the urban South, Arnold Weinstein's words tumble over one another in seemingly inexhaustible invention. They can be wickedly funny. (A streetwalker's hymn to the marketplace reads, "Come on night, make my day.") William Bolcom's music is an all-American synthesis of black and white pop and Latin styles; he is reportedly happier with this pared-down version of "Casino Paradise" than with the orchestrated and stage-directed production at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia two years ago. (The festival commissioned the piece.) Mr. Bolcom's immediately understood but subtle renderings of eminently familiar forms challenge the idea of innovation as a necessary criterion for artistic worth. From its musical side, "Casino Paradise" refers back to the methodologies of the 18th century, when invention and convention operated in confident symbiosis. To Mr. Bolcom's tangos come the added bite of extended harmonies and bitonal textures, but these tart flavors broaden the ear and never interfere with the genuine popular-music lyricism of his songs. The shortened version of "Casino Paradise" consists of 20 set pieces with minimal scene-setting between them. The format shares tendencies with both grand opera and the Broadway stage. The analogy to Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht is inevitable and altogether proper, although Mr. Bolcom and Mr. Weinstein create a malicious exuberance somewhat removed from Weill-Brecht's darker Central European pessimisms. Eddie Korbich and Joan Morris play the children of the tycoon and corruption king, J. J. Fergeson. Mr. Korbich is in the mode of an ingenuous song-belting Broadway hero; in "Casino Paradise" he moves from addled idealism to unenlightened self-interest. Ms. Morris gives Cis Fergeson an endearing glassy-eyed charm and also plays the entrepreneurial nurse who ends up with the family money. Andre De Shields, as the father, is a wonder of delighted ill will and barely suppressed violence. His performance, musical and otherwise, is focused and economical; by spending much of his time saying much with minimal gesture, he makes the truly emotional outbursts seem like earthquakes. All three performers bring to language a clarity and force most operagoers are not accustomed to. Mr. Weinstein's words deserve both. The back-wall projections, mostly showing brothel sleaze, are by Larry Rivers. Mr. Bolcom and Eric Valinsky played the piano and synthesizer. Roger Trefousse was the musical director. The Ballroom, at 253 West 28th Street, in Chelsea in Manhattan, will offer "Casino Paradise" tonight through Sunday with extra shows on Friday and Saturday nights. Urging fans of American popular music to go and see it may be preaching to the converted, but in this instance the subject of the sermon is particularly good. Those who really ought to experience "Casino Paradise" in its current setting are the hidebound professionals and aficionados still trying to make American opera work on European models. And besides, in what other opera house of the world can thirsty lovers of culture order a drink midway through Act I?

295-> Officer Dies Cleaning Gun
A New York City police officer was fatally shot in his home today as he and his wife, also a city police officer, cleaned their guns, the Nassau County police said. The officer, James Lauritsch, and his wife, Annette Praschunus, were off duty when the shooting happened at 8:40 P.M., said Sgt. Edmund Horance, a Nassau police spokesman. They were apparently cleaning their guns when Ms. Praschunus's gun accidentally fired and the bullet hit Mr. Lauritsch in the chest, he said. Officer Lauritsch was pronounced dead at Nassau County Medical Center, the sergeant said.

296-> Star Gazers Bewildered By Odd Galaxies
LIKE pupils at a show-and-tell class, astronomers brought their latest studies of galaxies to a meeting of the American Astronomical Society here last week, displaying reams of pictures, graphs, equations and speculations. But while the fare was often startling and sometimes spectacular, many galactic enigmas seemed even more impenetrable than before. Though they have produced a host of tantalizing hints, the latest investigations still seem unable to explain fully how galaxies form, clump together and evolve and how their sometimes violent cores satisfy their hunger for staggering amounts of energy. Many photographs supplied by NASA and astronomers working with it were as beautiful as they were intriguing, but they did not entirely quell an undertone of uncertainty and dispute pervading some sessions. "Very little in astronomy can be known with certainty, and a lot of those beautiful pictures are as tough to interpret as Rorschach patterns," said one astronomer, who spoke only on the condition of not being named because of his reluctance to antagonize senior astronomers. "Astronomy is a humbling trade." Many astronomers said that providing more money for new optical and radio telescopes would hasten the pace of discovery and understanding. Some also argued for financing a proposed NASA satellite called the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, an orbiting telescope that could greatly improve scientific understanding of distant galaxies that are shrouded by vast dust clouds opaque to visible light. Some images and interpretations offered at the meeting prompted skepticism as well as admiration. Typical was the case of a galaxy named 10214+4724, whose stunning importance was first realized two years ago when scientists matched separate sets of observations collected by NASA's Infrared Astronomy Satellite and visible-light measurements made by ground observatories. One set of measurements showed that the light coming from 10214+4724 was strongly shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, indicating that the galaxy is enormously distant from the Earth. Because it is so far away, the infrared light reaching the Earth from the galaxy is not particularly bright, but when allowance is made for the object's great distance, astronomers calculate that it must be 100 trillion times as bright as the Sun, making it brightest object in the universe. Disagreement About Galaxy Three different scientific groups studying this astonishing galaxy brought their results to the meeting, and although all agreed that the discovery of 10214+4724 was a landmark in astronomy, they disagreed about its meaning. Dr. Philip Solomon of the State University of New York at Stony Brook reported that he and two French colleagues had found evidence that the galaxy was primeval, meaning that we see it as it was just two billion years after the Big Bang, when it was just beginning to form stars. Using a radio telescope 30 meters in diameter near Granada, Spain, Dr. Solomon and his colleagues found immense amounts of dense molecular gas in the galaxy, particularly carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, as well as evidence of very large numbers of hot young stars, most of them of types that blaze up, evolve and burn out or explode quickly. "It's a case of runaway star formation," Dr. Solomon said, "stars that form without the birth control imposed by galaxies like our own, in which the interstellar gas is too thin for such rapid star formation." He says that rapid star formation alone accounts for the almost incredible brightness of 10214+4724 and that the galaxy has no hidden quasar to power its lighthouse, as may be the case with many common spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Another group studying the galaxy with a 30-meter telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Kitt Peak, Ariz., came to a similar conclusion. Dr. Paul A. Vanden Bout of the observatory told the meeting that his group had measured radiation from atomic carbon in the galaxy at two frequencies never before detected outside the Milky Way. The finding supports the belief that there is much more gas spread through the empty spaces between stars than had been previously observed, gas that provides a rich diet for the formation of new stars. But a third group, headed by Dr. Erik Becklin of the University of California at Los Angeles, sharply disagreed. Dr. Becklin said that he could discern no evidence of active star formation in the galaxy and that it was possible the galaxy's light source was powered not by a myriad of hot stars but by a hidden quasar in its core. The session ended without agreement. All three astronomers said the universe may contain many galaxies that blaze as intensely as 10214+4724 but that have been overlooked because their emissions are mostly infrared radiation rather than light. All three agreed that unless the new infrared satellite was built and placed in orbit, there would be little progress discovering more of these wonders. New Data on Quasars New observations of quasars themselves, very distant objects that are believed to be little larger than stars but that emit as much light as entire galaxies, also prompted disagreements. One concerns the power source of these objects. Theorists have suggested that various "engines" might power quasar light production, including radiation from extremely massive black holes, but surmises are hard to test. Astronomers have tried to bring some order to the bewildering variety of quasars they see, and some have proposed that quasars look different because they are at differing orientations with respect to the Earth. But this idea was dealt a blow by a report from Dr. Todd A. Boroson of the Kitt Peak observatory. If the orientation idea is correct, theorists had predicted, quasars that do not emit radio signals should have the same distribution of orientations as those that do emit radio signals. But Dr. Boroson's group found a way to test this prediction and found it false. This may mean, he said, "that a whole lot of basic ideas about what goes on near a black hole may have to be thrown out." Easily the most intriguing new picture of a galaxy was served up at the meeting by the operators of NASA's flawed but highly productive Hubble Space Telescope. This computer-enhanced image depicts the roughly spherical blue core of the spiral galaxy M51, on which a large black X is visible. Dr. Holland C. Ford of NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute told an audience that the black cross appeared to mark the position of a black hole behind it, which he believed to be powering the galaxy's intense radiation; "God has shown us exactly where the black hole is," he said. The horizontal cross bar of the X is probably a ring of dust 100 light-years in diameter surrounding the galaxy as viewed from its side, he said, but he acknowledged that the other bar of the X poses a puzzle. (A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, or about six trillion miles.) NASA also distributed spectacular Hubble Space Telescope photographs of another of its prime exhibits, a peculiar galaxy named Arp 220. Dr. Edward Shaya of the University of Maryland explained that Arp 220's twin lobes separated by a black band studded with blazing young star clusters probably reveal a titanic collision between two galaxies. In the region where the two galaxies intersect, runaway star formation is taking place, and this is likely to produce a rich crop of supernova explosions. But even the name of this odd galaxy suggests controversy. It takes its name from being item No. 220 in a catalogue of "peculiar" galaxies compiled in the 1950's and 1960's by Dr. Halton C. Arp using the mighty 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar, Calif. Dr. Arp selected pairs of galaxies for inclusion in his catalogue on the basis of a paradox that still disturbs some astronomers. The members of each pair he chose seemed to be related to each other, either because they were very close together or were linked by what appeared to be luminous intergalactic bridges. The paradox arose from the fact the shifting of light arriving on Earth from each galactic "partner" toward the red end of the spectrum differed wildly. Classical astronomical belief holds that the degree of red-shifting of light is directly proportional to the distance of a galaxy from Earth and that Dr. Arp's "pairs" were therefore very far apart, despite their apparent proximity. 15 Billion Years But Dr. Arp believed that there was a fundamental flaw in the assumption that red-shifting provided an infallible measure of cosmic distance. For his insistence on this unpopular view he was denounced as an astronomical heretic and denied observing time on the Mount Palomar telescope. He later found employment abroad, a development that some friends viewed as a result of his being ostracized by American astronomers. Dr. Arp's theory was not resurrected at the meeting, but his name remained in evidence. Besides Arp 220, Dr. Shaya presented another visual treat, a 36-second animated recreation of the history of the universe in the last 15 billion or so years. By plotting the present-day velocities of 570 gigantic clusters of galaxies and running a series of computer calculations based on a "least action" analysis, he projected paths along which these groups may have moved relative to each other since a time soon after the Big Bang. Among the conclusions he drew from his movie was that the universe contains only about 20 percent of the mass it would need to slow and reverse its present expansion, a conclusion that he believes has a profound consequence for cosmological theory. If his analysis is correct, it implies that the universe will go on expanding forever, finally cooling itself to extinction. This conclusion is bound to be challenged by other astronomers, many of whom are devoting their efforts to find the "missing mass" needed not only to prevent the universe from expanding forever, but also to confirm some popular cosmological theories about the origin of structure in the initially smooth universe. Investigators looking for this "dark matter," which is undetectable except by the gravitational influence it may exert on visible objects, reported some of the dribs and drabs they have turned up, in the form of gas clouds, huge objects from our terrestrial perspective, but almost negligible in the context of the universe as a whole. But there remains sharp disagreement as to what dark matter is and how much of it the universe contains. Astronomers from the Wyoming Infrared Observatory and the University of Wyoming distributed a picture of the spiral galaxy NGC 5907 as viewed from the side, and reported measurements purportedly showing that the galaxy was surrounded by a lot of dark matter. Huge and previously unnoticed lumpy clouds of molecular hydrogen were discovered hovering above and below the Milky Way galaxy by astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While not technically dark matter, this gas had evaded detection because it does not emit light. It was found by very sensitively tuned antennas listening for its faint radio broadcasts. The scientists believe the gas has important implications for theories of star formation and galactic evolution. Another astronomer, insisting on anonymity, sarcastically commented on all searches for hidden matter that "it's great to find more mass, even if it's just a drop in the ocean. Sooner or later we astronomers will get the universe into the kind of shape we want."

297-> 'Romper Room' Host On Her Abortion Case
When she talks about that summer of 1962 when headlines worldwide were howling about her, Sherri Chessen refers to herself as "Miss Sherri." That was the way she was known to the thousands of children who recited their Do Bees and Don't Bees as they watched her on the Scottsdale, Ariz., edition of Romper Room, the nationally syndicated television show. Off screen in 1962, this 30-year-old mother of four was something of a Miss Sherri, too: perky and naive. Believing her identity would be kept secret, she said, she told a reporter from The Arizona Republic that a tranquilizer she had taken, thalidomide, would probably cause the child she was expecting to be born with severe deformities. She said she meant only to warn others about the drug. Instead, this article and the others that immediately followed focused on her plans for an abortion. Soon after, her identity was exposed and her family was subjected to such intense public condemnation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation stationed agents at her home. Rejected by hospitals in America and Japan, she ultimately went to Sweden for the procedure. An Excruciating Summer "A Private Matter," an HBO film directed by Joan Micklin Silver that will have its premiere at 8 P.M. on Saturday, examines this excruciating summer in the lives of Sherri Chessen (Sissy Spacek), then known as Sherri Finkbine, and her family (featuring Aidan Quinn as her husband, Bob, and Estelle Parsons as her mother). It also looks at an era when abortion was considered scandalous and was permitted in Arizona only if the mother's physical or mental health was deemed fragile, and even then performed by physicians in secrecy. Before the news broke, arrangements for her abortion at a local hospital had been quietly made. But during a legal challenge to the case, her name was revealed, and a judge determined that while the doctors could go ahead with the procedure, they would be vulnerable to lawsuits. The hospital turned her down. She was dismissed from her job, and her husband was suspended from his high school teaching post. Their children were hounded, anonymous death threats poured in by mail and telephone and the press swarmed around their home. The film concludes as she and Bob Finkbine board an airplane for Sweden. But her real-life ordeal continued in Stockholm, where she was followed nearly everywhere by reporters from 34 countries, repeatedly interviewed by medical staff members and then, after three weeks, given the approval by a medical board to have an abortion. After the abortion, the three-month-old fetus was found to have no legs and only one arm, she said. 'I Was Labeled Unfit' When she returned home, "I just wanted to be anonymous," said Ms. Chessen, a former college cheerleader who had always wanted to be in broadcasting. But she needed to work, she said. "A lot of people didn't know what to do with me," Ms. Chessen said. "I was labeled unfit to handle children." Eventually, she did win a 15-minute slot on a television talk show. In 1964, she became pregnant. "As soon as I started showing," she said, "I had to quit." Ms. Chessen, who is now a 59-year-old mother of six and grandmother of four and who is living near Phoenix, still displays her much-vaunted sunniness, but underlying it, in the vernacular of her heyday, is one tough cookie. She and her husband were divorced in 1973, and she brought up their six children on her own. She moved the family to Southern California, where she sold real estate, and then returned to broadcasting, doing commercial voice-overs. In 1983, she returned to Arizona and tried to open a health spa. As she puts it, "We went for broke, and we made it," losing all her money in a bank involved in the savings-and-loan scandals. For years, she said, she turned down the producers asking for the film rights to her story, because "I wasn't interested in turning myself into a sideshow," she said. She finally gave permission to Bill Pace and Ronnie D. Clemmer (who also produced the forthcoming "A League of Their Own," a film about an all-women's baseball team). "They offered a humane look at what happened," she said. "I didn't want it to be a pro-choice piece per se, but told in such a way that the pro-life people could say, 'I still don't agree with what she did, but look at what she had to go through; what can we do to resolve this?' " Ms. Chessen said her decision to go forward was also prompted by the increasingly successful attacks on the legality of abortion. In recent years, she has begun to speak in public about her experience, saying that although her choice was agonizing, she made it because she did not want to burden her family with the financial and emotional strain that proper care for a severely disabled child would entail. Husband as Partner She has written several children's books, as yet unpublished, and has been working on seminars about fetal health care. Her partner is her husband of one year, an obstetrician and gynecologist who happened to practice in the Scottsdale hospital that turned her down for the abortion 30 years ago. He had been next in line to perform the abortion if her own doctor had abandoned her and the hospital had instead supported her decision, she said. She is bracing herself for the debut of the film, she says, which has revived the bad memories. Nonetheless, she says she likes what she sees. "I'm very proud of it," she said. "It's about the coming of age of Miss Sherri, when she realizes she can do something for herself, to be the center of her own universe." Ms. Chessen praises Sissy Spacek's portrayal of her, calling it a veritable "cloning." But the former Romper Room host has one cavil. During the scene in which the Scottsdale hospital administrator gives her the news that she cannot have the abortion performed at that hospital, Ms. Chessen, sounding just like a proper Do Bee, notes, "Sissy was snippy to the hospital supervisor, and I think she should have said, 'Thank you for trying.' "

298-> OUR TOWNS; Where Diplomacy Has Gone to Seed
THEY call the big stone house at the top of the hill in the Glenwood Lake neighborhood here "the embassy," and there are people who remember lines of limousines pulling in for cheerful receptions. These days, the 21-room former home of the Ambassador to the United Nations from the Central African Republic is a different sort of symbol of international diplomacy: neighbors are ready to declare a new cold war on the former French colony. It has, they say, allowed its now-boarded-up property to deteriorate, and that has damaged the neighborhood of carefully kept $200,000 to $400,000 homes. No Ambassador has been in residence for several years. The once stately mansion is now marred by downed electric wires, five abandoned cars, scores of broken windows and a forest of untended grass and forgotten rhododendrons. Until a fire in December left them homeless, the Ambassador's driver, two other adults and nine children had been staying in the basement, living without heat, electricity, water or telephone service. Diplomatic-mission properties are, under international treaties, "inviolable." That, people in Glenwood Lake have concluded, means that no one can make diplomats cut the lawn. "It's an abuse of privilege," said Robert J. Seitz Jr., the frustrated president of a neighborhood group, the Glenwood Lake Association. Mr. Seitz has accomplished, he said, absolutely nothing in more than a year of complaints. Most everyone who has talked to the Central African Republic's diplomats said they had been quite courteous in responding to the complaints, making repeated pledges to clean up the property. In a telephone interview from the country's real embassy, in Washington, Ambassador Jean Pierre Sohahong-Kombet dismissed suggestions that his country, listed by the United Nations as one of the poorest in the world, lacked the money to maintain the New Rochelle property. Speaking in English, he noted that the country had enough money to buy the expensive estate. Then he said he could not continue the interview without an interpreter because he conducts business in French. Later, his private secretary, Mireille Kousseiri, telephoned to say that Mr. Sohahong-Kombet would have no additional comment because, she said: "The house doesn't belong to the Ambassador. The house belongs to the Government." "When they decide to repair it, it will be repaired," she added. Sol Kuttner, a senior adviser in the United States delegation to the United Nations, said he had been working "assiduously" on this unusual problem for months. He said the inaction was caused by a lack of money and "a question of decision making" in the republic's government. This week he said new talks about the Glenwood Lake property were under way that he hoped would resolve the problem. Despite repeated promises, though, neighbors said, the steady deterioration has continued. "When a foreign country comes over here and lets its property fall into neglect, pays no taxes, gets away scot-free and just pays lip service to the people in the neighborhood," Mr. Seitz said, "they're taking advantage of the system, and it's not fair." Myrna Rubin lives in an impeccable colonial home across Holly Drive from "the embassy." She just walks out her door in the morning, she said, and gets riled up. "It's very upsetting," she said, "because I see this jungle." Glenwood Lake is the kind of place with wide streets where people like to feel that problems can be solved. It is an orderly suburban neighborhood just a five-minute drive from the center of this southern Westchester city of 70,000. In their daytime lives, many of the residents are people who get things done: doctors, lawyers, local officials and college professors. Some in Glenwood Lake like to point out that the once all-white neighborhood banded together years ago to fight "block busting" real estate agents who tried to scare whites into selling when black home buyers began to move in. Instead, some of the whites and the new black homeowners created what is now recognized as a stable integrated neighborhood that draws new residents with a tradition of neighborhood pride. The problem house up on Holly Drive, though, has stymied even the most optimistic of the Glenwood Lake problem solvers. "Foreign countries aren't always the best neighbors," Myrna Rubin said. "As a citizen, do I have any recourse? No."

300-> Tommy Koulax, Hamburger Chain Owner, 73
Tommy Koulax, founder of Tommy's Original World Famous Hamburgers, a chain of 17 fast-food outlets and a fixture in Southern California, died of cancer on Wednesday night at his home in this Los Angeles suburb. He was 73 years old. Mr. Koulax, a native of Oklahoma City, opened the first Tommy's in May 1946 at the corner of Beverly and Rampart Boulevards, near downtown Los Angeles. Within a few years, customers were lined up at his red and white frame building for the specialty there, his chiliburgers. Mr. Koulax is survived by his wife, Esther, and six children.

301-> The World Watches Murder
Incredulous over a cease-fire, shellshocked residents of Sarajevo ventured out of their shelters Monday to cash pension checks and shop for spring onions -- the errands of ordinary life that have been suppressed in Bosnia's capital for weeks by Serbian gunners. Suddenly Serbian mortars opened up from the surrounding hills. Before the guns again ceased firing, 19 more civilians lay dead. A one-sided war is shattering this once-lovely city in the heart of Europe . . . Suburbanites are slowly starved out of their basements . . . A community where Muslim Slavs, Croats and Serbs once lived side by side is subjected to "ethnic cleansing" reminiscent of the Nazis . . . Many thousands of civilians die. Where, as the Serbian gunmen step up the slaughter, is the rest of the world? Still wringing its hands on the sidelines. The Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic cannot conceal his responsibility for the death toll. He has armed bands of thugs like Arkan's Tigers and Seselj's White Eagles that commit appalling atrocities to drive Muslim Slavs and Croats from their homes. His army provides cover for their depredations. His henchman, the Serb militant Radovan Karadzic, crows about partitioning Sarajevo and purging non-Serbs from Serb-held sections. The Serbian commander in Sarajevo, Gen. Ratko Mladic, was recently overheard ordering his gunners to "drive them crazy" and "burn it all." Yet the United Nations evenhandedly avoids blaming him. "How can I talk to Mladic if I call him a murderer?" one official said to John Burns of The New York Times, even as General Mladic's marauders keep U.N. peacekeepers from securing Sarajevo's airport and allowing desperately needed relief flights to land. Some Americans uneasy about endless involvement in a bloody Balkan quagmire press the question, What's the U.S. interest? That construes interest in the narrowest way. To his credit, Secretary of State Baker declares an abiding U.S. interest in Bosnia, "to do what we can to prevent the humanitarian nightmare that's taking place there from continuing." International economic sanctions against Serbia are having some effect as citizens publicly protest the murderous Milosevic policies. It takes courage to challenge the lies and the guns, even as thousands more die in blameless Bosnia. If the sanctions don't move Serbia to cease its aggression, Mr. Baker adds, "we should not rule out the possibility that resort to some sort of multilateral pressure would be required." Yes. When?

302-> SKY-DIVING CRASH LINKED TO ENGINE
After a day sifting through the rubble of a plane crash that killed 12 members of a sky diving club near here on Monday, Federal investigators said today that they found evidence of engine trouble. The DeKalb County sheriff, Roger Smith, said a witness told the authorities that it appeared that at least one of the plane's two engines failed shortly after takeoff as the aircraft wobbled through the air about 50 feet above the field where it crashed and burst into flames, killing everyone on board. "One of the propellers was dead," Sheriff Smith said today. "There was no engine noise." Bob McIntosh, the head investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board at the scene, said the left engine "appears to be in a position that is not delivering power," and added, "We will be looking pretty closely at that to determine if there's some irregularity and what that might have meant to the pilot in the flight." 'Nothing Wrong' With Plane The plane was operated by the Hinckley Parachute Center. A spokesman for the center, George Wright, said today that the Beechcraft model 18 had passed a Federal safety inspection last month. "As far as we know there was nothing wrong with that plane," he said. The safety board said there have been 38 crashes involving planes carrying sky divers in the past 10 years. Ten of those crashes, including Monday's, resulted in the death of 68 people. The crash near Hinckley, 50 miles west of Chicago, has several similarities to another fatal crash this year. Sixteen people, including the pilot, died last April 22 when a twin-engine plane carrying 21 sky divers crashed on takeoff from rural Perris Valley Airport, about 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Six people aboard the plane were injured. Investigations into both crashes are continuing, but both inquiries have already focused on engine problems and questions about the proper use of safety restraints by passengers. Although planes for sky divers are allowed to operate without seats, Federal regulations require passengers to use safety belts while the plane is taking off and landing. Mr. Wright, the spokesman for the parachute center, said the plane that crashed here was equipped with enough restraining devices for 14 people, but it was unclear whether belts were being worn at the time of the crash. Investigators said the plane developed problems soon after takeoff and never flew higher than 400 feet. The issue of restraining devices seems to be a personal one in the world of sky diving. Jeff McVey, the co-owner of Skydive Los Angeles, said he had worn one only "a handful" of times before the Perris crash last April. 'Differing Views' on Belts "There are differing views on whether seat belts are more of a danger than they are a help for sky divers," Mr. McVey said. "We are sky divers, we have parachutes on our backs, and the seat belts conflict with rip cords on student gear. I personally have made a choice to wear one. Comfort is not an issue with respect to safety." William Ottley, executive director of the United States Parachute Association in Alexandria, Va., said wearing a belt depended on the individual policy at the drop site. "Some people are more faithful in using them," he said. "It's the law, but sometimes, as we know, people don't follow the law." When rescue workers reached the crash site here, the 12 men were found in a "ball" in the front section of the plane, which had nose-dived into a field. There were four student sky divers aboard. Several of the men were found with their arms wrapped around the man in front of them, Mr. Wright said. "That would be the instructors trying to protect the students," he said. "That's what they're taught. Those guys were my friends. It's a great sense of loss, but there's a lot of pride in knowing everybody was doing their job right up to the end." The pilot, James L. Mahr of Sugar Grove, Ill., had the proper credentials, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Mr. Wright said the pilot had 27 years of flying experience, many of them with the parachute center.

303-> 1992 Candidates Don't Fill the Muddied Shoes of Their Forebears
THE 1992 Presidential campaign may have veered more toward the gutter than the high road, but it is by no means the worst of the quadrennial exercises in promises and invective. American Presidential campaigns, said the curator of the Museum of American Political Life at University of Hartford, Edmund B. Sullivan, have a wonderful tradition of raucousness and personal abuse. Many campaigns, particularly in the politically boisterous 19th century, make the current contest seem almost polite. And, lest anyone think that interest in Bill Clinton's sexual past or in what Vice President Dan Quayle thinks of Murphy Brown are just more examples of modern-day voyeurism, the truth is that sex and the Presidential candidate is an old and fertile issue, probably best exemplified by the campaign of 1884. The candidates were the reform Governor of New York, Grover Cleveland, and James G. Blaine, Republican of Maine, both of whom were to provide effective fodder for a campaign that was marked by two chants that even today have a certain ring. Mr. Blaine was implicated in political scandal that led to the Democratic chant of "Blaine! Blaine! James G. Blaine! The Continental Liar from the State of Maine!" But the Republicans countered allegations that the Congressman sold inside information to land speculators with the charge that Mr. Cleveland, a bachelor, had fathered an illegitimate child by a 36-year-old widow. Thus the chant: "Ma, Ma, where's my pa? Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!" Mr. Cleveland defused the issue by simply acknowledging that, sure enough, he was the father of an illegitimate son living in Utica, for whom he provided. Even in the strait-laced Victorian age, politicians received credit for candor. Mr. Cleveland squeaked into the White House. The issues of the Cleveland-Blaine campaign, and all other campaigns since the time of George Washington, are detailed in thousands of items on display at the university museum. It is the biggest private treasure trove of campaign memorabilia in the land, ranging from buttons made to celebrate the inauguration of George Washington to a poster of Michael Dukakis with a baseball glove in 1988. The nucleus of the collection was donated to the university by J. Doyle DeWitt, an insurance company executive who for decades collected anything relating to Presidential campaigns. Since Mr. DeWitt's death in 1972, Mr. Sullivan, a professor of educational theory at the university, has been in charge of the museum since it was dedicated as part of a new library complex three years ago. He has written two books on political memorabilia. An amateur collector of political items when he was asked to oversee the collection, Mr. Sullivan has since become known as a national authority on the trappings of Presidential campaigns. Since sex in political campaigns is far from new and mud slinging is all too common, is there anything in the Presidential campaign of 1992 to set it apart? Alas, yes, says Mr. Sullivan, but in a very negative sense. What makes this Presidential campaign different, he says, is that both major party front-runners have turned off voters and neither has a strong constituency. "It's a general malaise," Mr. Sullivan said. "There's no finger on the pulse. You wonder what world these guys live in." The Democratic campaign, he adds, is almost a rerun of the Dukakis effort in 1988, "the most mismanaged campaign of modern times." The authority on campaigns, past and present, said he believes a major factor in recent campaigns is a plethora of media consultants who tell candidates how to conduct themselves. "They're using simple-minded techniques and voters respond by tuning out. Once candidates made speeches, so people could get an idea of how they think. Now they go from city to city, saying nothing new. It's all media consultants and sound bites. It's presumptuous to voters' intelligence. It sells voters short." To find a relative parallel for this year's campaign, Mr. Sullivan went back to 1912 "to find a sitting president at such a low level." That was the year when President William Howard Taft, a Republican was seeking re-election. Mr. Taft had been the Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Theodore Roosevelt, and Mr. Roosevelt had swung his support to his friend in the campaign of 1908. But by 1912 the old Rough Rider had become bitter over Mr. Taft's conservatism and decided to run against him on his own Progressive Party ticket. The Bull Moose defeated Mr. Taft but the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson, slipped in over both of them and became President. An Unparalleled Parallel The entrance of Ross Perot as an independent candidate in the current Presidential campaign also parallels the 1912 election, but with one major difference, Mr. Sullivan said. In 1912, the third-party candidate, Theodore Roosevelt, was a household name. In 1992, until quite recently, Ross Perot was generally unknown to the American electorate. But Mr. Sullivan concedes that Presidential politics, despite the punsters, pollsters and media consultants, is an inexact science. The only sure thing is that in November, there will be a winner and a loser or two. And so a new exhibition, "They Also Ran: Losers in the White House Sweepstakes," has been mounted at the museum and will run through the November campaign. Seymour, King and Cass On both levels of the museum are reminders -- lithographs, photographs, banners, buttons, campaign handkerchiefs -- of the also-rans. Here are reminders of William Jennings Bryan and Henry Clay, both three-time losers, and Thomas Dewey and Adlai Stevenson who managed to lose two elections each. There are also reminders of Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern and Barry Goldwater, still familiar names, and others who are mere footnotes to history: Horatio Seymour, Rufus King, Lewis Cass and, of course, James G. Blaine, the Continental Liar from the State of Maine. A huge campaign lithograph of the handsome, bearded and "Honorable" Mr. Blaine occupies a prominent space on one wall, looking every inch the first-class candidate.

304-> Justice Thomas Defends Democratic Process; Republican Appointees
To the Editor: I don't mind your July 5 castigation of Justice Clarence Thomas ("Justice Thomas, the Freshman") because I didn't think him qualified to be confirmed in the first instance. Nevertheless, you include at least one unfair and potentially misleading remark, especially as it implies that Democratic justices are great defenders of civil liberties, while Republican justices are not. You note that in cases involving school prayer and abortion, Justice Thomas took regrettable positions in sharp contrast to the more preferred positions of "three Republican appointees," Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. Eight of the nine justices are Republican appointees. Not just three, but all five of the justices who voted to uphold the core of Roe v. Wade were Republican appointees. Moreover, when Roe was decided in 1973 by a 7-to-2 vote, seven of the nine justices were Republican, with one Democratic appointee, Thurgood Marshall, for and one, Byron R. White, against the decision. Justice White, the lone remaining Democratic appointee, named 30 years ago by John F. Kennedy, is among the more conservative Court members on criminal and many social matters, and has long called for the overturn of Roe. I presume that by noting the "Republican" votes of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter, you unartfully take a swipe at Reagan-Bush appointees. In retrospect, however, and certainly from the pro-choice view, Republican appointees who have served on the Court in the last two decades, including Potter Stewart, Lewis F. Powell Jr., Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and, yes, even the oft-maligned Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, were defenders of the right to privacy. EDWARD S. HOCHMAN Paterson, N.J., July 9, 1992

305-> Foreign Correspondent Is Suspended by NBC
Arthur Kent, an NBC correspondent known for his calm reporting during the Persian Gulf war, has been suspended without pay for refusing an assignment in the Balkans, the network said in New York. Mr. Kent, quoted from Rome in today's issue of USA Today, said the problem was part of a continuing dispute with the network. "Everything is going to be resolved to remove any confusion connected to my name," he said. Mr. Kent and a producer, Joe Alicastro, were suspended on Wednesday because of their refusal to go to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, earlier in the month, said an NBC spokeswoman, Peggy Hubble. NBC announced the suspensions on Thursday, the same day an ABC News producer, David Kaplan, was shot to death in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, about 175 miles southeast of Zagreb. Noting the distance between the two cities, Ms. Hubble said the network would not order anyone into a war zone.

306-> SIDELINES: BELMONT STAKES; Tricks of the Trade
WOODY STEPHENS, the only man to saddle five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners, is often asked by other trainers what the trick was. "The Belmont is an awful funny race," said Stephens. "A rider means an awful lot. A lot of horses don't want to go one and a half miles. I'm a man who sits down with a rider and talks to him. Some trainers don't see their riders until just before the race. I explain to them what I want." Stephens's string began with Conquistador Cielo in 1982, and continued with Caveat, Swale, Creme Fraiche and Danzig Connection. He then saddled Gone West in 1987 (sixth) and Cefis in 1988 (fourth). Stephens, now 78 years old, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1990. He keeps fewer horses in his stable now, and he sleeps later than he used to.

309-> Early Injuries for 6 Islanders
Injuries will force six Islanders to miss the team's exhibition opener on Friday night against the Boston Bruins in Albany. One of the injuries, to defenseman Wayne McBean, could be serious. McBean left practice today with an injury to cartilage in his left knee that he suffered when he became entangled with Dean Chynoweth. He was to be given a magnetic-resonance-imaging scan today in New York. McBean suffered a similar injury last Dec. 31 and missed the rest of the season with knee surgery. If surgery is needed again, the Islanders announced, it will take place Friday in New York. The other injuries are less serious, but involve front-line players. Patrick Flatley, Brad Dalgarno and Vladimir Malakhov are out with groin strains. Pierre Turgeon is out with a hip flexor pull and Mick Vukota has a shoulder sprain. The Islanders will play the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night in Buffalo. They will open at Nassau Coliseum on Tuesday night against the Devils.

311-> COMPANY NEWS; CROWN CORK TO ACQUIRE CONSTAR INTERNATIONAL
Crown Cork and Seal Inc. said it would acquire Constar International, a leading maker of plastic containers, for $515 million in cash. The news sent the stock of Constar, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., soaring $7.875 a share to close yesterday at $32.25 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Crown Cork stock slipped 25 cents, to $36.125 a share, on the Big Board. Under terms approved by the boards of both companies, Crown will offer $32.50 a share for all of Constar's outstanding common stock, beginning next Wednesday. Crown Cork, based in Philadelphia, is a leading maker of metal containers, crowns and closures for bottles and other containers, and packaging machinery. It had revenues of $3.81 billion in 1991. "I am frankly perplexed by the valuation that Crown Cork is paying," said Jerry Melin, an analyst with Rothschild, who had estimated that Constar would fetch $22 to $24 a share in a takeover. Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it might downgrade Crown Cork's commercial paper because of the buyout proposal. Crown Cork officials could not be reached for comment.

312-> Review/Film; Music Meets Attitude: Lounge Lizards Concert
Three-quarters of the way into Garret Linn's engaging concert film, "John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards Live in Berlin," the leader of the nine-member band puts down his alto saxophone to relate a surreal vignette. A man wakes up in a white room that he doesn't recognize, peers in a mirror and decides his lips are so thin that he ought to try collagen treatments. When his wife walks in, he is disappointed to find that she looks so dowdy, but he realizes he loves her, and they both start laughing so hard at a secret joke that they collapse onto the carpet. The man impulsively apologizes to his wife for his meager sexual endowment. She says it's all right, but asks him if it is the reason he has massacred so many people. At this point, Mr. Lurie does a lurching little dance while making moans and groans that suggest primitive attempts at speech. The story ends when the man's wife asks, "Why are you so stupid, dear?" and he replies, "Because I'm the President of the United States." Muttered in a deadpan growl, Mr. Lurie's unfunny, sophomoric vignette embodies an attitude of snide hipness that sneaks around the edges of the Lounge Lizards' fashionably eclectic music. Where does the band's supercool attitude end and its passion for music begin? Mr. Lurie's attitudinizing sometimes makes it hard to tell. Mr. Linn's cinematic portrait of the Lounge Lizards in a 1991 performance at Quartier Latin, a popular Berlin nightclub, however, makes the most positive case for the band whose music was once labeled fake jazz. The concert's 12 songs are superbly recorded. And as a musically sensitive concert film ought to do, "Live in Berlin," which opens a 17-performance engagement today at the Walter Reade Theater, visually underlines the structures and expressive qualities of the pieces being played. The film's close-up portraits of individuals soloing or playing in duos and in trios also points up the superior technical skills of each member. The close-ups show how musical elements as dissimilar as Billy Martin's sizzling African-influenced percussion and Jane Scarpantoni's texturally abrasive, almost hornlike cello, contribute to an ensemble style that is rooted in diversity. A typical Lounge Lizards piece, if there is such a thing, begins with Mr. Lurie and Michael Blake's trilling saxophones, which are soon joined by Steven Bernstein's silvery trumpet in a Minimalist, Steve Reich-like theme. Before long it is interrupted by a blast of percussion and drums that take it in an African-pop direction. From there on, abrupt stylistic crosscurrents regularly arrive to keep changing the piece's stylistic focus. Sooner or later, everything from a cacophonous post-bop freneticism to echoes of a hard-boiled film-noir romanticism, to a tilting jazz-inflected rhythm-and-blues is brought in. The continual dynamic changes and churning sense of musical drama give each piece the feel of an adventure story jam-packed with action and spiced with a high-tension romantic interlude or two. It is all as stylishly bohemian (1980's-style) as the studiedly frayed glamour of Mr. Lurie's pallid, slicked-back, suit-with-skinny-tie look. And like Mr. Lurie's little stories, it all feels somehow deeply disingenuous. John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards Live in Berlin 1991 Directed by Garret Linn; edited by Caleb Oglesby; produced by Valerie Goodman and Taku Nishimae; released by Telecom Japan International. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Upper West Side. Running time: 102 minutes. This film has no rating. Featuring John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards: John Lurie, Michael Blake, Steven Bernstein, Jane Scarpantoni, Bryan Carrott, Michele Navazio, Billy Martin, Oren Bloedow, and Grant Calvin Weston.

314-> Road Show on Biotech and Bugs
J. D. Brooks is barreling south through Virginia's Dismal Swamp region, a cellular telephone and a recently drained plastic coffee cup at his side, cheerfully explaining how his company's bacteria destroy the stomachs of Colorado potato beetles. He falls silent for a moment and nods toward the soggy, heavily wooded flatlands crowding the two-lane highway. "George Washington wanted to drain this area into farmland," he says, allowing the conversation to wander only as far as the agricultural issues of yesteryear. Mr. Brooks's single-mindedness is a prerequisite for his current job. The 42-year-old Mr. Brooks is the eastern regional sales manager for the Mycogen Corporation, one of the handful of companies that have employees crisscrossing rural America to drum up business for the first agricultural products products based on gene- splicing and other biotechnology breakthroughs. Visions of Profits Scores of companies -- from start-ups like Mycogen, based in San Diego, to multinational giants like Monsanto and Du Pont -- have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into agricultural biotechnology research. Investors have been lured by visions of profits to come from a parade of super cows, hardier plants, healthier fruits, and safer pesticides, fungicides and weed killers. Now, with a stream of Government-approved products emerging from laboratories and field tests, the selling that will sort out winners and losers has begun in earnest. To the uninitiated, it might seem that biological pesticides would be an easy sell. Farmers want alternatives to synthetic chemicals. They do not like exposing themselves or their workers to hazardous chemicals, they fret about chemical residues in their soil and water, they fear tighter regulations that continually make the chemicals more expensive and they know consumers are growing more anxious about residues in food. Most of all, farmers worry that too many bugs are becoming resistant to chemicals. Many farmers embrace bacteria and other "biologicals" not as a complete substitute for chemicals but as a way of slowing the pace at which bugs adapt to them. All this makes it pretty easy for Mr. Brooks to find farmers happy to hear his sales pitch. But it does not mean that they are rushing to trust part or all of a crop to Mycogen's novel products or those of the company's rivals. The farmers hesitate because biologicals work more slowly than chemicals. They also break down more quickly once they are sprayed and often work effectively only in the early stages of an insect's life. Many produce disappointing results unless farmers change their spraying equipment or techniques. Mr. Brooks agreed to take a reporter along on a recent two-day trip through prime vegetable-growing regions of eastern North Carolina to provide some insights into the hard work of building new markets. The job varies widely with the season (budgets and trade shows consume many winter hours), the region and its crops, and the weather. The constants are grueling travel, chat that veers back and forth from highly technical to joshing conversation, and hours poking about in fields and warehouses. Mr. Brooks has been known to court farmers by pitching in to drive tractors or help bag potatoes at harvest time. Trying to Make a Difference "Mycogen permeates my life," he says as he nears the first stop on the sales trip. "Even when I'm home, I'm thinking about what I can do, where I can go, who I can see to make a difference." Bacterial pesticides are not Mycogen's only biologicals. Through acquisitions, Mycogen has added products including a line of salts from naturally derived fatty acids that kill insects, weeds, mosses and lichens. And, on the first day of this trip, Mr. Brooks is pondering the implications of a fax he received the night before at his home in Williamsburg, Va., telling him that the company was about to buy a controlling interest in Agrigenetics, a seed business. The unsettling questions are familiar to many sales representatives in fast-changing businesses: What are the newly acquired company's existing products and will Mycogen sell them? And what else will change with the merging of operations? Memories of losing his company car in cost-cutting measures after a previous acquisition were fresh in Mr. Brooks's mind. Mr. Brooks's first stop is a MacDonald's parking lot at Elizabeth City, N.C. to link up with Bill Scruggs, one of six Mycogen salesmen who report to him. They head off for a 9 A.M. visit with Walter Ray Meads, an agricultural chemicals distributor. Reluctant to Leave Mr. Meads is not in when they arrive -- a common occurrence during spring and summer sales calls to distributors and farmers -- but the two salesmen are reluctant to leave without seeing him. Agricultural chemical distributors, some of them billion-dollar companies, are indispensable middlemen for Mycogen and competitors like Ecogen, Abbott Laboratories, Sandoz, and Du Pont. Farmers tend to hold off on pesticide orders until they are ready to spray. If the distributor does not have the Mycogen product in stock, most farmers will switch to something else rather than wait for it. The salesmen's patience pays off when Mr. Meads rolls into the dusty parking lot 20 minutes later. There the three men discuss the weather, the late onset of bugs, which farmers are using Mycogen products and the likelihood that Mr. Meads will order more. Mr. Meads notes that it was tough to sell M-1, a first-generation Mycogen pesticide, at the same time that M-Trak, its successor, was being introduced. The salesmen leave Mr. Meads with several Mycogen baseball caps. Despite Mr. Meads's folksy admonition -- "You just can't predict nuthin' " -- Mr. Brooks comes away confident that the distributor will continue to order Mycogen products aggressively and expects local demand to grow. Mycogen's salesmen try to contact dealers like Mr. Meads several times a week during the spring, sharing information on how the crops and bugs are progressing. Cabbages and Pests It is a short drive to the next stop, the 2,000-acre John Ed Ferrebe & Son farm, which is in its fourth year of spraying cabbage with MVP, a Mycogen bacterial product that attacks the caterpillar of the diamondback moth and several similar pests. The farm also mixes chemicals and M-Pede, a Mycogen fatty acid, for spraying crops like broccoli to control aphids. Over the next 45 minutes, a conversation that begins with Martha Meiggs, the office manager, expands with the arrival of her husband, Ray, the farm's sales manager, and her brother-in-law, Jeff Jennings, who manages field operations. The chatter touches on the family's new golden retriever, the children, a trip to New York and Mr. Scruggs's coming wedding. Then the salesmen discuss a brochure the family has received for a new sprayer designed to improve the delivery of pesticides to the undersides of a crop leaves. The farmers invite the Mycogen team to the "Potato Meeting," where local farmers golf and socialize (Mr. Scruggs plans to be there), and query them about radicchio, an exotic salad green that Italian food distributors have asked the family to grow. The Mycogen salesmen confess they have never heard of it, much less which bugs like it. Concerns About Tolerance What really catches Mr. Brooks's attention is Mr. Jennings's suggestion that insects will develop a tolerance for the biological pesticides as more are used. Mr. Brooks is quick to express Mycogen's view that there is no good evidence yet of insects becoming more resistant. With a mixture of belief and hope, the sales representatives tell customers that the bacterial toxins have been in the environment for so long that any insects with the capacity to easily develop resistance to them must have done so long ago. The conversation then adjourns to a field, where the four men inspect plants to see where insect pressure is building up. It is the first of several "scouting" trips Mr. Brooks and Mr. Scruggs make over the next two days. That afternoon, Mr. Brooks is off to Raleigh to meet a distributor while Mr. Scruggs continues with local visits -- or attempts at visits. After failing to track down two local farm managers, he stops in at roadside home just outside Camden, N.C., that Bill Peele 3d, a local consultant, is renovating into an office. Mr. Peele, an agronomist, advises a growing number of local farmers on how to reduce their use of pesticides by more selective spraying and how to use biologicals. Such consultants, virtually unheard of a generation ago, are important contacts for sales representatives. Seeking More to Sell At the end of the afternoon, Mr. Scruggs phones San Diego to urge that more of the early production run of M-Trak be sent to his region. Mr. Brooks, taking a broader view, says later that it is more important to make sure the limited amount of product is spread evenly among influential growers across the country. The next day starts in New Bern, N.C., at Cardinal Chemical, a local distributor, where Mac Harris is far less upbeat about Mycogen's prospects than Mr. Meads had been in Elizabeth City. A number of local growers had been dissatisfied with their results with M-1, he says. Mr. Scruggs says it was not used properly in many cases, noting that the best results are achieved when the biologicals are mixed with more water and sprayed at higher pressures than chemicals. "They have to give it more than one chance because other things aren't working," Mr. Harris notes. Mr. Brooks and Mr. Scruggs double back to Havelock, a town on North Carolina's central coastal plain, where a convenience store telephone becomes a temporary office. Mr. Scruggs, having decided to spend another day in the area, soon heads off for some more farms. Mr. Brooks heads home. Sales and Salaries The rule of thumb is that a salesman has to generate $1 million in revenues for the company to cover the costs of employing him, Mr. Brooks says. Mycogen's sales force should hit that target for the first time in 1993, he adds. Sales representatives earn $30,000 to $50,000 a year at Mycogen, depending on experience and other factors. Most agricultural chemical sales representatives receive little or no commission. Mr. Brooks said that Mycogen salaries were probably 25 percent lower than those of competitors, but that the company's sales representatives also took part in a stock option program that could be lucrative if Mycogen prospered. "If we are successful, I'll have funded two college educations, set aside something for retirement, and I'll have made a difference in the environment," Mr. Brooks says as he wends his way home through the Dismal Swamp.

317-> Reviews/Film; The Clash of Cultures And Dreams Unrealized
On the surface, the rough-edged style and down-and-out characters of Claire Denis's second feature, "No Fear, No Die," make this film seem radically different from her exquisitely beautiful, fluid "Chocolat." But "No Fear" is about much more than its small-time heroes: two black immigrants in France who train and sell birds for illegal cockfights. As she did in the 1988 "Chocolat," the partly autobiographical story of a French girl growing up in Cameroon, in "No Fear" Miss Denis shows how the details of daily life carry the weight of a whole lifetime, even a culture. This film is exquisite in its own tough-minded way. "No Fear, No Die," released in France in 1990, will be shown today through Tuesday at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's series "Eurobeat: Blacks in European Cinema." At the start, Dah, an African from Benin, and Jocelyn, a man from the French West Indies, decide to make some quick cash by staging cockfights for Pierre (Jean-Claude Brialy), who has created an arena in the basement of his roadside restaurant. Dah, who takes care of the business end, seems to be angrier and more explosive. He is played by Isaach de Bankole, who was the servant Protee in "Chocolat" and the Paris cabdriver in Jim Jarmusch's current "Night on Earth." In all three of these roles Mr. de Bankole is exceptional. With a glance he not only suggests suppressed rage, but also hints at the complex cultural and racial prejudices behind it. It is Jocelyn who trains the cocks and gets in touch with Pierre, who knew Jocelyn's mother in the Antilles. Though he seems simpler, Jocelyn turns out to be the more troubled character, and Alex Descas plays him with perfect subtlety. He is the true star and center of the film. Miss Denis does not rush her story, and at first it appears there may not be one at all. Pierre gives Dah and Jocelyn a small, squalid room, where they eat, sleep and train the roosters. Jocelyn spends his days lavishing attention on the birds, and the film captures these scenes in affectionate detail. Jocelyn trains them as if they were prizefighters, feeding them vitamins, exercising their wings, gently clipping their feathers with small scissors before the fight. It takes some time before his identification with his birds comes to seem an unhealthy substitute for a sane life. Though Miss Denis's influences range from Jean-Luc Godard at his most lucid to the African tradition of non-narrative storytelling, the style of "No Fear" is her own. The hand-held camera work (by Agnes Godard, no relation to Jean-Luc) and intentional choppiness are as much a reflection of Dah and Jocelyn's scrappy lives as the gracefulness of "Chocolat" mirrored the false calm in a colonized country. Dah and Jocelyn's room is blue-tinged and claustrophobic, while the basement arena is dim and dank, the restaurant by the highway garishly bright. Eventually, as in "Chocolat," the surface of this world explodes with the force of repressed passions and cultural conflict. Pierre cuts Dah and Jocelyn's share of the money, and says to Jocelyn: "Just like your mother. Good in bed but born to lose. If you weren't so black, I'd think you might be my son." Jocelyn is losing his equilibrium, feeling so sexually frustrated that he becomes obsessed with Pierre's wife, Toni (Solveig Dommartin). His barely controlled feelings are expressed in extraordinary visual images, in the increasingly intimate way he dances with a strange woman at a bar, or the sudden impulse to dance with a rooster. When he finally snaps, it is not with any melodramatic wrench of the story line, but with a sense that violence and tragedy are born from the accumulation of small daily dramas. The film shows the cockfights (and a final disclaimer that no animals were mistreated) in just enough detail to suggest the violent emotions that are projected on the birds. But the great triumph of all Miss Denis's work is that her characters are never reduced to mere cultural symbols. There are some weak elements in "No Fear." Toni seems dull, though she is meant to be indiscriminately provocative to men. And Pierre has a grown son who, atypically for Miss Denis, seems to exist only because he must move the plot at a crucial moment. While this film is not as perfectly wrought as "Chocolat," it is just what one might expect from Claire Denis after all: the work of a daring, accomplished, unpredictable artist. No Fear, No Die Directed by Claire Denis; screenplay by Miss Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau (in French with English subtitles); director of photography, Pascal Marti; cinematography by Agnes Godard; edited by Dominique Auvray; music by Abdullah Ibrahim.

Colorado quarterback Kordell Stewart, the nation's second-ranked passer, will not make the trip to Minnesota for Saturday night's game because of a sprained left foot. Duke Tobin, a junior, will be making his first start since high school in 1988. He replaced Stewart in the second half of last week's 57-38 victory over Baylor and completed 10 of 15 passes for 154 yards and one touchdown. Colorado scored on four possessions under his direction. Stewart, a sophomore, has completed 37 of 53 passes for 660 yards with seven touchdowns and one interception for the 11th-ranked Buffaloes.

319-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Endorsements; Clinton and Jackson Edge Toward Reconciliation
Gov. Bill Clinton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson today took tentative steps toward reconciling their bitter disagreement over Mr. Clinton's criticism of a rap performer. But the two men did not speak directly to each other, and both sides took care to leave room for retreat. For Mr. Clinton, the efforts at peacemaking took place at an afternoon news conference here during which Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat who is a self-described "big Jackson supporter," endorsed both Mr. Clinton and the economic program the Arkansas Governor announced over the weekend. And Mr. Jackson, appearing at the United States Conference of Mayors in Houston, praised Mr. Clinton's economic plan, saying it was moving "in the right direction, down the right road." The Associated Press reported Mr. Jackson as saying: "It deserves serious analysis and comprehensive debate. To paraphrase a gospel song, he has come a long way from where he started." But Mr. Jackson also was quoted as saying that it had been "a week of activities of political calculation" by Mr. Clinton, and that as a result he would not endorse a Presidential candidate before the Democratic National Convention next month. Remembering Will Rogers Mr. Clinton said he was "encouraged" by Mr. Jackson's words, but he indicated that the two men had not put all their differences behind them. "Well, you remember what Will Rogers said about that," Mr. Clinton said. "He said he didn't belong to an organized political party; he was a Democrat. I don't know that you can ever achieve complete harmony. I'm more interested in achieving clarity of purpose and principle and vigor and trying to unite people around a set of principles." Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jackson have sparred with words over Mr. Clinton's decision to use Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition meeting to criticize racially inflammatory comments by Lisa Williamson, who performs rap music as Sister Souljah. Mr. Jackson called the Governor's criticism a "sneak attack." Mr. Clinton beamed today as Mr. Conyers offered his endorsement. The Governor has received the conveniently timed endorsements of leading black officials in the past when he was involved in disputes with Mr. Jackson. Mr. Conyers declared the Sister Souljah dispute, which has mushroomed into a larger discussion about rap, race and politics, a "side issue" and said he endorsed Mr. Clinton after reading his economic plan, which has also been welcomed by many big-city mayors. "We've now made closure with the mayors of the cities, with the Democratic House leadership, with the members of the Congressional Black Caucus," Mr. Conyers said. "And I think that in what looks like a three-way race, my candidate looks better and better every day.".

320-> NEW IRAQI ENVOY APPOINTED AT U.N.
President Saddam Hussein is sending an envoy with considerable experience in Washington to represent Iraq at the United Nations, apparently with the daunting task of persuading the United States to ease pressure on Baghdad. The envoy, Nizar Hamdoun, a former under secretary in the Foreign Ministry, is expected to arrive early this week, replacing Abdul Amir al-Anbari, who had asked for a less demanding assignment and is to represent Iraq at the Unesco in Paris. Mr. Hamdoun was Iraq's Ambassador to Washington in 1983-87, when he not only successfully restored relations after a 16-year break but helped win Washington's backing for Baghdad in its long war against Iran. Iraq's Tough Stance His appointment to what is now Iraq's main forum for pleading its case comes at a particularly difficult moment, however, with the United States and its allies once again stepping up pressure on Baghdad. Iraq maintains that it has complied with the cease-fire the Security Council imposed on it at the end of the Persian Gulf war by agreeing to the destruction of its most dangerous weapons, and that it should be rewarded with an easing of the trade embargo imposed after its invasion of Kuwait. But the Administration has refused to countenance any relaxation, and earlier this year Iraq switched back to a more defiant policy. President Hussein broke off talks on a Security Council offer that would have allowed Iraq to sell oil to buy badly needed food and medicine. He also refused to define a new frontier with Kuwait and stepped up attacks on Kurd and Shiite rebels. The Allies' Reply The United States and its allies have responded by threatening Iraq with renewed bombing, banning Iraqi planes from flying over the Shiite area in the south and telling the United Nations to set up a separate aid operation for the Kurds. They are now discussing seizing $4 billion in frozen Iraqi accounts abroad and using the money to compensate victims of the invasion and to buy the food and medicine Iraq needs. At the same time, the divided Iraqi opposition is becoming more active. Arab diplomats said today that Syria had called a meeting of opposition groups in Damascus next Saturday to discuss tactics for removing President Hussein after a visit to President Hafiz al-Assad by the Kurdish dissident leader Massoud Barzani. To this unpromising situation, Mr. Hamdoun brings an understanding of Washington policy-making, a reputation as a good communicator, a wide circle of friends in the foreign policy establishment and what former Assistant Secretary of State Richard E. Murphy calls "the reputation of being a loyal Baathist but also an honest man, outside the inner circle." Whispers of Dissent His arrival also coincides with signs that Iraq may be trying to soften its reputation for ruthless brutality by reviving the promises of greater democracy that it made before the gulf war. Today a Government-owned newspaper in Baghdad carried an appeal by eight Iraqi intellectuals to the Government to be more democratic. The appeal came the day after President Hussein's son Udai also called for more democracy in a newspaper he edits. Iraq no longer has relations with the United States, and diplomats here say Mr. Hamdoun was chosen for the United Nations post in the hope that he can improve relations. A Man to Maneuver "He's being sent to see if there's some way to maneuver out of this mess," says Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institute in Washington. The son of a cavalry officer in the guard of the last King of Iraq, Mr. Hamdoun was educated by Jesuits in Baghdad before qualifying as an architect. But he made his career with the Baathist party, overseeing relations with Syria and serving as an under secretary in the Ministry of Information before going to Washington to reopen diplomatic relations. Since then regular trips back to the United States, for treatment of a cancer that is in remission, have allowed him to keep up old friendships. But many diplomats agree with Miss Kipper that he will "find it a lot harder to reestablish his own position today."

321-> PRO FOOTBALL; Jury Gets N.F.L. Case Today
Closing arguments were concluded here today in the National Football League trial over free agency. The eight-woman jury received instructions afterward from United States District Court Judge David Doty and will begin deliberations Wednesday morning. Both lead attorneys -- the league's Frank Rothman and the players' Jim Quinn -- were passionate in their summations. Each asked the jury to "use your common sense" in finding a verdict. Rothman said that the players were greedy for more money and that free agency "would be the destruction of the National Football League that we know today." Quinn said free agency would promote a better league and said that "it took guts for these eight players to get in this courtroom and fight those bunch of monopolists."

322-> COMPANY NEWS; P.&G. Plans To Eliminate Line of Juice
The Procter & Gamble Company said yesterday that it was closing its Citrus Hill orange juice division, ending a decadelong effort in the pure fruit juice business. Edwin Artzt, the chairman and chief executive of P. & G., said the company decided to quit the 100 percent juice business after it started slowly and was unable to gain on its two main rivals, the Seagram Company's Tropicana and the Coca-Cola Company's Minute Maid. "You can't make money in a business if your primary entry is a No. 3 brand, and you can't have a market leader if you don't have a competitive advantage," he said. "We just didn't have it and couldn't get it." P. & G. introduced Citrus Hill in the fall of 1982 and has waged a heated battle with rival juice makers in an effort to make a profit with its heavily promoted juice brand. The company, which is based in Cincinnati, also said it would sell its three remaining pure juice brands -- Speas Farm apple juice, Texsun orange and grapefruit juices and Lincoln apple juice. The decision enables the company "to focus on the rapidly growing juice drinks business -- a $10 billion world market -- where our results are strong and prospects are bright," P.& G. said. Juice drinks typically blend fruit juices with other ingredients, like sugar and water. P. & G.'s brands are Hawaiian Punch and Sunny Delight. Mr. Artzt predicted improved earnings and higher capital spending at the company, whose products include Tide detergent, Ivory soap, Pampers, Crest toothpaste, Pepto-Bismol and Pringles. P.& G. stock rose 37.5 cents, to $48.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it would add about 5 cents a share in 1993 and double that amount beyond next year. P. & G. earned $2.62 a share in fiscal 1992, which ended in June. Analysts, on average, estimate that it will earn $2.90 a share in fiscal 1993. The company said it will take a third-quarter after-tax charge of about $200 million that would probably have no effect on its dividend. It said it had hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to assist in the sale. P.& G. employs about 2,300 people in its United States juice products business, and about half will be affected by the changes. The company said it was not certain how many would lose their jobs. Last year, P. & G. ran into trouble with the Food and Drug Administration over its Citrus Hill labeling. It agreed to drop the word "fresh" from its "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" processed juice, after the F.D.A. said the label misled consuemers into thinking the juice was fresh when it was not.

323-> Sharpton's Headache: To Get Out the Vote
He barrels across the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, past a woman who blows him a kiss, past the girl on a pay phone who abruptly exclaims into the receiver, "I see Al Sharpton." On these nighttime Brooklyn sidewalks where a white face is as rare as an eclipse of the moon, the black preacher passes the street vendors who call, "How you doing, brother? You got my support." Then he enters the Slave Theatre for a meeting of the black faithful who first coalesced around the racially incendiary case of Tawana Brawley. The next day, the Rev. Al Sharpton is in Harlem, addressing a forum sponsored by a black sorority. He stays overnight with a family in a Bronx housing project. He is at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights for a debate that has turned into the Al Sharpton show -- Mr. Sharpton versus three empty chairs to symbolize the white candidates in the race for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. The three declined to attend. 'Something for Nothing' "They did not show. They have dissed the African-American community," said the moderator, Gary Byrd, who is broadcasting the event live over WLIB, the black-oriented radio station. Almost as often as the station break, he refers to the "something for nothing conspiracy" of white candidates who, he says, want black votes but "believe they can disrespect the black community and black press and get away with it." Often it seems as if Mr. Sharpton -- from his campaign headquarters in Bedford-Stuyvesant -- is running in an entirely different world from his white rivals, as he campaigns in the inner city, among all-black crowds where people speak to him in agony about crack houses on their blocks, of teen-agers shot in senseless violence, of joblessness and homelessness. For years, the 37-year-old Mr. Sharpton articulated these concerns in street marches, with the chant "No justice, no peace!" He derided moderate black politicians close to the Democratic Party as "cocktail sip Negroes" or "yellow niggers." Test of His Support But now, as he moves into the final week of his first run for office, Mr. Sharpton is struggling to channel the discontents of the street into a large turnout at the polls in a race that will test the depth of Mr. Sharpton's support as he challenges the established black leadership in the state. "All of our marching, all of our protesting, all of our agitating don't mean nothing if we do not have access to power," he thundered to fervent supporters gathered at a Bronx community center last week. Mr. Sharpton insists he can win the primary, although polls have shown him fighting City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman for third place. But he is also quick to explain what a showing of even 10 percent would do for a man whom critics have derided as a media creation with no more of a following than the 200 demonstrators he can always draw for a march. Supporters Unregistered "Anytime somebody with under $100,000 is starting to get double digits in the polls, somebody would appear to be a moron to say he only has got 200 fringe followers out there somewhere," Mr. Sharpton said recently. "If Mario Cuomo feels I represent 10 to 20 percent of state voters and he's got to run for re-election in 1994 and there's a crisis next year, certainly he would negotiate with me differently than if he thought I represented 200 people in Brooklyn." Mr. Sharpton's core supporters have always been the poor and disaffected, and he acknowledges that his greatest challenge is to get his people to the polls. "There is a large segment of people that relate to me that are not registered which will hurt me," he said. But he added that beyond the "angry masses" is a "large segment of people" that will vote for him. He is doing several things to pull out the vote. Alton H. Maddox Jr., the lawyer who also was an adviser to the Brawley family, is running "Operation Underground Railroad," which Mr. Sharpton describes as an effort to get each supporter to bring 20 friends to the voting booth. He says that five hundred black churches have been enlisted in a separate effort. And Caribbean van drivers, who compete with the city transit system with unlicensed van service, are being asked to offer rides to the polls. Mr. Sharpton's opponents, especially Ms. Holtzman and State Attorney General Robert Abrams, are pushing for their own share of the black vote. And the confrontational preacher has far from uniform appeal among blacks, even in neighborhoods like Crown Heights where he has been most visible. "I don't like politicians at all," said Patrick Abraham, 17 years old, who is too young to vote but who went to Medgar Evers with his youth group to hear Mr. Sharpton speak. "Al Sharpton -- to me he has a big mouth and I don't like people with big mouths." Contribution From Rangel But Mr. Sharpton and his campaign advisers already note, as a sign of future influence, that black Democrats who endorsed either Ms. Holtzman or Mr. Abrams have started to hedge their bets. Representative Charles Rangel of Harlem, a backer of Mr. Abrams, sent Mr. Sharpton a $1,000 campaign contribution. Representative Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn, who has endorsed Ms. Holtzman, recently visited a housing project at Mr. Sharpton's side. "He's doing a fantastic job at voter registration," Mr. Rangel said, explaining his contribution to Mr. Sharpton. "I still support Abrams but I think having a catalyst like Sharpton focuses attention on issues that never come up in the debate." Differences Within the Camp There are signs already of tensions inside Mr. Sharpton's inner circle over how to build further on the Senate race. "Whatever Sharpton does, there's already something else in the air," said Mr. Maddox. "Black people are in the formative stages of forming an independent political party." Mr. Maddox was an adviser along with Mr. Sharpton to Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager who claimed she was raped and abducted by whites. Mr. Abrams, who was named special prosecutor in the case, concluded that her tale was fabricated. Mr. Maddox's license to practice law was suspended in the aftermath of the case. Mr. Maddox said such a party, coming on the heels of a strong showing for Mr. Sharpton, "would serve notice to traditional black politicians that it will no longer be business as usual in the city." For now, Mr. Sharpton distances himself from such talk. Would Meet With Ferraro "I am committed at this point to try to change the Democratic party," he said. "If I see that become impossible then I would go toward a third party. But I clearly stayed away from that this year." He has declined to run in November on the line of the New Alliance Party, a controversial radical group with which he has had ties, and is even willing to speak about stumping for Geraldine A. Ferraro, the frontrunner in the Senate race if she becomes the Democratic nominee to face the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato. "I would certainly give it a serious thought and I would certainly sit down with her and talk about what ways we can agree," he said in an interview. It is not clear how well such newfound moderation will sit with Mr. Sharpton's base of the disaffected. When Mr. Sharpton noted at Medgar Evers College that in the year of the woman, the women in New York's Senate race "are not talking about our women," there were shouts from the virtually all-black audience of "blondes" and "lying tramps." Some of those who speak fervently about Mr. Sharpton have already written off the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom Mr. Sharpton describes as a mentor. Wilfred Forbes, 34 years old, a street vendor, raced to grab Mr. Sharpton's hand one night last week, then described Mr. Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, as his only heroes. Asked about Mr. Jackson, he said, "He seems to have been bought off. He ain't black no more."

326-> Reavis Cox, 91, Dies; A Marketing Authority
Reavis Cox, an internationally recognized marketing authority and former chairman of the department of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, died on Saturday at his home in Swarthmore, Pa. He was 91 years old. He died of natural causes, his wife, Rachel, said. Dr. Cox was born in Mexico of American missionary parents. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas and, in 1932, a doctorate in economics from Columbia University. He joined the Wharton School's faculty in 1935 and remained there until his retirement in 1971 as the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing. Along with several colleagues, Dr. Cox identified methods for studying the flow of ownership of goods, from the sources of component raw materials to the consumer, and systematically assessing the efficiency, cost and value added at each stage of distribution. He wrote or was the co-author of 11 books and numerous articles. At various times he was managing editor and editor in chief of both The American Marketing Journal and The Journal of Marketing. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David Cox of Fort Wayne, Ind.; a daughter, Rosemary C. Masters of New York, and five grandchildren.

328-> To Help Itself, Utility Aids Riot Area
For the Southern California Edison Company, the response to last month's riots did not end when it finally got the power back on. The utility, whose profits from selling electricity are directly dependent on the economic health of the Los Angeles area, saw that the unrest would be another blow to the long-term prospects of the region. The area was already being hurt by a severe recession and by a flight of companies and jobs to other states. The riots also made clear to corporate leaders the severity of the city's social problems, giving Edison a troubling glimpse of what the future holds if nothing is done to give inner-city residents more economic hope. So within two weeks of the rioting, the utility put together what is so far the biggest corporate financial commitment to improving conditions in some of the area's most blighted neighborhoods. The plan is to contribute $35 million worth of cash, buildings, labor and services over the next five years to create job training centers, support educational and charitable programs, and help businesses devastated by looting and arson. "We as a company will be successful only if the region is vibrant, and the region will be vibrant and healthy only if companies like ours assume some responsibility for leadership," said John E. Bryson, the chairman of Edison and its parent company, SCEcorp. Southern California Edison's response is an example of what government officials and economic development experts call enlightened corporate self-interest. If they are to succeed in building a stronger economic foundation for the poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles and other cities, those officials said, they will need to persuade many more companies to adopt that kind of attitude -- and then do more. Government officials have long looked to corporations to play a greater role in shoring up schools, providing jobs and job training and financing charities and community development efforts. But perhaps never before have corporations been so directly challenged by government officials and community leaders to make a lasting difference as they have in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. And although they express their thanks for programs like Edison's, government and community leaders ultimately want the business community to do more than make charitable contributions. They want companies to open factories, distribution centers and other operations in poor neighborhoods as a means of creating jobs for local residents and a strong framework for further economic growth. Opportunity for Profit In return, they acknowledge that government must work harder to give companies greater opportunity to make a profit from their investments in the inner city. No matter how civic-minded, they said, no company will stay long in any area if it is losing money. "Corporate America has to come together on a sustained, long-term basis to create opportunities that are money-making for them and that create jobs as well as real ownership possibilities for disadvantaged people," said Mark Fabiani, a Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles. "Anything short of that means failure." Mr. Fabiani said a number of large companies had already offered to open new factories or other operations in the area to create jobs. But none have made public announcements, and Mr. Fabiani declined to identify them. He said that the companies, local governments and the privately financed Rebuild L.A. effort headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, first wanted to study issues such as community support, tax breaks and low-interest loans that would give the companies a better chance of being successful in the long run. "Our goal has to be to convince corporations that these investments are in their best interests, that they are essential to their interests," Mr. Fabiani said. "They have to know that the investments will be profitable and ultimately advantageous to their shareholders." But Mr. Fabiani and others said it was unclear how many companies would be willing to make substantial investments in new operations in South-Central Los Angeles and other poor communities, especially once the publicity surrounding the unrest faded away along with the urgency of dealing with the underlying problems. 'Project for Marathoners' For every company that can identify a reason to make large-scale investments in improving the inner city, there clearly are many more that see little direct benefit to themselves in taking on the problems of security, insurance and an inexperienced work force by establishing some kind of permanent presence in a blighted area like South-Central Los Angeles. "This is a long-haul game, a project for marathoners," said Jon P. Goodman, the director of the Entrepreneur Program at the University of Southern California, who has worked extensively in aiding businesses in the inner city. "What I am really waiting to see is whether, after the crisis, after the pressure of the recent events abates, they are still there, still rolling these projects out." There are limits, in fact, to what even socially active companies like Edison are willing and able to take on, especially when it comes to actually creating new jobs in the areas that most need them. Mr. Bryson said Edison would try to step up hiring efforts to some extent in poor communities. Yet Edison, which like many large corporations has been reducing its work force, decided it could not prudently make a commitment to hiring any substantial number of people in coming years from the neighborhoods affected by the rioting, he said. Edison is instead concentrating much of its effort on job training programs. As part of its $35 million plan, it is allocating $6.5 million to developing such programs in Compton and Long Beach, two of the communities hardest hit by the rioting. In Compton, the company is donating an unused building it owns and will pay for it to be renovated and then finance the center's operations. The company expects the center to provide job training for hundreds of people each year. Forgiving Utility Bills The company plans to contribute $7.5 million in cash, equipment and technical expertise to various charities, economic development efforts and community organizations, and increase by $500,000 the $2.25 million it had previously planned to spend on a program to help "at risk" students in local schools. To help owners of homes and businesses destroyed in the rioting, the company will forgive bills owed to it by those owners and will provide low-interest loans toward the purchase of energy-efficient equipment as they rebuild. Edison will also make a multimillion-dollar donation to Rebuild L.A. And the company said it was still seeking suggestions from community leaders on how to spend an as-yet unallocated portion of the $35 million. "As an electric utility, we have a network of wires, but also a network of people in all of the affected communities," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, Edison's vice president for customer service. "We're talking to leaders in each community to see what's needed." For the most part, he said, the answers have centered on help in creating jobs and in improving education. But the company has also tried to address narrower and more immediate needs by soliciting employee suggestions. Ed Robinson, an energy services representative in Compton, suggested after talking to many customers that Edison provide some employees to help small-business owners fill out the complex forms needed to apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration. He is also pushing for the company to help involve gang members, unwed mothers and other disenfranchised residents in deciding how to address the community's problems. Key Is Involvement Economic development specialists say the key to any company's sustained efforts at community improvement is the involvement of employees. Edison executives concede that some employees oppose the spending of $35 million to address inner-city problems, especially at a time when the company is cutting employment. But over all, they said, employee support and involvement have been strong. "I was around after the Watts riots in '65, and I saw a lot of Band-Aid solutions," said Bill Thomas, an area manager in Compton. "I see some of the things we are doing now as having positive long-term effects."

332-> Market Place; True Believers In Value of Noise
AT first glance, the disclosure by Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. last week that insiders recently sold more than 300,000 shares of the company's stock could well be interpreted as a damaging loss of faith in a nine-year-old company with a promising technology but so far no profits. Yet, the company explained, this stock was sold so that five officers and directors could pay for warrants to buy still more of the stock. The warrants expired Sept. 30, and the effect of the transactions was to provide the company with $910,000 in additional cash for working capital. "This is a situation where the management is reinvesting in the company," said Dennis Miller, director of financial affairs at Noise Cancellation. Investors apparently agree. The company's shares have inched up in the last few days, closing at $3.50, up 18.75 cents, in over-the-counter trading. Instead of dipping into their savings, the officers sold stock to pay to exercise the warrants because, Mr. Miller said, "so much of their net worth is tied up in the company." If the management team, led by John J. McCloy 2d, the chairman, is a group of true believers, so are many other investors. The stock market's valuation of Noise Cancellation, about $180 million, includes plenty of optimism. The enthusiasm is based on the prospects for the company's anti-noise technology. It promises to silence the noise that is a bane of modern industrial life, generated by everything from appliances to automobiles to airplanes, relieving stress and saving energy. The electronic silencers work by producing sound waves with peaks and valleys opposite those of the sound to be silenced, a kind of aural antidote. Anti-noise has been around as a theory for decades; now microchip technology has made it possible to come up with noise-busting products. The specialized computer chips perform the lightning-quick calculations needed to recognize the target sound and generate a silencing wave. Noise Cancellation, based in Stamford, Conn., holds key patent rights in the field. And over the last three years, it has started joint product-development deals with large industrial companies worldwide. The roll call of partners includes the Walker division of Tenneco Inc., for electronic engine mufflers; the Detroit Diesel Corporation, also for engine mufflers; A.B. Electrolux, for quieting consumer appliances; the Foster Electric Company of Japan, for silencing headsets; Siemens Medical Systems, also for silencing headsets, and a marketing agreement with Philips Electronics N.V. With a growing list of deals, Mr. McCloy said, "the fundamentals of this business are getting stronger by the week." According to Gary Glaser, an analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, the main issues in assessing the outlook for Noise Cancellation are the commercial potential for anti-noise technology and how well the company is positioned to cash in on that technology. "I'm extremely bullish on both scores," he said. In the first half of 1992, Noise Cancellation reported a loss of $2.9 million on revenues of $2.2 million. Still, Mr. Glaser estimates that by 1995 Noise Cancellation could post profit of $19 million on revenues of just over $200 million, and that by 2000 income could hit $165 million on revenues of $1.7 billion. But even enthusiasts like Mr. Glaser caution that while Noise Cancellation has built some prototype electronic silencers and sold some, the high-volume products including auto mufflers and household appliances that should generate strong sales and profits for the company are "a couple of years down the road." Other analysts agree that trotting out a high-volume product will be a watershed for Noise Cancellation, but they remain skeptical until it happens. The potential market may be huge, they say, but when it will blossom is an unknown. Besides, they add, there is no shortage of competitors. The main rivals are Toshiba, Hitachi, the Digisonix division of Nelson Industries, the General Motors subsidiary Group Lotus P.L.C. and Active Noise and Vibration Technology Inc. "Noise Cancellation is strictly a price speculation at this stage -- an intriguing investment but very high risk," said Roland Williams, an analyst at the First Albany Corporation, who has participated in the price speculation. He said he bought Noise Cancellation at 50 cents a share in October 1990 and sold when it reached about $4.50 a share near the end of last year. If the stock price were to drop toward $1 a share, he added, he would he be tempted to buy again. Some short-sellers are certainly betting heavily that Noise Cancellation's shares will fall, holding a short-interest position in the company of more than 1.4 million shares. Few outsiders know Noise Cancellation better than Thomas Hesse, who left the company in 1987 to found Active Noise and Vibration Technology in Phoenix. The two companies share rights to some patents and each has separate patents. "Noise Cancellation has spent time and money in some areas of this technology, and they have some very good scientists," Mr. Hesse said. "And I think the growth in this industry will be so great that there will be room for several players."

334-> Program to Curb Domestic Abuse
In this central New Jersey town, Francis Eib, the police chief, can rattle off case after case in which domestic violence has led to killing. That's why he lobbied the 24 other municipalities in Middlesex County to participate in a program in which women living in fear of domestic abuse can hit a "panic button" pendant that secretly tells police that they are in danger. Middlesex County officials decided to join five other cities nationwide in trying the Abused Women's Active Response Emergency program, known as Aware, in the hopes of sparing women from physical abuse. The program started on Tuesday and will operate for six months before it is evaluated for long-term use. ADT Security Systems, based in Parsippany, N.J., developed Aware and operates the free program. Ending in Death Aware could have helped avoid some incidents of domestic violence that led to killings in the county, such as when John J. Arias stormed into the Edison, N.J., home of his ex-girlfriend in 1991, Chief Eib said. Mr. Arias wounded his ex-girlfriend and killed her mother, Linda M. Galbo. He was convicted of murder on Sept. 22 and a jury has recommended he serve a life term. He has not yet been sentenced. There were 61 killings in the state tied to domestic violence last year, according to the 1991 New Jersey State Police Uniform Crime Report. Three of those killings were in Middlesex County. Essex County had the highest number of reported domestic violence incidents in 1991 with 4,862, the report said. There were 3,709 reported domestic violence cases last year in Middlesex County, up 8 percent from 1990, the report said. The report stated that there were 55,698 domestic abuse cases statewide last year. The numbers make the case for bringing Aware to the county, officials said. "The women who have received the Aware pendants are at grave risk, but living in the community," said Jackie Marich, executive director of Women Aware Inc., a shelter for abused women and children in Middlesex County.

335-> Art in Review
'Joan Mitchell: Pastel' Whitney Museum of American Art 945 Madison Avenue (at 75th Street) Manhattan Through June 21 This exhibition of more than three dozen of Joan Mitchell's recent pastels provides a distillation of her abstract painterly style. Essential to all of her work is the attention she gives to the physical weight of pigment. The pastel is applied in thick, emphatic strokes here, tangles of loose calligraphic thread there, with a judicious use of rubbing, smudging and overdrawing throughout. The interwoven colors are many and rich, with a bias toward vegetable hues -- succulent greens, dark reds -- that make a few of these drawings look like informal but exotic bouquets. What sustains the work's interest over the span of the show, however, is the sense of temperamental variety it conveys. The drawings in which lines are pressed together in vertical bunches or scrawled horizontally have an adamant, insistent quality different from the Impressionist sunniness that one associates with many of Ms. Mitchell's paintings. Especially moving here is a pastel with an off-center knot of color that droops like a wilted flower under a descending veil of white pigment and another in which two thin red lines curve down the center of the paper's white field like razor-thin, intersecting wounds. The emotional ambiguity these two works convey is sometimes hidden in Ms. Mitchell's grandly conceived larger paintings, but it remains, as these pastels suggest, an important aspect of her art.

336-> PRO FOOTBALL; Petrovic Career as a Net May Not Go Past 1993
While they attempt to re-sign the free agent small forward, Chris Morris, and fill the vacancy created by the departure of Terry Mills, another financial and personnel crisis may be slowly developing for the New Jersey Nets. After a workout at the Nets' practice facility in North Bergen, N.J. earlier this week, Drazen Petrovic, their leading scorer last season, said he has already received six preliminary offers from teams in Italy and Spain for next season. "Two from Spain and four from Italy," said Petrovic, who said he has instructed his agent, Los Angeles-based Warren Legarie, to press the European teams for a sense of how much they would be willing to pay for the shooting guard, who will turn 28 later this month. Friends Make Big Money He pointed out that his friends and teammates on the Croatian National Team, Dino Radja and Toni Kukoc, earn $3 million and $2.5 million a year playing in Italy. Petrovic, who will be a restricted free agent following the coming season, will earn roughly $1.5 million for 1992-93. Given his popularity in Europe, where he played several seasons before joining the Portland Trail Blazers in 1989 and returned to lead Croatia to a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympics, Petrovic is certain to attract offers that would at least double his current income. While it is highly probable that the Nets would be willing to pay him in the $3 million-a-year range, Petrovic added that he does not intend to use the European offers as leverage to force the Nets into extending his contract within the next few months because he doesn't yet know if he willwant to return. "I wouldn't want to sign a three- or four-year deal with the Nets right now," he said. "I want to see how things work out this year. "I'm not satisfied with being one of the 16 teams that makes the playoffs but then goes out in the first round. I'm committed to winning. I want it to be a situation where everyone is committed, where there's a work ethic and people work hard over the summer. If we are going to be building a championship caliber team with Chuck Daly, then I'd stay." It seems unlikely that Petrovic, having established himself as an offensive force in the National Basketball Association and having recently obtained his green card, would prefer to play in Europe. But knowing that he could get equal compensation and be closer to his family in Zagreb will give him a powerful bargaining chip should he want to leave the Nets, who would have no right of first refusal if he signed with a team in Europe. Petrovic's reluctance to commit long-term to the Nets is undoubtedly the aftertaste of the inner turmoil that gripped the Nets last season, when, among other blood feuds, there was some bitterness between Petrovic and some of the other Nets, like Morris and Derrick Coleman. Playoff Frustrations Near the conclusion of the team's final playoff game against Cleveland, Petrovic and Morris had an angry exchange, after which, according to Sam Bowie, Petrovic refused to play the last couple of minutes. Petrovic denied benching himself, and instead blamed the frustration of the Nets having blown a large lead and a game that would have forced a Game 5 showdown. His wait-and-see attitude on the coming season, nonetheless, reflects a concern about the ability of his younger teammates to eliminate the pettiness and focus solely on winning. "Hopefully," said Petrovic, "he'll have more control and there won't be all that off-the-court stuff." REBOUNDS CHUCKY BROWN, a 6-foot-8-inch, free-agent forward was signed yesterday by the Nets to a one-year contract. Brown, drafted in 1989 by Cleveland out of North Carolina State, has averaged 6.9 points and 2.8 rebounds in his N.B.A. career. The Cavaliers waived Brown in December, and he was picked up by the Los Angeles Lakers. "Chucky has been a good performer in his first three years and has experience as a starter," said General Manager WILLIS REED. "We are always looking to strengthen our team and improve our depth and Chucky can fill a role for us." The Nets did not announce terms of the deal.

337-> Sparring During the Campaign Between Abrams and Ferraro
During the bruising Democratic primary campaign, Geraldine A. Ferraro was bombarded with allegations that linked her or her family to organized crime. Most of the accusations came from City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, but State Attorney General Robert Abrams raised similar questions. Here is a look at some of Mr. Abrams's statements: *Aug. 19 -- The Village Voice publishes an article with the headline "Gerry and the Mob," identifying what it said were 24 mob figures as supporters or business associates of Ms. Ferraro or her husband, John A. Zaccaro, or their parents. Mr. Abrams, describing himself as "gravely disturbed" by the article, says New Yorkers "must seriously consider whether Geraldine A. Ferraro's lack of an ethical compass makes her fit to hold a high position of public trust." Ms. Holtzman used the headline with the word "Mob" in subsequent television commercials; Mr. Abrams did not. *Sept. 8 -- With a week before the election, Mr. Abrams accuses Ms. Ferraro of failing to release documents that would show her and husband's partners in at least eight corporations or partnerships. Ferraro aides say Mr. Abrams is trying to suggest that she has mob ties, and Ms. Ferraro, denying any interest in the companies, lashes back at Mr. Abrams: "Guilt by ethnicity has been succeeded by guilt by postal address." *Sept. 11 -- The Abrams campaign releases a television commercial that says in part, "While Bob Abrams was taking on the mob, Geraldine Ferraro was taking illegal campaign contributions." The Ferraro camp says the juxtaposition is an obvious attempt to tar her with a mob brush and that Mr. Abrams misled viewers by failing to mention that the violation cited in the ad concerned a loan Ms. Ferraro had taken from her own family. *Sept. 12 -- Mr. Abrams holds a news conference to demand that Ms. Ferraro release her Congressional papers, which a prosecutor in Queens had unsuccessfully sought to subpoena in 1987 during the bribery trial of her husband, Mr. Zaccaro, who was acquitted. When hecklers demand that Mr. Abrams get "out of the gutter," Mr. Abrams shouts, "She doesn't want people to know her past or background. Here she's sending in stooges to break up our press conference." *Sept. 13 -- During a televised debate, Mr. Abrams is asked whether he believes Ms. Ferraro has ties to organized-crime figures. Mr. Abrams responds: "That's not relevant to this discussion." Pressed for an answer, he says: "I never said that. To my knowledge, I don't know, and it's not relevant here."

338-> Personal Injury Victims Deserve Jury Trial
To the Editor: In "Clumsy? Sue New York City" (Op-Ed, Sept. 30), Saul B. Shapiro, a lawyer, tells of his experience dabbling in "negligence cases" for four months, defending New York City pro bono. He waxes philosophical on the burden such lawsuits impose upon a city overburdened with fiscal woes. His argument is that these apparently frivolous cases don't deserve a jury trial. He wants them relegated to an arbitrator or transferred to the Court of Claims, where judges paid by New York can more economically dispose of them. He reminds me of the definition of a conservative -- a liberal who's been mugged. Mr. Shapiro might not be so ready to waive the right of a trial by a jury of his peers if he were the injured party. He might not be so ready to trust the life of his injured spouse or child, maimed or crippled as the result of the city's negligence in allowing a dangerous pothole to remain carelessly unattended, if he knew that the decision of an arbitrator was final, without recourse to review or appeal from a possibly unfair or improper decision. Although I am a plaintiff's personal injury trial lawyer, representing victims of carelessness every day, I was also an assistant corporation counsel, defending such cases for the city. I've seen both sides. Undoubtedly, there are frivolous cases. But these almost never survive to the trial stage. And Mr. Shapiro well knows that more than 90 percent of personal injury lawsuits are disposed of before trial. It seems very fashionable these days to trash trial lawyers and, by inference, their clients. We are, it seems, responsible for everything from consumption to AIDS. This is an easy and, thanks to articles like Mr. Shapiro's, a convenient copout. Indeed, the very headline on his article betrays prejudice and insensitivity to those with meritorious claims and no other recourse. JAMES WOLFE New York, Oct. 1, 1992

339-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Perot Outdraws a Playoff Game
The half-hour paid political announcement that Ross Perot bought on Tuesday night attracted a higher rating than most regularly scheduled entertainment shows on all three networks. The Perot commercial on CBS even beat Tuesday night's National League playoff game, which followed it on the same network, as well as two shows on NBC and one on ABC. For the half hour, Mr. Perot scored a 12.2 rating. Each rating point represents 931,000 homes, and the A.C. Nielsen company said the total number of households watching Mr. Perot was 11.4 million. Nielsen estimated that 16.5 million people had watched the Perot commercial. By normal television standards, the Perot commercial qualified as something of a hit. It easily beat its competition on NBC at 8 P.M., an episode of the series "Quantum Leap," which had an 8.9 rating. The baseball game that followed Mr. Perot had a 12 rating. Mr. Perot also beat "Reasonable Doubts" on NBC, which had a 10.6 rating on Tuesday night, and "Going to Extremes" on ABC, which had a 12 rating. Mr. Perot's score was better than the average prime-time rating for all the shows on NBC and ABC last week. NBC had an average rating of 11, and ABC had an 11.8.

342-> Primaries Are No Test of Character
Despite the strong voter turnout in New Hampshire, many people remain deeply dissatisfied with how we select our Presidential nominees. Leading up to this year's campaign, we heard plenty of promises from the media about greater attention to the substance of candidates' ideas. Soon enough, though, personal issues took over. Already, Bill Clinton and his wife have had to justify their marriage, and he has been forced to defend a thoughtful letter written as a college student coming to terms with the draft and the Vietnam War. Paul Tsongas has stripped to a swimsuit to prove his health. And Bob Kerrey has had to explain repeatedly why his family business cannot afford to buy private health insurance for its workers. How did these become issues in a Presidential campaign? Character is a legitimate political issue, especially in a President. We have had Presidents with personal problems that seriously diminished their public judgment and power to govern effectively. We should learn about these problems before they are elected, not afterward. But the campaign is actually neglecting the qualities of character that relate most directly to the capacity to govern. Voters deserve to know about any candidate who wants to be President. We are voting for a person, after all, not a list of issue positions. We should know not just what the candidates say about issues, but who they are: Their depth, intelligence, honesty, sense of responsibility, courage. We should know if they are stupid, arrogant, dishonest, careless. This is why the public is eager to get past the campaign handlers and the managed messages. It is why we so avidly watch the Presidential debates, searching for any clues of what really moves the candidates. Easily lost in the obsession with personal character, however, are more relevant questions about political character. Some of these questions are profound: What are the candidate's core political values? Does he have a firm sense of the direction in which he wants to lead the nation? Is he secure with himself -- with his convictions and his conscience? Other questions are more mundane, but hardly unimportant: Does the candidate have the skill to build a coalition among disparate groups? Will he be able to gain the trust and respect of members of Congress? Will he be able to handle himself with foreign leaders? Does he have the force of character and persuasive talent to get others to go along with him on controversial decisions? Does he have the judgment to select good advisers and Cabinet members? Unlike a parliamentary system, where leaders are picked by peers who know them, we have developed a self-nomination system where almost anyone with the ambition can run for President. A candidate is not required to pass any test; he or she does not need any organizational base of support; it is not even necessary for him or her to have been elected to office before. Dealing with questions of political character in the campaign has become so difficult because we have confused the party nomination process with the Presidential election itself. The election is the business of the people. But the nomination is more properly the business of the parties. The problem lies in reforms, especially in the Democratic Party, that were supposed to open the nomination process and build public trust. Instead, they have produced an almost universal suspicion of the candidates. In turn, party leaders have lost the power to screen candidates and select a nominee they believe will best compete and represent the party in the November election. Under these circumstances, the mass media become the only forum for dealing with questions of character, personal or political. Voters end up having to substitute for a nomination process that is incapable of passing judgment on character. Rumors begin to pass for news, and reporters are forced to engage in the psychoanalysis of candidates. Everyone involved is cheapened -- the candidates, the reporters and the voters. The solution is to reduce the influence of the primaries and boost the influence of party leaders, who can be held accountable for the personal and political character of a nominee. The "super-delegates" category established within the Democratic Party after 1984 allows some opportunity for this, but it should be strengthened. In November, the American people will once again vote to decide who will occupy the most powerful public office on earth. A Presidential election is our national celebration of democracy. It should provide an occasion for serious debate worthy of a great country. The process should have some dignity -- even nobility. Our citizens deserve a full opportunity to become informed, not just about the issues, but about what kind of political character each candidate would bring to the Presidency.

343-> Israeli Aide's Trip Linked to China Ties
Israel and China are expected to establish diplomatic relations for the first time during a trip by Foreign Minister David Levy to Beijing toward the end of the month, senior officials here said today. The Levy trip has been veiled in secrecy, and the Foreign Ministry declined to confirm either that he would be going to China or that an agreement to create formal ties was imminent. Nonetheless, other Israeli officials said the Foreign Minister would probably leave for Beijing in two weeks, adding that he would not be setting off on such a journey unless Israel expected to fulfill its long-held desire for normal relations with the Chinese. Once such ties were established, they said, it would clear the way for China to take part in the third phase of the Middle East peace process, scheduled to begin in Moscow on Jan. 28. That is the so-called multilateral talks on water resources, arms control and other regional issues that might include as many as 35 countries. High-Level Contacts In late November the Palestinian news agency reported that the Palestine Liberation Organization had been told by the Chinese that they want to take part in the multilateral round. But Israeli officials said China was well aware that it would first have to give Israel the diplomatic recognition the Israelis have long wanted. High-level contacts have picked up considerably in recent months, with the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, making a secret trip to Beijing two months ago, followed by a return visit to Jerusalem two weeks ago by China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Yang Fuchang, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to come here. Although Israel was quick to recognize the People's Republic of China after the Communist revolution in 1949, the countries never developed diplomatic relations. But they have long had trade, scientific and other contacts that include arms sales by Israel to China that are said to total several billion dollars. "It's been substantial, and it's been going on for 5 or 10 years," said Gerald M. Steinberg, a strategic-studies specialist at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv. According to Professor Steinberg, Israeli sales to China have included tanks, aircraft technology, avionics and electronics. There have also been reports about Israeli help for China's missile program, he said, probably including the new M-9 surface-to-surface missile that Israel now fears China might try to sell to Syria and other Middle East countries. He and other Israelis say they expect Beijing to view Israel as a possible source of Western technology and military expertise. For Israel,perspective, a major aim is to slow China's arms sales to the Middle East, and Professor Steinberg said a high priority is to keep Syria from getting the M-9. Israel is also concerned that China is negotiating sales of nuclear technology to Algeria and Iran. On diplomatic issues, Israel hopes for a more even-handed Middle East policy from the Chinese, who support Palestinian demands for self-determination and for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. But they have been quoted recently as accompanying such familiar calls with appeals that Israel's security be guaranteed.

344-> Review/Film Festival; World-Weary Youths Adrift in Hong Kong
Hong Kong, with its modern skyscrapers soaring over a misty harbor framed by a spectacular mountain backdrop, is one of the most photogenic cities in the world. And it has never looked more imposingly spiffy than in Clara Law's gorgeous "Autumn Moon," which the New York Film Festival is presenting tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. and Monday at 9:15 P.M. at Alice Tully Hall. But in Miss Law's elegiac comedy, the city also symbolizes a modern world in which technology and popular culture have all but erased cultural traditions that are centuries old. In aerial shots of the city's skyscrapers, parks and beltways, Hong Kong could be any modern metropolis. The young people adrift in this environment tote expensive cameras and film equipment, eat at McDonald's and drop the names of pop stars. As they wander around, conversing in a careful, slightly broken English, they exude an uneasy melancholia that, given their ages, seems premature. Tokio (Masatoshi Nagase), the film's world-weary young protagonist, has come to Hong Kong from Japan, looking for good restaurants, he says. When he first meets Wai (Li Pui Wai), a 15-year-old girl who lives with her aged grandmother, he is fishing in a harbor that seems unlikely to yield much of anything. In an early conversation, he regales her with the prices of everything from his camera to his underwear. When Wai worries that in Canada, where her parents have recently moved, no one will have heard of Madonna, he assures her: "Don't worry. Madonna is everywhere." The character is also an intrepid Lothario. While in Hong Kong, he begins an affair with Miki (Maki Kiuchi), the sister of a woman he seduced and coldly dropped. Divorced and a bit older than Tokio, Miki is flawlessly beautiful, yet she keeps referring to her wrinkles and evinces a pathetic gratitude for his attentions. Tokio also encourages Wai to ask a young classmate whom she fancies out on a date. When they meet, all he can talk about are his plans to go to America and make a fortune as a computer-wise nuclear physicist. "Autumn Moon" is more concerned with ways of looking at the world than with telling a dramatic story. Although visually magnificent, it is not especially deep or emotionally involving. Like the city itself, the characters are in transition, caught in a cultural void between East and West. Visually, the film alternates between lingering shots of the city and its environs, all photographed with an exquisite eye for composition, and the more constricted, bluish pictures of the same scenes as viewed through the lens of Tokio's movie camera. When the characters, who seem to be perpetually at loose ends in a city that is almost empty of people, have nothing better to do, they interview one another. Beneath his suave exterior, Tokio reveals himself as a nihilist. His greatest fear, he tearfully admits, is that life is worthless. The traditions that the modern world is sweeping away are represented by Wai's 80-year-old grandmother. The ailing old woman cooks traditional meals that seem exotic to Tokio when Wai takes him home for dinner. She also practices daily devotions in front of a Buddhist shrine in her apartment. The fading old ways are ultimately symbolized by a mid-autumn ceremony involving bamboo-and-paper lanterns that are set on fire and floated out on the water. That ceremony is re-enacted by the young people in "Autumn Moon," but using plastic and light bulbs. As their electric lanterns drift away from the shore to an explosion of fireworks, one senses that a way of life is being inexorably washed out to sea with nothing to replace it. AUTUMN MOON Directed by Clara Law; screenplay (in English and Cantonese with English subtitles) and editing by Fong Ling Ching; director of photography, Tony Leung; music by Lau Yee Tat, Tats; produced by Ms. Law and Fong Ling Ching. At Alice Tully Hall, as part of the 30th New York Film Festival. Running time: 108 minutes. This film has no rating. Tokio . . . Masatoshi Nagase Wai . . . Li Pui Wai Grandmother . . .

345-> EASTERN COLLEGE REPORT
C. W. Post Sean Sharkey, the St. John's quarterback, might pay a little extra attention tonight against C. W. Post at Redmen Field in Queens. The Pioneers are going to come at Sharkey with blitzes from inside and outside. That was the formula against Iona's Billy Hyland last week and the Gaels' passer never had a chance. There were 13 sacks by Post defenders and three passes intercepted in a 24-0 victory. Tailback Joe Brusca, who had 218 yards rushing against Iona, will again be the spearhead of the Post offense. St. John's has its own super running back in Tony Russo, who has gained 820 yards in six games. The Pioneers' Liberty Conference record is 2-0-1. Wagner is 3-0 in the conference, and St. John's is 2-1. The next decisive match comes one week from tomorrow: Wagner at Post. Wagner The Seahawks, 5-1 over all, travel to Glassboro, N.J., to take on Rowan, one of only four undefeated and untied teams among the 86 Division III competitors in the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Rowan used to be known as Glassboro State, but the school's name was changed earlier this year in recognition of a major benefactor. But the uniforms still say Glassboro. "We didn't have time to order new ones," said John Bunting, the former Philadelphia Eagles linebacker now in his fifth season as head coach. The Wagner-Rowan contest will have an impact on the selection of four teams from the East to compete in the Division III national tournament, which begins Nov. 21. Two Rowan standouts have been inside linebackers Joe Low and Bruce Davis. The latter is a transfer from Delaware State with pro potential, according to Bunting. The usual high expectations apply for Wagner's senior quarterback, Terry O'Hare, who is closing in on several Seahawk career passing records. Another ace is Ryan Tobin, the linebacker and co-captain who averages 13 tackles a game and has five sacks. The other undefeated and untied ECAC teams are Ithaca, 6-0; Middlebury, 4-0, and Rochester, 6-0. Ithaca The Bombers, who have outscored six opponents by a hefty margin of 263-75, may face a bit of a challenge at home tomorrow against Buffalo State. That's because Buffalo State is smarting some from its first defeat, a 19-15 upset by Buffalo, after four victories. Ithaca's Jeff Wittman, an outstanding running back, has now scored 13 touchdowns and is averaging 7 yards per carry. The Bombers' winning streak is at 15 and they continue to be ranked No. 1 in the N.C.A.A. East poll. The top of the ranking fills out as follows: No. 2 is Rowan, 6-0; No. 3, Rochester, 6-0; No. 4, C. W. Post, 5-0-1; No. 5, Buffalo State, 4-1, and Worcester Tech, 5-1. The Buffaloes Buffalo State is a State University of New York college with 10,000 students. The team nickname is the Bengals. Jerry Boyes, an Ithaca alumnus, is the head coach and last year's team had a 9-2 record that included a playoff victory over Worcester Tech for the ECAC Northeast title. The University of Buffalo is also a SUNY institution, one with 18,000 students, and the nickname is the Bulls. Last Saturday's victory over Buffalo State was a big one for the first-year coach, Jim Ward, a onetime star at Maryland. The Bulls (2-5) play host to Hofstra (4-3) tomorrow. New Haven The undefeated Chargers' 66-7 trouncing of American International failed to advance the team in the national Division II poll. New Haven (6-0) stayed in sixth place. New Haven, whose offense averages 631.7 yards and 55.3 points a game, plays its crosstown rival, Southern Connecticut (3-3) tomorrow. The typical Charger score this season has been 55-27 and running back Roger Graham has gained 1,153 yards, 192 per game. Lafayette The Leopards, the pre-season choice of the coaches to win the Patriot League championship, play their first league game tomorrow, at Fordham. In splitting six out-of-conference contests, Lafayette has defined itself as a team that will trade touchdowns with any foe and remain competitive to the final second. Its average score has been 34-31 and the losses were to Princeton by 3 points, Cornell by 11 and Army by 2. Tom Kirchnoff, the 6-foot-3-inch, 210-pound quarterback, is having "as good a season as you could ask for," said Coach Bill Russo. Add Erik Marsh, ranked No. 5 among I-AA rushing leaders, and there's a potent offensive duo. Defense? Don't ask. Sacred Heart Last season, the first football team at the school in Fairfield, Conn., won five of nine games and everyone was delighted. This season is another story. The Pioneers have lost all five games and play Catholic at home tomorrow. Coach Gary Reho even tried his star linebacker, Dave LeSage, at quarterback and the result was one pass completion for five yards against Nichols.

NEW YORK CITY CAN A SMILE HELP TO CURE? If you smile at patients, help them read their own charts, let them sleep all night without waking them up for tests, provide a kitchen where they can make a sandwich or brew a cup of tea -- in other words, if you treat each patient like a person rather than an illness -- will they get better faster? That is the question behind a $2 million experiment at Beth Israel Hospital. Page 1. NO RAISES FOR CHURCH EMPLOYEES The Archdiocese of New York, struggling to control rising costs, has frozen the salaries of 1,600 lay employees and the monthly stipends of 1,500 priests. The freeze is the latest of a series of steps taken by the archdiocese to cut its expenses, including closing schools and cutting the work force of Catholic Charities. Page 25. SUSPECT SAID TO HAVE BLOODY KNIFE The police officer who arrested the black teen-ager accused of fatally stabbing a rabbinical scholar in Crown Heights last summer told a jury how he found a bloodied knife and dollar bills in the suspect's pocket.

347-> Rising Yen: Japan's Mixed Blessing
Amid the commotion in the European foreign exchange markets, the Japanese yen has staged a rally and is emerging as perhaps the strongest major currency right now, a development that could hurt Japan's already weakened automobile and electronics giants. The yen closed here on Thursday at 120.25 yen to the dollar, a high for Tokyo after rising as high as 119.83 earlier in the day. Today the yen weakened a bit, closing at 120.85, Just last week the yen was as low as 125 against the dollar and at the beginning of August was down to 128. [ In New York trading Friday the dollar was quoted at 120.75 yen, up from 120.55 yen late Thursday. On Wednesday, the dollar plunged as low as 119.55 yen before recovering a bit. ] The yen has been gaining in the last few weeks even against the German mark, whose strength has caused a crisis for the British pound, the French franc and other European currencies. At the beginning of the month, the mark was worth 89 yen; now it is worth 80. 'Full-Court Press' "It's full-court-press, yen strength against all currencies," said Paul A. Summerville, senior economist for Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. The strength of its currency is likely to prove a mixed blessing for Japan. It could alleviate some of the pressure on Japan's beleaguered banks and make it less expensive for Japan to import the oil and other raw materials it depends on. Politically, a strong yen could help mitigate a soaring trade surplus by making Japanese exports seem more expensive to the world and foreign products cheaper to the Japanese. But for automobile and electronics companies that depend heavily on exports, the high yen could deal another blow at a time when the companies are already suffering heavily from a slump in Japan's domestic market. The net overall impact of a higher yen could be to prolong the nation's recession, some economists say, even in the face of the Government's $86 billion stimulative spending plan. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other top officials have said in the last two days that the Government would consider intervening in the market if the yen experiences too sharp a rise, but that this did not appear to be the case yet. The prospect of intervention has helped keep the yen from rising further, analysts said. Gradual Change Sought But Japanese officials actually appear to be more interested in making sure exchange rate changes are gradual, not in keeping the yen from rising. Indeed officials of the Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan have generally been in favor of a rise in the yen and Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, reiterated Thursday that he still favored a firming of the yen over the long term, according to press reports here. Still, investors in the Tokyo stock market interpreted the developments favorably. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 327.23 points on Thursday but then fell back by 215.19 today to close at 18,394.76. With Japan's own economy in a steep slump and interest rates low, the yen hardly appears to be a candidate for a strong rally. Many executives and economists think the yen looks good only by default, as investors seek to escape the turmoil in Europe and because prospects for the American economy are uncertain. "The main reason for the sharp rise of the yen doesn't exist in the yen itself," said Akira Satate, deputy general manager of foreign exchange at the Bank of Tokyo. Strength Seen Fleeting Some executives said the current strength of the yen would be only transitory. But others say the same factors that have brought the yen to its current position will drive it even higher. In addition, some people are hoping the economy here will recover because of the Government's stimulatory package announced last month. "The yen is now a safe-haven currency," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economics and market analysis for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., who thinks the yen will rise to 115 to the dollar or even higher. Despite its poor economy and its political scandals, Japan has a more certain political and economic outlook than the United States and many European countries, he said. Japan's strong trade and current account surpluses are also helping keep the yen strong, he said. The prospect of a higher yen is sending chills through the board rooms of Japan's electronics and automobile companies, which are already facing periods of extremely low profits or even losses. Takashi Matsuda, managing director and chief financial officer of the Honda Motor Company, said in a statement that if the yen stayed at its current level or gained strength it would have unfavorable effects both on Honda's export profits and on the Japanese economy. The company, which gets nearly half its revenues from sales in North America, has been basing its financial projections on the assumption of 130 yen to the dollar. In part because of the gradual strengthening of the yen since last year, Japanese auto makers have already been raising auto prices in the United States more than their American competitors, and have lost some market share. "The move in the currency right now is the best thing that's happened to Detroit in a long time," said Stephen Usher, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International in Tokyo. For Casio, the Japanese manufacturer of calculators, watches and other electronic gadgets, each 1-yen rise in the exchange rate translates into a reduction in pretax profit of 1 billion yen, or more than $8 million, said Toshio Isobe, a spokesman for the company. But raising prices right now would be difficult, he said, given the weak economies throughout the world. Japanese banks could also get a break in meeting new requirements for the capital they must have relative to their assets. The sharp fall in stock prices in the last two and a half years has already put some banks in danger of not being able to meet those requirements because some gains on stocks are counted in the capital calculations. Mr. Summerville of Jardine Fleming said that about 25 percent of the asset of the major Japanese banks were in dollars, such as loans for real estate in the United States. With the yen strengthening, less capital, as measured in yen, is needed to cover those assets. "This is good for Japan because it gives the banks more breathing room," he said. Japan has managed to adjust to a much bigger gain in the yen that was caused by the 1985 Plaza Accord, in which major nations agreed to strengthen the yen in an attempt to slow Japan's export machine. By early 1988 the yen had risen to almost 120 to the dollar -- a record passed only this week -- from about 250 yen to the dollar in 1985. The sharp change in the currency caused an economic slump here, but one from which Japan recovered with dazzling speed. To make up for tougher export markets, Japan stimulated its own economy with fiscal measures, leading to a domestic boom. Manufacturing companies invested heavily in automation to improve efficiency and moved some operations offshore so they could remain competitive in world markets. And with its currency strong, Japanese companies became major buyers of downtown skyscrapers, Hollywood studios, oceanside golf courses and other American property. The Japanese will not be able to rely on the domestic market for help this time. However, with banks nursing bad loans and companies in weak condition, the new strength of the yen is not expected to set off a new shopping spree for foreign properties.

348-> HOCKEY; Islanders Play 8 Minutes, but Leafs Play Whole Game
The Islanders solved a three-goal deficit with a midgame scoring spurt tonight, but because they did more aimless scrambling than intelligent skating, they found no solution to match Toronto's fourth goal and wound up with a 4-3 defeat at Nassau Coliseum. "We stunk," said Ray Ferraro. "We didn't deserve to win. We played eight minutes of hockey, and that's not enough." The loss, their 23d of the season, curtailed a winning streak at two games and inspired a derogatory tirade from Coach Al Arbour. "I can't think of one player I can single out on our team that played decent, never mind well," said Arbour. "They were all bad." The Maple Leafs, in contrast, were decent, and that was all that was needed. Glenn Anderson, one of the freshly imported teamload of veterans charged with turning the Toronto youth experiment of the 80's into something a little more predictable, won the game for the Maple Leafs with his second goal of the game. The rising shot glanced off an Islander player's leg and ultimately bumped along into the net off goalie Mark Fitzpatrick's pads three minutes into the final period. The Islanders must have sharpened their skates between the first and second periods because once Mike Bullard put Toronto up, 3-0, at 2:09 of the second, the home team finally began to behave like an interested participant. Until then, the Islanders had seemed disinclined to return from the weeklong hiatus they enjoyed during the All-Star Game break. The Maple Leafs, reaclimated to the rigors of the regular schedule by Wednesday's 5-2 loss against Boston, took advantage of it. "Maybe we should've played exhibition games during the break to keep our minds on hockey," said Derek King. "If this keeps up, we'll be getting our golf clubs out real early." Volek Starts a Rally Set up by King, David Volek began the comeback by snapping a shot past Rick Wamsley from the left circle at 5:40. King, who now has a career-high 28 goals and 46 points, cut the Maple Leaf lead to 3-2 with his 14th power play goal of the season at 17:58. Just as the Islanders were in danger of coming up empty on their fifth power play of the night, Jamie Macoun created some clutter by shoving Pierre Turgeon into the net. As Turgeon, who had just taken a shot, and Wamsley, who had just stopped it, ended up on their backsides in the webbing, King slipped over to the right post and calmly lofted the rebound over them. Benoit Hogue blasted his game-tying 40-foot slapshot past Wamsley at 18:52. The goal was Hogue's 20th of the season, a career high, and his 47th point, another career high. Canucks 3, Red Wings 1 DETROIT (AP) -- Jyrki Lumme scored the tie-breaking goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time as Vancouver set a team record with its fourth consecutive road victory. Canadiens 3, Bruins 1 BOSTON (AP) -- Denis Savard scored one goal and assisted on another as Montreal broke a streak without a victory at three games and increased its Adams Division lead to 13 points over Boston. Goalie Patrick Roy had 32 saves in recording his 25th victory of the season as Boston took its first setback after five consecutive victories. Sabres 5, Penguins 4 PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Donald Audette scored 3:15 into overtime to complete Buffalo's four-goal rally as the Sabres defeated Pittsburgh, the second successive game the Penguins have squandered a three-goal third-period lead. Jets 1, Flyers 0 PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rookie Stephane Beauregard made 24 saves for his first N.H.L. shutout and Phil Housley scored with 3:55 remaining to give Winnipeg the victory over Philadelphia, snapping the Flyers' unbeaten streak at home at nine games. Blackhawks 4, Nordiques 2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Quebec's road streak without a victory reached 22 games as Jocelyn Lemieux and Frantisek Kucera scored 15 seconds apart midway in the third period, lifting Chicago. Kings 6, Blues 5 ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mike Donnelly scored twice in the third period and set up the game-winner by Corey Millen with 5:20 to go as Los Angeles rallied from two three-goal deficits. The Kings ended a six-game streak without a victory, during which they had been 0-3-3 since Jan. 7.

349-> EX-SOVIET LANDS TO GET SWIFT AID
The 47-nation conference on aid to the former Soviet Union ended today with some general proposals on how to expand and accelerate humanitarian assistance but with lingering uncertainty over how to pay for the programs and carry them out. In an effort to spur the aid process, the Bush Administration announced today that it would fly 54 shipments of emergency food and medical supplies to Russia and the other republics, beginning Feb. 10, to help the new Commonwealth of Independent States through the winter. On board the C-5 and C-141 aircraft will be some 16 million prepackaged meals left over from the Persian Gulf war. In addition, at the end of the two-day meeting Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced new plans to send some 2,000 American farm volunteers over the next three years, for periods of up to 90 days, to work directly with private farmers in the commonwealth, and a new plan to establish a $25 million fund called the Eurasian Foundation for Democracy to help strengthen free market institutions in the former Communist nation. Money for the American food and medical airlift, as well as the technical assistance programs like the Eurasian Foundation, will come primarily from funds urged on the Bush Administration by Congressional Democrats last year. While the Administration did not encourage Congress to appropriate the money at the time, it is now eagerly taking full advantage of it. Following their talks, the 47 ministers present at the State Department announced a series of five sketchy "action plans" they would use in the coming months to improve and enlarge the transfer of medicine, food, shelter, energy and technical assistance to the commonwealth. The plans, each of which is being supervised by a working group headed by two countries that attended the conference, contain both new suggestions and proposals for insuring that aid already promised does not get duplicated or diverted to the black market. Some of the plans, though, are so general and vague that it is still hard to see what they will involve. For instance, the food plan says the working group will try "encouraging competition and improving productivity throughout the food sector," and "establish contacts with the new states," and "build up links with the international institutions involved in assisting the new states." If all of these plans are fleshed out, financed and carried out, the situation in the former Soviet Union will probably improve. But it is still unclear how many of these new initiatives will become reality. Mood at Conference The mood at the close of the conference was best summarized by Portugal's Foreign Minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, spokesman for the European Community, who declared at the closing news conference: "This is the first step of a process. Ahead lies the task of translating our commitments into effective and rapid results. We now need to insure that the people in the new state and their authorities at every level join us as partners in this task. Our aim is to contribute to their efforts and help them to reach the objectives they have chosen. If we succeed in this enterprise, as we must, we shall not only have helped to provide relief to millions of people. We shall need to build a strong momentum on the basis of our commitments at this Washington Conference." The ministers agreed to reconvene again, at the beginning of May in Lisbon, to review progress. Each of the five working groups -- medical, food, energy, housing and technical assistance -- will have to report at that time on how well its plan has been carried out. American officials are counting on this pressure to help insure that the countries -- including the United States -- follow through on their promises. Proposal by Baker When this aid conference was proposed by Secretary Baker in a Princeton speech last month, it was not greeted with much enthusiasm by either the White House or the Europeans. The Europeans in particular saw it as a gimmick, basically designed to allow the United States to take credit for leading the global aid effort for the commonwealth without having to spend any more of its own money. Although Secretary Baker said this week's conference was intended not to secure more pledges of aid, but merely one to coordinate offers that had already been made, the European complaints embarrassed the Bush Administration into increasing its own contributions. The President said yesterday he would ask Congress for $645 million more in humanitarian and technical aid during fiscal 1992 and 1993 -- which he apparently plans to take from the military budget -- and followed that up today with the announced airlift. Washington has now committed about $5 billion to the aid effort, but most of that is in farm credits for the Russians to buy grain from American farmers with loans that must be repaid. Some other countries that were invited, though, also felt impelled to pledge real or token increases in their assistance, although many experts believe these still fall far short of what is needed if the commonwealth states are to avoid social unrest from shortages of food and shelter. Dispute With Japan Japan, for instance, announced before coming to the conference that it would give $50 million more to the Red Cross for humanitarian aid to the commonwealth, but Tokyo made clear it would not make any larger contributions until Russia returns to Japan disputed islands the Soviet Union occupied at the end of World War II. The Japanese earlier had pledged $2.6 billion in aid, mostly in the form of credits. Among the new pledges, Oman announced that it would commit $200 million to support energy exploration in the commonwealth. Thailand offered $450 million in loans for republics to buy rice and other commodities, while Korea offered $800 million for the same. Argentina proposed to absorb 100,000 Russian immigrants. Saudi Arabia and other gulf states agreed to unfreeze more than $1 billion in aid they had promised the former Soviet Union and frozen during the August coup. Finland offered to transport humanitarian aid to the commonwealth at a large discount. "The conference created pressure on us and the people we invited to give more," said a senior Administration official. "In three months, people will have to say what they've done." Mr. Baker said a delegation from this week's conference would sit down next week with leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk to review the decisions and proposals put forward in Washington. He also announced the appointment of Richard L. Armitage, as the coordinator for American aid to the former Soviet Union, with responsibility for making sure that aid gets to its proper destination. The Americans refused to allow discussion at the conference of a Russian request for a multibillion dollar currency stabilization fund, along the lines of that provided for Poland, to support any transition to free markets. Administration officials insist that such a program will have to be handled by the International Monetary Fund.

351-> Sousa Made Money as Well as Music
To the Editor: Richard Mooney's "Semper Sousa," (Editorial Notebook, Oct. 3) pays tribute to John Philip Sousa on the occasion of a performance to mark the centenary of the Sousa Band's debut in Plainfield, N.J. Mr. Mooney tells us about Sousa's compositions, but chiefly why Sousa has long been known as the March King for works like "The Washington Post" march and "The Stars and Stripes Forever," which first played in his mind on a trans-Atlantic crossing. Mr. Mooney closes, however, on a regretful note: "A musical genius, perhaps, but not a born businessman. While he eventually made a fortune from concerts and later compositions, he sold several early pieces, including 'Semper Fidelis' and 'The Washington Post,' to a Philadelphia music publisher for $35 each." But John Philip Sousa was as brilliant a businessman as he was a musical genius. His great fortune came when he, together with Victor Herbert and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, brought an action against dance halls, restaurants, hotels, theaters and the moving pictures, in which he claimed the doctrine of performing rights. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the final decision in favor of Ascap. Phonograph rights, movie rights, orchestra rights, vaudeville rights and all the other rights made Sousa, Herbert, George M. Cohan, Irving Berlin and several others instant millionaires. Tin Pan Alley became the big boss! So, you see, it wasn't only sheet music rights! JACK GASNICK New York, Oct. 4, 1992

352-> Coins
Tokens In Lieu of Change Among a host of coins being auctioned later this month is a rare and interesting example of the "Hard Luck" tokens of the early-19th century. This particular one is called the "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token, a title taken from the inscription on the obverse. Hard Luck tokens were minted in 1837 and 1838, years when Americans found themselves in a recession, surrounded by bank failures. Those days, people hoarded coins in bad times and small change became hard to find. Merchants began buying tokens from private mints at less than face value and used them as one-cent pieces when tendering change. The 1838 "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token, which catered to antislavery sentiments in the Northeast, was one of hundreds of these tokens. The "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token is actually the rarer sibling (only three are known to exist) of the "Am I Not a Woman & a Sister" token. The two are quite similar, differing mostly in the inscription. The figures of a slave on the tokens are nearly identical; however, the poses and the way the slaves are shackled are different. The token is a strong reminder of abolition, one of the three central political themes of the 19th century: the other two were temperance and women's rights. Abolitionists, taking their cue from Britain, began agitating for an end to slavery at the close of the 18th century, and the battle continued until the Civil War. The phrase "Am I Not a Man and a Brother" appeared frequently in Britain on tokens and even china. The "and" was changed to an ampersand when the slogan crossed the ocean. Why the female version of the token is more prevalent than the male is a numismatic mystery. Some believe that it may have been that the dies for the "Am I Not a Man & a Brother" token may have broken early in the run, while the others survived. Or the female token may just have been more popular, and the male tokens could not be sold. At any rate, some 500 to 1,000 "Am I Not a Woman & a Sister" tokens are thought to exist. Both tokens can be seen in the New York Vista Hotel, 3 World Trade Center (between West and Liberty Streets), in Manhattan from March 24 to March 27. The auction, held by Bowers & Merena, is scheduled for the afternoon and evening of March 26 and the evening of March 27. For more information, call Bowers & Merena (800) 458-4646. Missing $100,000 Dimes The Professional Numismatists Guild, a company in Van Nuys, Calif., that assesses and assigns grades to valuable coins, has organized a contest to find 1894-S dimes. Only 24 of the dimes were minted at the San Francisco mint in 1894, and of those only 12 are known to exist in collections. The "S" denotes its San Francisco provenance. Anyone finding a genuine 1894-S dime will receive free authentication services and a free trip with two nights' accommodations in Orlando, Fla., to attend the American Numismatic Association convention in August. The finder also holds a coin worth well over $100,000. Other 1894 dimes or coins are not selling for anywhere near that amount. For example, an 1894 dime minted in Philadelphia is worth less than $50 in all but the very best of grades. Lucky hunters should call Paul L. Koppenhaver, the company's executive director, at (818) 781-1764. A Medal for Erudition Every year, the American Numismatic Society presents the Archer M. Huntington Medal to honor numismatic scholarship. This year's winner is Peter Robert Franke of Saarbrucken, Germany. Mr. Franke will receive the award and will talk about his specialty, Greek imperial coinage, at 3 P.M. next Sunday at the society's headquarters, Broadway at 155th Street in Manhattan. The speech is entitled "The Memory of Alexander the Great in Roman Asia Minor." For information, call (212) 234-3130.

353-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; 12-1 Technology Dazzles Dance Floor
A new candidate to challenge Arazi for the Triple Crown of racing in 1992 strode to the front today when the 12-to-1 longshot Technology outran Hammer's favored Dance Floor by four and a half lengths and won the $500,000 Florida Derby. It was only the fifth time that Technology had gone to the post in a career delayed by injury, but the third time he had won and the fifth time he had come home with a piece of the prize. It was also the first time he had won a stakes race, but he did it with command under the educated pacing of Jerry Bailey, one of the country's senior jockeys and one of the hottest this winter in Florida. Technology scored his coup in textbook fashion. He stayed two lengths behind the early streaker, Waki Warrior, then made his move as they entered the home stretch. He shot past the leader and held off a late run by Pistols and Roses, the local star who had won four straight races in Florida this winter. Using the rod sparingly, Bailey flicked Technology three times left-handed to get the lead and three times right-handed to keep it. At the finish, Technology was running by himself, four and a half legnths in front of Dance Floor, who held off Pistols and Roses by a neck. He ran the mile and an eighth in 1:50 3/5 and returned $26.20 for $2 bet by his partisans to win. Sonny Hine, who trains Technology for Scott Savin, conceded that his colt had not been nominated for the Kentucky Derby, but he said with conviction: "I don't know what it costs to make a late nomination. Whatever it is, we'll pay it." It costs $4,500, which must be paid by April 1, but Technology more than covered it when he brought home $300,000 today. To confound the Kentucky Derby picture even more, Dance Floor showed some pulmonary bleeding after the race. It means he will most likely be treated with the medication Lasix, which is legal in Kentucky and also in Maryland, site of the Preakness Stakes. But it is not legal in New York, scene of the Belmont Stakes, the third jewel in the Triple Crown. This was Florida's annual glamour day of racing, and this year it also was Florida's heaviest day of betting. The crowd of 29,433 wagered more than $5 million at the track; the statewide total passed $6.9 million, more than $1 million above the record set on Florida Derby Day in 1988. It also was a day spiced by three major stakes races and one missing celebrity: Arazi, now wintering in France and preparing for his role as the favorite for the Kentucky Derby on May 2. But Gulfstream had its own celebrity, the rap-music star Hammer, the owner of the Oaktown Stable, who arrived in racing last year with the dynamic filly Lite Light. He was back today wearing a red suit and a smile, surrounded by his three brothers and their father, and with the big horse of the stable, Dance Floor, trained by D. Wayne Lukas and ridden by Chris Antley. They went to the head of the class three weeks ago when Dance Floor won the Fountain of Youth Stakes. But today the colt went off the 4-to-5 favorite, started from outside in the No. 11 post position, apparently suffered internal bleeding en route and missed. "We told Chris to get out good, but he was still three-wide going to the first turn," said Jeff Lukas, who directs the stable for his father. "Then he was right where he was supposed to be when he made his move and turned for home. But we just finished second." Grab the Green Does Two significant preliminary races preceded the Florida Derby, starting with the $126,550 Buckram Oak Handicap, a mile-and-a-sixteenth race for fillies and mares on the grass. It was won by the favorite, Grab the Green, who outran Christiecat by three lengths with Julie La Rousse next only a head back in third. Another rave review was earned in the Swale Stakes by D.J. Cat, the late-blooming star of Happy Alter's stable, who won his fourth race in four starts when he swept through on the rail and captured the race by a neck over Binalong. The next horse, Always Silver, was more than five lengths back. Yes, that was Jerry Bailey riding the winner, four races before he rode the winner of the Derby, giving him nine stakes victories here this winter. He and D.J. Cat hustled the seven furlongs in 1:23 1/5 and returned $3 for $2 to win. The colt bucked his shins last summer and missed six months of racing, but he now is rushing along the road to Kentucky.

354-> For Neediest, a Haven From Danger
In a city where guns and knives sometimes seem to have replaced Barbie dolls and G.I. Joes as the toys of choice, the list of serious infractions posted on the bulletin board at the Children's Aid Society's East Harlem Center seems quaintly irrelevant. "Throwing of objects; profanity; failure to remove hats; destruction of property or writing on walls; trespassing." The center's director, Carmen La Luz Rivera, said very few of "our kids" break the rules. "The children around here aren't dangerous, they just live in a place that can be dangerous," she said. "The rules let them know that they can be safe here, that this is a place where kids can be kids." Since opening in 1954, the East Harlem Center has provided a safe haven in a tough neighborhood. Six days a week and through the summer it provides recreational, educational, and health services to 1,000 local children and their families. For at least three youngsters, the center is a second home. 'This Lets You Stay Clean' "The street is the only other place to hang out," said Jamel Washington, 13 years old, who spends six days a week at the center. "There you end up a bum or you end up on drugs or dead on the street. This lets you stay clean and try to make something of yourself." As if finishing Jamel's sentence, John Cardona, 12, said, "You can come here if like there's problems at home." Dominic Torres, 12, explained, "In school you have to put on act for the teacher and you have to watch yourself so people don't get mad and hurt you." Jamel cut in, "You know everybody here and you feel comfortable around them," he said. "If you don't come here one day they'll call your family to find out where you are. They always want to see your report card." A day at the center breaks into three periods. From 8:30 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. preschoolers enrolled in Project Head Start fill the halls with sounds of tumbling blocks and zooming toy cars. In other classrooms, their parents learn about asthma and diabetes and and how to make nutritional meals on a rice and beans budget. At 3:30 P.M., the decibel level rises through the unbounded energy of 6 to 12 year-olds getting help with their homework, studying drama, cheerleading, arts and crafts, and playing basketball. Once a week they take field trips to places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lincoln Center. The nights belong to teen-agers who use the center as a place to study, play, hang out and to learn about AIDS and pregnancy prevention. The center is just as important for its unoffical programs. Residents with poor English skills drop by to have legal notices and leases translated; to get help with a letter or phone call to a city agency, and assistance if their heat or hot water is not working. Every Wednesday they pick up bread, potatoes and other staples donated to the center. "The centers are our prime mechanism of crisis prevention," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, which operates 6 neighborhood centers and 20 other locations in New York. "We take children and their families who may not yet be in crisis and provide them with programs and assistance they need so they do not fall into crisis." It costs $322,000 a year to run the East Harlem Center. Only $90,000 is provided by fees and government subsidies, so the rest must be covered by Children's Aid's investment income, foundation grants, and donations including support from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Neediest Cases helps thousands of New Yorkers through seven charities. The Times covers all of the overhead so that all the contributions are passed directly to the charities which feed the hungry and operate multifaceted programs like the East Harlem Center. Julio Agosto said he has stopped by the center almost every day for the last 35 years. Born in Puerto Rico, he made his first visit as a 13-year-old thinking about dropping out of school because his poor English skills made it difficult for him to learn. "I remember I had a problem making the "th" sound," he recounted. "The director of the center used to sit with me and make me stick my tongue on the top of my mouth and say "th, th." When he was 16 the center gave him first job, maintaining a recreation room and supervising younger children. They helped him apply to college and gave him pocket money so "I wouldn't feel like I was less than the other students." After graduation they helped him get a job with the city as a youth worker. Now, he is a truant officer with the Board of Education. "I've spent my life working with other people," he said. "I guess that's my way of trying to pay back Children's Aid for all it did for me."

355-> ART VIEW; Cells, Crystals, Bugs and Shells, Rendered in Paint
Terry Winters has been a quiet figure on the art scene for a decade. Although he began working in the early 1970's and gradually developed a reputation among artists, he did not have his first one-man show in New York until 1982. Since then, his paintings, drawings and prints have been regularly on view, but in a decade when flashiness counted, his low-key work was not the sort to grab the spotlight. Now, in a new decade that seems more receptive to gentler strains of art, the spotlight has been turned on him in a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, through May 10. The show is organized by Lisa Phillips, a curator at the museum (it was first seen at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, its only other stop). Mr. Winters is a good painter and this is a handsomely installed exhibition. But considering that it covers barely more than a decade of activity by an artist who is not yet 43 years old and whose work, so far, is limited by a narrow expressive range, the show is as out of proportion as the extravagant claims made for Mr. Winters in the accompanying catalogue. One leaves the Whitney acknowledging Mr. Winters's devotion to the craft of painting, and the intensity of his drawings and prints, but also feeling that the exhibition makes a grander case for him than his art can yet bear. The show includes 150 paintings, drawings and prints, beginning with works from 1979, when Mr. Winters was taking his first tentative steps toward the biomorphic abstraction for which he has become known, with its intimations of cells, molecules, crystals, shells, plants and human organs in paint that can resemble the stuff of primordial ooze. The exhibition concludes with recent paintings like "Event Horizon" and "Geomancer" and a suite of charcoal drawings from 1989 that represent his boldest achievements. The exhibition is the latest evidence of a renewal of interest in abstraction, coming as it does after several surveys of contemporary abstraction in New York galleries and at the same time that a retrospective of the sculpture of Martin Puryear, now at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, is making its way around the country. As it happens, Mr. Puryear's trajectory and Mr. Winters's are not unrelated. Like the 50-year-old Mr. Puryear, Mr. Winters began his career when many artists were feeling constrained by the rigors of Minimalism. And like Mr. Puryear, Mr. Winters began to formulate his mature esthetic when so-called New Image artists of the later 70's were rejecting Minimalist strictures against figuration and gesture and embracing illusionism. Both Mr. Winters and Mr. Puryear have emphasized the values of facture and texture. Both are understated in their approach and openly indebted to art history. Both seek to invent abstract forms ambiguous in meaning but rich in allusion. The forms for Mr. Winters, and for a large number of other contemporary artists, like Tony Cragg, Susan Rothenberg, Richard Deacon, Elizabeth Murray, Carroll Dunham and John Newman, derive from organic shapes. In this, Mr. Winters is tapping into a vein of abstraction that has its roots, in America, in the work of the 1920's by painters like Joseph Stella, O'Keeffe and Dove and, in different ways, in the Surrealist art of the 40's by Gorky, Baziotes, Rothko and Pollock. No wonder it has been difficult for Mr. Winters to create images that do not look derivative. One way he has tried to stake out his own ground has been to make his organic forms serve as metaphors for the act of painting. His images of cells and molecules, the building blocks of life, are depicted in myriad techniques that are themselves building blocks of painting. A work like "Good Government" is as much about different ways of putting paint to canvas -- with its blend of washed, impastoed, scumbled, erased, slathered and crisply drawn passages -- as it is a chart of rudimentary organic forms. Even the quality of studied awkwardness in the handling of paint and construction of the composition seems to refer to the idea of initial stages of development. Like Cy Twombly, but to a considerably lesser degree, Mr. Winters has a way of making these apparently uncomposed and scrawled images into something elegant. Among the contemporary artists who seem most important to Mr. Winters, there is not only Mr. Twombly but also Brice Marden, whose attention to lushly painted surfaces forged a path out of Minimalist austerity that Mr. Winters followed -- and whose recent calligraphic works would appear to have been influenced by Mr. Winters's early efforts like the "Spine" series of 1980. The Whitney exhibition suggests that although the changes have been measured and incremental, Mr. Winters's development has been somewhat along the lines of the organic shapes he depicts -- from simpler and more modest to bigger and more complex forms. His range of color has also broadened, from the predominantly muted grays and blues of his early paintings to the mixed palette of recent years: in works like "Dumb Compass" of 1985 and "Montgolfier" of 1987, for instance, circles of brilliant yellow, green and red break up a vast brown field. Some of his imagery is marvelously witty, like the fleet of deflated balloons that rises across the night sky of "Lumen" and the big, sticky bugs that seem to be mired in the paint of "Insecta." But it is less for the evocative capacity of his biomorphic shapes, which in such quantity come to seem predictable, and more for the formal characteristics of his art that Mr. Winters ultimately makes an impression. One characteristic is the interplay between figure and ground that has become richer and more ambiguous in recent works, like "Black and White Manifold," "Event Horizon" and "Untitled." Another trait is the tactile variety of Mr. Winters's paintings -- the tarlike wasteland of "Jews Pitch," the gelatinous passages that so perfectly simulate the quality of the organism in "Tone," and the scarred and mottled surface of "Dystopia." His prints and drawings, although closely linked with the paintings, look more consistently successful than the canvases, and the show is admirable for displaying works on paper beside paintings so as to give them equal prominence. Charcoal-and-crayon drawings like "Dark Plant 1" and "Dark Plant 16" of 1982 are sharper statements than anything that Mr. Winters was painting at the time. There is an energy as well as a Dubuffet-like roughness to a series of color lithographs from 1985-86 called "Folio." And the suite of drawings from 1989 presents frontal, often symmetrical, compositions -- something unusual for Mr. Winters, whose works have evolved out of a rejection of the orderliness of the Miminialist grid. The images can bring to mind sexual organs, brains, mutating cells and an occasional face, rendered in velvety charcoal strokes almost as thick and palpable as Richard Serra's oilstick drawings. For the usually reticent artist, the decisiveness and directness of the suite is striking, and it helps to close this often disappointing mid-career retrospective on an optimistic note.

356-> Connecticut Court Appeal For Man Tried Four Times
Louis Nizer and William M. Kunstler, the prominent defense lawyers, teamed up to appear before the Connecticut Supreme Court this week, urging an end to the 18-year ordeal of Murray R. Gold, who faces a fifth trial in the slayings of his former in-laws. Mr. Gold, a 58-year-old former stockbroker in New York City, was tried four times and convicted twice in the deaths of Rhoda and Irving Pasternak. The couple were stabbed in their Waterbury, Conn., home on Sept. 26, 1974. Mr. Gold was married to their daughter, Barbara, for 21 months in the early 1960's. The prosecutors said he killed her parents because he thought they were responsible for the breakup of his marriage and because Mr. Pasternak, a lawyer, had represented his daughter in some divorce matters. In March a judge overturned Mr. Gold's most recent murder conviction, from 1986. The judge ruled that the defendant had been mentally incompetent during the trial. Fifth Trial Is Possible The Supreme Court Justices are expected to rule in about three months. They could reinstate Mr. Gold's conviction, order a fifth trial or order him freed. "How long will this continue?" asked Mr. Nizer, who is 89 years old and who represented Charlie Chaplin and Mae West in the 1930's. "I plead to you to put an end to this," he said. "This man had nothing to do with the murders." Mr. Gold's first trial, in 1976, ended in a mistrial when the jury declared itself deadlocked, after Mr. Kunstler presented evidence that the Pasternaks were killed by Bruce Sanford, a motorcycle gang member who committed suicide six weeks after the murders. The State Supreme Court threw out the conviction from his second trial, ruling that evidence implicating Mr. Sanford had been improperly excluded. The third trial ended in a mistrial after Mr. Gold dismissed his lawyer, John Williams of New Haven, accusing him of conspiring with the judge and jury against him. After his fourth trial, he was sentenced to 25 years to life. Mr. Gold has been described as suffering from paranoia and schizophrenia. He remains at a state prison in Somers, where he travels the corridors in a wheelchair, talking to himself, according to court documents. But the Assistant Chief State's Attorney, John Killen, argued that Mr. Gold's 1986 conviction should be reinstated. He argued that Mr. Gold was taking medication that muddled his thinking during the trial, and that evidence of his mental incompetence was unconvincing. Mr. Kunstler, who represented Mr. Gold at his first two trials, sat with Mr. Nizer at the defense table Wednesday but did not address the justices. He joked that he was present as Mr. Nizer's law clerk. Mr. Nizer, who is representing Mr. Gold without charge, told the justices that if his client, whom he had represented before, was is tried a fifth time, evidence will show the Pasternaks were killed by Mr. Sanford.

357-> SIDELINES: THEY'RE FAMILY; Brothers-in-Laws In Competition
Research has uncovered the under-reported fact that only two sets of brothers-in-law are active in professional sports these days. The best-known pair is JERRY PATE and BRUCE LIETZKE, both outstanding golfers. But bowling has its own stars in STEVE COOKand MIKE AULBY, and they will make a rare New York-area appearance Wednesday when the Professional Bowlers Association tour brings them to Sayville Bowl on Long Island for a $130,000 tournament. The in-laws are both left-handed. Cook, though, stands 6 feet 7 inches to Aulby's 5-7. Aulby has already earned his million while Cook has pocketed $800,000 in winnings. In a recent tour event, Cook defeated Aulby in the finals.

358-> At Last, G.O.P.'s Bills See Light of Day
REPUBLICAN state senators who have spent their entire careers in the minority are facing a heady prospect. They are going to see some of their favorite bills voted on. For the last two decades, Democrats have wielded the gavel of the Senate President, a position that carries the ultimate power to decide which bills are posted for voting. Republicans who came up with inspired pieces of legislation would sometimes have to watch from the sidelines as their bills were stolen -- copied word for word -- and put up for a vote by Democratic sponsors. It has not been uncommon to see 10 Democratic Senate bills voted on for every Republican bill. That number would change when the Democratic leadership wanted Republican votes for a potentially controversial measure, creating an opportunity for some horse-trading. Now it's the Republicans' turn. A landslide victory in the November elections gave them overwhelming majorities in both houses of the Legislature. That gives the Republicans the power to appoint the committees where much of the mischief is done, where bills submitted by the minority are often held and similar bills are released under the sponsorship of the majority. The new Senate majority leader, John H. Dorsey of Boonton, said the Senate staff had been assigned to draw up a list of bills that have been denied a vote over the years and to single out some of them for early action in the legislative session just started. And Democratic leaders have begun to complain that their bills are being hijacked by the new Republican majority, though the gripes are not too loud. The role of the majority carries with it important responsibilities -- passing a balanced budget, dealing with a revenue gap and the problems of controlling health-care costs and financing public education in a way that will meet constitutional requirements for fairness. But the prospect of seeing some of their long-delayed pet bills, important and otherwise, finally come up for a vote is bringing smiles to the faces of the new bosses in the Senate. Gerald Cardinale of Demarest, an 11-year veteran of the Senate, recalls that he first introduced a bill eight years ago that would require restaurants to notify customers if they use monosodium glutamate in their cooking. "I got it out of committee, but John Russo would never put it up for a vote," he said, referring to the former Senate President. Dr. Cardinale, a dentist, expressed surprise at the furor his bill had created. "The MSG people came out of the woodwork," he said, "and would convince restaurateurs that it would be costly, when all they would have to do was put a sticker on their menus until they printed new ones. I think the 3 percent of the population that suffers an adverse reaction to MSG are entitled to know if it is their food." He also plans to get a vote on another bill that attracted 25 co-sponsors but was denied a spot on the voting board. This would require schools to begin each day by reciting that part of the Declaration of Independence that says people are "endowed by their creator" with certain rights, a phrase that is certain to raise anew the debate over school prayer and the separation of church and state. "I saw John Russo the other day and teased him about not posting it in the past," Dr. Cardinale said. Backer of Initiative Measure Mr. Dorsey said, "My bill is I. and R." An 11-year veteran of the upper house, he was an early champion of initiative and referendum legislation, which would give voters the right to propose and vote on changes in state law. The idea, supported by a number of voter groups, passed the Senate twice, only to die in the Assembly. The only reason it made it through the Senate, Mr. Dorsey said, was that the Republican leadership was confident the measure would fail in the Assembly. Senator Leanna Brown of Chatham, who is starting her ninth year in the Senate, said some of her bills would need reworking because of changed conditions since she had first sponsored them. "I'm told the last time there was this dramatic a change in legislative leadership, it took two years to get the process working smoothly," she said. Mrs. Brown said she still wanted to pass her bill that would allow people to conduct businesses from their homes under certain conditions. Given the realities of the computer age, she said, the measure "makes sense." But it would not permit the creation of businesses in a residential zone if they would attract a lot of traffic -- she cited a dance studio as an example -- or violate local zoning codes. Because of the complexity of the issue, she said, she will probably first move to create a commission to study the proposal and recommend new legislation. Office of Children's Advocacy Another of her initiatives that was bottled up would have created an office of children's advocacy within the government to coordinate all the services geared toward the needs of children. "The pundits say the 60's and 70's were the decades of the ombudsman," she said, "and this decade will be the time for a children's advocate." Senator Robert E. Littell of Franklin said he had been frustrated by the failure of the Legislature to follow up on an old study that found a number of state dams to be in poor condition. He sponsored a Clean Water Bond Act in 1990 to provide $100 million to start a revolving fund that would support state and local projects in solving flooding and pollution problems. The fund would also support conservation and recreational use of waterways. The bill was never voted on. "In the case of private lakes that needed some dam repairs," he said, "money for the project could be applied for jointly by the owners and municipalities and paid back through assessments charged to the owners by the towns over 20 to 30 years." Seed Money for Schools Senator William L. Gormley of Margate said he hoped to get action on a bill he had been pushing for some time -- along with two fellow Republicans, John H. Ewing of Bedminster and Joseph A. Palaia of Ocean Township, and a Democrat, Matthew Feldman of Teaneck -- to create a fund to provide seed money for school construction. "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would provide about $400 million from tolls and lease payments at the World Trade Center to the state's Economic Development Authority," he said. "The toll revenue would have to be spent in the port district -- within a 25-mile radius -- but the revenue from leases could be spent anywhere, and this would provide the seed money to rehabilitate old schools or build new ones." Mr. Gormley said the present situation, with the Legislature controlled by one party and the Governor belonging to the opposite party, offered a real opportunity for bipartisan cooperation on important initiatives like upgrading the state's aging stock of school buildings.

359-> Israel Says Arab Attack Kills 2 Soldiers in South Lebanon
Three Arab guerrillas ambushed an Israeli Army convoy in south Lebanon today with missiles and hand grenades, killing two soldiers and wounding five before they themselves were killed, the army said. The army said Israeli troops, backed by helicopters and tanks, responded to the ambush and killed all three men. Israel radio said the guerrillas had been hiding near the village of Khula, north of the Israeli border. In Lebanon, the pro-Iranian Party of God said a Sunni Muslim group, Islamic Holy War in Palestine, planned the attack.

360-> Joseph Valiunas, 68; Favored Free Baltics
Joseph Kestutis Valiunas, a longtime leader in the independence movement for the Baltic states, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I. He was 68 years old and was a resident of Southampton. He died of heart failure after a long illness, his family said. Mr. Valiunas was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. He hid from the Nazis there during World War II and later resisted the Communists in the turmoil of the war's aftermath. He earned a doctorate at the University of Tubingen in the American-occupied zone of Germany and immigrated to the United States in 1951. Mr. Valiunas worked in several businesses. He was the founder of Neris International, a Manhattan concern that was a major exporter of American coal to Germany and Italy after the war. He was also the president of the American division of Compania Exportadora de Vinos Marques de Vilallonga, a wine exporting company in Barcelona, Spain. As president of the Baltic World Conference, he was arrested in 1975 in Helsinki, Finland, for protesting at a meeting of European foreign ministers. He objected that they were ignoring the Soviet Union's domination of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. He was freed after two days in prison, after demands for his release from the United States and other Governments. He is survived by his wife, the former Elena Jasaitis; four sons, Dominicus of Charleston, S.C., Andrew of Bishop, Calif., Julius of Manhattan, and Peter of London; three grandchildren, and a brother, Andrew, of Washington.

361-> COMPANY NEWS; Philips to Close A Plant in Utah
Philips N.V., the Dutch electronics concern, will close a United States semiconductor plant in Utah this year as part of its continuing effort to streamline operations. The closing of the Signetics production operation in Orem, Utah, will affect 900 employees, Philips said in a statement released by its world headquarters here. The plant, opened in 1966, is a high-volume producer of three- and four-inch semiconductor wafers, but Philips said its technology was becoming outdated. Its production will be moved to other locations in the United States, Europe and the Far East, the statement said.

362-> In Poll, Executives Back Free Trade
Corporate executives who are suppliers, customers and rivals of the swelling ranks of foreign companies in the United States get a firsthand glimpse every business day of the economic impact of the nation's free-trade policies. And most of them conclude that the benefits of free trade -- stimulating economic activity and efficiency -- outweigh the costs of stiffer foreign competition, like lost jobs and markets for some industries, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. The 490 executives surveyed, representing a cross section of American industry from multibillion-dollar corporations to small family companies, are considerably more emphatic in their support for keeping the nation's markets comparatively open than is the public in general, which, according to previous Times/CBS polls, is more sympathetic to curbing imports to protect American jobs and industries. In the survey of top executives, completed last month, 61 percent said their opinion was closer to the statement "Free trade must be allowed, even if domestic industries are hurt by foreign competition." By contrast, only 33 percent said their opinion was closer to the statement "Trade restrictions are necessary to protect domestic industries." Six percent declined to agree with either statement. The free-trade support among executives is largely explained by how far the internationalization of Corporate America has progressed, which was clearly evident in recent follow-up interviews with two dozen of the executives who were surveyed. Neal Trask, for example, is president of Trask Decrow Machinery Inc., a company with $5 million in sales that markets industrial pumps and compressors in South Portland, Me., a town scarcely known as a hub of global commerce. Trask Decrow sells its machinery to the region's pulp and paper makers, shipbuilders and for use in the snow-making equipment on nearby ski slopes like Sugarloaf. But for the last few years, the company has also done a brisk trade in snow-making pumps with the Hokkaido Snow Service Company. "One of my best customers is in Japan now," Mr. Trask said. "I'm a free trader." View on Japan Restrictions In Bartlesville, Okla., the Mark Roberts dealership sells Honda Accords and Chrysler Voyager and Caravan mini-vans. Like 58 percent of the executives polled, Mr. Roberts replied that restrictions in Japan were probably a main reason that more American products are not sold in Japan -- more important than explanations such as that American goods have a reputation for lower quality or that United States companies have not tried hard enough to crack the Japanese market. Like most executives in the survey, Mr. Roberts regards Washington's pursuit of opening the Japanese market as necessary, worthwhile and in the interest of fairness. But even if all the restrictions were lifted, he doubts it would help America much. "It wouldn't make a hill of beans worth of difference to the U.S. economy," Mr. Roberts said. "That's not the trouble with our economy." Mr. Roberts's showroom provides an example of the increasing globalization of American industry, as well as the complexity surrounding that issue. Most Hondas on his lot, Mr. Roberts notes, are shipped from the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio. Washington-Honda Debate Honda is currently embroiled in a debate with Washington over just how American its made-in-America cars really are. Customs Service investigators have challenged Honda's contention that the "domestic content" of its cars built in America is 75 percent, meaning that three-fourths of the value of each car is based on American labor, parts and other costs. Even the definition of an American executive is getting more complicated these days. Tachi Kiuchi was one of the randomly selected chief executives in the survey. Mr. Kiuchi is the head of Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc., a $2.5 billion-a-year subsidiary of the Japanese company, which has six factories and employs 50,000 people in the United States. Mr. Kiuchi's free-trade sympathies are not in doubt, but he does sense a growing economic nationalism in the United States that he believes is making it more difficult for Mitsubishi Electronics to sell its semiconductors, televisions, elevators, auto parts and other products in America. Mitsubishi Electronics' target for 1992 is to increase sales by 5 percent. 'Buy America' Effect Seen "To attain that goal would be much easier if it were not for this Japan-bashing business climate," Mr. Kiuchi said. "It's hard to put your finger on or point to some set of figures, but the 'Buy America' sentiment is having an effect." Other business people in the survey agreed, but they also said the Buy America effect was hard to measure and that some customers were more nationalistic in their speech than in their buying habits. John Kiefer, whose car dealership in Santa Cruz, Calif., sells Mazda, Oldsmobile and BMW cars, said: "I've had people come in that have bought four Mazdas in the past and say that they're not buying another Japanese car. Some still do, though." The appeal of economic nationalism seems to be much stronger among the public than among corporate executives. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll in January, 1,281 adults were asked, "Which is more important to you: to protect American industries and jobs by limiting imports from other countries, or to allow free trade so you can buy good products at low prices no matter what country they come from?" Of the adults surveyed, 56 percent replied that it was more important to "limit imports," while 38 percent chose to "allow free trade." By contrast, 61 percent of the corporate executives polled in March said free trade was more important, while 29 percent said limiting imports was more important. Still, in their personal purchases, some executives show signs of buying American. W. John Devine, the chairman of Child World Inc., a 125-store toy retailer, has not bought an American car in 15 years. And after owning a Porsche, Ferrari and Audi, he said he was considering buying a Lexus, made by Toyota. But upon reflection, and following favorable reviews in car magazines, Mr. Devine said he was now leaning toward a Cadillac Seville STS. "I'm not a Buy America guy," Mr. Devine said. "But I figure, if the quality is about equal and it helps G.M. and the U.S. economy, why not?" Growing Social Pressure Ralph Colello, managing director of the operations management practice at Arthur D. Little Inc., said he saw a climate of social pressure building behind the notion of buying goods that are clearly identifiable as American products. "It's quiet and beneath the surface, like what went on with smoking years ago," he said. "With the recession and all the cutbacks at American companies, there's a lot of potential for nationalism."

363-> Sinan's Mosques
To the Editor: The article on Sinan's mosques was of special interest to my wife and me, since we had been in Istanbul last December. Standing high amongst that city's most fascinating attractions are, of course, Sinan's superb mosques. Unfortunately, both the Shehzade and Rustem Pasha mosques were closed for restoration, although the Shehzade, standing near the Aqueduct of Vanels and the wide Shehzadebashi Caddesi, can be readily admired from without. As compensation we found a particularly charming Sinan work situated right at water's edge in Uskudar, the intimate Semshi Pasha mosque, and sweeping vistas of the Bosporus, the Golden Horn and the minaret-studded, bedomed skyline of old Istanbul. Finally, one visiting the magnificent Suleymaniye should not miss, not only the handsome tombs of The Magnificent and his controversial consort, Roxelana, but that of Mimar Sinan himself just to the north of his grandest work.

364-> FOOD; Regarding Guerard
The name "Michel Guerard" is emblazoned in blue on his starched white chef jacket, his checkered trousers are well creased. The three-star French chef who invented cuisine minceur preens under his pleated toque. He looks ready for more television cameras, or to pose for publicity purposes once again in front of Eugenie-les-Bains, the luxurious country inn and spa that he and his wife, Christine, run in the southwest of France. For nearly two decades, he's been the guru of the international slimming set -- by now his is practically a brand name. "Michel Guerard" resonates with the French as immediately as "Lean Cuisine" does with the Americans. But as the chef called Guerard wraps his apron around his waist this winter morning, he sighs. A gentle puff of belly presses against his apron strings. It looks like a "magret," the plump breast of the moulard duck that is raised and revered in his corner of France, straining against butcher's twine. "Cooking is a dangerous business," Guerard says as he walks into his kitchen. After all these years, his repertoire is constantly expanding. But his battle with girth remains the same. Born in Vetheuil, a small town north of Paris, Guerard was 15 years old, a "skinny, skinny, knob-kneed pastry apprentice," when he first encountered the hazards of his trade. He moved deeper into the realm of buttercreams and chocolate ganache when he became pastry chef at the Hotel Crillon in Paris. Then he bounded into the rich world of savory food, learning to saute and sauce and becoming, eventually, a chef's chef, with his self-styled cuisine gourmande. The small bistro that he opened in a Paris suburb in 1965 dished up the richest of the rich: a heart-stopping pot-au-feu, a buttery broth of sea urchins and mussels, a rabbit terrine studded with foie gras, pastries and more pastries. Ah, he sighs, with the wistfulness of one recalling a lost love, "such days, such days." The more Michelin stars he gathered, he says, the more he began looking like the roly-poly Michelin-tire man. When his wife-to-be mentioned the symmetry, the chef cast himself from the Eden of indulgence into "a long, punishing march through fields of grated carrots." Two decades later, the memory of the traditional diet still sends a shadow of pain over his impish face. "The ritual of boiled meat and boiled beans," he moans weakly. The sentence was too much. In "Michel Guerard's Cuisine Minceur" he wrote: "No longer was I allowed to know the marvelous, profound resonance that is produced when the eye, the nose and the palate join together in a symphonic wave to savor a finely crafted dish." Even now, "I still can't bear the thought," says the chef, who is 58 years old. In 1972, Guerard closed his bistro in the north of France and migrated to the southwest, where he opened a more luxurious dining room and inn. There, in the era that bridged haute and nouvelle cuisines, he mounted "an evasive action" against traditional diet regimes, creating a style of cooking that courts every sense except that of deprivation. The man is a shameless master of deception. He is not above using an imitation-butter flavoring to send a memory of the real thing through dishes that he de-creams. He doesn't feel that he's violating the national culinary trust when he substitutes a mousse of wild mushrooms for foie gras in his rabbit pate. These sleights of hand are now instinctive, he says. The steam is fogging his kitchen windows, and a surly wind whips wet, brown leaves through the air outside. Michel Guerard sighs -- again. He wants a rib-sticking, festive dinner as much as the next guy. Speculatively, he weighs two bulbs of fennel in his hands. He whiffs the duck broth that is barely simmering on the stove. Voila! A soup, a fennel soup. He can replace heavy cream with chicken broth and low-fat milk for flavor, use more vegetables for a fuller body and garnish the soup with a vibrant red-pepper mousse for a contrasting flavor and visual distraction. And duck. It's possible to eat duck and stay slim, he says. The breast meat must be carefully trimmed. The broth must be simmered, chilled and de-fatted, then simmered again to thicken it for a sauce. A melange of vegetables cut like one-carat gems will be diverting in the sauce. And -- this is the best part, he giggles -- he will carve apples to look like potatoes to accompany the dish. A pomme de terre pun: People expecting a potato, getting an apple and forgiving it because the pomme de terre look-alike has been poached in such an intriguing blend of spices. "Parfait!" He rubs his hands and checks his watch, as if to see how long he has to wait before sitting down to this meal with his wife and four friends. "A grand simplicity, a lot of duplicity, a little joke, a perfect meal," he says. Let other spa chefs limit their imaginations as much as they limit their fat. "I am still the best." FENNEL SOUP (ADAPTED FROM MICHEL GUERARD) 1 onion, peeled, finely minced 2 small leeks, white parts only, carefully cleaned and finely minced 1 sprig fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 6 cups chicken broth, either fresh or low-sodium canned 3 bulbs fennel, trimmed and finely chopped, tops reserved for garnish 2 tablespoons low-fat milk 4 sprigs flat parsley leaves, rinsed and finely chopped Red-pepper mousse (optional, see recipe). 1. Heat a nonstick pot over low heat. Add the onion, leeks, thyme, salt, pepper and 1/4 cup of the broth, cover the pan and cook over low heat until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the fennel, cover, and continue to cook until the fennel is tender, about 15 minutes. Add the remaining chicken stock and bring it to a boil. Cover, lower the heat and simmer gently for 25 minutes. 2. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth. Strain it through a fine-mesh strainer. Return any of the puree that does not pass through the sieve to the blender, puree again and re-strain, repeating until all the soup has been used. The soup can be refrigerated at this point for up to 3 days. 3. Just before serving, slowly bring the soup to a simmer, remove from the heat and whisk in the milk. Ladle into bowls. The soup can be garnished simply with the reserved fennel tops and chopped parsley. For a more festive -- and flavorful -- dish, add a dollop of red-pepper mousse. Yield: Four servings. RED-PEPPER MOUSSE (ADAPTED FROM MICHEL GUERARD) 2 large, sweet red bell peppers 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon low-fat, plain yogurt 3 tablespoons skim-milk ricotta cheese 2 1/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin. 1. Char the peppers over an open flame or under the broiler until the skin blisters and turns black on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a paper bag, close and set aside until the peppers are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Split each pepper lengthwise, lay it flat and use a sharp knife to lift off the skin and remove the veins and seeds. Do not rinse the peppers. 2. Put the peppers, salt, pepper, yogurt and ricotta into a food processor and process until smooth. 3. In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the puree over low heat until it is hot, but not boiling, and remove from the heat. Soften the gelatin in 1 tablespoon of tepid water and stir into the warmed portion of the puree. Continue stirring for 5 minutes, until the gelatin is completely dissolved and the puree has cooled slightly, then stir in the remaining unheated puree. Place in the food processor and process briefly to combine well. 4. Put the mousse into a clean bowl, cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours until firm. Yield: One and one-half cups. PAN-GRILLED DUCK WITH SPINACH AND POACHED APPLES (APAPTED FROM MICHEL GUERARD) The duck and broth: 1 9-to-10-pound moulard duck or 2 4 1/2-pound Long Island ducks (see note) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 onion, peeled and quartered 1 leek, white part only, carefully cleaned and cut into large pieces 2 small carrots, peeled and chopped 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 1 bouquet garni (1 bay leaf, 1 sprig fresh thyme, 2 sprigs parsley, 1 small stalk celery with leaves -- all tied together with a string) 6 mushrooms, trimmed, stems discarded The sauce: 1 quart duck broth (see recipe) 1 small leek, white part only, carefully cleaned, or 1 small white onion, finely minced 1 small carrot, peeled, finely diced 1/4 cup finely diced sweet red pepper, seeded 1/4 cup finely diced yellow pepper, seeded The garnish: 1 to 1 1/4 pounds spinach, leaves only, rinsed well Spicy poached apples (see recipe). 1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Use a sharp knife to remove any excess fat from the duck. Remove the neck, cut in half and place in a shallow roasting pan. Remove the wings, being careful not to cut into the breast. Place the wings in the roasting pan. Cut along one side of the ridge of the breastbone, then scrape the knife against the side of the breastbone, gently freeing one half of the breast from the cavity. Repeat on the other side. Remove as much fat as possible from the meat and discard the fat. Remove the loose, sinewy flap of meat from the underside of both breast pieces. Set aside. Blend the salt and pepper and rub the mixture into the skin side of the breasts. Cover and refrigerate. Remove the duck legs and use the back of the knife to break up the carcass. Add the carcass to the roasting pan and roast in the oven along with the neck and wings for 20 to 25 minutes, turning frequently until evenly browned. 2. Put the browned duck parts, onion, leek, carrots, peppercorns and bouquet garni -- and enough water to cover, about 6 quarts -- in a stockpot over low heat. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the legs, the flaps of meat from the breast and the mushrooms, cover partially and simmer for 4 hours to get about 2 1/2 to 3 quarts. Skim any foam as it rises to the top. 3. Strain the broth and discard the solids. Strain again through a fine sieve or a large strainer lined with cheesecloth. Cool and then refrigerate overnight to chill completely. Skim and discard the fat. 4. Prepare the spicy poached apples. They can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 hours. 5. An hour before serving, begin making the sauce. Put the duck broth in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until it has reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 35 minutes. (Freeze the remaining broth to make soup.) Add the leek or onion and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the carrot, remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes. 6. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot, but not smoking. Lay the breasts skin side down, and cook until brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn them over and cook until done, about 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breasts. Pour out the fat as it accumulates in the pan. Remove the breasts to a tray, cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes before slicing. 7. Five minutes before you are ready to serve the duck, return the sauce to the heat and bring it to a simmer. Add the peppers and set aside for 3 minutes. 8. Steam the spinach until just wilted and drain well. 9. Use a sharp knife to slice the duck breasts thinly. Lay out 4 warmed plates. Place a mound of steamed spinach in the center of each plate and fan the duck slices around the spinach. Spoon the sauce over the meat, garnish with the spiced apples and serve. Yield: Four servings. Note: This recipe is best prepared with "magret," the breast of the moulard duck, which, in the United States, is a cross between the Muscovy and the Pekin, or Long Island, duck. About twice the size of other duck breasts, magret is available through specialty butchers or by mail order for about $3.50 a pound from D'Artagnan, Jersey City, N.J., (800) 327-8246. SPICY POACHED APPLES (ADAPTED FROM MICHEL GUERARD) 1/8 teaspoon each of ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground nutmeg and freshly ground pepper 1 quart apple cider 1/2 cup white wine 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored, each cut into 8 pieces lengthwise, each piece carved into a half moon. 1. Mix the spices together. 2. In a saucepan, combine the spices, apple cider and wine and bring to a boil. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Add the apples, take the pan off the heat and set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours before serving with the duck. Yield: Garnish for four servings.

365-> Garden Q. & A.
Starting Tarragon Q. I have heard that it is not possible to grow tarragon from seed. If this is true, how is it started? -- Genevive Hoffman, Riverdale, the Bronx. A. Although it is not the most handsome of plants, the true French tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus sativa) more than compensates for its place in the garden. This herb has aromatic, anise-flavored leaves that are often essential to fish, veal and poultry dishes as well as tartar and bearnaise sauces and salads. True French tarragon is propagated only by division and cuttings. The tarragon seeds available to gardeners come from the Russian tarragon plant, which is a coarser, less flavorful and less aromatic herb. It is not considered worthy of use in the kitchen. When buying a nursery-grown plant, don't be shy about asking which kind of tarragon it is. A helpful new book on growing herbs and greens is "The Salad Lover's Garden" by Sam Bittman (Doubleday, $25). Gardenia Bud Loss Q. Why do my gardenia buds dry up or fall off before blooming? The plant appears healthy, with deep green leaves. -- Shulamith Oppenheim, Amherst, Mass. A. Gardenias are like temperamental lovers: seductive but difficult to live with. A native of China, this evergreen shrub (Gardenia jasminoides) is prized for its fragrant white flowers. Since the 18th century, it has been grown outdoors in the South and indoors in the winter in very cold areas. But not always easily. To begin with, the plant does not tolerate drafts and does not like fluctuations in temperature, either of which may cause buds to drop. When grown indoors, it does best in a relatively cool room with some sun. Humidity must be kept high to insure good bud development; one way to do this is to place the potted plant on a pebble-filled tray that contains water. In addition, the soil must always be kept barely moist. If it dries even briefly, the flower buds die. Essential, too, is the regular addition of coffee to the soil, using either the grounds or liquid, said Patti Hagan, a garden writer and expert gardenia grower. Coffee is acidic and supplies nutrients, minerals and trace elements that seem to be of considerable benefit to gardenias. Barren Blueberries Q. Two years ago, I bought a highbush blueberry by mail. It has not borne fruit, and I can see no sign of buds this year. What does this plant need? -- Randall M. Church, Harrisburg, Pa. A. Like rhododendrons, their cousins in the Ericaceae family, highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum) must have loose, well-drained, evenly moist soil that is rich in organic matter. And like its relatives, highbush blueberries also need extremely acid soil. The pH should be close to 4 and no higher than 5. You can achieve this by working sphagnum peat moss into the soil, along with phosphate rock, potash and well-rotted manure. Finely ground sulfur or iron chelates also lower the pH. Assuming the soil is satisfactory and your blueberry receives at least five hours of sun daily, the problem of no blooms may be one of age. Mail-order nurseries often ship plants that are two to three years old, but it usually takes four to six years before the plants are mature enough to flower. Also, highbush blueberries are often self-sterile. This means your plant needs company to bear fruit. A different variety that flowers at an overlapping time must be grown within bee-flying distance. Since you cannot rely on a neighbor's having a different variety, you should grow one yourself to insure good pollination. These varieties bear flowers in more or less overlapping order, from earliest to latest: Bluetta, Earliblue, Northland, Patriot, Blueray, Ivanhoe, Bluecrop, Berkeley, Jersey, Herbert and Coville.

366-> FOOTBALL; Finally, Bucs Rule Out Parcells as No. 1 Man
In a terse statement that sounded like a spanking, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced yesterday that Bill Parcells would not be their new coach. Parcells, who two weeks ago rejected a five-year, $6.5 million offer to coach the Bucs and run their football operation, apparently changed his mind this week, only to have the Bucs reject him. The statement, saying that Parcells was no longer a candidate for the job, ended, at least for now, the confusing, back-and-forth flirtation Parcells has had in the last few weeks over his coaching future. Hugh Culverhouse, who owns the Buccaneers, called a news conference on Dec. 29 to announce that Parcells had first accepted the job and then changed his mind. At the time, Culverhouse left no doubt that he was upset over being "jilted." Hours later, on the NBC television pre-game show on which he had appeared all season, Parcells said he had never accepted the Tampa Bay job in the first place. Parcells later told the Green Bay Packers, who are also seeking a head coach, that he did not feel he was ready to return to coaching. That ended his current consideration of coaching options until he surprisingly reopened talks with the Buccaneers this week. Paper Reports Meeting The Tampa Tribune reported yesterday morning that Parcells and Culverhouse were talking again about a contract that called for fewer responsibilities and less money. Those talks, whatever their content, ended abruptly yesterday. "The Bucs announced that Bill Parcells is no longer a candidate for director of football operations and head coach," the team's statement said. "Mr. Culverhouse met today with Parcells in the Washington, D.C., area to discuss events leading to Parcells' rejection of the Bucs' five-year contract offer of Dec. 28. "Mr. Culverhouse stated that today's meeting did not provide him with the comfort level to pursue further discussions. There was no discussion of any modification of the monetary terms or other conditions of the original offer." After the Bucs' announcement, telephone calls to Parcells's office in Lyndhurst, N.J., went unanswered. Two hours earlier, apparently after the meeting with Culverhouse, Parcells said from his office only that he had nothing to say on the subject. He would not say if he had met Culverhouse this week or had plans to do so. Last night, Stephen Story, a Bucs' attorney, said there had been a two-and-a-half-hour meeting yesterday morning in Washington. He said he attended along with Parcells; Parcells's agent, Robert Fraley; Culverhouse, and Rich McKay, another Bucs' attorney. Story insisted that contract terms were not discussed. "Bill was disappointed," Story said in a later interview with The Associated Press. "He had looked forward to the possiblity of being coach. He had his opportunity and it just didn't happen this time." Giants Coach for 8 Years From 1983 through 1990, Parcells coached the Giants to two Super Bowl championships in eight years, the most recent last January. On May 15, three months short of his 50th birthday, he resigned with little warning. Under his successor, Ray Handley, the Giants slumped to an 8-8 record. When Parcells quit, he appeared worn down from coaching and expressed concern about his health. On Dec. 16, he underwent an angioplasty procedure to clear a blocked artery leading from the heart. He spent the 1991 season as a studio host and occasional game analyst for NBC television. Now he is expected to stay with NBC, although the network has denied reports that he will become their No. 1 analyst next season, replacing Bill Walsh, who is considering returning to the 49ers as a consultant. Culverhouse Embarrassed Culverhouse is a powerful figure in the National Football League. He seemed embarrassed in his original news conference when he said he had agreed to all 38 points that Parcells had sought in a contract, only to have Parcells back out. Parcells said he had not agreed to that contract, but had asked to have the points put in writing so he could study them and make a decision. The Bucs have been seeking a head coach since they dismissed Richard Williamson after a 3-13 season. They have interviewed Parcells, Buddy Ryan, Sam Wyche, Mike Holmgren and their defensive coordinator, Floyd Peters. Ron Erhardt, the Giants' offensive coordinator under Parcells, said Ryan had talked to him about a possible position with Tampa Bay if Ryan got the Bucs' job. On Tuesday, the Giants dismissed Erhardt, who spent last season as an assistant head coach with few duties, and Mike Pope, their long-time tight-end coach. Erhardt Figures in Plans "Buddy Ryan told me he was going to Tampa Bay to interview," Erhardt said. "He said if he got the job, would I be interested in being his offensive coordinator. I told him if he got the job, I would be willing to sit down with him and talk." Football people have assumed that if Parcells takes another head coaching job, he will hire Erhardt again. "If Bill takes a job," Erhardt said, "I think he feels very comfortable with how I approach things. I think he's comfortable with me."

367-> Sinan's Mosques
To the Editor: The Rustem Pasha Mosque that Mr. Bernier so enthusiastically describes is, indeed, one of the most interesting, but is currently under repair with those incredible Iznik tile walls covered by heavy protective canvas. Unlike Mr. Bernier, I would not depend on the taxi drivers to know the locations of all the mosques. Many of these drivers have recently come to Istanbul from Anatolia and if you can point out your desired destination on a tourist map you're likely to have better luck. The best approach to the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque is on foot, walking to the southeastern end of the Hippodrome, then following the street that runs steeply downhill. This gives an opportunity to see the high supporting wall (on your right) of the southern, semicircular end of the Hippodrome. From here, one can get a sense of the immensity of that ancient structure (spectator capacity estimated at 100,000) that a walk across the grassy center of the At Meydani cannot give. Continue along the street until you come to a restored Ottoman house, now a small hotel that has taken the name of the mosque. You'll see the minaret of the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha nearby. If it is locked when you arrive, wait around for a few minutes and it's likely someone will come to show you in and point out its unique features.

369-> BILLS SEEK TO END LAWMAKERS' PERKS
Driving home on Friday from Capitol Hill to his district in southern New Jersey, Representative William J. Hughes heard caller after caller tell a radio talk show host how angry they were over the perquisites enjoyed by members of Congress. "The tenor of the calls was, 'Who do they think they are?' " said Mr. Hughes, a Democrat who has been in Congress since 1975. He had no doubt that the House Bank affair, involving members of the House of Representatives who overdrew their special bank accounts, would help push legislation to cut back on some of the privileges enjoyed by members of Congress. Mr. Hughes, who has introduced such bills year after year without success, has said he did not overdraw his account at the House Bank. Mr. Hughes's bill, reintroduced in November with support from two other New Jersey Congressmen, Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat, and H. James Saxton, a Republican, is intended to cut down on lawmakers' costly international travel -- trips described by their defenders as fact-finding missions but by their critics as boondoggles. A Far-Reaching Proposal The Hughes bill is just one of several measures introduced in recent months by members of Congress eager to distance themselves from the image of lawmakers as elitist and greedy. "If we abolished the perks we would be inoculated against criticism of perks," said Representative Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat who has proposed one of the most far-reaching bills. Mr. Bennett's proposal, which has also been offered in the Senate by Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, would seek to abolish virtually all of the extra benefits that lawmakers receive, either free or at reduced costs. The bill has about 30 co-sponsors. Another approach was offered in January by Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota. His bill would examine the many perks now available to lawmakers and eliminate those that are either unrelated to their official duties or that are not generally available to the public. Under Mr. Daschle's proposal, many benefits offered to lawmakers at cut rates would instead be provided by contractors charging full market prices, with the profits turned over to the Treasury to reduce the deficit. Free Medical Service Any effort to control Congressional perks would have to examine a wide variety of privileges enjoyed by lawmakers and, in some cases, by members of their staffs. One bill, for example, introduced last year by Representative Michael Bilirakis, a Florida Republican, would require members of Congress to pay for the medical service and prescriptions they now obtain free from the Office of the Attending Physician, which is operated by the Navy. Even though members of Congress have health insurance programs comparable to those of other Federal employees, they can get free health care ranging from physical exams and laboratory tests to electrocardiograms and ambulance service from the special office. Free Health Club Among the other perks used by lawmakers, according to listings published by Congressional Quarterly and by the Congressional Accountability Project, are these: *Free health club privileges at a gymnasium in a House Office Building and exercise rooms in two Senate office buildings. The gym includes a swimming pool, a steam room and handball, volleyball and basketball courts. *A special ticketing office that serves as a travel agent for members of Congress. Airlines may give them free upgrades to first-class seats. And they have their own free parking spaces close to the terminals at airports in the Washington area. *Restaurants on Capitol Hill, used by lawmakers, staff members and visitors, are subsidized by the Government. There are five public restaurants and five others reserved for members of Congress and their guests. Members may also reserve private rooms for dining and may arrange banquets catered at low cost. *Free parking in garages on Capitol Hill, and indoor or outdoor spaces for senior staff members. *About $100,000 of life insurance, with one-third of the premiums paid by taxpayers, is provided to members of Congress. They are also eligible to participate in standard Federal employee health insurance, contributing to the premiums. *A special $3,000 annual tax deduction for living expenses. The Internal Revenue Service also maintains a special office in both the Senate and the House from February through April 15 to help lawmakers and staff members prepare tax returns. Although these perks have been widely criticized in recent months, Ralph Nader, a leading critic of Congressional privileges, said that doing away with such fringe benefits was not the central issue. He said it was more important that Congress rescind the pay increase it voted for itself last year.

370-> HOCKEY; Hats Are Off to Blues' Hull As He Extends Scoring Streak
His shots did not seem to travel. They simply arrived, way ahead of schedule once again, in the rear of the Ranger net. Brett Hull, the human with an extraterrestrial slap shot, performed his light-speed stick work last night while transporting St. Louis to a 5-3 victory over the Rangers. Two slaps and a flick of the wrist meant three Blues' goals, and a Ranger defeat that kept New York locked in a first-place tie with Washington in the Patrick Division. For Hull, making his only visit this season to Madison Square Garden, a 15th-career hat trick was nearly business as usual. He now has 43 goals on the season; a goal-scoring streak of 10 straight games; a point-scoring streak of 19 games, and an astounding 40 goals in his last 34 games. The Rangers, like other teams, had a plan to contain Hull. They were going to assign the best checker on each line to cover him, rotating them to remain fresh and sharp. But Hull, too slippery for all that, eluded Randy Gilhen in the first period, then went completely unwatched during a Ranger power play in the second. "Usually, it's different around here, they check you so tight," Hull said. "Tonight, they seemed to have a different game plan." Obviously, the blueprint did not fit the job. Hull beat Ranger goaltender Mike Richter twice with his lightning shot, and again at 14 minutes 10 seconds of the final period on a breakaway for the final goal of the game. By then, the Rangers were down a goal and stretching themselves: a perfect set-up for the league's ultimate opportunist. "When he's shooting," Richter said, "there's a real urgency about getting ready." Costly Penalty to Beukeboom Even when he was not scoring, Hull was a problem. As the Rangers gathered themselves for a third-period rally, his charge down the left wing drew a roughing penalty by defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, and an ill-timed manpower disadvantage for New York. The two men collided a couple of times, sticks went up, Beukeboom ended up with six stitches in the face, and a two-minute penalty. "Jeff was crosschecked in the head, he gets six stitches, it happens in front of everybody," Ranger Coach Roger Neilson said. "I don't know how that can happen." No matter how hard Neilson complained, he could not make Hull's remarkable feats on this night go away. Unmarked by Gilhen in the slot after a face-off in the first period, Hull took a pass from linemate Dave Christian and fired a wide-open slap shot at Richter. The puck took off, as it always does from Hull's stick, and did not slow until it struck net at 7:26. Short-Handed Goal Most amazing was his second goal, a short-handed score at 7:44 of the second period, when Hull got his own rebound and shot again from low in the right circle. Somehow, despite the improbable angle, Hull's shot found the upper left corner of the net as Richter grabbed at air. "He had maybe an inch," Richter said. "I thought I had enough time, but he just unleashes them." Hull called this shot, "a half slap shot." He said he did not expect to be sent out as a penalty killer by St. Louis Coach Brian Sutter, but quickly got into the spirit of things. "The puck came back to me, and I just guessed where the net was," said Hull, whose short-handed score was only the second of his career, both this season. He guessed right, as usual. The puck went in, as usual. "Maybe you do have to have somebody follow him around," Ranger forward Adam Graves said. "He seems to find those holes, and wherever there's a hole you'll find Brett Hull." SLAP SHOTS Despite his 43 goals, BRETT HULL has a zero plus-minus rating this season. . . . The victory was only the fifth road victory for the Blues, and just the sixth home defeat for the Rangers this season. . . . St. Louis goaltender CURTIS JOSEPH, who leads the league in save percentage, turned aside 35 of 38 shots. . . . MARK MESSIER, BRIAN LEETCH, MIKE GARTNER and Coach ROGER NEILSON will conduct a clinic next Wednesday at Lasker Rink in Central Park for the youngsters of the Ice Hockey in Harlem program.

371-> DANCE VIEW; Abstractions Have Their Human Side, Too
Because human beings can't stop being human, abstract dances can't be totally abstract. Choreographers who purport to tell no stories still make dancers seem like distinct individuals engaged in conflict or united in harmony. Molissa Fenley, Peter Pucci, Randy Warshaw and Doug Varone all created storyless dramatic dances in the "Altogether Different" series that recently concluded at the Joyce Theater. Their best offerings were focused and rich in implications. Their worst were so ambiguous as to be vague. These four choreographers must surely agree with George Balanchine, who, when asked why he didn't choreograph stories, replied that two dancers on a stage were a story in themselves. In such a story, dancers can hurtle past one another, collide or try to avoid collision. Or they can stop moving, root themselves side by side, then reach out and touch -- gently or firmly, warily or confidently. Whatever they do, their movements are somehow connected to joys, sorrows, fears and aspirations known to everyone. Dance cannot stop presenting images of human behavior. Take Mr. Pucci's spare but eloquent "Love Duets." The work, performed in silence, consisted of three duets, each with similar steps that required the performers to draw near while making sculptural shapes in space. What provided "Love Duets" with emotional resonance was the fact that the first duet was for two women, the second for a man and a woman, and the last for two men. Mr. Pucci's title announced his intentions. But audience members who failed to glance at the printed program would still have found it difficult to believe that this piece was simply a minimalist study in which different people did the same steps. The choreography spoke for itself. Mr. Pucci's three duets treated heterosexual, lesbian and homosexual love with equal respect. Mr. Warshaw called his entire Joyce program "Fictions of Relationship." His dancers' costumes evoked no specific locale or historical period. Yet the movements he created brought people together in ever-changing relationships. In "Shutter," dancers wandered across a fog-filled stage to melancholy trombone wails by Peter Zummo. They made fumbling attempts to establish contact and, once they did, appeared uncertain of how to react. For instance, in a male duet, Jeff Lepore and Conor McTeague could have been either wrestling with or comforting each other -- or both. The stage may have been foggy; the dance was not. The choreography's consistent and deliberate ambiguity revealed that "Shutter" depicted confused people. The fog in which they were lost was somewhere in their minds or hearts. Ms. Fenley's mesmerizing "Place," to a mystically intense score by Arvo Part, could have been superficially viewed as a solo emphasizing stately poses. Ms. Fenley, however, was more than a moving statue. Several sequences resembled struggles with unseen forces; there were fleeting gestures that suggested praying hands. "Place" concluded triumphantly. Ms. Fenley was obviously treading sacred ground; before her solo ended, her movements implied that she had been blessed. Mr. Part based his composition "Sarah Was 90 Years Old" on the biblical story of Sarah, who, though she feared that she was barren, gave birth to Isaac in her old age. Nothing in the choreography literally retold that Old Testament narrative, and you didn't have to know the composer's source material. Nevertheless, choreography and music were spiritually allied. In contrast, Mr. Varone had difficulty establishing focus in two of his productions. That was unfortunate, for he has often been able to extract a wealth of meaning from a few shrewdly chosen movements. Thus, his "Cantata 78/Every Waking Hour" (1986) was a tender tribute to human trust and compassion; in "Antediluvian" (1989), he envisioned humanity on the brink of catastrophe. But, at the Joyce, his "Stranded Landfish" gave the impression of being nothing more than the constant meanderings of six dancers to Latin melodies played on the saxophone, with taped accompaniment, by Luis Pauta, a street musician who performs in subway stations. Actions occurred for no apparent reason and -- worse -- with no impact. Whereas "Stranded Landfish" was choreographically impoverished, "Force Majeure," to music by Christopher Hyams-Hart, was crammed with allusions that grew increasingly and frustratingly elusive in meaning. The program note quoted from "The Spell," an antifascist novel written in 1934 by Hermann Broch. Mr. Varone's choreography called upon the dancers to resemble members of a community. They occasionally ran mindlessly or marched like robots. One man kept bursting into maniacal laughter. Another died. Still another grieved over him. Although the agitation was conceivably related to the threat of fascism, "Force Majeure" defied explication and categorization. If its harsh images were like those of an abstract painting with jagged lines and fragmentary shapes, its sheer profusion of incidents made it closer to a conventional choreographic narrative than to the sort of work Balanchine had in mind when he made his comment about two dancers on stage. Even when viewed as a narrative, "Force Majeure" proved unsatisfactory. Connections between events were blurry, and one wanted to know more about who these people were and why they behaved so oddly. Whereas Mr. Varone grew hazy, Ms. Fenley, Mr. Pucci and Mr. Warshaw knew precisely what they wanted to bring from the outside world to the world of the stage. Their abstractions were clear in both choreographic patterning and human significance.

372-> Houghton Mifflin Loss
The Houghton Mifflin Company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $5.6 million on Wednesday because of seasonal fluctuations in the publishing business, but the company finished the year with higher profits. The quarterly loss compared with a loss of $8.3 million in the corresponding period last year. Sales for the quarter rose 2.4 percent, to $78.4 million, from $76.6 million in the 1990 period. Houghton Mifflin said it normally reports a loss in the fourth quarter because schoolbooks are bought earlier in the year. For the year, the company earned $25.1 million, or $1.75 a share, up 39 percent from its profit of $18 million, or $1.27 a share, for 1990. Full-year sales increased nearly 11 percent, to $466.8 million from $421.6 million. Houghton Mifflin stock rose 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $31.25.

373-> Metropolitan Diary
THE scene: the bread line at Zabar's where Marion Thunberg encounters an excited elderly woman who says: "I'm so thrilled. I just saw Tony Randall in meat!" . . . Dear Diary: The place is the boys' locker room at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, Upper Division, on West 93d Street. Time: around 6:45 P.M. Myself and two men in their 30's are changing into swimsuits for a deep-water running class. Enter a sixth-grade boy, clad in a toga with a plastic sword strapped to his waist. He adjusts his costume before continuing rehearsal. First man: What play are you putting on? Boy (with pride and confidence): "The Iliad." First man (knowingly): Oh yeah. Second man: Cool play. All is silent as the two men exit down the adjoining hallway until one is heard speaking. "What's 'The Iliad'?" he asks. -- JOSEPH A. TRAVER . . . A chilly, gray afternoon on Madison Avenue. Lori Klinger passes a mother and her young son just in time to hear the woman say: "Oliver! If you don't behave you're not going to Barbados!" . . . Dear Diary: Seeing the current TV commercial in which Cher extols the virtues of a low-calorie sugar substitute reminded me of the time, a while back, I found myself seated directly in front of that svelte lady and her male companion at a performance of "The Phantom of the Opera." She munched her way through a whole box (large size) of Milk Duds during the first half of the show. At intermission, she tossed the empty box on the floor and left. The box, by the way, was retrieved by an adoring teen-ager who put it lovingly in his pocket. -- KAROLYN K. WRIGHTSON . . . Dear Diary: For the last 12 years, I have been more or less involved in the public-service advertising campaign "Take a Bite Out of Crime," featuring the trench-coated crime-fighting dog McGruff. As a matter of fact, I am the voice of McGruff on radio and television. From time to time I've had to call the parent organization, the National Crime Prevention Council, in Washington from my home in Nyack, N.Y. The receptionist knew who I was and would often ask me to talk like McGruff. I would and she'd giggle and put my call through. Until this morning. I phoned Mac Gray, the director of marketing. A syrupy recorded voice came on: "You have reached the N.C.P.C. If you know the extension you may dial it at any time." I didn't know the extension. "If you don't know the extension dial 555. If you want to dial Q press 5. If you want to dial Z press 9." I dialed 555. "Now dial the first three letters of the name of the person you wish to reach." That threw me. Was it Grey or Gray; I didn't know at the time. Suppose it was like Psmythe, the Wodehouse hero? Or Tsongas. The hesitation doomed me. Before I could dial, the voice returned: "I'm sorry, we have no extension in that name. Please start over." I did, this time moving swiftly through 555 and G-R-A. It rang. A voice said, "Hello, this ---- " and suddenly it was cut off with "If you know the extension you may dial it at any time. If you don't know the extension dial 555. If you want to dial Q. . . ." After a few choice words to the disembodied voice I 5-5-5'ed and G-R-A'ed once more. To my delight an extension rang once . . . twice . . . three times and . . . "Hello, this is Jan Grant. We're having a birthday party in the office today and I can't come to the phone. If you have a message please leave it now." I said, "Happy birthday," and asked her to wish Mac Gray one as well. Whatever his extension. -- JOHN M. KEIL . . . Overheard on a Madison Avenue bus by Cynthia S. Pader of the Bronx. First woman: I must remember to phone Lincoln Center and order tickets for that new show, "Six Baboons Adoring the Sun." Second woman: You're confusing that show with the one they just had, "Six Degrees of Separation." The new show is "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun." First woman: So I'm off by two baboons! . . . Dear Diary: To be filed under I, as in I'm-Really-Too-Old-for-the-90's. A friend of mine is a constant talker; her line is always busy. So I went to Sweet Sensations on Columbus Avenue, where they have a most impressive selection of chocolate items, to buy her an appropriate gift. "Do you have any chocolate telephones?" I said almost apologetically. "Of course," the young man behind the counter responded without a moment's hesitation. "Standard or cellular?" -- ADELE APPLEBAUM

374-> Grammy Short List: Many For a Few
The 34th annual Grammy Awards are shaping up as a battle between Bryan Adams, R.E.M., Bonnie Raitt, Amy Grant and Natalie Cole. Each was nominated for record of the year and a single, and received between 3 and 6 other nominations in the 78 categories covered by this year's Grammy Awards. The winners will be named on Feb. 25 during a national CBS telecast. The nominations were announced yesterday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in a news conference at the Apollo Theater. R.E.M., the band from Athens, Ga., that brought collegiate or alternative rock into the Top 10, received 7 nominations for its 8th album, "Out of Time," and the single "Losing My Religion." The group had never previously been nominated. Mr. Adams, the Canadian rocker whose hit from the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You," has sold 10 million copies worldwide as a single, received 6 nominations for that song and another song, "Can't Stop This Thing We Started," which both appear on the album "Waking Up the Neighbors." Three Categories Added Ms. Raitt, the singer and songwriter who swept three major categories in 1989, received five nominations for her album "Luck of the Draw." Ms. Grant, a pop-gospel singer who has received five previous Grammy Awards, and Ms. Cole, who has received three previous awards, were each nominated in four categories. Three new categories were added to the awards this year: world music, covering international performers; rock song, a songwriters' award that pits Mr. Adams against Sting, Metallica, Jane's Addiction, Tom Petty and Queensryche, and traditional pop, which covers pre-rock pop. As has often occurred with the Grammy Awards, hugely popular music that appeals primarily to younger audiences, including best-selling albums by Guns 'n' Roses, Public Enemy, Metallica and Nirvana, was relegated to separate categories, such as hard rock, rap, heavy metal and alternative music. American Classical In the classical categories, the nominations for best classical album all feature music by 20th-century American composers: Samuel Barber, Leonard Bernstein, Elliott Carter, John Corigliano, Howard Hanson and Charles Ives. The Grammy Awards are voted on by the approximately 6,000 academy members. The eligible recordings were released between Oct. 1, 1990, and Sept. 30, 1991. Albums released late in 1991 by Michael Jackson and U2, among others, will be eligible next year. Along with the nominations, the news conference announced other academy activities in the weeks preceding the awards ceremony: Grammy in the Schools, which sends academy members to talk to students in 15 cities, and Musicares, a charity for indigent musicians and other recording-business people, which will hold a fund-raising dinner on Feb. 22. Here is a partial list of the nominees: Record of the Year (a single): Amy Grant, "Baby Baby"; Bryan Adams, "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You"; R.E.M., "Losing My Religion"; Bonnie Raitt, "Something to Talk About"; Natalie Cole (with Nat Cole): "Unforgettable." Album of the Year: Amy Grant, 'Heart in Motion"; Bonnie Raitt, "Luck of the Draw"; R.E.M., "Out of Time"; Paul Simon, "The Rhythm of the Saints"; Natalie Cole, "Unforgettable."

375-> ELECTION PROSPECT GROWING IN ISRAEL
Prospects for early Israeli elections increased today with the imminent departure of two right-wing parties from the governing coalition, but Government officials insisted that the political turmoil would have no effect on Israel's participation in Middle East peace talks. "The peace process has to continue even after the crisis," Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters. Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took pains to argue that the political uncertainty would have no effect on Mr. Shamir's commitment to continue peace negotiations with the Arabs. "The determination and faithfulness to the peace process remains emphatically unchanged, and the Prime Minister will not stray one bit from this course," the Prime Minister's spokesman, Ehud Gol, said. Mr. Shamir held consultations throughout the day with ministers from his Likud party to discuss possible options after the expected resignation on Sunday of ministers from the far-right Tehiya and Moledet Parties. Autonomy Offer Cited Yuval Neeman of Tehiya and Rehavaam Zeevi of Moledet said they were leaving the Government because it had offered autonomy to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The two ministers decided to resign after Mr. Shamir showed them a document presented to Palestinian negotiators in Washington that referred to self-governing arrangements. The ministers' departure would deprive the Government of a parliamentary majority, leaving it susceptible to defeat in a no-confidence motion to be submitted in Parliament this month by the opposition Labor Party. Mr. Shamir can now try to maintain a minority government, or initiate action to dissolve Parliament and set a date for early elections. The next national election is due in November, but could now be moved up to May or June. The Prime Minister could also choose to hand in his resignation to President Chaim Herzog, who would then authorize either Mr. Shamir or the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, to form another coalition. In the interim, the current Likud-led Cabinet would remain in power as a caretaker. But the emerging political consensus is that Mr. Shamir will ultimately move to call early elections, possibly in coordination with the Labor Party.

376-> Isaac Asimov, Whose Thoughts and Books Traveled the Universe, Is Dead at 72
Isaac Asimov, the pre-eminent popular-science writer of the day and for more than 40 years one of the best and best-known writers of science fiction, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. He was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan. He died of heart and kidney failure, said his brother, Stanley. Mr. Asimov was amazingly prolific, writing nearly 500 books on a wide range of subjects, from works for preschoolers to college textbooks. He was perhaps best known for his science fiction and was a pioneer in elevating the genre from pulp-magazine adventure to a more intellectual level that dealt with sociology, history, mathematics and science. But he also wrote mysteries, as well as critically acclaimed books about the Bible, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, limericks, humor, Shakespeare, Gilbert and Sullivan, ancient and modern history, and many other subjects. Mr. Asimov's first book, "Pebble in the Sky" (Ballantine), a science-fiction novel, was published in 1950. His first 100 books took him 237 months, or almost 20 years, until October 1969, to write. His second 100, a milestone he reached in March 1979, took 113 months, or about 9 1/2 years -- a rate of more than 10 books a year. His third 100 took only 69 months, until December 1984, or less than 6 years. "Writing is more fun than ever," he said in a 1984 interview. "The longer I write, the easier it gets." He once explained how he came to write "Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare" (Crown). It began, he said, with a book called "Words of Science." " 'Science' led to 'Words on the Map,' " he remarked, "which took me to 'The Greeks,' which led me to 'The Roman Republic,' 'The Roman Empire,' 'The Egyptians,' 'The Near East,' 'The Dark Ages,' 'The Shaping of England' and then 'Words From History.' It was an easy jump to 'Words in Genesis,' which brought on 'Words From the Exodus.' That led me to 'Asimov's Guide to the Old Testament,' and then 'The New Testament.' So what was left except Shakespeare?" His usual routine was to awake at 6 A.M., sit down at the typewriter by 7:30 and work until 10 P.M. In "In Memory Yet Green," the first volume of his autobiography, published in 1979, he explained how he became a compulsive writer. His Russian-born father owned a succession of candy stores in Brooklyn that were open from 6 A.M. to 1 A.M. seven days a week. Young Isaac got up at 6 o'clock every morning to deliver papers and rushed home from school to help out in the store every afternoon. If he was even a few minutes late, his father yelled at him for being a folyack, Yiddish for sluggard. Even more than 50 years later, he wrote: "It is a point of pride with me that though I have an alarm clock, I never set it, but get up at 6 A.M. anyway. I am still showing my father I'm not a folyack." He Learns to Read, Then Teaches Sister Isaac Asimov was born Jan. 2, 1920, in the Soviet Union, near Smolensk, the son of Judah and Anna Rachel Berman Asimov. He was brought to the United States in 1923 and was naturalized in 1928. He taught himself to read before he was 5 years old, using the signs on his Brooklyn street. A couple of years later, with a little help from his father, he taught himself to read Yiddish. When he was 7, he taught his younger sister to read. He skipped several grades and received a high-school diploma when he was 15. After discovering science fiction on the magazine rack in his father's store -- and overcoming his father's objections to fanciful subject matter -- he tried writing science fiction himself and sold his first story when he was 18. The story, "Marooned Off Vesta," ran in the October 1938 issue of Amazing Stories. Three years later, in 1941, he sold a story called "Nightfall" to Astounding Science Fiction, then the top magazine in the field. It was edited by John W. Campbell Jr., whose ability to find talented writers was largely responsible for what is considered the Golden Age of science fiction in the 1930's and 40's. Almost 30 years after "Nightfall" was published, the Science Fiction Writers of America voted it the best science-fiction short story ever written. Astounding Science paid a cent a word, Mr. Asimov once recalled. "So for a 12,000-word story I expected $120. I got a check for $150 and thought Mr. Campbell had made a mistake." But when Mr. Asimov called to tell him, "he said the story had seemed so good to him he gave me a bonus of one-quarter cent a word." Mr. Asimov graduated from Columbia University in 1939 with a bachelor of science degree, and earned an M.A. in 1941 and a Ph.D. in chemistry there in 1948. The next year, he accepted an offer from Boston University's School of Medicine to teach biochemistry. "I didn't feel impelled to tell them that I'd never had any biochemistry," he recalled in a 1969 interview. "By 1951 I was writing a textbook on biochemistry, and I finally realized the only thing I really wanted to be was a writer." He was made an associate professor of biochemistry in 1955 and a professor in 1979, although he stopped teaching in 1958 and only occasionally went back to the university to lecture. A Science Fiction Of Verve and Clarity Mr. Asimov's science-fiction novels and stories won many awards: five Hugos, given by the fans, and three Nebula Awards, given by his fellow writers. His "Foundation Trilogy" (all published by Doubleday) -- which takes place in a future galactic empire and consists of "Foundation" (1951), "Foundation and Empire" (1952) and "Second Foundation" (1953) -- was given a Hugo in 1966 as Best All-Time Science-Fiction Series. Among his nonfiction works, "Asimov's New Guide to Science" is considered one of the best books about science for the layman. Reviewing "Foundation's Edge" (Doubleday), a sequel to the trilogy and the first of Mr. Asimov's books to make the New York Times best-seller list, the critic Gerald Jonas said in The New York Times Book Review in 1982: "He writes much better than he did 33 years ago -- yet he has lost none of the verve he brought to this series when he and the galaxy were much younger. What more could one ask?" "Foundation's Edge" won a Hugo in 1983 as the best science-fiction novel of the year. In recent years, Mr. Asimov wrote "Foundation and Earth" (1986) and "Prelude to Foundation" (1988). A final novel, "Forward the Foundation," is to be published by Bantam Books later this year. Mr. Asimov himself made no great claims for his work. "I make no effort to write poetically or in a high literary style," he said in 1984. "I try only to write clearly and I have the very good fortune to think clearly so that the writing comes out as I think, in satisfactory shape." "I never read Hemingway or Fitzgerald or Joyce or Kafka," he once wrote. "To this day I am a stranger to 20th-century fiction and poetry, and I have no doubt that it shows in my writing." No Typist or Agent, And No Airplanes He wrote his first drafts on his typewriter, and short articles and final drafts on a word processor, and he rewrote everything only once. "It's not out of conceit," he said. "But I have lots of stuff I'm committed to write and if I linger lovingly I won't be able to write at all." Not everything, however, fell into place easily. He once did a children's book in a day, but the Shakespeare book took two years. The book he considered his favorite, "Murder at the A.B.A." (1976), a mystery novel in which he himself was a character, took seven weeks; "The Gods Themselves" (1972), a science-fiction novel that won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards, took seven months. "I do all my own typing, my own research, answer my own mail," Mr. Asimov once said. "I don't even have a literary agent. This way there are no arguments, no instructions, no misunderstandings. I work every day. Sunday is my best day: no mail, no telephones. Writing is my only interest. Even speaking is an interruption." Although he wrote about space travel through countless universes and light years, Mr. Asimov himself refused to fly. "Isaac says that he loves to fly into space and span the galaxies," the editor Ben Bova once remarked. "But only in his imagination." Among Mr. Asimov's other well-known science-fiction works were "I, Robot" (1950), in which he invented his famous Three Laws of Robotics, which govern the relation of robots to their human masters: robots may not injure a human or, by inaction, allow a human to be harmed; robots must obey humans' orders unless doing so conflicts with the first law; robots must protect their own existence unless doing so conflicts with the first two laws. Robot and galactic-empire themes eventually expanded and intertwined in 14 novels. Secret of Success: It's All in the Genes He also wrote many nonfiction works and magazine articles on a wide range of subjects and was the editorial director of a magazine named after him -- Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine -- for which he wrote the editorials in each issue. He received the James T. Grady Award of the American Chemical Society in 1965 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science-Westinghouse Science Writing Award in 1967. Recently Mr. Asimov said he had had a prostate operation and was cutting back on his writing. He suspended his monthly column in Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine, to which he had contributed some 400 columns and articles over 33 years. Writing 10 or more books a year was standard procedure for Mr. Asimov, and he continued his busy pace after a heart attack in 1977 and triple bypass surgery in 1983. "I have been fortunate to be born with a restless and efficient brain, with a capacity for clear thought and an ability to put that thought into words," he once remarked. "None of this is to my credit. I am the beneficiary of a lucky break in the genetic sweepstakes." Mr. Asimov once told an interviewer about sadly contemplating death and the end of conscious thought. But, he said, he cheered himself with the thought that "I don't have to worry about that, because there isn't an idea I've ever had that I haven't put down on paper." Mr. Asimov married Gertrude Blugerman in 1942; they were divorced in 1973. In addition to his brother, of Roslyn Heights, L.I., he is survived by his wife, Janet Jeppson, whom he married in 1973; a son, David, of California; a daughter, Robyn, of Manhattan, and a sister, Marcia Repanes of Queens. FROM THE YET TO BE TO THE LONG AGO Isaac Asimov, a self-confessed compulsive writer, produced nearly 500 books on a remarkable array of subjects, reaching out not only to distant galaxies but also to the distant past for inspiration. Here is a small sampling of his prodigious output.

378-> PRO BASKETBALL; Riley Returns to 'Showtime' and Oscars
Pat Riley looks intently toward the future and rarely looks back. That is part of what keeps him driven, what keeps him hungry for more success no matter how much he achieves. But Wednesday night at the Forum, Riley will have to look back. He will return to the Forum for the first time as the Knicks' coach to face the Los Angeles Lakers, the team he coached to four National Basketball Association championships in nine seasons. The Lakers are Riley's lifeline to professional basketball. He played for them, he coached them, and he will always be linked to them historically, no matter what he accomplishes in New York. To outsiders who will not feel the electricity, it may be just another game on the 82-game schedule. But those close to Riley know he will feel a multitude of emotions as he steps into the arena, as he enters the visitor's locker room, and finally when he appears in front of the capacity crowd to lead the Knicks (34-20) into battle. Emotional Night in Store "It's going to be an emotional night for him," said Michael Cooper after the Laker practice today. Cooper, who was a key guard-forward on all of Riley's championship teams in Los Angeles, is now the team's special assistant to the general manager. "Having to stand up and yell from the other side of the court is going to be difficult for him," Cooper said. "He has meant so much to the Forum and to the people of L.A. He'll have friends there, and it's going to be a great crowd. And I'll tell you, 16,000 of those people will probably come to see Coach Riley. I just hope he doesn't do what he does best, which is win." The Lakers' current circumstances will make the atmosphere even more intense. Magic Johnson, Riley's close friend who played for him throughout his years here, is expected to attend. Riley and Johnson have talked frequently since last November, when Johnson announced that he was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and that he would retire from the Lakers. Riley often speaks of Johnson with admiration, and seeing Johnson again will certainly remind Riley of their glory days. Meanwhile, the Lakers (29-25) are on a seven-game losing streak, their longest since 1958. Most people have never seen the Lakers struggle to win as they are now, and some of their opponents feel it's about time. But Riley revealed some of his inner feel ings earlier this week, when asked if he felt that some people relished seeing the Lakers lose. On Lakers: 'They'll Be Back' "I'm sure some people do, but I don't," Riley said. "They've lost Earvin, they lost Vlade Divac for a while, and it has been tough for them. But they'll be back." Riley has played down his feelings about Wednesday's game, although it is also a night when the Lakers will honor their 1972 championship team, which Riley played on. Riley prefers to keep some of his thoughts private, to share them only with those close to him. "I'm sure I'll have visions tomorrow about some of the things I remember from when I was once on that floor," said Riley after today's practice. "I'm obviously going to have mixed emotions. But I'm sure once they toss the ball up, both sides will forget about that stuff. The Lakers have lost seven in a row. If for no other reason they'll want to beat us to stop thtat slide." Everyone else knows better. The Knick players said Riley had not said anything special to them about Wednesday's game, nor did they expect him to. But it wasn't necessary. "It has to be special for him," said Mark Jackson, the Knicks' point guard. "He coached there. He played there. It's a part of his life. We'd just like to win the game." Talk About How Riley Left Riley's return to Los Angeles has rekindled discussion about the way he departed. The 1989-90 Lakers were 63-19 during the regular season, but were upset by Phoenix, 4-1, in the second round of the playoffs. There was talk that Riley's demanding style had mentally burned out some players, that after nine years the players had begun to tune him out. Cooper said the situation was not that clear-cut. "I've been told that I was one of the sources of all the negativity that was going on at that time," Cooper said. "But we all respected him very much. No one could force Pat Riley out. No player could have. Of course, Dr. Buss could do it," Cooper said, referring to the Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss. "But he was very happy with Coach Riley and I don't think he had anything to do with Pat's decision to leave. "I don't feel he was pushed out. I was shocked that he left. He had said some things before about leaving and we always said, 'Yeah, Riles, sure.' We knew he'd be back. So for him to actually follow through on it was shocking. I truly believe he felt it was time to try something new." Lured Off TV by Knicks But after working last year as a basketball analyst for NBC, Riley was lured back to coaching by the Knicks. He has been a dominant factor in the team's resurgence, and many of his colleagues are happy that Riley is proving that he can win without Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, or James Worthy. "I always gave Pat Riley his due," said Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons of the Suns. "Yes, a coach should win with the teams he had in L.A. But he's one of the most organized, most prepared, most competitive people you'll ever be around. And the Knicks needed a coach like him. Those players know that he's going to be there. Any player there can decide to complain if he wants to, but they're not going to run a coach of that stature out of town. The players know that, so they have no choice but to respect him. I knew he would win there, and he will continue to win. And what better place for Pat Riley to be than the Big Apple." REBOUNDS XAVIER McDANIEL continued his inconsistent play in Tuesday's game at Phoenix, scoring only 6 points. It was not the kind of return to Phoenix that McDaniel, who was traded to the Knicks by the Suns in October, had in mind. "Sure, you can't help but think about it," McDaniel said when asked if he thought his play had contributed to the loss. But I can't get down on myself. I have to keep working." . . . JOHN STARKS dislocated the pinky on his left hand, but he practiced Tuesday and is expected to play on Wednesday.

379-> Ex-P.O.W in Iraq Is Sent Hate Mail for Marrying Black
A soldier who was taken prisoner by Iraq in the Persian Gulf war has been receiving hate mail because of her marriage to a black man, an Army spokesman says. The 22-year-old former prisoner of war, Specialist Melissa Rathbun Coleman, who is white, was captured by Iraqi soldiers while driving a truck during the battle for Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and spent 33 days in captivity. After her release, she married a fellow soldier, Specialist 4 Michael Coleman, 32. They now live in El Paso, near Fort Bliss, where they are stationed, and are expecting a child in the spring.

380-> Bridge
It is a familiar scene. Under the lights in a stadium in Boca Raton, Fla., Gabriela Sabatini has won yet another tennis match, and thousands of fans applaud as a monstrous check, about three feet long, is handed over. But something is different. The numbers on the check are smaller than one might expect, and Sabatini is giving, not receiving. And the recipient, who lives nearby, is wearing a suit and is not a tennis player. His name is Richard Pavlicek, and he has just won the Virginia Slims all-star bridge tournament, organized by Bridge Today magazine and played concurrently with the Virginia Slims tennis tournament. (In a pro-am curtain-raiser to the bridge tournament itself, Meredith McGrath, a 20-year-old tennis expert, played duplicate with 19-year-old Andrew Moss, a bridge expert. "I couldn't do this professionally," she remarked afterward. "There is too much tension.") This happened 11 days ago, and Pavlicek's prize was $4,000, part of a total prize fund of $10,000. The competition will be repeated next year, with an increased prize pool of $15,000. It is expected to be part of a professional circuit, with the next event to be played in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in July. In Boca Raton, 16 invited bridge experts competed in an individual contest scored by imps. Notably successful were the players who learned their bridge in other parts of the world: second was Zia Mahmood, who represents Pakistan but lives in Manhattan when he is not on the road; third was Sabine Zenkel, who represents Germany but lives in Chicago, and fourth was Benito Garozzo, who won many world titles for Italy but lives in Palm Beach, Fla. Notably unsuccessful -- Pavlicek aside -- were six Americans who have won world championships: they were almost all crowded at the bottom of the final standings. One of the difficulties with an individual is that the players have little chance to discuss bidding methods. The usual solution, adopted in this case, is to impose a standard method, a lowest common denominator. Most of the required bidding language was sensible, but some of the players may have wondered why they were expected to use two styles that are obsolescent in serious play: the forcing jump raise and forcing secondary jumps by the responder. It is generally assumed that three no-trump is easier to make than six no-trump, but the diagramed deal from the All-Star game suggests, paradoxically, that the converse is sometimes true. At two tables South played in three no-trump, which would normally be easy with 30 high-card points in the combined hands. After a heart lead there were eight tricks in clear view, but the ninth proved elusive. Both declarers won the first trick with the heart queen in dummy and cashed winners in spades and diamonds. After discovering that West was short in both those suits they inferred length in clubs. That was right as far as it went, but when they then played West for the club queen they lost to East and failed by two tricks. At a third table, as shown, West overcalled one club with three hearts, a somewhat frivolous pre-emptive action, vulnerable, that succeeded in throwing a monkey wrench into the North-South bidding. Zenkel, sitting South, could have doubled East's four-heart bid and collected 800 points. Instead she bid four no-trump, which was no doubt intended to be natural. But North assumed that the bid was Blackwood and he showed two aces, leading to a shaky six no-trump contract. West knew that a heart lead might give South a trick and therefore selected a passive spade lead. South took the king and the queen, and inferred correctly that the missing minor-suit honors were on her right. She therefore led to the club ace and played the diamond jack. When this was covered with the queen and ace, South led the heart eight. West should have put up the ace, but played low and permitted South to steal an entry to dummy with the queen. The declarer then led the diamond eight for a finesse, held the trick and continued by finessing the nine. She cashed the diamond king and reached this ending: [ DIAGRAM ] When a spade was led to the ace, West was under pressure. He threw a club and South played that suit to make her slam. If West had thrown the heart ten, South would have led a club, playing the king on East's queen. Then she would have led to the club ten, thrown West in with his lone heart ace, and scored the club jack at the finish.

381-> Peter Sammartino, 87, Is Dead; Was Fairleigh Dickinson Founder
Peter Sammartino, the founder of Fairleigh Dickinson University and an early leader in the restoration of Ellis Island, was found shot to death yesterday with his wife, Sylvia, at their home in Rutherford, N.J., in what the police said was a murder-suicide. He was 87 years old and his wife was 88. The couple had been in failing health. The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said Mrs. Sammartino had Alzheimer's disease and Dr. Sammartino had undergone surgery to remove a kidney. No note was found. But Mr. Fahy said that Dr. Sammartino had been recently getting his affairs in order and had hinted to friends that he might die soon. The university Dr. Sammartino founded in the old Ivison Castle in Rutherford is to celebrate its 50th anniversary later this year. He began with 60 students. The initial decision to start a two-year junior college was made four days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The next morning Dr. Sammartino and a handful of colleagues reconsidered and, by one vote, decided to proceed. Enrollment of 12,000 Today Fairleigh Dickinson is the largest private university in New Jersey. It has an enrollment of 12,000 and campuses in Teaneck-Hackensack, Rutherford and Florham Park-Madison, plus a branch in Wroxton, England. Its programs include liberal arts, business administration, dentistry, engineering and education. Mrs. Sammartino, the former Sylvia (Sally) Scaramelli, served without pay for 14 years as its first director of admissions and retired as dean of admissions. The university's initial financing was $15,000 from Dr. Sammartino, $15,000 from his father-in-law and $30,000 from Col. Fairleigh S. Dickinson, the head of the Becton, Dickinson surgical appliance company, for whom the school was named. The original building cost $21,600. Years later, individual contributions rose into the millions of dollars. An innovative educator, Dr. Sammartino insisted that teachers visit students in their homes, sent the social sciences department to visit Asia and Africa, dispatched students to the Bowery, coal mines and migrant camps, and required some students to buy a share of stock in any company to study its reports. When new buildings were planned, the contractors' bids were opened by students at assemblies, and architects were on stage to answer questions. The students voted their recommendations to the trustees. When money ran out on one project, the students decided to complete the work themselves. Dr. Sammartino and the faculty donned overalls to join them. To impress local business with the college's economic importance, he once paid the staff and faculty in silver dollars, and the merchants quickly took notice. He also a promoted health food, buying chemical-free beef and providing free brewer's yeast and cheap vitamins for students. He was an outspoken critic of water fluoridation. Dr. Sammartino served as president until he retired in 1967, but remained active at the university and in other causes. Active in Civic Affairs He was the president of the New York Cultural Center, in the former Gallery of Modern Art building at Columbus Circle, for five years. The gallery was donated to the university by Huntington Hartford, heir to the A& P fortune. Mr. Sammartino was also on the board of the State Opera Society. He was the founder and chairman of the Restore Ellis Island Committee, but he retired from the effort in 1978. He also founded the International Association of University Professors and served as its president. He was chairman of an eight-town economic development commission and vice president of the New Jersey Constitutional Convention and the National Italian-Americans Foundation. He also participated in the President's Commission on Higher Education, the White House Conference on Education, the Peace Corps advisory board and the National Board of Foreign Scholarships. He worked to improve services for the hearing-impaired, of which he was one. Dr. Sammartino was born in New York City. He graduated from City College in 1924 at New York University earned a master's degree in education in 1928 and a doctorate in 1931. The idea for Fairleigh Dickinson grew out of his work for 10 years at the New College, an experimental school at Columbia University's Teachers College. He wrote more than a dozen books on education. Mrs. Sammartino was born in Boston. She graduated from Smith College and earned a master's degree in history from Columbia. She was chairwoman of the State Commission on Women and president of the Garden State Ballet Foundation. A university spokeswoman said she did not know of any immediate survivors. A maid found the Sammartinos bodies in the bedroom of their home in Rutherford early yesterday afternoon, after she suspected something was amiss and forced open the locked door. The police recovered a .38-caliber revolver. Mrs. Sammartino was shot in the temple and Dr. Sammartino was shot in the mouth, Mr. Fahy said. The last time the couple were seen alive was 4:30 P.M. Saturday, when the maid left the house for the day.

382-> Iacocca Pay Chopped 35% Last Year
Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, took a pay cut of about 35 percent last year, but his compensation hardly was paltry. Mr. Iacocca, 67 years old, who has said he will retire at the end of the year, took home nearly $3 million in salary, stock and other compensation last year, compared with a pay package of $4.5 million in 1990. Chrysler lost $795 million in 1991 as the American automobile industry experienced its worst year in history. Chrysler's 1991 proxy, released today, also yielded information about the pay of Robert J. Eaton, the General Motors executive Chrysler recruited to replace Mr. Iacocca when he steps down. Eaton's $750,000 Salary Mr. Eaton will be paid $750,000 annually. He also received $200,000 to reimburse him for some benefits from the General Motors Corporation he had to give up. And he received an option to buy up to 300,000 Chrysler shares at $16.94 each. Mr. Eaton, the proxy said, bought 25,000 Chrysler shares upon joining the company last month. The compensation of the Big Three auto executives came under fire by Japanese executives during President Bush's trip to Japan in January. Some pay experts have criticized auto industry pay as lavish, particularly when the domestic industry has been laying off workers, closing plants and seeking protection from Japanese competition. Graef Crystal, a compensation expert who teaches at the University of California at Berkeley, said Mr. Iacocca's salary was too high compared with those of his peers at G.M. and the Ford Motor Company. "It's a no-brainer," he said. "Why should the smallest and the least successful of the Big Three give its chief executive the most pay?" Low Shareholders' Return Among the 300 largest corporations in the country, which he tracks regarding pay and stock price performance, Chrysler is in the lowest 5 percent in return to shareholders but among the highest in chief executive compensation. Still, Mr. Crystal said he was not greatly offended by Mr. Iacocca's pay, in light of much larger awards by companies like the Coca-Cola Company, whose chairman, Roberto C. Goizueta, received a million shares last year. The shares were estimated last month to be worth about $81 million. Mr. Iacocca's pay, according to the proxy statement, consisted of a cash salary of $976,378, a 6.3 percent increase from last year's salary, plus $126,464 as part of a long-term incentive plan. In 1990, he received a $2.7 million stock award and $784,125 in dividends. But last year, Mr. Iacocca received a stock bonus of 123,750 Chrysler common shares, worth $1,883,436, including dividends and interest. Options on 130,000 Shares Though his salary was down, Mr. Iacocca also received a large award of stock options in 1991, which could become enormously valuable if Chrysler's stock price rises substantially from its current level of $17.75. Chrysler awarded him options for 130,000 shares at $14.13 each and 45,000 shares at $11.75, which can be exercised at various dates in the future. Mr. Crystal estimated that the latest option award was probably worth about $900,000, based on the historical performance of companies' share prices. Chrysler does not disclose the total number of options Mr. Iacocca owns, but the proxy said he owns about 2.3 million options that can be exercised within the next 60 days at $12.13 to $33.50 each.

383-> Senate Republicans, Soft on Guns
By sabotaging a crime bill agreed to by a joint House-Senate committee, Senate Republicans have left themselves facing the election empty-handed. So what do they propose in place of legislative meat? Scraps: a new bill that resurrects offensive language eliminated by the conferees but omits the most important provision -- a waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun. The conference bill also included worthwhile provisions for more than $3 billion in Federal aid to state and local law enforcement, including correctional "boot camps" and drug treatment in prisons. And it established a Police Corps scholarship program for college students. Senate Republicans felt the bill didn't go far enough to limit the habeas corpus appeals of prisoners and the exclusion of illegally seized evidence. While their new bill accepts the financial aid and the Police Corps, it reverts to highly restrictive language on habeas corpus and the exclusionary rule. And it leaves out the waiting period bill, known as the Brady bill for the Presidential press secretary wounded when former President Reagan was shot. That omission may serve political convenience. Worried about his right wing, President Bush might welcome the stronger language on habeas corpus and excluded evidence while frowning on a Brady bill he once said he'd accept. But the omission does nothing to make streets safer. The disputes over habeas corpus and evidence concern treatment of criminals already caught. The Brady bill would make a direct contribution to crime control. That's because the bill, by requiring a waiting period, would slow the brisk traffic in guns from cities with lax restrictions on gun purchases to cities with tough restrictions. The bill is supported by huge majorities of gun owners and the public. The Senate Republicans' easy abandonment of it shows their willingness to put politics before public safety.

384-> Diner's Journal
Grappino In the garment district of midtown Manhattan, just south of 42d Street, good lunch spots are harder to find than Nehru jackets. So when an attractive Italian restaurant on West 39th Street was recommended recently, I scooted down for lunch. The four-year-old Grappino has a clean, generic northern-Italian-restaurant look, with pale yellow walls that appear pinkish under colored ceiling lights, long banquettes and tightly packed tables. At a recent lunch, the dining room was crowded and so noisy that waiters had to bend over to communicate with diners. A starter of grilled shrimp, fennel and tomato sprinkled with balsamic vinegar was fresh and tasty ($8). So was a grilled vegetable plate holding tiny sweet carrots, zucchini, eggplant, cauliflower, mushrooms and goat cheese ($6.50). Entrees include pastas, grilled chicken, seafood and steak. The penne with radicchio, broccoli, mild sausage, roasted peppers and olive oil ($15) was well balanced and skillfully cooked. Grilled swordfish was pleasing, too, with a garnish of orange sections, pine nuts, fennel and basil ($18). Other entrees include grilled breast of chicken with arugula, tomato and pesto mayonnaise ($8); cavitelli with eggplant, hot peppers and tomato ($8), and sirloin steak with tomato, black olives and Tuscan-style bread ($15). Recommended for dessert are the moist, minimally sweet mascarpone cheesecake ($5) and an apple crostade, a strudel-like apple tart ($6). Grappino, at 38 West 39th Street, is open Monday through Friday, serving lunch from noon to 3 P.M. and dinner from 5 to 9 P.M. American Express is accepted. Telephone: (212) 398-0350. The Changing Scene CLOSED: Auntie Yuan, the elegant Chinese restaurant at 1191A First Avenue, near 64th Street, Manhattan. David Keh, the owner, said a drop in business forced the closing of the restaurant, which he had turned over to a managing partner seven months ago. "These are not the times to have a restaurant like Auntie Yuan," he said. At the same time, Mr. Keh said he has secured the lease to the former Fortune Garden Pavilion at 209 East 49th Street, Manhattan, where he plans to open a Chinese noodle restaurant in mid-March. OPEN: May We, a Mediterranean-style restaurant at 1022 Lexington Avenue, at 73d Street, (212) 249-0200. . . . C III, a casual American restaurant in the Washington Square Hotel, 103 Waverly Place, Manhattan, (212) 254-1200. The chef is Daniel Kobin, formerly of Dano in Greenwich Village. . . .

385-> N.I.T.; MacLeod Back at Garden For the Other Final Four
John MacLeod is back home in Indiana, where as a boy he was taught by nuns and cheered for Notre Dame. But there is also a New York side -- albeit brief -- and MacLeod is juggling the two worlds these days as coach of the Fighting Irish team that plays in tonight's National Invitation Tournament semifinals at Madison Square Garden. "I enjoyed New York," the former Knicks coach said yesterday. "It didn't turn out the way I wanted, but if we didn't have those injuries. . . ." MacLeod, still a snappy dresser, met the other three coaches for lunch yesterday: Rick Majerus, the wise-cracking after-dinner speaker whose Utah team meets Notre Dame at 9 P.M.; Jeff Jones, the coach of a Virginia team that has players named Havlicek and Stith and that faces a Florida squad composed of out-of-staters and coached by Lon Kruger, at 7 P.M. The championship game will be played Wednesday night. Midnight Pizzas Majerus, wearing a bulky white sweatshirt with a bold red "Utah" across the front, enjoyed playing the bumpkin. He said his players "aren't used to being able to get a pizza at 12 o'clock at night." "In Salt Lake City, everything's closed by then," he said. MacLeod's starched collar hardly fluttered as he regarded Majerus. But MacLeod also seems to be a man glad to be where he is: coaching in college. He joined the Knicks 15 games into the 1990-91 season and guided them to the playoffs, although they were under .500 (32-35) during his tenure. It was to be the last of his 18 pro coaching seasons. At one point, the Knicks won 12 of 14 games. Then injuries struck. At season's end, Paramount, which owns the Garden, Knicks and Rangers, already had dismissed the general manager who had hired him, Al Bianchi. MacLeod was next. MacLeod was ready to return to college coaching for the first time since 1973. 'Wanted Some Stability' "I could have stayed in pro ball," the 54-year-old MacLeod said yesterday. "But I said if a good opportunity came up in college, I would take it. I have two teen-agers. I wanted some stability. I'm from Indiana." That added up to Notre Dame, where he has produced one of the finest first-year records in the school's history (16-14), despite playing what Majerus calls "the toughest schedule in the country." Daimon Sweet, one of Notre Dame's three star-quality performers (along with LaPhonso Ellis and Elmer Bennett), credits MacLeod with recognizing his ability from 3-point range. Sweet, a senior, had played under former coach Digger Phelps. "He had no confidence in me," said Sweet. "He told me he never wanted me to shoot from there. He said I'd never make it." So Sweet never took a 3-pointer until this season. Last Wednesday he poured in a school-record six as the Fighting Irish toppled Manhattan to make the trip to New York. "I watch the Knicks closely," said MacLeod. "They're, what, 20 games over .500? Dave Checketts has done a good job as G.M. They'll do well in the playoffs." MacLeod remembered that not that long ago his Knicks season ended after a playoff loss. "Last April or May I began the discussions with Notre Dame, and here it is, not even a year later, a full season already has taken place. To be able to come back here and finish the season in New York is a plus."

386-> Mao's Cable Explains Drive Into Korea
The publication of a secret cable from Mao to Stalin in 1950 has provided the first documentary evidence of the Chinese leader's intentions in making the risky decision to enter the Korean War and engage American forces in combat. Answering questions that have haunted scholars for decades, the telegram and other documents that have recently been smuggled to the West lend support to the theory that Mao acted out of fear that an American victory in Korea would threaten China. The documents have also convinced historians that Stalin agreed to, and then abruptly canceled, a Chinese request for Soviet air cover during the attack. "If we allow the United States to occupy all of Korea," Mao wrote in the Oct. 2, 1950, cable, "Korean revolutionary power will suffer a fundamental defeat and the Americans will run more rampant and have negative effects for the entire Far East." Threat of U.S. Bombing The cable explicitly recognized that the United States might bomb Chinese cities in retaliation for its entry into the war, but asserted that the destruction of the American forces in Korea was a goal worth the risks. Two weeks after that summary of Chinese strategic thinking was sent to Stalin, Chinese soldiers invaded North Korea, where they surprised the American troops who were spearheading the United Nations military effort to protect the South Korean Government of Syngman Rhee. The cable is among hundreds of documents that were published in Beijing in 1987 and 1990 as a collection of Mao's 1949-1951 papers. Although they were intended only for the eyes of senior Chinese officials and historians, several copies have been smuggled out of China and obtained by scholars in the United States. Stalin's Air Cover The documents also offer a glimpse at diplomacy between the Communist giants. Scholars now assert that after Stalin reneged on air cover and army supplies for the Chinese invasion, originally set for Oct. 15, Mao froze preparations and reassessed China's position, but decided with his Politburo by Oct. 13 to go ahead with the advance anyway. It began on Oct. 19. The invasion, by 260,000 Chinese troops, horrified American commanders in Korea and forced them into the greatest retreat in United States military history. The deadlock that followed, after three years of bitter and inconclusive fighting, left the Korean Peninsula divided, as it has remained ever since. At the time the telegram was sent, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the commander of United Nations forces in Korea, openly doubted China's willingness to enter Korea with an army that was fatigued from years of its own civil war. The Americans also ignored warning signals sent by Beijing as United Nations troops advanced north of the 38th parallel, which had separated the territories under Soviet and American control since the Japanese withdrew from the country in 1945. Because the Chinese troops moved undetected at first, and then orchestrated successive feints, the size of their military presence was not fully grasped by MacArthur until late November, when the Chinese began unleashing huge nighttime assaults -- sometimes called "human wave" attacks -- on the Americans. 'Inside Information' At the time, some policymakers in Washington believed that the Chinese troops had been sent on orders from the Soviet Union, and that Moscow controlled a monolithic Communist bloc. Although historians have since learned of the complex antagonism between Mao and Stalin, no documentary evidence has before been seen about what led Mao and his colleagues to their fateful decision. "Now we really have inside information about decision-making," said Allen S. Whiting, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona who wrote "China Crosses the Yalu," a 1960 book about China's entry into the war. "These papers have been very illuminating." Mr. Whiting, whose theory that Chinese leaders entered the war out of a feeling of defensive necessity has been borne out in the documents, said he was surprised by the extent to which Mao worried about anti-Government forces within China at the time of the war. Mao at first hesitated to enter the war, Mr. Whiting said, partly because of what he perceived as a threat of lingering opposition to the Communist Government set up only a year earlier, in October 1949. But by late September 1950, Mr. Whiting said, Mao became convinced that a significant American presence in Korea might lead to an American-backed offensive by the Communists' enemy, the Nationalists, who had been expelled from the mainland but still posed a threat from Taiwan. Altered Chinese Papers Scholars who have studied the documents warned that they should be viewed with the knowledge that in the past, Chinese papers have often been altered to paint political leaders in a favorable or unfavorable light. Although the complexity and internal consistency of those documents point to their authenticity, there are other limitations. "The problem is that they are fragmentary," said Michael Hunt, professor of political science at the University of North Carolina, who is also writing about the documents. "This is a cable in a series of exchanges between Mao and Stalin. We don't know what's been said so far." In the Oct. 2 telegram, Mao refers to much-needed assistance from Moscow. Stalin apparently agreed in the following days to provide air cover, but then reversed himself on Oct. 10. Prime Minister Zhou Enlai went on a secret trip to Moscow to try to persuade Stalin to support the Chinese attack, but was unsuccessful. In a cable to Zhou on Oct. 13, Mao wrote that China's Politburo had backed the decision to go to war anyway. Moving with stealth once they crossed the Yalu River border into Korea on Oct. 19, Chinese troops were not discovered by American intelligence until they clashed briefly with United Nations soldiers on Oct. 25. By drawing back, Chinese commanders created the illusion that they were retreating to China and deliberately drew the Americans northward before China launched a full attack in the final week of November. About 53,000 American soldiers were killed in the war. The documents do not reveal a total of Chinese deaths in the war, believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. The documents also fail to reveal whether Chinese leaders were part of any direct planning for the June 25, 1950, attack by Kim Il Sung that began the war. It is likely, scholars say, that Mao knew of Kim's intentions but not of his timing.

387-> HOCKEY; N.H.L. Board Refuses to Vote on Proposal
The National Hockey League team owners refused to vote on a new proposal by the players yesterday and said they would offer a proposal of their own today in an effort to end the players' strike. Bob Goodenow, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, said yesterday's developments were "in one sense a disappointment" because he had hoped for a solution to the strike, which began last Wednesday and threatens the Stanley Cup playoffs. "There are six or seven issues that haven't been tied down," Goodenow said in a news conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. "The owners had the opportunity to end this strike today and they chose to come up with a new proposal. We really feel we're at the end of the line as far as what we are able to do." Two of the major issues remaining to be settled are distribution of revenue from trading cards and length of a new collective bargaining agreement. In addition, both sides indicated that a free-agency formula that was thought to have been decided was a renewed subject of debate. 'Crucial Issue Not Playoffs' John Ziegler, president of the N.H.L., speaking after a meeting of the league's board of governors, said that the players' proposal "wasn't high-octane gas" and added that "the crucial issue is not the playoffs. "What really is before us is will this business survive as we have known it?" Ziegler said in a news conference at the Plaza Hotel. "The restructuring must take place immediately. One of the problems we've had in dealing with the association is a refusal to face the economics." The owners say they will lose $9 million this season after making $125 million in the previous three seasons. The union says the owners will make $24 million. The players say the trading-card issue is crucial. According to figures released by the league yesterday, the players will get between $11 million and $12 million this year and the owners will get $8 million as their share. Although the money has never before been the subject of collective bargaining, the owners say it now must be. Proposal for 3-Year Deal On Sunday night, the players said they had answered a major owner demand by offering to accept a three-year contract, including the current season, with the possibility of a re-opener after one more season if certain, unspecified economic conditions existed. Ziegler said yesterday that the re-opener clause was "really kind of fictitious." When the strike began, Ziegler resumed discussions with Goodenow. Missing from those talks was William Wirtz, the owner of the Chicago Blackhawks who is the chairman of the board of governors and the co-chairman, along with Ziegler, of the negotiating committee. Wirtz was in the Bahamas, where he spoke by telephone to criticize Goodenow, charging that Goodenow miscalculated in leading the players into a strike. Ziegler said the issue of Wirtz's absence was "a bogeyman" and that he talks by phone with Wirtz once or twice a day. Gretzky Joins Discussions Meanwhile, Goodenow brought to New York his nine-player negotiating committee and the representatives of all 22 teams. Goodenow said the group would meet last night at a Manhattan hotel. Also joining the discussions was Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings, who is not a negotiator or a player representative, but is one of the most talented and respected performers in the sport. Mike Gartner, the player representative of the Rangers, asked if he thinks the owners sincerely want to end the strike, replied: "I think there are definitely some owners concerned to get this done and getting on with the playoffs. I hope they are in a majority." When the negotiations began, many players said the primary goal was increased free-agent mobility. Since then, the players have given in on most demands. Owners have sought greater control by trying to add to the contract the right to match contract offers given to free-agent players like Brendan Shanahan, who moved last year from the Devils to St. Louis. Under the new formula, the former team could keep such a player by matching his new salary offer. Savard 'Very Confident' "The players feel we have gone far enough, in most respects, probably too far," Gartner said. If there is no solution today, Gartner said, "I don't see what can be accomplished." Asked how long the strike could go on, Gartner said, "We look at it as a worst-case scenario, possibly not playing until next fall, if then." A more optimistic note was sounded by Serge Savard, general manager of the Montreal Canadiens. "I think the playoffs will go on, I'm very confident," Savard said. "But my confidence level could change." Ziegler said there was a "clear and present danger of their being no completion to the 75th-anniversary season."

388-> DINING OUT; In East Haven, Just Plain Barbecue
SINCE Spanish explorers found native Americans cooking meat on racks over open-air pits and named the technique barbacoa, what was practicality has developed into an art form. To fans of grilled food there are rituals to be observed in the making of the perfect barbecue. What kind of fire is used? Which wood is best, hickory, oak, mesquite? How long should the meat be slow-cooked? Is true barbecue the Southern version with pork, or is it Texan with beef? Which sauce is essential to barbecued meat, a Texas-style, tomato-based sauce or the North Carolina-favored vinegar-based sauce? There are even splinter groups in the barbecue cult, worshipers of the Memphis persuasion, the Kansas City sect, the Coloradan faction. Then there is the "I don't care how it's done, as long as it's tasty" group, those of us so non-doctrinaire that we approach each new barbecue experience with an open palate. New to Connecticut is Kansas City Bar-B-Q Heaven, on Route 80 in East Haven. The locale is a free-standing building, with a stylized barn door on one side, a United States flag painted on another. Inside, a small room, clean and neat as a farmhouse, suggests the usual fast-food place with a few tables (seating 28 in all), a few stools in front of a counter along one wall and the order counter. A rural down-home atmosphere is created by a galvanized steel chicken coop (with wood shavings) on one wall, homey signs, a pig cut-out, small-scale wagon wheel overhead lights and country and Western music tapes. To the hard-core barbecue cultist, Kansas City Bar-B-Q Heaven may seem too clean, since part of the barbecue mystique is finding a funky place (the grungier it looks the better) by the side of a dusty, country road. At Kansas City Bar-B-Q Heaven, a modest little place, the meat is slow-cooked from 4 to 12 hours over an aromatic, smoky hickory fire in a rotary pit. The proof is the result. In one instance, the falling-off-the-bone nature of the moist slices of beef brisket was matched by a seductively smoky flavor and incredible tenderness, the culmination of the leisurely cooking process. Beef is justifiably the house specialty. It made a delicious sandwich on a large, puffy Portuguese-style roll. It is also possible to order it as a platter, along with some rather indifferent cole slaw and a choice of french fries (freshly made, crisp and meaty) or pork beans (smoky, zesty, richly flavored -- a far better choice). The platter is actually a cardboard plateful of meat, with the extras served separately in plastic cups, along with plastic utensils. It's not exactly Southern funky, more like New England shore dinner plain. The menu is limited, but our expert on the subject said, that is what barbecue fans prefer. ("You don't need many choices with barbecue.") We tried the half chicken ($6.40), which was moist, smoky and crisp skinned. (A quarter-chicken is also available for $4.70.) There are three pork items on the menu: baby back ribs and St. Louis-style spareribs (a larger cut, with more fat), both available by the rack or half-rack, and chopped pork shoulder sandwich (succulently smoky and sweet tasting). Half a rack of baby back ribs (seven small ones at $7.50) was all meat, no fat, tender and flavorful. The larger St. Louis spareribs ($8.50 a half-rack) were abundantly meaty, too, but more succulent. The tomato-based Texas-style barbecue sauce was acceptable, but the incendiary hot sauce had more character. As you might expect, prices are moderate for adequate portions. For $13.30 (before tax or tip) two of us had a satisfying lunch of a sliced beef brisket sandwich, half a rack of baby back ribs and two cups of coffee. Beverages are limited to coffee, iced tea and soft drinks. There are no appetizers, a few daily specials, like barbecued lamb, and minimal desserts, like a walnut-studded brownie and five kinds of ordinary, commercial cheesecake. Expect just good barbecue -- short, simple, neat and sweet. Kansas City Bar-B-Q Heaven Good 913 Foxon Road (corner of Rose Street), Route 80, East Haven. 466-2222.

389-> Clinton's Private Life Serves as Distraction
To the Editor: The surge in interest in the personal life of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is campaigning for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination, shows a disturbing trend in American politics. All too often, the American public seems to identify a politician's competence or suitability for elected office with his or her personal life. This unfortunate penchant for sensationalism, which much of the news media feed on, denigrates the political process and eclipses the pressing issues. There is little evidence in history to support the view that with moral piety comes political effectiveness. Winston Churchill, one of the great statesmen of the 20th century, was certainly no icon of piety. His taste for liquor was well known. John F. Kennedy's personal exploits did not prevent his rise to the highest elected office and place in history. Regardless of the validity of the accusations leveled against Governor Clinton, I believe that this American preoccupation with personal "affairs" tends to obscure the real problems of our time. Perhaps, if our society focused less on sensationalism and the private lives of candidates, and more on the economy, health care, drugs, the homeless, AIDS (the list goes on and on), we might be able to elect a President who can lead and help America in the challenging and frightening times ahead.

390-> French Angered at Ruling on Nazi Collaborator
French politicians, newspapers, human rights groups and a chorus of other voicesexpressed outrage today over a Paris court's decision to drop charges of crimes against humanity against a Frenchman accused of killing Jews in Nazi-occupied France in World War II. The decision on Monday, which is to be challenged before the Supreme Court of Appeal, was denounced by a broad spectrum of political leaders, many of whom saw it as new evidence of the French judiciary's reluctance to condemn French citizens for war crimes against Jews even though it has been willing to condemn Germans for similar crimes. The lower appeals court ruled that there was no case to support charges against Paul Touvier, a 77-year-old former pro-Nazi militia leader, on the ground that his execution of seven Jewish hostages in June 1944 did not constitute a crime against humanity. But the angry reaction to the ruling also suggested that almost 48 years after the liberation of France, French society is now readier than before to confront the reality of extensive French collaboration with Nazi Germany's campaign to kill Jews. The French Parliament suspended its session this afternoon to permit members to attend a memorial service for Mr. Touvier's victims organized by the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions at the Monument to Deportation on the Ile de la Cite. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy was described by a spokesman as "upset" by the court's decision. Laurent Fabius, leader of the governing Socialist Party, described Mr. Touvier as "filth who committed abominable, horrific crimes." Politicians of other parties demanded the ruling be reversed. In Turkey, President Francois Mitterrand said, "This has surprised me too and that's an understatement. The court stirred further indignation by clearing the collaborationist Vichy Government of any crimes against humanity because it had no policy of "ideological hegemony." It was never a secret that some 76,000 Jews, including 11,000 children, were deported to Nazi death camps from France. Of these, only 2,500 survived. But it was only in the 1980's that public opinion became aware that French police and others also killed Jews and organized deportations. Since then, led by Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer who brought Klaus Barbie, the Lyons Gestapo chief, to trial in 1987, the campaign against French war criminals has focused on Mr. Touvier and two wartime police officials, Maurice Papon and Rene Bousquet. Mr. Touvier was arrested in 1989 at a French monastery where he had been hiding since the war. He was charged with crimes against humanity, a charge not covered by a pardon he received in 1971. He was released from jail last year on grounds of ill health. Mr. Papon, a wartime police official in Bordeaux, enjoyed a postwar political career, serving as Paris police chief in the 1960's and Budget Minister in the 1970's. In 1982 he was charged with crimes against humanity for ordering the deportation of 1,690 Jews. Mr. Bousquet, secretary general of police in Vichy, spent some time in jail after the war, but he then propsered as a banker. In 1989 he was accused of rounding up Jews for deportation. Today, a court in Bordeaux said it would open an investigation for crimes against humanity against Mr. Papon and Mr. Bousquet.

391-> GARDEN BOOKSHELF; New Crop Of Books For Sundry Obsessions
WITH the outdoor garden now quiet, there's time to fill the indoor bookshelf. And there are more than enough new volumes to feed nearly every horticultural obsession. Consider the passion for perennials. Then consider THE RANDOM HOUSE BOOK OF PERENNIALS (Random House; paper, $25 each). This two-volume set, with 5,000 color photographs, is part of a series by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix, two Englishmen determined to show more species than any gardener can hope to encounter in a lifetime. But what a way to dream, with close-ups of Euphorbia oblongifolia in thecentral Caucasus, and Veronia noveboracensis in New Jersey. The latter, of course, is one of several plants from this side of the Atlantic that shows the authors' interest in what they call the "particular problems" of Americans: climate, soil and the like. But with only Latin names used throughout, maybe in the next go-round these zealous authors will include an index of common names for Americans whose particular problem is not knowing that Veronia noveboracensis is also called New York ironweed. So you're mad for flowers. Well, you may be a little less sure after reading Judy Glattstein's persuasive prose in GARDEN DESIGN WITH FOLIAGE (Garden Way Publishing; cloth, $29.95; paper, $17.95). This carefully organized book, with its sprinkling of clear illustrations and concise, informative charts, should change the way you think about leaves. The author's knowledgeable observations and encouraging tone makes it possible to plan clever contrasts of foliage shapes, sizes and tones, without relying on flowers. Whether used purely as a utilitarian plant support or elegant pieces of architecture, the subject of TRELLIS by Jamie Garnock (Rizzoli, $40) boasts a 4,000-year track record of service to gardeners. The 190 illustrations, both photographs and diagrams, are a broad introduction to the versatile wood structures once known as "carpenter's work." Seemingly every notable fashion is here, from 17th-century trompe l'oeil treillage to 20th-century minimalism. What's missing are the nitty-gritty construction technicalities of how to fabricate each fanciful piece of architecture. The plants most likely to be turned into fanciful pieces of architecture are explored in THE HEDGE BOOK by Jeffrey Whitehead (Storey Communications; cloth, $21.95; paper, $12.95). This is a handy little volume with a concise presentation of the choices and uses of species for living walls. These are the plants with potential to obscure an offensive view, keep creatures out or in, impose a formal structure or define a garden space. Those whose harvests of ciders, jams and fruit wines are woefully inadequate may correct that condition with THE HARROWSMITH BOOK OF FRUIT TREES (Camden House Publishing; paper, $22.95) by Jennifer Bennett. Here is a clear presentation of the basics of planning, selecting and planting in Northern climes. Countless cultivars are neatly delineated for gentlemen (and gentlewomen) farmers who are contemplating their first collection of apricot, peach, nectarine or apple trees. For more than 20 years, Peter Loewer has observed, written about and sketched the woodsy world he shares with nature's sundry creatures. The results are found in THE WILD GARDENER (Stackpole Books, $19.95), a compilation of 50 essays that weave an idiosyncratic mix of history, medicinal lore and literature with pure dirt horticulture. Under scrutiny are such wild things as skunk cabbage (he takes issue with Thoreau's suggestion of using its leaves for drinking cups) and bumblebees (whose residences in mouse holes evoke images of Beatrix Potter). The black and white illustrations are the author's own. When you've finished, take a minute to peer into BAER'S 1992 AGRICULTURAL ALMANAC (John Baer's Sons; paper, $2; 717-392-0733). This digest-size book is a must for those who sow according to the moon and stars, with lively garden yarns to entertain those who don't.

392-> F.B.I. to Shift From Cold War to Crime War
In a personnel shake-up that reflects the end of the cold war, the Federal Bureau of Investigation plans to reassign several hundred agents from internal security investigations to combat serious crime and gang violence, officials in the Bush Administration said today. Although the move is expected to involved fewer than 300 agents in a force of about 10,000, the shift is symbolically dramatic, representing a downgrading of counter-espionage efforts in favor of a more intensive attack on violent crime, particularly gang violence. "Call it a peace dividend," one official said. The reassignment comes as a result of the breakup of the Eastern bloc and the diminished threat of spying against the United States by the former Warsaw Pact nations, who in the past had vigorously collected intelligence in the United States. Those changes have left the bureau's foreign counterintelligence section, which is responsible for investigating threats to national security by foreign agents operating in the United States, without a clearly defined purpose and facing the possibility of budget cuts. The move also represents an effort by the Federal Government to marshal greater resources against serious street crime, areas in which state and local officials have historically played a greater role than have the Federal law-enforcement authorities. Greater Federal Role Planned Attorney General William P. Barr said at his confirmation hearings last fall that he planned to make the effort to curb violent crime a top priority for the Justice Department. Since then, officials have been working on several proposals to increase the Federal role. The scaling down of counterintelligence operations represents a major change for the F.B.I. In the past, internal security has ranked as one of the bureau's top priorities.In cities with a large foreign diplomatic presence, like Washington and New York, hundreds of agents have been assigned to surveillance and investigative work. William S. Sessions, the Director of the F.B.I., has insisted in recent months that the demand for a strong counterintelligence presence remained high, despite the dismantling of the Soviet Union and toppling of Communist governments in Eastern Europe. Some bureau officials justified the continued staffing levels by asserting that the newly emerging independent states had merely shifted their resources from military espionage to industrial spying in an effort to help their limping economies. But the impending move appears to represent a changed environment in which domestic law-enforcement concerns now override the threat of overseas spying. The expected changes will require scores of agents to move from their current jobs to cities like Chicagoo and Los Angeles, where gang-related violence has reached epidemic levels. Several dozen cities are expected to receive an infusion of new agents, but the precise locations remained unclear today. Operation Triggerlock The Government has already taken several actions to step up its activites against violent crime. Last year the Justice Department initiated Operation Triggerlock, setting up task forces in several cities to enforce Federal laws that make it illegal for habitual felons to own weapons. Last fall, in a speech in San Francisco, Mr. Barr outlined several proposals to attack Asian-American gangs that appear to dovetail with the reassignment of counterintelligence experts for a broader attack on gang violence. Those proposals included the wider use of electronnic surveillance and long-term undercover operations against Asian criminal enterprises and a proposal to enact new laws enabling the authorities to shut down Asian crime groups as criminal enterprises. In fighting gang violence, the F.B.I. has already sought to apply techniques developed in investigations of organized crime, including infiltration and the use of informers to file broad racketeering charges intended to dismantle the gang's leadership.

393-> GOVERNMENT THAT MEANS BUSINESS
David Osborne's proposal to create an "entrepreneurial" government may harm the people most in need of government aid -- those who lack the education and skills required to succeed in the marketplace ("Goverment That Means Business," March 1). Though calls to "empower" individuals and "reward" success have visceral appeal, experience shows that these principles can hurt the poor as much as help them. For example, the principle of "results-oriented government," introduced to federal job-training programs in the early 80's, caused programs to exclude the least skilled in favor of those better able to meet job-placement goals. This predictable response to "a reward" for success denies job training to those who need it most. No one can dispute the benefits of greater flexibility, adaptability and innovation in government. However, poverty's legacy -- splintered communities and weakened families -- requires a considered, long-term strategy that may be incompatible with an entrepreneurial approach.

397-> James Joyce Papers Go on Public Display For the First Time
The National Library of Ireland, where James Joyce did research as a young writer, has made public some 3,000 of his letters, notes and household bills. The collection, which may be the last major trove of Joyce material, had remained locked up in the library for 51 years at the request of the man who collected them, Paul Leon, Joyce's secretary in Paris for 10 years. Leon had gathered the papers from his own files and from the Joyce apartment after the Germans occupied Paris in 1940. Within months, Leon, who was Jewish, was arrested, and later fatally shot by a guard at Auschwitz. His son, Alexis, spoke at ceremonies at the library on Sunday. So did Joyce's grandson, Stephen, who continued his campaign against the use of Joyce's personal material by scholars. His efforts were apparently successful in that the library has decided to withhold some of the items from the public until the year 2050. Stephen Joyce's words caused one prominent Joyce scholar, Senator David Norris, to stalk angrily out of a reception at the library. Among the items, a few hundred of which are on display at the library, are gas bills, an angry note from Joyce about what kind of quotation marks should be used in the French edition of "Finnegans Wake," and notes that may help scholars in their continuing interpretation of what they consider a cryptic work largely impenetrable to the public. "It will be of assistance to scholars as to what Joyce wanted to emphasize in 'Finnegans Wake,' " said Senator Norris, who lectures at Trinity College and has written many articles and edited books on Joyce. "It is probably the last major deposit of Joycean material," he said. One of the items, he said, was a letter by Sean O'Casey, which greatly amused Joyce, complaining that an Irish newspaper had attributed authorship of "Finnegans Wake" to him. Dublin, which Joyce abandoned early in his career and to which he rarely returned, celebrated the public exhibition of the papers as a major literary and cultural event: a serious matter unlike the events of the annual Bloom's Day, which tend to turn the city into a "Ulysses" theme park as tourists try to relive the day -- June 16, 1904 -- on which the novel's events transpire. Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, a former businessman who has no pretensions of being a Joyce adept, said, "One cannot contemplate the treasures being unveiled today without being reminded of a tragic chapter in European history." The allusion was to Leon's fate and to the failure of the Irish Government, which was neutral in World War II, to intercede with the German Government on his behalf. When the Germans took Paris in June 1940, Joyce and his family had moved to Zurich. Leon was still in Paris, against the advice of friends, including Samuel Beckett, and collected the papers he had accumulated in 10 years as Joyce's secretary and friend. In the fall of 1940, he gave the papers to the Irish envoy in Paris, instructing him to send them to the National Library in Dublin and not to allow their viewing until 50 years after Joyce's death. Joyce died unexpectedly in Zurich on Jan. 13, 1941. In the fall of that year, Leon was arrested and shipped to Auschwitz. Documents recently released by the Government here indicate that while Irish diplomats in France and Germany alerted Dublin to Leon's plight, nothing was done for him, probably because Ireland did not want to damage its relations with Germany. Senator Norris noted that Stephen Joyce's remarks at the ceremony on Sunday were described by The Irish Times as "aggressively delivered as he denounced the National Library, the Joyce industry, scholars, journalists and anyone who was interested in reading private correspondence not their own." He called the speech a plea for censorship. And there was a great irony in these remarks, said Senator Norris, that would have amused Stephen Joyce's grandfather. In the "Scylla and Charybdis" section of "Ulysses," he noted, Joyce, represented by the character Stephen Dedalus, argues for intellectual freedom in a study of "Hamlet" that analyzes Shakespeare's sex life. "And the site of that debate in 'Ulysses,' " Senator Norris said, "was the National Library of Ireland."

398-> Mirror Group Pension Pact
Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. has agreed to use its earnings to replenish its pension funds, which are said to have been depleted by the late media executive Robert Maxwell, lawyers acting for pensioners said today. The agreement will mean that about 6,000 pensioners -- 3,200 current employees and 2,800 former employees with deferred pensions -- will receive full pensions, said Ann Scurfield of the law firm Berwin Leighton. Mirror Group, publisher of The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror, declined to give figures on how much it expected to pay to bolster the pension fund or over what period it would contribute. Mr. Maxwell skimmed $:526 million, or about $930 million, from pension funds and companies under his control in the weeks before he died, Mirror Group has said. It also contended that Mr. Maxwell had lied about vast sums of money that disappeared from the company's accounts. Mr. Maxwell was 68 years old when he went overboard from his luxury yacht, Lady Ghislaine, off the Canary Islands in November. His body was later found at sea. The commercial director of Mirror Group, Bernard Tominey, said the details of the plan to replenish the funds should be made final within the next few weeks.

401-> Factory Dinosaurs Imperil Poland's Economic Gain
Plunked by government fiat on Defenders of Stalingrad Street, the W.S.K. company endured the cold war as a reluctant Polish cog in the Soviet military machine, grinding out spare parts and helicopter engines. The street name -- choosing it was roughly akin to calling an American street Hanoi Avenue -- was changed by city officials shortly after Polish Communism collapsed in 1989. Just a year later, the Soviet Union failed to make good on on a $30 million debt to the factory, and soon after disappeared from the map altogether. W.S.K. remains. The largest employer in this city 180 miles southeast of Warsaw, it is a worst-case instance of how the industrial legacies of the Communist system threaten to drag down economic reform plans in Poland and other Eastern European nations. The factory, part of an interlocking group of aviation concerns that employ 70,000 people across Poland, stands on the verge of bankruptcy. Management and the Solidarity union demand a bailout to save their company and help this city of 153,000, which depends on W.S.K. for everything from heat -- one of its byproducts, steam, keeps a sizable part of the city warm -- to tax revenue. They want the Government to forgive overdue taxes and place big new airplane orders for the Polish Army. "We're asking the Government to find a place for us in the economy," said Bronislaw Jarecki, member of the Solidarity leadership at W.S.K., whose initials stand for Transportation Equipment Manufacturer in Polish. "The Government has to make a decision whether or not it needs an aircraft industry or whether it has to be restructured or whether one-half should produce aviation and the rest something else. "You cannot close this down. It's too big. Something has to remain here." The company, and dozens others like it, represent a test of strength for the shaky coalition Government of Jan Olszewski, the Prime Minister, who has called Poland's budget "catastrophic." Pleas are pouring in from every corner of the heavy industry-empire built by the Communists. At the Nowa Huta steel mill in Cracow, the country's biggest state-run concern, they are pressing for a Government-guaranteed loan to rebuild foundries. The previous Government had a radical plan to close a substantial portion of the company and throw 15,000 people out of work; it was greeted by a workers' hunger strike. Private Businesses Double The opening moves in Poland's reform, market prices and free trade began on Jan. 1, 1990, and brought cities like Warsaw or Cracow alive with commerce. Last year, the number of private businesses doubled. Yet the national economy is in a recession, with unemployment above 11 percent. Only a handful of Poland's more than 8,000 state-run enterprises have been turned over to the private sector, and restructuring Communism's industrial dinousaurs is proving even harder than expected. More than 60 percent of Polish workers are still employed by the Government, either as bureaucrats or at the state companies. Polish officials acknowledge that bailing out the state companies, particularly those that depended on the arms business or now-collapsed Soviet market, would mean hyperinflation and a crippling blow to the fledlging private sector. Jerzy Eysmontt, new leader of the Government's economic team, insisted that Poland would not go on a money-printing spree to underwrite the aid. That would place in jeopardy the seal of approval from the International Monetary Fund that Warsaw needs to continue reducing its $45 billion foreign debt and gain foreign assistance to finance its large deficit. Prime Minister Olszewski, who plans to unveil his economic blueprint by mid-February, faces a brutal dilemma. If he helps the Rzeszow plant or similar claimants, all will clamor for a piece of the pie. Flat rejections risk a wave of social unrest from the workers at the large state-run industries who were the prime supporters of the Solidarity movement. Aides to Mr. Olszewski said the decision has already been made to protect the several dozen towns in which one factory is the only employer for tens of thousands of people. The hundreds of cities like Rzeszow, where bankruptcy of a leading company would be very painful but not fatal, pose a more difficult problem. No government has yet dared tell the Communist-era factories the cold truth: that many of them are virtually worthless and must be scrapped or drastically overhauled. "It's too late," said Zdzislaw Najder, newly named senior adviser to Mr. Olszewski. "Two years ago, I said we should be preparing policy that recognizes: those who made this victory over Communism possible, the workers in big state enterprises, will be worse hit. Instead, nothing was done." Mr. Najder said the new Government must forge a social compact with Polish society and the trade unions. "We have to agree on a set of minimal obligations in social security, health, education," he said. "Then we will have to start with the admission that we cannot do even that." Out in Rzeszow (pronounced zheh-SHOOF), where the Solidarity union is holding an occupation strike in a management building, they are convinced Mr. Olszewski will prove sympathetic. At first glance, the plant looks like Poland, circa 1980. The Solidarity banner is draped across the W.S.K. factory gates. Upstairs, a crowd of workers clusters in a room filled with long tables. A crucifix gazes down at the scene from a perch next to the Polish flag. There are differences. Back then, the fear was that the Soviets might come. Now, the worry is that the former Soviet republics might not return with their business. Then, the workers wanted a voice in running the factory. Now, they have the power to fire managers, and design their protests to avoid slowing production. Job Rolls Cut Sharply Since 1989, W.S.K. has trimmed its job rolls from 14,000 to 8,500, with layoffs of 1,500 more scheduled for this spring. In 1990, it paid $6.4 million in taxes to the central Government. Last year, the Government levied $3.3 million in taxes, but collected none. The company has some exports to foreign countries, and hopes for more. A study by Polish consultants concluded that the aviation sector could survive, if it were cut from 70,000 to 30,000 jobs and switched from military production to crop dusters, jet trainers and smaller aircraft for developing nations. Joint ventures with major Western aircraft makers were possible, the report concluded. Mieczyslaw Janowski, the Mayor of Rzeszow and a former aviation engineer at W.S.K., sees no alternative to rescuing the concern. Unemployment in the city stands at 17 percent, and W.S.K. represents 12 percent of the remaining jobs and 15 percent of local tax revenue. "In my opinion, the state cannot wash their hands of it," Mr. Janowski said. "At one time, the state made the decision as to what kind of production. O.K., it was a Communist state, but there were very restricted possibilities. Now you can't just say, 'Boys, do it completely by yourselves.' "

403-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Coors Tries A Canned Promotion
THE Coors Brewing Company is moving ahead with an elaborate summer promotion that features the distribution of prize cans of Coors Light infused with high-tech gadgetry. Is it bothered by the fiasco that Coca-Cola suffered when its MagiCans proved more mischievous than magical? Apparently not. Coors insists that its Talkin' Can Sweepstakes, promoting its best-selling brand in beer's busy season, is different and improved enough to avoid the pitfalls that made MagiCans -- and Coca-Cola -- the laughing stock of the advertising and marketing industries two years ago. In that ill-fated promotion, prizes replaced soda in selected cans, but just about everything went wrong from malfunctions to a wave of negative publicity. Phil Senes, merchandising manager for the brewer in Golden, Colo., said in a telephone interview that Coors had taken every precaution. "Though it's hard to foretell the situations that may arise when you go out with a program that reaches the masses," Mr. Senes added, "we spent almost a year trouble-shooting what could go wrong." The promotion is now under way, timed to begin with Memorial Day, the unofficial start of summer. Coors, the nation's third-largest brewer, is making the contest the focus of its entire summer marketing effort for Coors Light, which vies for third place in beer sales with Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light. Though Mr. Senes would not discuss spending, Advertising Age estimated the budget at $6 million to $10 million. The MagiCans foul-up was one of most embarrassing in the annals of sales promotion. "There's never been anything like it!" burbled a press release for "Magic Summer '90," as Coca-Cola called the campaign. And indeed, never had the world's largest soft-drink company had to cut short a huge promotion after only three weeks amid hoots of derision. Coca-Cola intended to distribute about 750,000 MagiCans, which looked exactly like 12-ounce cans of Coca-Cola Classic. But inside, instead of soda, was a prize. A mechanism under the lid was triggered when the pop-top was popped, causing rolled-up cash or a prize voucher to rise through the spout. And to give MagiCans the heft of regular cans, they were partly filled with chlorinated water, sealed off inside. Isolated malfunctions arose within two weeks of the promotion's start in May 1990. Sometimes, the mechanism jammed and would not pop up. Other times, it fell into the can, piercing the seal on the water and releasing it so that unsuspecting consumers could taste it. Coca-Cola insisted the promotion had been successful, generating double-digit sales-volume growth, despite being curtailed after only about 250,000 cans were distributed. But in marketing, where perception so often is reality, the spectacle of Coca-Cola being nagged by seemingly never-ending problems with a mechanical gizmo damaged the company's image. Mr. Senes said that despite the problems the Coke Classic promotion was successful. "Most packaged-goods companies are trying to figure out how to get in front of consumers and be noticed," he added. "MagiCans were a way to do that and, I believe, the talking cans are also." So to avoid a "MagiCans II," Coors made several important changes, he said: * Details of the contest cover about a third of every Coors Light can. Nowhere on the MagiCans was there contest information. * Coors is randomly inserting the more than 30,000 talking cans in 12-pack cartons of Coors Light, which also carry sweepstakes details. MagiCans were also found in six-packs and amid cans sold individually. * Coors's tests were aimed at making sure the liquid inside -- carbonated, rather than chlorinated, water -- is securely sealed. A microchip inside a container nestled within a 12-ounce can of Coors Light enables it to "talk." When exposed to light, it is supposed to say, "You win!," and then describe the prize, items like stereos and compact disks, valued in excess of $1 million. Coors believes the idea of "instant gratification" in a consumer contest is so powerful, Mr. Senes said, that it strived mightily to devise methods to make its promotion work. Chris Sutherland, president of the Promotion Marketing Association of America, a trade association in New York, welcomed Coors's decision to "take what was somebody else's failure and attempt to make it a success." He did, however, note one potential problem that Coors might encounter: Like Coca-Cola, Coors is "substituting another kind of liquid in the can" than what a consumer expects. (Another was that a sample can sent by Coors would not stop talking for almost 15 minutes, despite several efforts to silence its spiel.) The Coors Light agency, Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago, has created humorous television commercials, which mock other kinds of contests, to promote the sweepstakes. Riverside Promotions in Wilton, Conn., is the promotion agency handling the sweepstakes. Goldberg Moser O'Neill Advertising in San Francisco is handling advertising aimed at the beer trade.

404-> Mobil's Profit Falls 82%; Amerada Posts Deficit
The Mobil Corporation said today that earnings plunged 82 percent in the first quarter, while the Amerada Hess Corporation said it lost $23.4 million. Recession, lower prices for crude oil and natural gas crimped profits for most global oil companies in the quarter, and analysts expect that the industry will report profit declines of 50 percent or more from operations in the period. The Amoco Corporation, for instance, said Tuesday that its operating income declined 52 percent. Bryan Jacoboski, oil analyst at Paine Webber in New York, said global business conditions for the industry were improving modestly, except in Japan, where Mobil is a major refiner and marketer. "Demand is starting to recover in the U.S., and refining and marketing profit margins have started to improve," he said. Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company after the Exxon Corporation, is one of a few oil giants not likely to show rising profits in the current quarter, Mr. Jacoboski said. But with prices for crude oil and natural gas higher than in the first quarter, most companies will post modest gains in operating income this quarter, he added. "The first quarter will prove to be the low point for the full year," he said. The following is a breakdown of the first-quarter results for Mobil and Amerada Hess: Mobil Net income was $127 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $710 million, or $1.73 a share, in the 1991 quarter when the company reaped huge profits from surging prices for refined products in the Middle East and Europe during the Persian Gulf war. Revenues fell 8 percent, to $15.2 billion from $16.6 billion. Excluding one-time charges, Mobil's operating income fell 70 percent, to $213 million, or slightly better than analysts' estimates. Mobil's shares fell 50 cents today, to $61.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., said its results included a $75 million charge related to layoffs and other cutbacks in United States operations, plus a $30 million charge for a dry hole in Peru. One-time costs for cutbacks begun in Canadian operations were put at $11 million. Mr. Murray said Mobil had scaled back its spending and would delay investments "until business conditions improve," a position adopted by most oil giants in recent weeks. "Although the second quarter has opened with what appear to be early indications of an upturn in the U.S. economy and a recent firming of crude oil prices, it is still too early for substantial optimism," he said. Operating earnings in oil-and-gas exploration and production fell to $232 million, from $371 million, mainly because of lower prices for oil and natural gas. In worldwide refining and marketing, profits fell to $52 million, from $390 million, because of weak demand in Asia, Europe and the United States. The United States refining and marketing operations, hampered also by unusually warm winter weather, did not earn a profit. The chemicals unit earned $10 million, down from $92 million a year earlier. Amerada Hess The first-quarter loss compared with a profit of $75.7 million, or 93 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. The 1992 figure included a gain of $13.1 million from a tax refund. Revenues for the New York-based company fell 29 percent, to $1.45 billion from $2.03 billion. A large East Coast refiner and marketer of gasoline, Amerada Hess lost $39.7 million in the quarter in its refining and marketing unit, compared with a loss of $43.6 million in the period a year ago. Income from its oil-and-gas exploration and production unit was $29 million, down from $134 million a year earlier. Earnings for the 1991 quarter included a one-time gain of $46.2 million from a legal settlement. Amerada Hess's stock fell $1.50 a share today, to $40, on the Big Board.

406-> Review/Theater; Making a Virtue of Eclecticism In New Orleans Song and Dance
"The High Rollers Social and Pleasure Club" is a Broadway excursion into the mood and street sounds of the city of New Orleans. There is a Mardi Gras party going on here. Whether or not one feels like an invited guest will depend on how much one enjoys the music, a gumbo of diverse ingredients, and what demands one makes for art to go hand in hand with entertainment. "High Rollers" is principally the creation of Allen Toussaint, who wrote a half-dozen of the more than 40 songs and is onstage as pianist, leading a tuneful combo. As the composer of songs like "Mother-in-Law" and as a successful record producer, Mr. Toussaint has made a considerable contribution to New Orleans rock and soul. But one can get the drift of a revue that opens with a garishly costumed jester standing atop a bar promising "a big powwow in the sky." He then introduces "the legendary Allen Toussaint," a description that may have been written by the aforesaid composer. In other words, the show at the Helen Hayes Theater starts out on the wrong foot, achieving a kind of alienation effect on the audience. Later, it missteps, as vulgarity is confused with sexuality, and as some of the production accouterments like Theoni V. Aldredge's costumes cross the border into bad advice. On the positive side, the show has spirit and exuberance and a fervently talented cast, which sings and dances as if possessed by some musical genie. The performers, even more than the music, are the essence of the show. The women are a striking trio: the willowy Vivian Reed, Deborah Burrell-Cleveland playing the role of "the queen" and the delicate Nikki Rene. Each has her own style, with Ms. Reed specializing in lowdown blues like "You Can Have My Husband" ("but don't mess with my man"). Singing together, as in Huey P. Smith's "Sea Cruise," they become a bouncing boogie-woogie black version of the Andrews Sisters. Trapped by their obvious roles, and wearing black tights that would be more appropriate in a bicycle race, the men have a more difficult time asserting their individual identities. In his bowler hat, the muscular Michael McElroy seems to be reaching for the Geoffrey Holder crown, and Eugene Fleming preens beneath the glitter as the jester. But both of them and Lawrence Clayton have strong voices, especially so in the case of Mr. Clayton, who joins Ms. Burrell-Cleveland in the sinuous "Dance the Night." They are followed by an equally passionate duet by Ms. Reed and Mr. McElroy. In a fillip to the first-act conviviality, the saxophonist Gary Keller (like the other instrumentalists, he looks out of place in a conventional suit) takes center stage for a mellow solo. After "the good times," as the first act is called, the second act's "more good times" are a bit of a letdown. Spicing the menu are Tarik Winston and Keith Robert Bennett, paired as the Wonder Boys. They are like a couple of newsies tapping their way through "Feet, Don't Fail Me Now." Between their syncopated dancing and leaping splits, they further enliven an already lively show. As for the other men, they seem to have taps on their tights. Although the revue may or may not be typical of New Orleans, the songs try to make a virtue of eclecticism. There are nonsense ditties like "Tu Way Pocky Way," which could be a cousin to "Push Ka Pi Shi Pie" in "Five Guys Named Moe," a "Jelly Roll" and even a reach into the bayou for Hank Williams's "Jambalaya." All of the talk and especially the voodoo mumbo jumbo could be excised without harm, and there is too much hand waving in what passes for choreography. Under Alan Weeks's direction, the show speeds quickly by, with the final three numbers merging into an obligatory chorus of "When the Saints Go Marchin' In," accompanied by a shower of confetti over the audience. Walking down 44th Street after the show, one can easily tell which theatergoers have just seen "High Rollers." This jamboree is as diffuse as it is frenetic, but in contrast to the casts of audience-participation shows at other theaters, these performers do all the work and earn their place in the musical spotlight.

407-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Cranes and Belly Limelight A woman who sings and three men on drums and guitars: that was the lineup for both Cranes and Belly, bands that performed Tuesday night. The two bands also share a basic musical strategy; in their songs, a serene, girlish vocal is swathed in noise. Sometimes the singing grows harsher to match the swelling chaos; sometimes it remains lost in its own reverie. Either way, the performers show little emotion, staying calm and deadpan, barely moving to the beat. Yet the two bands were utterly distinct. Cranes, an English band, chose discord and primitivism. The songs were slow and deliberate, with a basic drumbeat and just two or three chords. The music was guitar-driven, but some songs added a repeating piano riff, a Minimalist handful of notes. Alison Shaw, on bass, sang in a mewling, childish wisp of a voice, her words so vague and whispery they were largely indecipherable, as they are on the band's album, "Wings of Joy" (Dedicated/B.M.G.). A few songs used their stately tempos and keyboard sounds to build a rough-hewn grandeur. But sooner or later the noise would swell, a looming wave of guitar distortion and sourceless squall, buffeting but never toppling Ms. Shaw's voice. Cranes' music could be the sound of a lone innocent holding her own within a pitiless universe, In Belly, noise provides more muscle for Tanya Donelly, the band's singer, guitarist and leader. Her voice is clear, working its way at times to an angry rasp or a Sinead O'Connor leap, while her lyrics seemed to be about troubled sleep and tense romances. One song asked "Don't you have someone you'd die for?" Ms. Donelly, formerly of Throwing Muses, writes songs that seem to take shape along the way; although she wrote only a small part of Throwing Muses' repertory, she has plenty of strong material. Where most rock songs would repeat, hers expand or mutate, bringing in new material or changing meter, as if the old walls of structure had dissolved; she writes waltzes as well as standard 4/4 rockers, and some of the songs have a country bounce. Belly plays harder than Throwing Muses did, using power chords, a pounding beat and concentrated drones, while Ms. Donelly easily commands her way through the turbulence.

408-> Review/Dance; New at the City Ballet: Works by 2 Old Hands
Hoping to stimulate creativity, the New York City Ballet is in the midst of its novel Diamond Project, an intensive weekend showcase for new works by 11 choreographers. The souvenir program even carries an inspirational message credited to that celebrated art critic Winston Churchill: "Without tradition, art is a flock of sheep. Without innovation, it is a corpse." A more apt quotation might be from Virgil: "They can because they think they can." Confidence, in fact, was hardly missing from Peter Martins and William Forsythe, whose premieres (along with a repeat of David Allan's "Reunions") made up the bill for the company's spring gala on Thursday night. The evening at the New York State Theater doubled as the Diamond Project's second program. Yet Mr. Forsythe came up with some well-designed trivia in his premiere, "Herman Schmerman," and Mr. Martins misfired, albeit with dignity, in his treatment of Stravinsky's "Jeu de Cartes." Like everyone else, they kept to the project's reported conditions: leotard costumes, no sets, a use of classical technique and a pledge to keep within the budget. Very possibly such constraints are not for everybody, but they shrewdly force the participating choreographers to concentrate on the dance element in their ballets rather than on theatrical trappings. Mr. Forsythe, the American director of the Frankfurt Ballet in Germany, and Mr. Martins, the City Ballet's artistic director, are masters of the leotard ballet. In this instance, however, they showed signs of running out of steam. In "Jeu de Cartes," Mr. Martins has battled a Stravinsky score as if it were an assignment. He took a similar approach with two compositions that George Balanchine himself always avoided: the composer's suite from "L'Histoire du Soldat" and his "Concerto for Two Solo Pianos." There is something of both these Martins ballets in this treatment of "Jeu de Cartes," but it is less successful. The reason is obviously the score, which, although specifically written for Balanchine, is virtually undance able. It never made for an enduring work in the Balanchine canon: the first version, "Card Party," in New York in 1937, was revised in 1951 as "Card Game." Although John Cranko and Janine Charrat created versions of "Jeu de Cartes" that were considered popular, they banked on pathos or entertainment rather than substance. The truth is that the music is treacherous and Mr. Martins's attempt to add a dimension to its structure and texture in a plotless ballet is an invitation to confusion. Trying to purify, as in "Soldat," he has discarded the original story but also abstracted it. Stravinsky's conceit of a joker who takes on the guise of other cards in a simulated poker game is translated here into the idea of a ballerina who leads each of the "three hands." Darci Kistler becomes a different card, so to speak, when she puts on a tunic with a different color to match her cavaliers. Albert Evans, in red, partners her with a red sextet of women behind him. Damian Woetzel does the same in black with six men in black and Nilas Martins follows suit with a blue female sextet. The male solos are all different, with Mr. Woetzel getting the virtuosic ones, and Miss Kistler injects a needed playfulness through her sublime dancing. Yet for all its high skill, the ballet has an overall rigid sameness about it. Mr. Forsythe prefers fewer steps and "Herman Schmerman," even by Forsythe standards, could use more variety despite its witty punchline. The steps are placed side to side rather than connected. Atmosphere is what Mr. Forsythe knows how to create and here he suggests a dancing ground. Five dancers in black -- Kyra Nichols, Margaret Tracey, Wendy Whelan, Jeffrey Edwards and Ethan Stiefel -- watch occasionally behind a panel fence. They are at their most interesting in the solos, which have an innovative shift of weight. Thom Willem's electronic score has more texture than usual and offers apt support for a rather sketchy sketch.

409-> Culkin to Appear in 'Nutcracker' Film
Macaulay Culkin, the young star of the 1990 movie "Home Alone," will appear with the New York City Ballet in a film of "The Nutcracker" that re-creates George Balanchine's choreography. The film, a joint venture of Elektra Entertainment and New Regency Productions, is directed by Emile Ardolino, who has directed for the PBS television series "Dance in America"; staging is by Peter Martins, ballet master in chief of the City Ballet. The film is to be released next winter. While a student at the School of American Ballet in the late 1980's, young Culkin danced the role of Fritz in two City Ballet performances of "The Nutcracker." Principal dancers in the film will include Darci Kistler as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Damian Woetzel as the Cavalier, Kyra Nichols as Dewdrop and Jessica Lynn Cohen as Marie.

411-> ON PRO HOCKEY; Penguins Feeling Heat As Cold Front Sets In
When they continue their defense of the Stanley Cup on Thursday night in Pittsburgh, the embattled Mario Lemieux and his rattled Penguin teammates must contemplate what a repeat of Games 1 and 2 would mean for their place in history. Since the 1952 Toronto Maple Leafs, no defending champion has been swept in the first round. But if the Penguins' performances back at the Igloo are consistent with their display Tuesday night at the Capital Centre, the champs of last spring could be waving a white flag by May Day. In losing by 6-2 to the Washington Capitals, the Penguins seemed to unravel. After taking a 2-0 lead on two power-play goals set up by Lemieux, they began a parade of mostly unprovoked penalties. First, Kevin Stevens knocked over goalie Don Beaupre, and Ulf Samuelsson went off with him for cross-checking. This led to the Capitals' winning goal, by Michel Pivonka. Next, with 99 seconds left in a power play, Rick Tocchet nullified Pittsburgh's advantage with another cross-check. Later, while trailing by four, Bob Errey charged Dmitri Kristich. Finally, when Jay Caufield tried to start a fight and found no takers, his teammate Troy Loney got two misconducts for punching the backs of helmets. While the Capitals kept their cool, their fans pelted Pittsburgh's bench with debris and exchanged harsh farewells until security guards rushed in. Appropriately for a city of embassies and tourists, the game included players from a half-dozen nations, and there was much to discuss in many tongues. Did somebody say "No mas?" "We're not feeling sorry for ourselves," said Stevens, who speaks with a Boston accent. "We're behind the eight ball. I can't wait to get home. It seems like we've been here for a month." They might not be back until autumn, when Lemieux might be recovered from the sore shoulder that has replaced his sore back as the topic of discussion. "I'm not going to talk about the injury," Lemieux said, in a quiet voice, with a light French accent. "I've already talked too much about it." After missing Sunday's 3-1 defeat in Game 1 of this Patrick Division semifinal series, Lemieux began Tuesday's game with a big body check and many lovely passes. But after his team fell far behind, Lemieux spent most of the third period on the bench and much of the post-game period with ice on his shoulder and penalty-killing on his mind. "We took penalties in key situations," he said. "We certainly have to improve on that. We have to be more disciplined." Perhaps, after the change of owners, the death of a coach, the medical problems of Lemieux and all the roster shuffling, the Penguins are psychologically spent and overmatched against the Capitals, who finished second behind the Rangers in the regular season. Once again Tuesday, the Capitals' success was led in part by Khristich, Pivonka and Petr Bondra, part of hockey's new world order. The first goal was scored by Khristich, who comes from Kiev. Bondra, who is also from Ukraine but grew up in Czechoslovakia, scored once and assisted on two others. He tied the game on a sizzling rush past Gordie Roberts before beating Tom Barrasso with a fake. He leads the series with three goals. Pivonka, born and raised in Czechoslovakia, also assisted on two. Afterward, all spoke in various languages with various reporters. "I feel great," Bondra said. "More body contact in playoffs. Big games. Very big." Pivonka, Bonda's linemate and mentor, said, "Everybody knows he's got speed, but nobody knew he was going to get hot like this." Rod Langway, the Capitals' father figure who was born 35 years ago in Maaq, Formosa, but grew up in the Boston area, said Pivonka is "like a big brother to Bondra." Bondra, Pivonka and Khristich are helping to tear down another of hockey's lingering stereotypes: that Eastern Europeans won't excel in post-season play because they either are tired from the long season or won't stand up to the increased intensity of North American players. Al Iafrate, once a troubled young American, continues on his new-found stable course, rushing the puck and shooting it on goal and settling into the role of hockey's Axl Rose. Iafrate lights his cigarets with a blow torch, rides a motorcycle and talks freely about why, despite his size and all the provocation from many Penguins, he didn't choose to fight. "Anyone can do anything they want to me," he said. "I'm big enough where if I don't feel like fighting, I don't have to fight, right? I have more to lose. Seems like every time I get in a fight, I break a facial bone. I must have soft bones in my face." In discussing the international blend of the team, he added, "and we have five guys from Detroit," including himself. It's a nice enough name for a hometown, but nothing like Bondra's; he was born in a place called Luck. Why not just change his number from 12 to 7 and place a bet on the Capitals?

412-> Macedonia Is More Than a Name to Greece; Skopje to Explain
To the Editor: "They've Been Macedonians for 1,400 Years" by Pavlina Proeva and Sheila Krstevski (letter, May 2) serves as evidence why Greek opposition in naming a new neighboring state "Macedonia" is fully justified. The writers claim that "Macedonians inhabiting the Greek province of Macedonia . . . are officially denied their nationality." This outrageous claim is made without proof or documentation and is provocative in nature. The inhabitants residing in Greek Macedonia identify themselves as Greek and do not feel oppressed or aggrieved. The writers say that stores in Florina and Thessaloniki accommodate their customers by speaking Slavic and this is proof the owners are not Greek. Yugoslavs have in recent years been vacationing in the northern part of Greece in droves. If the shopkeepers in Florina and Thessaloniki try to communicate with their customers in Slavic (Bulgarian), that is good business practice. Ms. Proeva and Ms. Krstevski claim that the Slavs have been Macedonians for 1,400 years but they fail to define what they mean. When one examines the history of Skopje, the capital of the republic, for example, the argument that it is Macedonian is invalidated. Skopje was never part of ancient Macedonia but was an Illyrian tribal center in the third century B.C. The Slavs made many incursions but did not capture Skopje until A.D. 1189. Stephan Dushan was crowned emperor there by the Serbs in 1346. Skopje was incorporated by Serbia in 1913 and was made part of Yugoslavia in 1918. In 1945 Tito conveniently designated Skopje as the capital of the new "Macedonian" republic. Greece is not denying the republic of Skopje its right to independence and existence. The question is not why Greece objects to its neighbor's appropriating the name Macedonia, but why the neighboring state is so insistent and intent on adopting such a name.

414-> Liberty Cup Is Canceled
Corporate support of yachting events brings with it a tenuous existence, as organizers of New York's Liberty Cup Match Racing Regatta acknowledged recently. The group, the Harbor Festival Foundation, canceled this year's event at the last minute. Bill Darnell, executive director of the foundation, said last week that that his staff was unable to find adequate sponsorship. The four-day regatta was scheduled to begin next Wednesday in New York Harbor. Darnell said that it cost about $300,000 to $400,000 to stage a Liberty Cup regatta. "Rather than go into deficit spending, we decided to postpone Liberty Cup until next year," Darnell said. "We had a sponsor who was committed up to the last minute, but then did not sign." The harbor foundation is a nonprofit organization supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

415-> Amid Vichy Storm, Paris Honors Jewish Dead
The French observed the 50th anniversary today of the first major roundup of Jews in Nazi-occupied France amid growing demands that President Francois Mitterrand publicly recognize the responsibility of the Vichy Government for crimes against Jews. In recent weeks, a flurry of newspaper articles and television programs have sought to dispel the traditional view that only Germans singled out Jews for persecution by demonstrating how the Vichy Government took the initiative in ordering the French police to arrest Jews. The anniversary notes the time when the French police, under the Vichy Government, took part directly in the first organized roundup on July 16 and 17, 1942. Then some 13,000 Jews, including 4,000 children, were arrested and confined in a cycling stadium, the Vel d'Hiver on the Left Bank, before being deported to Auschwitz and other death camps. Of these, only about 400 survived. The stadium no longer exists. During the German occupation between 1940 and 1944, about 76,000 French and foreign Jews were deported to Nazi death camps, of whom 2,600 survived. A large group of intellectuals last month called on President Mitterrand to break an historical taboo by formally proclaiming that "the French state of Vichy" carried out persecution of and crimes against Jews. But on television on Tuesday, Mr. Mitterrand sidestepped the issue, noting that in 1940 "the French state was Vichy and not the Republic" and that the Resistance, the Government of General de Gaulle in 1944 and the Fourth Republic "were founded on rejection of this state." The intellectuals renewed their appeal to the President today to recognize Vichy's responsibility, arguing that "the French state today is answerable for everything that has been done in the name of the state." After November 1942, the Nazis occupied all of France and the Vichy Government continued only a shadowy existence, eventually fleeing to Nazi Germany in 1944. Mr. Mitterrand laid a wreath at the entrance to the Vel d'Hiver in Paris today, and some protesters in the crowd heckled the President when he arrived. Other demonstrations today included one in which Jewish students symbolically tried the Vichy Government in front of the Palace of Justice. The debate about Vichy's role in persecuting Jews has been raging here since April when a Paris court dropped charges of crimes against humanity against a former Vichy police official, Paul Touvier, who ordered the execution of seven Jews.

416-> COMPANY NEWS; DELTA PILOTS REFUSE TO DELAY PAY INCREASE
Delta Air Lines' unionized pilots refused yesterday to defer a group of pay increases scheduled to go into effect Sept. 1. Delta had asked the pilots to defer the pay increases after the airline reported a loss of $506.3 million for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. John Culp, a spokesman for the Delta members of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the union plans to make a detailed study of Delta's books and may agree later to some concessions. "We have decided to accept management's offer to study the financial condition of the company, but we have declined their request to postpone the September pay package," Mr. Culp said. The review will probably take several weeks. Neil Monroe, a spokesman for Delta, said company officials were disappointed by the decision. Members of Delta's management and officials of the Master Executive Council of the pilot's union met yesterday in Atlanta to discuss Delta's request for the pay deferral plus some as-yet unspecified productivity concessions. Mr. Monroe said Delta had not spelled out the productivity concessions because that point had not yet been reached in the discussions.

422-> First Interstate Posts a Profit
First Interstate Bancorp today reported a second-quarter profit of $64.5 million, or 75 cents a share, saying it was coming to grips with the bad loans and runaway expenses that caused an $80.3 million loss in the comparable period last year. The banking giant, with 995 offices in 13 Western states, said bad loans and other nonperforming assets fell by $270 million, or 18 percent, from first-quarter levels. Operating expenses were down $74 million from a year earlier, as a result of a drastic streamlining. With its loan portfolio improving, First Interstate set aside less money to cover losses. Its provision for such losses was $88 million in the second quarter, compared with $295 million in the period a year earlier. As of June 30, First Interstate's allowance for losses totaled $1.26 billion, or 4.98 percent of all loans. That compares with $1.25 billion, or 4.82 percent of all loans, on March 31, and $1.14 billion, or 3.74 percent of all loans, on June 30, 1991.

423-> U.S. Opens Inquiries on Spending for Los Angeles Rail System
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the General Accounting Office have opened inquiries into the Los Angeles agency that is building that city's vast new subway and rail system, the largest public works project under way in the country, Government sources said today. Investigators and auditors, prompted in part by whistle-blowers, will examine a broad range of activities of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and its staff and will focus on reports of fraud, wasteful spending and bribery of public officials, according to the sources, who are familiar with the unfolding investigations. Representative John J. Duncan Jr., a Tennessee Republican who is a member of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, said today that some frustrated whistle-blowers complained to his office after their reports of improprieties were ignored by officials in California. As examples of wasteful spending, Mr. Duncan cited $800,000 for opening ceremonies for a segment of the rapid-transit system; $2.9 million for meals, travel, entertainment and automobiles for the agency's 400 employees over 18 months, and the billing of personal entertainment expenses to agency credit cards. Agency Vows Cooperation The Federal Government has already contributed $1.353 billion to constructing the subway system, the first 4.4-mile segment of which is to open next year from downtown to the mid-Wilshire district, and has approved another $695 million. Plans to spend an additional $1.75 billion on the system are under consideration in Washington. The subway is part of a $45.9 billion rapid-transit network to be completed in 20 years. Stephanie Brady, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, said, "We are completely unaware of any such investigation." She said the agency would cooperate fully. Mr. Duncan said former and current workers on the project began sending their complaints and suspicions to him earlier this year, after he publicly criticized Los Angeles officials for awarding a rail-car contract to the Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese concern, despite a lower bid from an American company. That contract was subsequently canceled. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, agreed to Mr. Duncan's request for a formal inquiry into allegations of fraud, waste and abuse in the project, according to Congressional and G.A.O. sources. The inquiry will be conducted by the G.A.O.'s Office of Special Investigations, the sources said. The F.B.I., which also received complaints and information about the subway project, is looking into "serious criminal allegations against specific people" involved in the construction, a Government source said. The allegations include drug sales and use, payoffs to public officials and other criminal violations, the source said. Mike Kortin, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said today that he could neither confirm nor deny the existence of the investigation. In May, county and city auditors in Los Angeles confirmed newspaper reports of lavish spending and poor management controls at the Los Angeles transportation agency, noting, for example, that it had been spending $6,000 a month for coffee for employees. The auditors also found that agency employees were ignoring corrective measures imposed to control spending. Last March, Los Angeles transportation officials promised to crack down on a number of generous spending practices, which, they acknowledged, were unusual for a public agency. Records showed that the agency's head, Neil Peterson, and other employees had spent $51,000 for meetings, drinks and meals at the Los Angeles Athletic Club during an 18-month period. Staff members frequently bought meals for each other and public officials at local restaurants, and held numerous parties and receptions that were billed to taxpayers. Bills for doughnuts were more than $6,000. Dozens of employees criss-crossed the country, the records showed, running up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills for conferences and conventions at Walt Disney World and resorts in Atlantic City and Palm Springs, Calif. Poor accounting controls made it possible for an employee to charge $1,588 for bicycles to an agency credit card, the records showed. In recent months, several former employees have filed lawsuits asserting that they were dismissed for complaining about improper financial or safety practices. Agency officials have denied the assertions.

425-> Lebanese Plan the Return of War Refugees
The Government announced today that it would begin returning hundreds of thousands of refugees who were forced to flee their homes at the outset of the Lebanese civil war 17 years ago. The Government program provides for setting up local committees in 116 Lebanese villages and towns as well as establishing a National Council for Refugees that will try to facilitate the repatriation process by providing housing loans and for rebuilding the villages in addition to providing security for the returning refugees. About 800,000 people were displaced by the civil war in Lebanon. Before the war began in 1975, Muslims and Christians lived as neighbors in many areas, but the war forced many Lebanese to seek safety in enclaves where their religious group was dominant. Repatriation of the refugees was a key part in the Lebanese accord to end the war that was reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in 1989. The Government program is part of an effort to hold the first parliamentary elections in 19 years. The mainstream Christian Phalange party has refused to participate in the elections, however, until Christian refugees can return home and vote in their villages.

427-> Georgia Sale By Times Co.
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it had completed the sale of the offices, equipment and subscription lists of The Gwinnett Daily News, a suburban Atlanta newspaper it had owned since 1987. The newpaper was published on Sunday for the last time. The property of the Gwinnett paper was sold to Cox Enterprises Inc., publisher of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. The sale was announced last month but was subject to a waiting period for possible review by the Justice Department. That period has now expired. The sale ends a battle between the Gwinnett paper and its much larger Atlanta competitors for readership in the city's affluent northern suburbs. As The Daily News grew rapidly, doubling its circulation over five years, to 50,589 at the end of 1991, Cox also directed its energies toward attracting Daily News readers. The sale of the paper, which the Times Company bought for $90 million, is expected to reduce the Times Company's quarterly earnings by 45 cents a share because the sale price of the assets is less than what they are valued at on the company's books. The terms of the deal with Cox were not disclosed.

433-> Dow Up 15.67, but Off 3.24 for Week
Wall Street stocks closed higher yesterday as an upturn in the bond market helped shares snap a three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.67 points to end at 3,328.94. For the week, the index lost 3.24 points. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues led declines 1,103 to 591 on moderate volume of 166.8 million shares, compared with 185.8 million Thursday. The market's gains, which come just before the Republican Party's national convention next week, could be setting the foundation for a recovery, analysts said. Investors will be watching for President Bush's economic plans following reports on Thursday about possible changes in tax policy. "I think the stock market is finally starting either the Republican convention rally or an extension of the summer rally, which could carry through into September," said David Bostian, chief strategist at Herzog Heine Geduld. "To the extent the Republicans make a unified presentation, the market will accept it favorably," he said. "In addition, I think the Fed may decide to give us one final cut in the discount rate or the Federal funds rate." Investors also moved back into stocks after the bond market recovered from Thursday's steep drop. The 30-year bond closed up 23/32 of a point, which lowered its yield to 7.31 percent from 7.41 percent Thursday. The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said yesterday that the bond market had probably overreacted on Thursday to comments made by the new White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, who said the Government should emphasize lower tax rates and government spending limits. Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Baker's remarks were not hinting at specific new programs. Bill Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, said the market has been anticipating the convention next week. "Economic figures have not been that convincing one way or the other." 'The Market Will Tread Water' The batch of economic reports released yesterday -- July industrial production, capacity use and early-August consumer confidence -- had little impact on the market. "Unless something weird happens, I think the market will tread water between 3,300 and 3,400," Mr. Raftery said. In trading, Lowe's Companies tumbled $4.375, to $18.675. Prudential lowered its earnings estimate, and Dean Witter cut its rating after the company issued its second-quarter earnings results.

434-> Lead Levels Force Closing Of a School
School officials yesterday ordered a Greenwich Village elementary school closed for the first day of school today after tests by the teachers' union indicated that there were high levels of lead in the dust on the floors. Dangerously high concentrations of lead were found in dust samples taken in the spring. Those samples were analyzed by a laboratory hired by parents from Public School 3, at 590 Hudson Street, at Grove Street. But until last night, when the teachers' union received preliminary results of tests taken on Friday and Monday, the Board of Education had maintained that the school was safe. The Board's own tests, taken after parents complained about dust falling from a paint and plaster-removal project at the five-story school, had come back negative, school officials said. A spokesman for the teachers' union, Neill Rosenfeld, said last night that seven of the 41 samples taken by the union's industrial hygienist had had concentrations above acceptable levels. He said he had not been told what the specific readings were for each sample or how much above acceptable levels the samples were. Because the hygienist had delivered the findings orally, rather than in writing -- and because air samples taken at the same time are still being analyzed -- Mr. Rosenfeld and other union officials were careful to call the dust-test results "inconclusive." Officials of the Board of Education said they would meet today with members of the teachers' union to discuss the findings in detail. It is not clear how long P.S. 3 will remain closed, although yesterday's announcement was for only a one-day shutdown. "It's not a relief to find this out," said Ann Rupel, whose about-to-be-9-year-old son attends P.S. 3. "This shouldn't have had to happen at the last minute, but I think the fact that these tests, after they've been stonewalling or pooh-poohing the problem, came back with elevated levels, confirms our perceptions." The closing order came at a time when the threat of lead poisoning seemed to dominate local headlines and the daily routines of city agencies. First there were reports of lead-tainted debris from the Williamsburg Bridge. Then tests found that soil near the Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges contained lead concentrations higher than what the Federal Centers for Disease Control considers safe. And, after another survey found lead hazards in drinking water, New York City officials announced that the water supply would be treated with a lead-reducing chemical. Lead contamination has long been considered a health hazard for children; experts say it can cause neurological damage that slows learning ability. Lead paint was banned in 1978, but thousands of buildings completed before then still have lead paint that can flake off. The concern is that young children could eat the paint, which scientists say tastes slightly sweet. At P.S. 3, the concerns about lead were first raised in the spring, when a parents' group hired a private laboratory to measure lead levels. One of the tests showed a lead level of 13,000 micrograms, far exceeding the 200 microgram level permitted by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the Board of Education, in its own tests, said the highest reading it found was 125 micrograms per square foot. The average reading in the Board's tests was 10 micrograms per square foot. Work crews spent the summer removing flaking lead paint from inside the 85-year-old school at the same time that they were repairing the roof and replacing the cornice. With most of the work finished and the fall term about to begin, the board conducted tests for lead in the air and on the floors last week, as did the industrial hygienist hired by the teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers. The union shared the findings with officials of Community School District 2 and with the Board of Education last night. There is no formal requirement to close a school when high levels of lead are suspected, but the school district and the central board immediately decided to do so. "We felt it was better to err on the side of caution because the tests were not clear," said Robert Terte, a Board of Education spokesman. The school was ordered closed while some parents were still at a late-afternoon meeting called by Parents Against Lead in Schools, the group that arranged for the tests that found the high lead levels in the spring. That meeting followed a sometimes chaotic tour of the school led by Dr. John Rosen, the director of pediatric metabolism at Montefiore Medical Center, and Laurence Molloy, the president of the environmental management company that did the spring tests. Standing on a chair in a hallway, Mr. Molloy pointed to paint chipping off the wall. "Kids will put their hands on the wall and later they'll lick their hands," he said. But another lead poisoning expert, Sergio Pionelli, interrupted, saying the building was not hazardous. "Dr. Rosen is dead wrong," he said. "They tested for the dust and the school is, in my opinion, safe.

435-> Navy Investigator Removed From Inquiry on Assaults
A naval investigator looking into the assault of 26 women at a naval aviators' convention last year was removed from the case and disciplined after one of the victims complained that the agent was pressuring her to see him socially, the Navy said today. Navy officials said Laney S. Spigener, a civilian agent with the Naval Investigative Service, was suspended without pay for three days because of the complaint by Lieut. Paula Coughlin, a former admiral's aide and one of the women attacked by drunken aviators at last year's convention of the Tailhook Association, a private group of retired and active-duty aviators. A Navy spokeswoman, Lieut. Jacquie Yost, said Lieutenant Coughlin told the agent's superiors on Nov. 26 that Mr. Spigener "was attempting to establish something other than a professional relationship with her." Mr. Spigener was removed from the case and, following an inquiry, disciplined on April 15, Lieutenant Yost said.

436-> Rick Sklar, 62, A Dominant Force Behind Rock Radio
Rick Sklar, whose programming made WABC in New York the most popular radio station in North America, died at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan on Monday. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Sklar died from complications after minor surgery but the exact cause of death is not known, a spokesman from his company said. At the time of his death, Mr. Sklar was a vice president of the Interep Radio Store in New York, a national media-consulting concern that brings together the advertising inudstry and radio stations around the country. Top 40's Early Days Mr. Sklar was a leading force in the early days of rock-and-roll Top 40 radio. He was a native of Brooklyn and began his career as a disk jockey at WPAC-AM in Patchogue, L.I., shortly after graduating from New York University. From 1955 through 1962, he handled promotion and programming at two New York AM stations that began Top 40 radio: WINS, now an all-news station, and WMGM, which later became WHN; WEVD has that spot on the dial today. He was recruited as program director for WABC's Top 40 show in 1962. He nurtured radio personalities -- Bruce (Cousin Brucie) Morrow among them -- who became legendary. Mr. Sklar remained as WABC's program director until 1977, when he became vice president of programming for ABC Radio. He was an adjunct professor at St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens, and the author of an autobiography, "Rocking America: How the All-Hit Radio Stations Took Over America" (St. Martin's Press, 1984). He is survived by his wife, the former Sydelle Helfgott; his mother, Cecille, of Manhattan; a son, Scott, of Sausalito, Calif.; a daughter, Holly, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Ruth Sklar of Manhattan.

438-> Iraqi Official Rejects Threats of U.N. Attack
A senior Iraqi official said today that threats of new bombing strikes or other military action would never persuade Iraq to allow United Nations arms inspectors to search the Agriculture Ministry here or any other buildings that are "symbols of sovereignty." "Such threats do not change Iraq's position," the official, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, said at a news conference the day after the United Nations inspectors ended their 17-day vigil outside the ministry, saying the Iraqi authorities were no longer protecting them against threatening demonstrators. "Whatever the Security Council does won't change the position of Iraq," Mr. Aziz said. "We are not going to compromise on our principles. Iraq will never compromise its sovereignty." The inspectors, sent by special commission charged by the Security Council with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, were acting on a tip from a Western intelligence agency that documents related to its ballistic missile program are hidden there. Sovereignty Is Cited But Iraq said allowing them to search would amount to a surrender of its sovereignty and endanger its security. Mr. Aziz, a lifelong ally of President Saddam Hussein and one of the most powerful figures in his Government, said Iraq has "no objection" to the inspectors' searching buildings that "relate directly or indirectly" to Iraq's program for developing weapons of mass destruction, which must be eliminated under the Security Council's gulf war cease-fire plan known as Resolution 687. These might include "camps, plants, industries, warehouses and institutions related to fields covered by 687," he said. But Mr. Aziz insisted that "buildings like the Ministry of Agriculture or this ministry, the Ministry of Information and Culture, or other buildings which are symbols of sovereignty or of the state have nothing to do with areas covered by 687, and we do not allow the teams to search them." This was a matter of principle for Iraq, he added. Iraq's unbending stance today means that it remains in violation of the Security Council cease-fire plan, which gives the special commission and its inspectors the right to go wherever they want inside the country. This and several other current disputes between Baghdad and the United Nations have angered the United States, Britain and France and led them to start warning Baghdad they may be forced to take military action of some kind to secure its compliance. Food Prices Rise Despite the talk of war, Baghdad remained calm today with no signs of any preparations for an attack. But since the Agriculture Ministry crisis began on July 5, hoarding has pushed the market price of most basic foods up by a further 20 percent. The Iraqi dinar's value on the unofficial market has also sunk, with a dollar now sometimes fetching as many as 22 dinars, compared with 15 or fewer before the standoff began. The Deputy Prime Minister also offered the United Nations no comfort in another dispute over the future of the organization's relief program in Iraq and the 500 lightly armed United Nations guards deployed around the country to protect relief workers. He called the program "a farce" and said most of its budget goes for salaries and expenses bringing little benefit to the Iraqi people. And he accused many United Nations officials of "doing political spying work to the benefit of United States and British intelligence agencies." The United Nations is now pressing Baghdad to renew the agreement under which these relief workers and their guards are stationed in the country and which expired at the end of last month. The Secretary General has ordered them to stay at their posts for the time being. The Deputy Prime Minister was careful not to say the agreement will never be renewed or that United Nations staff should leave the country, but he came close to doing so. "Where is the incentive for Iraq to renew?" he asked, adding, "We have to make a stop to this hypocritical and politically motivated activity."

439-> 3 Slain in Bronx Apartment, but a Baby Is Saved
Police officers first noticed the stench, then opened the door to a Bronx apartment yesterday and found the bodies of three shooting victims: a middle-aged man, his teen-age son and his 28-year-old wife. The officers found something else: under a bed, only feet from her dead mother, lay a 3-month-old baby girl, dehydrated but alive. "In her last dying act she protected her baby," said Lieut. John W. Se bring, commander of the 43d Precinct. "She probably knew she was going to die, so she stuffed the baby where she knew it would be safe. "And it was." Lieutentant Sebring said the triple homicide in Parkchester, above a doctor's office in a three-story brick home, was connected to drugs. The family apparently sold heroin. About 10 small bags of heroin were found on a table in their apartment at 2034 Benedict Avenue along with boxes of glassine envelopes and scales. The victims were identified last night as Eusuerio Rivera, 53; Mr. Rivera's son Jason Laboy, 16, and Mr. Rivera's wife, Adrienne Jones, Lieutenant Sebring said. Each had been shot once in the head and had been dead about 24 hours, the Lieutenant said. The baby, whom the police would not identify, was unharmed, but was being treated for dehydration at Jacobi Hospital last night. Complaint About Loud Music "The child is in good shape and her condition is considered stable," said Clarence L. Crump, a hospital administrator. The bodies were discovered about 12:30 P.M., Lieutenant Sebring said, when the police responded to a complaint from the doctor on the first floor that loud music was blaring from the apartment. The husband and wife had last been seen by neighbors about 11 A.M. on Wednesday. In the heat, the corpses had already begun to decompose, and officers pushed open the door after they smelled the odor. In the front room, they found Mr. Rivera lying on his back. The 16-year-old lay in a hallway leading to the two bedrooms, his head in a blindfold made from duct tape. "Theoretically, he was home when they came and they tied him up and waited for the others to come home," Lieutenant Sebring said. The mother was found on the floor in a small bedroom near the bed and her child. Although the father apparently has relatives, the baby was placed in the custody of the Bureau of Child Welfare, the lieutenant said. Robbery Seen as Likely Motive There are no suspects, Lieutenant Sebring said. He speculated that the killer or killers knew that the family sold heroin and ransacked the apartment in search of drugs and cash. A television, videocassette recorder and computer were not touched. The lieutenant did not rule out revenge or a drug dispute. As officers combed the apartment yesterday for clues, a second son, 18, returned home as a crowd gathered to peer at the house. Through the open front door, the father's midsection was visible from the street. The son was not considered a suspect, though investigators were questioning him last night, Lieutenant Sebring said. Neighbors along Benedict Avenue, a relatively quiet street a block south of the Parkchester housing complex, said the family had lived there for only a year and were not well known. Though the police said neighbors told them that cars drove up to the house frequently and at odd hours, residents two doors down said they had not noticed. Three residents, who would not give their names, said that the husband and wife fought, sometimes out on the street, half a block from St. Helen's Church on the corner at Olmstead Avenue. "All we know is that they were fighting all the time," one woman said. "Every day, fighting and fighting."

440-> TURMOIL IN EUROPE; Fed Action On Europe Not Expected
The turmoil in European's financial markets is primarily a European affair and the United States will not get involved in trying to help steady Europe's jitters, officials of the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve said today. In fact, the turbulence could actually help both the American and the European economies, the officials said, because it could lead to lower interest rates and thus spur growth in Europe that would ultimately give the United States a boost as well. Beyond that, Europe's foreign exchange trauma has given the Federal Reserve more flexibility to lower interest rates, because the trauma has strengthened the dollar, they said. The dollar's extreme weakness early this month prevented the Federal Reserve from cutting rates by more than the one-quarter point cut it announced on Sept. 4. Fed Under Pressure In a speech today in Los Angeles, David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the present European turmoil was essentially a European phenomenon. "We're staying on the sidelines," said one Fed official. But clearly the United States is not unaffected. Since the election season began, the Fed has been under intense pressure from both Congress and the White House to lower interest rates even further than they have. The rates are now the lowest they have been in three decades. Fed officials acknowledged that if they had wanted to lower rates this week, they probably could not have done so. The step would have been be akin to throwing a great rock into an already unsettled pond. An American rate cut would probably strengthen the German mark, and increase tensions in Europe, pressuring other nations to raise their interest rates and protect their currencies against the mark. More Flexibility for Fed "What's happening in Europe gives the Fed a little more flexibility," said Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist with James Capel Inc. in New York. "They certainly won't cut rates this week, but they might do it in early October when the September employment report is released. I expect unemployment to be higher in that report." One senior Administration official praised the idea of devaluations in Europe, saying that they would spur growth there. Faster growth in Italy or Britain should ultimately mean that those countries would import more American goods. That official also said that such devaluations would lessen the need for these devaluing countries to jack up interest rates to defend their currency from falling against the German mark. Under the European Monetary System, member nations are required, barring a formal devaluation, to keep their currencies from falling against the mark. Lower interest would spur growth in the devaluing nations and help spur their growth -- and growth throughout Europe. Rooting for German Cuts European Community finance ministers are expected to announce more devaluations along the lines of the devaluation of the Italian lira. [ In Brussels early Thursday, the European Community finance ministers agreed to devalue the Spanish peseta and suspend the lira from the exchange rate system. ] "We want more of the same," said John Williamson, an economist with the Institute for International Economics. He said he feared that the Europeans might decide to keep some currencies at unrealistically high levels against the mark and that this could hinder growth by forcing some countries to raise rates. He was also rooting for further rate cuts by Germany's central bank. American officials said the devaluations in Europe were not unalloyed good news because they could strengthen the dollar vis-a-vis the pound and lira, and thus make American goods less competitive versus British and Italian goods. But these officials said the devluations might help strengthen the mark against the dollar, and that could help America's competitive position. Market Plunge Feared The big fear that American officials expressed was that the commotion in Europe could cause American stock and bond markets to plunge. One official said the fact that the New York Stock Exchange slid today while the dollar strengthened showed that the European situation was undermining investor confidence. American officials said Europe's exchange rate markets will be at or near the top of the agenda when the Group of Seven's finance ministers meet Saturday in Washington. Originally, the weak dollar was scheduled to be topic No. 1. Some economists suggested that the United States might push the Europeans to structure their monetary system in a way that countries other than Germany do not repeatedly have to jack up their interest rates to defend their currencies, thus slowing their economic growth.

441-> U.S. Aides Propose $500,000 Fine for State Power Authority
Federal authorities yesterday proposed fining the New York State Power Authority $500,000, saying it had suffered "a significant breakdown in management and administrative control" at one of its nuclear reactors, the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba. The Power Authority said it had already addressed some of the deficiencies but had not decided whether to pay the fine, which is large by Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards. The Power Authority could appeal the fine to the commission. The commission staff said the Power Authority had submitted incomplete or inaccurate information about mishaps at the 17-year-old plant and had installed new electrical relays on the system that is supposed to shut down the reactor in an emergency without evaluating them properly or checking them after they were installed. In addition, the staff said, the Power Authority had failed to identify and correct serious problems. For example, a leak of thousands of gallons of water a day from the main steam system began in mid-August 1991 the staff said, and was not corrected until commission inspectors pointed it out in October. Letter Faults Management The Power Authority was also cited for failing to protect "equipment that is essential to shutting down the reactor" from fire and smoke damage. Fitzpatrick is on Lake Ontario, eight miles northeast of Oswego. In a letter to the authority, the regional administrator of the commission, Thomas T. Martin, said plant management had failed in areas that "are fundamental elements of any program for operating and maintaining a nuclear power plant in a safe manner." The commission put the plant on a "watch list" of reactors needing increased attention in February of this year. Fitzpatrick has been closed since November 1991 for refueling, maintenance and fire protection work and is scheduled to return to service next month. In a statement, Ralph E. Beedle, the Power Authority's executive vice president for nuclear generation, said the issues raised by the commission "all arose some time ago and we have since addressed all and resolved most of them." For example, he said, the authority has replaced all 208 of the suspect relays and "implemented a comprehensive program to identify root causes of problems at the plant." Power Authority officials stressed that the proposed fine covers violations over a long period and that they have instituted a "results improvement program" to make the plant run better.

443-> Crackdown Announced on Groups Using Violence in Construction
The Dinkins administration announced plans yesterday to crack down on the rising number of groups using violence and extortion to get jobs at construction sites for black and Hispanic workers. The announcement came a day after two men who the police said belonged to the Queens Community Construction Coalition, a group that tries to get jobs for minorities, were fatally shot in a Queens park where they had gathered with about a dozen other men to discuss the day's job openings. The police said last night that they did not know whether the Queens coalition had ever resorted to violence. The shooting occurred about 7 A.M. in Baisley Pond Park in South Jamaica, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Norris Hollomon. Officers have established no motive in the slayings. Some law-enforcement officials have linked the shooting to the escalating violence among construction workers as some minority groups try to get a foothold in the largely white building trade. The proliferation of these groups has led some members to resort to gun battles in fierce fights over turf. One of the victims in the slaying on Thursday, Raymond Atkinson, 25 years old, was the head of the Queens Coalition, Sergeant Hollomon said. The other man, Terry Lewis, 22, was a member of the group. No suspects have been arrested or identified in the killings, the sergeant said. The director of the Mayor's Office of Construction, Rudolph J. Rinaldi, yesterday outlined countermeasures intended to squelch such violence. They include increasing police patrols at construction sites and tightening security to control access to those sites. Mayor David N. Dinkins emphasized that he was not targeting "legitimate coalition groups," which, he said, do not resort to intimidation as a means to seek jobs for their members. "Rogue groups, however, have stepped up their criminal activities, and we will take vigorous measures to prevent them from continuing down this road," the Mayor said. He added, "Although jobs may be scarce during the economic slump, workers at construction sites have the right to work without fearing for their lives." The city has worked with the construction industry to develop new security procedures at the sites, like creating separate entrances for workers and visitors and designating liaisons between the sites and local police precincts, Mr. Rinaldi said.

444-> Datek Operating Again
Datek, an over-the-counter market maker based in Brooklyn, resumed trading today two days after the firm was sanctioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The association suspended the firm and its general manager, Sheldon Maschler, for 90 days on charges of abusing the Small Order Execution System. Datek's lawyers filed a petition for a stay of the sanctions until an appeal hearing on Tuesday. Until the hearing, Datek will be allowed to trade stocks, but the firm is prohibited from using the small order system, which was intended for electronic trading of orders not exceeding 1,000 shares. Datek is accused of executing large orders over the system by dividing them into multiple blocks of 1,000 shares each, allowing the firm to sell thousands of shares quickly from its own inventory.

446-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Classic Slogans Hit the Spot: Here's a Book That Has a Lot
"When it rains, it pours" helped sell Morton salt for decades. "Where's the beef?" enriched Wendy's by encapsulating consumer skepticism about the portions at other fast-feeders. And "In your heart you know he's right" was a rallying cry for supporters of Barry Goldwater's bid for the Presidency in 1964 -- one wickedly rejoined by those backing President Lyndon B. Johnson: "In your guts you know he's nuts." Those slogans, and some 5,000 more, can be found in a new book, "Every Bite a Delight and Other Slogans" (Visible Ink Press, Detroit, $15.95), which offers a compendium of themes, jingles and catch phrases arranged in 126 categories from adhesives ("Best glue in the joint" for Elmer's Glue All) to writing instruments ("All write with a Waterman Ideal Fountain Pen . . . all wrong if you don't."). "There's history in the words," Janet Braunstein, a co-author of the book, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Detroit, where she is an advertising and marketing reporter for The Detroit Free Press. "You can see our society reflected in slogans." In the book, the title of which comes from a slogan for the Grennan Cake Company, Ms. Braunstein and her co-author, Laurence Urdang, focus on "trends in what companies think are important to consumers, "as seen in the way they advertise," Ms. Braunstein said. The book is replete with slogans that could run today only if, to paraphrase the Crazy Eddie slogan, the advertiser really were insane. Many would be sexist by modern standards: "Ask the man who owns one," for Packard, which Asher/Gould Advertising in Los Angeles has recently restyled for American Suzuki as, "Ask anyone who owns one." Others used dialect, like, "I'se in town, honey," for Aunt Jemima pancake flour. Some would be unsupportable scientifically, like "Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet," for Lucky Strike cigarettes. And there are those whose meanings have changed as the language changes, like "the gay-hearted fragrance," for Yardley of London. The political realm typifies how slogans have evolved, Ms. Braunstein said: "Some of the old ones were mini-speeches. Now, they're miniature sound bites." In 1920 it was, "Keep faith with our sons -- bring America into the League of Nations -- vote for Cox and Roosevelt," for the Democratic ticket of James Cox and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1988 it was "Read my lips: no new taxes" for George Bush. The book also includes scores of slogans that misfired by being too bland, too generic or just plain dumb -- Ms. Braunstein cited "Gotta have it," which Pepsi-Cola introduced in January. Another pitfall, she added, occurs "when everyone says the same thing and it gets to be meaningless," as exemplified by innumerable slogans stressing quality or freshness. Slogan fanatics will be disappointed at the many famous slogans omitted from the book, like, "It's smart to be thrifty" (Macy's); "With soap it's loaded" (S.O.S.); "Gee, Dad, it's a Wurlitzer!" (Wurlitzer organs); "Who says a good newspaper has to be dull?" (The New York Herald Tribune). Of course, not everyone is sold on slogans. Though the Leo Burnett Company has produced some of advertising's best-recalled slogans -- "Fly the friendly skies" for United Airlines and "Come to where the flavor is" for Marlboro cigarettes, for example -- its campaign for Sony appears without slogans. "Our research showed Sony is a name that speaks for itself," said Brian Williams, a senior vice president and account director at Burnett in Chicago. "We didn't feel we needed to say anything more." (Please, don't tell Ms. Braunstein.) -------------------- The anwers to the quiz on page D1 are: 1-e; 2-g; 3-f; 4-c; 5-h; 6-i; 7-j; 8-b; 9-a; 10-d.

448-> Post Office Plans Large Cut In Workers at Headquarters
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon plans to announce Friday that the United States Postal Service's management will be restructured and trimmed of thousands of jobs through the early retirement of headquarters workers, a postal official said tonight. Such a move has been expected since July, when Mr. Runyon took over the Postal Service's management and told his senior staff to come up with a plan to cut costs for the organization, which has been losing money. The plan was reported by NBC News, which said 30,000 to 40,000 of the Postal Service's 130,000 management jobs would be eliminated. Marty Roberts, a Postal Service spokesman, said the NBC report was essentially accurate. Mandatory Retirements? The network said that longtime employees who were at least 50 years old would be offered the chance to retire voluntarily at a reduced pension but that mandatory retirements might be necessary to meet the cost-cutting goals. The report said half of the 42 assistant postmasters general in the Washington headquarters could lose their jobs. Mr. Runyon, a former chief executive officer of the Tennessee Valley Authority and a former top executive of the American manufacturing subsidiary of Nissan, a Japanese automobile company, predicted when he became Postmaster General that the organization would run up a $2 billion deficit for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. In the last fiscal year, the deficit was $1.5 billion, Mr. Roberts said. The Postal Service has tried in a number of different ways to compensate for its losses. Aggressively promoting stamps as collectibles, it reaped $175 million in the last fiscal year, almost double the figure from the year before. The Postal Service was set up as a Government-sponsored corporation in 1971 with the idea that it would make enough money to end taxpayer subsidies of mail service. It last met this goal in 1982. Although the service is required to break even during any three-year period, it has consistently lost money in the last few years. Its market promotions have included the Elvis Presley stamp, which is part of a series that will feature pop music stars. The Postal Service is a sponsor of the Olympic Games, which has brought the agency a substantial amount of revenue, from special-delivery and parcel-post services, that might otherwise have gone to private delivery companies. Olympic-theme stamps alone are expected to generate $35 million.

449-> Engineer for Clinton; Man Behind the Man on the Podium
Whom, Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader, was asked recently, would he call to get someone a job in Washington if Gov. Bill Clinton wins? "From my standpoint," Mr. Manton replied, "I'd start with Harold Ickes." Mr. Ickes says he harbors no ambitions to be a patronage dispenser, particularly after last week. Between cease-fire negotiations with Edmund G. Brown Jr., he spent an inordinate amount of time juggling guest passes to get the prominent and self-important inside Madison Square Garden for the Democratic National Convention. He had no trouble getting inside the Garden himself, though. Mr. Ickes managed the convention for Mr. Clinton after engineering his pivotal New York primary victory in April. But a week ago, as dignitaries crammed the podium where Mr. Ickes had effectively maneuvered for days as a political strategist and parliamentarian, he left to view the convention's finale inconspicuously from the floor. The next morning, Mr. Clinton publicly thanked only three people at a post-convention session: Ronald H. Brown, the party chairman; Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Ickes, whom the candidate described as "one person without whom I might not be here." Harold M. Ickes, a 52-year-old New York lawyer, has emerged, more than anyone, as Mr. Clinton's man in New York. It has been a striking transformation for a modest, consummate outsider still unaccustomed to winning. Four years ago, Mr. Ickes represented the Rev. Jesse Jackson in platform and procedural negotiations. Just before the convention then, Mr. Ickes and Tad Devine, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's designee, were touring the Omni in Atlanta when Mr. Ickes excused himself to make a telephone call. He made sure that he would be overheard in what was, in fact, a one-sided phone conversation: he pretended to be ordering 1,500 whistles to capture the attention of the convention chairman in case the Jackson force's parliamentary motions were overlooked. The ploy worked and the Jackson camp was heard, if less shrilly. A Rules Change? This year, Mr. Ickes was on the verge of forcing a rules change that would have made it easier to demand a roll-call on convention procedures when he was struck by a revelation: "If you have the nomination securely in hand, why give others the opportunity to create a fuss?" For a quarter-century, Mr. Ickes's mission has been to make a fuss. His candidates usually lost. But Mr. Ickes, a man whom Mr. Clinton said "never sleeps" and whose wispy hair is seemingly lofted by static electricity, survived. He scored the sort of tactical and moral victories that prompted Thomas E. Donilon, a Dukakis strategist, to describe him as "a nuclear weapon." In 1989, Mr. Ickes (pronounced like quickies) defied his record by serving as counsel to Mr. Dinkins's successful mayoral campaign. As Mr. Dinkins's negotiator, he fended off debate challenges until the last few days of the campaign to the consternation of Roger Ailes, who was advising the Republican candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Ailes denounced Mr. Ickes as "a lightweight, lying, left-wing weenie." (Mr. Ickes is a self-described West Side liberal, encapsulating his ideology and where he lives with his wife and 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte.) Beyond Disagreements Last year, responding to a call from Mr. Clinton, whom he had met 20 years ago in the antiwar movement, Mr. Ickes enlisted for the first time with a front-runner. In 1988, he had supported Mr. Jackson to make a point. This time, he signed on with Mr. Clinton, hoping to make a President. They profoundly disagree on several issues, including the candidate's support of the death penalty and of armed intervention against Iraq. But Mr. Ickes believed from the beginning that Mr. Clinton embodied two characteristics that appear to have become mutually exclusive in contemporary Presidential politics: he is a progressive who could get elected. "This has been deemed the most unified convention," said Laura Handman, Mr. Ickes's wife, "and the difference was that Harold was with the winning candidate." One measure of Mr. Ickes's growing stature in New York last week was that Ms. Handman, a successful civil liberties lawyer, began introducing herself at convention functions as Laura Handman Ickes -- a bow, she apologized, to the fate of political spouses who "are sort of nobody unless you're somehow connected." And who better to be connected to than Mr. Ickes, who was so plugged in that he intuitively figured weeks before that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would nominate Mr. Clinton and that Senator Al Gore would be the Vice-Presidential nominee. Now the Peacemaker Mr. Ickes spent last week heading off just the kind of disruptions he would have generated himself as an outsider (cowbells were the Brown camp's counterpart to Mr. Jackson's whistles). He largely submerged dissent and soothed egos -- rearranging the convention speaking schedule to accommodate legitimate claimants to their few moments in the spotlight, among them Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "There had been some indication from her staff that it would be useful to the candidacy, so I decided she ought to speak," Mr. Ickes said, adding slyly that "it's all done in a very self-effacing code." Ms. Handman helped, too. Representing the Democratic National Committee, she argued successfully against a suit filed by delegates who demanded that the convention consider a platform plank that opposed capital punishment. Party officials said the delegates lacked the signatures to get the plank to the floor. In his former role, Ms. Handman acknowledged, Mr. Ickes might have pursued the same legal strategy as the dissenting delegates, but with one distinction. "He would have gotten the right signatures," she said. Still a Sign of Caution Mr. Ickes now appears likely to play a national role in the Clinton campaign. But, as Sarah Kovner, another West Side Democrat who worked with Mr. Ickes in this and other campaigns, said, "He obviously is the key Clinton person in New York, and whether he's going to work in New York or not doesn't matter." Where he works after November is more speculative. "If you asked him whether he would go into government, he'd say no," Ms. Handman said, "but I hope that's not the case." If he goes to Washington, he would be emulating his father, Harold L. Ickes, whom Franklin D. Roosevelt recruited as Secretary of the Interior and emergency administrator of a public-works program to create jobs. Mr. Ickes does not flatly say no. But after toiling loyally for so many might-have-beens, he is characteristically cautious. "You have to win the general election first," he said.

452-> SIDELINES: TRAVELING IN CIRCLES; Spring Training Via the Daytona 500
BOB OJEDA and ROGER McDOWELL concede that they no longer feel awe for their fellow major league ball players, but they laughed at themselves feeling like awestruck fans at the Daytona 500 yesterday. "We saw RICHARD PETTY arrive," Ojeda said, with respect in his voice. "I was around DAVEY ALLISON's garage, and I know how we are when we're trying to prepare," McDowell said. "I didn't want to bother him, so when I was introduced, I just said, 'Nice to meet you.' " The two old friends, teammates on the 1986 World Series champion Mets, now reunited on the Los Angeles Dodgers, were driving together to spring training in Vero Beach and decided to stop at Daytona for the race. They arrived around dawn, without sleeping, and wandered around until they persuaded a friendly photographer to slip them into the crowded garage, where a few more visitors would never be noticed amid the sponsors and promoters and crew members. "I can't wait to see how fast they really go," Ojeda said. "You really can't tell how fast it is on television." The two pitchers, who open training Friday, said they might try to beat the traffic before the race was over, just like fans in Dodgers Stadium. Both were still disappointed the Dodgers could not hold their Western Division lead last season. And both said the Mets would be improved this season -- without GREGG JEFFERIES, they said, nearly in unison. Both resented the emphasis the Mets' front office had put on Jefferies since 1988. Ojeda seemed content to watch the race, perhaps from the pits area, but his more activist buddy had bigger plans. McDowell, who used to carry carpentry tools and give raging hotfoots to his Mets teammates, mused, "Maybe we'll get fireman suits and help out the pit crew." When last seen, he was chatting up the members of a tire crew.

453-> Newark Police Fatally Shoot 2 Teen-Agers
Two Newark teen-agers who had been riding in a stolen car were shot and killed shortly before dawn today, after one of them pointed a gun at an off-duty officer and his partner at a red light at a downtown intersection, the authorities said. One of the youths, identified as Barry Shelton, 18 years old, was shot at close range and killed as he stood outside the car pointing a stolen handgun toward the officers, the police said. The other youth, Michael Chapman, 16, was fatally shot as the two officers fired their service weapons as the car in which the two teen-agers and two other youths had been riding left the scene, according to a statement released this evening by Newark's police director, William R. Celester, and the acting Essex County Prosecutor, James F. Mulvihill. The two officers, Darrel White, 25, and Arnold Bell, 28, were both placed on administrative duty by Mr. Celester immediately after the shooting, but neither was accused of violating any department regulations. "The investigation at this time revealed no wrongdoing on the part of the officers in this incident," Mr. Celester said in the statement. Under New Jersey law, an officer can fire at a suspect only if he thinks his own life or someone else's is in danger. The incident today was the second in recent months in which police officers have been involved in violent confrontations with joyriding youths. In June, the Police Department suspended six Newark police officers without pay pending an investigation into the June 9 shooting of a 17-year-old, Howard Caesar, near West Side Park after he emerged from a stolen car. Three of the officers have been charged with conspiring to cover up their actions in the early morning confrontation that led to the shooting of Mr. Caesar, who was critically wounded. Mr. Caesar remains in University Hospital in Newark in satisfactory condition. It is still unclear which officer shot Mr. Caesar, but the bullet that wounded him was not fired by a 9-millimeter handgun, the standard-issue police weapon, but rather by a .45-caliber pistol. On Aug. 7, one of the six officers pleaded guilty to lying on a police report and agreed to testify before a special grand jury impaneled by the Essex County prosecutor to investigate the shooting. The mysterious circumstances surrounding the shooting have strained an already uneasy relationship between the Police Department and residents of the city. Mayor Sharpe James has angrily accused the officers of wrongdoing, prompting the New Jersey Attorney General to admonish him to stop so as not to disrupt the investigation. Today's fatal shootings occurred at about 4 A.M. as Officers White and Bell, both off-duty, were driving toward the police department's East District headquarters in Officer White's personal car, the joint statement said. The shootings took place at the intersection of Raymond Boulevard and McCarter Highway, about 100 yards west of Pennsylvania Station in downtown Newark. By day, it is one of the busiest intersections in the city, with the Seton Hall School of Law on one corner and an office tower on another. At the time of the shooting, however, the intersection would normally have been deserted. In Newark, which has one of the highest rates of auto theft in the nation, stealing cars for joyrides has become a youthful pastime, with teen-agers, mostly male, trying to prove their mettle by spinning the cars in tight circles, or "doughnuts." On August 13, Mayor Sharpe James announced 12 proposals to try to discourage the young thieves, including requiring compensation for damage and "boot camps" and house arrests for offenders. A taxi driver waiting outside Penn Station at the time of the shooting said that he heard five shots. "We knew right away it was gunshots," the cabby, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. "Someone ran over, a young guy, and yelled, 'Someone just got shot out here.' "

455-> CREDIT MARKETS; More Corporate Issues Are Offered
New corporate debt securities continued to stream into the credit markets yesterday, with more than $4.5 billion worth of new issues priced. The heavy volume came just a day after $2.5 billion worth of corporate bonds were priced, and prompted some traders and investment bankers to predict that $10 billion in new issues would be sold this week. If those estimates are realized, the total for the first week of 1992 would equal the amount of corporate bonds sold in all of January 1991. The surge in corporate issues came on the same day that the Treasury was auctioning $9.5 billion worth of new seven-year notes. The auction was the first in a series that will run through the middle of February. During this period, the Treasury is likely to auction some $60 billion worth of new notes and bonds, according to estimates from R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. At yesterday's auction, the new notes were sold at an average yield of 6.40 percent, down sharply from the average 7.20 percent yield at the previous seven-year auction, on Oct. 9. Mild Disappointment The note sale was a mild disappointment to traders, and prices of outstanding notes and bonds dipped slightly after the results were announced. But the declines were later reversed, partly because of a further big drop in oil prices. By the end of the day, most issues had eked out small gains. New-issue activity in investment-grade corporate bonds was highlighted by a three-part, $2 billion offering from the Tennessee Valley Authority, comprising $500 million each of 10-year and 7-year notes and $1 billion worth of 5-year securities. The 6 7/8 percent 10-year notes, which are noncallable for three years, were priced at $98.618 to yield 7.07 percent, 30 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The 6.50 percent seven-year notes were priced at $99.897 to yield 6.70 percent, 27 basis points over the when-issued yield on the new seven-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. These securities are noncallable for two years. And the 6 percent five-year notes were priced at $99.194, to yield 6.19 percent, 24 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing. Triple-A Rating Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Services and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The T.V.A. said that proceeds of the sale would be used to call $1.95 billion worth of bonds of various maturities. The Ford Motor Company, the other big corporate issuer yesterday, priced $700 million worth of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Bear, Stearns & Company. The 8 7/8 percent securities were priced at $99.625 to yield 8.911 percent, 1.53 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's. Because of strong demand, the size of the issue was increased from $500 million. The decline in interest rates over the last year is allowing corporations to cut interest expenses by refinancing higher-cost debt. The savings will help corporate balance sheets, but economists said the process would be very slow. Because of the drop in interest rates during the first three quarters of 1991, "corporations saved $5 billion in net interest expense," said Joseph Carson, an economist at Chemical Bank. "That number could easily triple this year," Mr. Carson added, "but at the end of the day it is what happens with corporate profits and overall economic activity" that determines a corporation's financial health. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 107 1/8, up 2/32 , to yield 7.38 percent, compared with 7.39 percent late Tuesday. Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10514/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 6.73 percent. The 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 10023/32 in late trading, up 2/32 , to yield 4.61 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates continued to fall. Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.70 percent, down 4 basis points. And six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.73 percent. The continued decline in short-term rates apparently reflects a widespread view among market participants that the Federal Reserve Board will decide to ease monetary policy again soon, perhaps immediately after the December employment report is released Friday. Activity in the municipal bond market was highlighted by a negotiated sale of $742.11 million worth of revenue bonds for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, including both serial and term bonds. Yields on the serial bonds range from 4.85 percent on securities maturing in 1996 to 6.20 percent on bonds that mature in 2006. A term bond maturing in 2012 was priced to yield 6.30 percent. And a term bond maturing in 2018 was priced to yield 6.35 percent. Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new seven-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.861 Average Yield . . . 6.40% Low Price . . . 99.805 High Yield . . . 6.41% High Price . . . 99.972 Low Yield . . . 6.38% Accepted at low price . . . 77% Total applied for . . . $18,314,640 Accepted . . . $9,506,705 N.Y. applied for . . . $16,992,145 N.Y. accepted . . . $9,032,725 Noncompetitive . . . $772,000 Interest set at . . . 6.375% The seven-year notes mature Jan. 15, 1999.

457-> Oil From Burning Offshore Well Threatens Louisiana's Coastline
Pollution from an oil well that has been burning out of control since last Thursday is threatening a section of South Louisiana's fragile coastline, just recently battered by Hurricane Andrew. The well burst into flames two days after it blew out as workers tried to renew production in a dormant well in Timbalier Bay, an estuary rich in fish and wildlife. About 80,000 gallons of oil have escaped since the blowout, but much of that has escaped in thick clouds of black smoke visible for about 8 miles. According to the United States Coast Coast today, the blaze is consuming 2,100 gallons of oil per hour while as many as 420 gallons are spewing into the bay every hour as the Greenhill Petroleum Corporation, the Texas-based company that owns the well, is trying to contain the damage and put out the fire. Barge Stuck on Wellhead Efforts to put out the fire have been slowed by the difficulty of moving a heavy work barge that is stuck on the wellhead. The company that is actually trying to extinguish the flames, Boots & Coots, which also helped put out oil well fires last year in Kuwait, cannot install firefighting equipment until the barge is moved. Meantime, attempts are being made to stop the fire from below the sea by drilling an 8,800-foot-deep well toward the base of the burning well. The second well is to be used to pump salt water into the burning well. "As of 6 a.m. today, we were drilling at 3,003 feet," said Mitch Ackal, a Greenhill spokesman. "The relief well should be finished in 10 days." "The urgency is to cap the well and control the flow," Mr. Ackal said. "This could flow for no one knows how long on its own." The slick is now 3 1/2 miles long, including a mile of light sheen, 2 miles of medium-weight oil and a half-mile of heavy oil. "There is so much debris in the way," said Chief Petty Officer Jeffrey Murphy, referring to the difficulties in responding to the accident. "There is nothing but a network of pipelines down there. It's not simple." The cause of the fire is unknown, the Coast Guard officer said. "It started small," he said, when a valve blew out while workers were trying to reactivate the well. "There was a leak and they were trying to cap it when somehow something sparked and it ignited." Pelican Rescued Nearly 200 oil-field workers and countless state and Federal fish and wildlife officials are combing the spill area to try to contain and clean up the spill, to try to rescue oil-drenched birds and to assess damage to fragile marshlands that border the Louisiana coast. By today, one oil-drenched bird, a pelican, had been rescued. Sightings of other damaged birds have been reported, but no other birds have been caught. Among the high-tech damage-control devices in use are noisemakers to scare the birds away from oily beaches. The oil is spilling into an area that not only serves as a highly productive nursery for fish but that also acts as a resting and nesting place for shore birds. Government officials have been unable to assess the damage because the oil is still moving, but "this spill is definitely having an impact on the natural environment in the area," said James Hanifen, a marine fisheries biologist who is coordinating the State Wildlife and Fisheries Department's response to the spill. "There is a possibility that some of the marsh will die back and not recover," Mr. Hanifen said. "The most sensitive part of the plant is the root system, and if the marsh surface is covered with oil, it can percolate down to the root system and kill the roots. Or it can keep air from moving through the sediment and suffocate the roots." The marshes, which nourish a variety of fish and wildlife, also buffer Louisiana during hurricanes, most recently Hurricane Andrew, which hit the Louisiana coast just west of this spill. "It is not a pristine area," said Mr. Hanifen, "but it's some of the most productive areas in the world for fisheries, and at the same time very productive for oil and gas, seemingly conflicting uses but both of them co-existing."

459-> OPEC Raises Oil Production
OPEC nations increased oil output in September to the highest monthly level in a decade. According to estimates released on Tuesday by the Paris-based International Energy Agency, the 13-nation group pumped 24.7 million barrels a day of crude last month, about 200,000 barrels more a day than the agency's revised 24.5-million-barrel figure for August. One industry analyst said output had exceeded any monthly figure this year and was the highest since 1981. Since last March, monthly output has been below 24.4 million barrels a day. September's production gave the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries its highest quarterly average -- 24.4 million barrels a day -- in 11 years. The analyst predicted an average daily output of some 24 million barrels for 1992, saying that was the highest annual level since 1980.

461-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Heating Oil and Gas Climb On Cold-Winter Speculation
Heating oil and natural gas futures prices rose sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid speculation that this winter would be the coldest in several years. On other commodity markets, precious metals fell, and grains and soybeans retreated while livestock and meat futures were mostly higher. Natural gas for November delivery soared 10.6 cents, to $2.432 for 1,000 cubic feet, extending Wednesday's 17.5-cent gain. November deliveries of home heating oil jumped 0.85 cent, to 65.49 cents a gallon. In other energy trading, November light sweet crude oil rose 25 cents, to $22.33 a barrel, and November unleaded gasoline rose 0.76 cent, to 59.86 cents a gallon. A three-week slide in natural gas prices halted Wednesday on forecasts for an unusually cold weekend in the Midwest, where natural gas is widely used to heat homes. The November delivery price has soared more than 13 percent since trading opened Wednesday morning. Temperatures are not expected to fall as far in the Northeast, where heating oil is the fuel of choice, but more traders are betting that this year's cool summer will be followed by a harsh winter. A National Weather Service 30-day forecast issued late Wednesday predicted below-normal temperatures in the central through the northeastern United States through the middle of November. After mild winters the last two years and in seven of the last 10 years, the market sees good odds of at least normal temperatures in the coming cold season, said David Pruner, president of KCS Energy Risk Management Inc. in Edison, N.J. Also contributing to the gain in oil prices was Wednesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute stocks report, which showed a smaller-than-expected rise in United States crude stocks. Gold and silver futures fell for the fourth straight day on the Commodity Exchange in New York on selling from Europe, where investors bought precious metals last month as protection against chaos in the foreign exchange market. October gold fell $1.80, to $341 a troy ounce, and December silver fell 0.5 cent, to $3.702 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures posted moderate losses on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Government rejected a Russian bid for wheat. A Government offer to subsidize vegetable oil exports to 11 countries was widely expected and had no supportive effect on soybean or soybean oil prices. Cattle futures firmed in quiet trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on expectations for continued strength in cash cattle prices. Hog futures ended narrowly mixed on signs of increased movement of animals from farm to slaughterhouse.

462-> THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Real Estate; Developers Are Cheered by Talk of New Tax Rules That Would Offset Income With Losses
Throughout the real estate industry hopes rose this week that Congress would adopt a tax change proposed by President Bush that would aid real estate investment companies and improve market conditions generally. The Administration's proposal would allow taxpayers active in the real estate business to offset taxable income with losses sustained in operating rental property they developed. The losses include depreciation as well as cash operating losses. One Executive's View "This would help people who are in trouble, who are on the verge of foreclosure," said Stephen Driesler, senior vice president of the National Association of Realtors in Washington. "If someone is hanging on, this may be all the equity the owner has in the property." Michael J. Gregoire, chairman of the Homart Development Company, the shopping center development affiliate of Coldwell Banker Real Estate, also spoke of the benefits. "It would serve to stabilize real estate values and improve liquidity," he said. California Perspective The inability to deduct losses from commercial or residential rentals from other real estate income has been a bone in the throat of real estate development companies since the passage of the 1986 tax act. Congressional fervor to prevent passive investors like doctors and dentists from lowering their taxes by deducting real estate losses harmed the whole industry, many executives said. One result has been that real estate companies have been less able to bid for foreclosed property and property owned by the Resolution Trust Corporation. They have also found it harder to hold on to losing investments while waiting for a turnaround. In Southern California, Duncan Matteson, president of the Matteson Investment Corporation in Menlo Park, said there was a "great oversupply" of rental housing in southern Orange County, northern San Diego and the Riverside-San Bernardino area. "We can't raise rents; expenses keep going up," he said. The inability to use losses to offset taxes on profitable operations makes it harder for his company and others to take on the challenge of properties the Resolution Trust Corporation is trying to market, he said. By making real estate more attractive, industry experts say, the Administration proposal would raise property values. According to the National Real Estate Organizations, an umbrella group for 12 real estate trade associations in Washington, the change in tax law would raise commercial real estate values by 3 to 7 percent.

464-> The Talk of Seville; In Expo Architecture, Mishmash Means Eclectic
Imre Makovecz's Hungarian pavilion, widely regarded as the most inventive structure at Expo '92 here, soars free from the fair's architectural cacophony like some dizzy fantasy. Built from wood carved in folk styles and bearing a gray slate roof, it seems inspired by village churches but leaps beyond any one model with an exuberance that recalls the Catalan Antonio Gaudi. Inside, the building's conceptual basis becomes clearer, with no loss of wit and style. The interior is divided, one portion symbolizing Hungary facing the West, with a simplified Baroque church front. Pass through that facade and one finds Hungary facing East, the wall exploding with undulating Slavic-style facades (more gray slate) and carved portals. There is also a "Tree of Life" on the Western side, a jumble of roots and branches with a glass floor so that visitors can see the whole thing. The 22-minute tour is reinforced with pungent Hungarian folk music and vivid lighting and, on the Eastern side, a film and video show of the sort inescapable at this latest and most high-tech of international expositions. Inevitable Diversity Ever since the first universal exposition in 1851 at the Crystal Palace in London, these fairs have been conceived as forums for technological achievement and advertisements for a utopian future. That most definitely includes architecture, and so the most ambitious world's fairs have always been intended as showcases for innovative buildings, landscaping and urban planning. One trouble, however, is that with individual countries contributing their own pavilion designs, even the most stringent of guidelines cannot prevent a stylistic mishmash. In the age of high modernism, such jangling discrepancies contradicted the cool formalism on which modernist style was predicated. Today's eclectic, post-modernist age means lots of junky ornamental froufrou, spangles and neon appliqued across what may be an utterly conventional neo-modernist box. If a country has tried to pinch its pennies, the result can be pretty mingy -- most embarrassingly for an American visitor, the United States pavilion and its decades-old geodesic domes. But post-modernism can also mean wit and play and invention. And the stylistic diversity often contained within a single post-modernist structure makes the heterogeneity of a world's fair look like deliberate architectural principle. "Diversity makes its own statement," said Gines Aparicio Soto, Expo's director general of projects and construction, in an interview. "We had some restrictions, but it is very difficult to put limits on creativity, especially in a time in which we have no single international style of architecture." The High-Tech Prize Mr. Aparicio noted that the buildings at Expo, which opened on April 20, tended to be international or national. "I think the style that dominates is high-tech," he said, citing Nicholas Grimshaw's British pavilion. Expo organizers specified that fountains, pools and water walls proliferate to combat the southern Spanish heat both literally and psychologically. Mr. Grimshaw's building, itself a fairly anonymous (if ecologically sophisticated) high-tech construction, is graced with a particularly large, refreshing water wall by William Pye. The prize for space-age architectural exotica, however, goes to Jean-Paul Viguier's French pavilion. At first it looks like a simple plaza with embedded lights, a floating, cooling roof and a single mirrored side wall several stories high. But there are secrets: the mirrored wall contains an exhibition highlighted by an ingenious scale model of separated sections of Paris. This is first seen beneath a glass floor, with a vertiginous effect of peering down through different parts of Paris at different distances. It turns out the model consists of one part facing upward and, stuck to its back, another part facing downward. The downward-facing part is reflected up by a mirror, creating the layered effect. There is more: underneath the plaza is a mysterious pit, again done with mirrors. In it a film about the cosmos is projected, with eerie images in the darkened room doubled and redoubled. Visitors view the film either from the sides of the pit or from a moving walkway above it. Although all the pavilions avail themselves of modern technology and practicality (gift shops and restaurants abound), some deliberately evoke traditional folk styles. Denmark, Norway and Finland are especially pleasing in this regard: elegant, simple buildings that speak clearly of their provenances. Tadao Ando's Japanese pavilion, billed as the world's largest wooden structure, has attracted attention, though its sheer size can seem overbearing. Mr. Aparicio's favorite is the Moroccan pavilion, a gift from King Hassan II of Morocco to King Juan Carlos of Spain. It is intended to remain on the site, like 30 percent of all Expo structures, after the fair closes on Oct. 12 and was thus built with a greater richness of materials than some of the more overtly ephemeral constructs. The pavilion, designed by Michel Pinseau of France, blends ornate Moorish filigree, sweeping arches and chiseled stone pools with simple glass walls to enchanting effect. There is also an extensive formal garden. Mr. Aparicio said that given the rapid shifts in the political life of Eastern Europe, the intentions and the designs of some pavilions from that part of the world had been altered. Even Hungary's design was changed in mid-planning. "It was originally supposed to be a glass box with live butterflies in it," Mr. Aparicio said. Unifying Theme: Comfort As striking as many of the national pavilions may be, it is the overall layout and the attention to visitors' comforts that seems almost more impressive. Many of the Expo buildings (as opposed to the national pavilions) are distinctive, especially the cockeyed tentlike roof of Jose Miguel de la Prada Poole's Palenque, a breezy entertainment venue, or Gerardo Ayala's simply handsome Teatro Central, devoted to avant-garde events. The most appealing exploitation of the water theme is an undulating wall by the New York team of architects known as SITE. Its cascade effect, as in all the water walls, is obtained by a tiny angling, causing the falling water to gather in rippling sheets. Mr. Aparicio is by training a civil engineer, and his deepest interest in the Expo constructions is their utility for Seville after October, post-Expo. In the long run, aside from the extra tourist income and national pride Expo is providing, its legacy will be a radical transformation of this lovely town into an international mecca. Cartuja Island, where Expo is situated, was until recently a flood plain for the Guadalquivir River. Now the river has been controlled upstream and opened up near Seville, where it had been blocked and stagnant. Riverside train tracks have been replaced by a combination esplanade and flood wall, soaring new bridges span the river and a ring of highways circles the city. There are 19 new hotels, whole new suburbs and an elegant high-speed train to Madrid. All of Seville's social problems have hardly been solved. Perhaps the development, instead of energizing the local economy, will merely subvert Seville's charm. But right now, late night in old Seville still finds balmy, orange-scented evening air, narrow streets, broad boulevards, bubbling fountains, strumming guitarists, stylish youths zipping by on roller skates and, everywhere, loving couples. If Seville can sustain this balance of new and old, international and regional, buoyant display and timeless beauty, Expo will have made its most important mark of all.

465-> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL; A Welcome Home on the Bench
Maybe tomorrow afternoon Coach Jerry Moore will fire a finger at Richie Diaz and send the 16-year-old father plunging onto the field against Irvington in his first varsity appearance. Richie wants to play so badly that he can barely talk about it, and 15-year-old Chris Diaz wants to be next and 9-year-old Joey Diaz knows that once his brothers make it he will become even more famous in the insulated world of Elizabeth High School football. Only their mother, Miriam Montoya, will have mixed feelings. "Football is helpful," she said carefully, "because your mind works better. You don't think so much of bad stuff. But it scares me. It's a dangerous game." But here at the largest high school in New Jersey, where all 4,300 students are "at risk," according to Thomas G. Dunn Jr., the superintendent of schools, merely because they live in the tough port city, football may actually provide a measure of safety. At least, that's what the football coach thinks. "Whether Richie and Chris ever get in a game or not," said Moore, "just being with this program will help them. They will learn right from wrong, good from bad, they will experience defeat and come back again and again. Football is everyday life." Coach Moore has fielded winning teams in each of his last seven years at Elizabeth, and this season's record, 2-1, does not reflect the potential of a team led by a 14-year-old freshman quarterback, Al Hawkins, whose poise and missile-launcher arm, said Moore, "blow my mind." But before he is a coach, Moore fancies himself psychologist, social worker and father figure. So when Miriam Montoya showed up last month to pull her older sons from the 295-player program to care for Joey, Moore sat them down to tell their story. Chris remembers squirming with embarrassment as his mother told the coach how she had come from Honduras 18 years ago, how she now worked from 9 to 5 as a secretary in the investments department of the Newark Archdiocese. She does not get home in time to pick up Joey from the fourth grade, and she does not want him coming home alone. Despite some support from the boys' father, an Elizabeth firefighter, she cannot afford a baby sitter. "I can help these kids," Moore told her, "maybe more than you can. And down the road they can help us. Leave your boys with me. All of them." So Richie, a 5-foot-6-inch, 140-pound junior wide receiver and defensive back joined the junior varsity, and Chris, a 5-6, 140-pound sophomore tailback and defensive back, joined the sophomore squad. Joey, whose stats include a sunrise smile and a Jay Leno voice, joined the coach. He does homework in the field house, drinks the coach's sodas and sneaks up behind players loafing at their lockers and booms, in the coach's voice, "Why aren't you OUT THERE!" Players jump, whirl around, see nothing at eye level and race OUT THERE. "He's something," Moore said with a grin. "And his brothers are tough kids, good attitude, good hustle. I'm glad they're so hungry to play. But it's only their first year, and you've got to work your way up the depth chart. That's real life. Prove yourself." Neither Richie nor Chris came close to getting into Elizabeth's first two games, and then Chris fractured his left pinkie in a sophomore game. And so, last Friday night, when Elizabeth played Kearny under a damp sky, Chris was sitting in the stands between a girlfriend and his mom, with Joey at their feet. Down on a sideline, Richie hopped from foot to foot on a chorus line of 60 Minutemen, many of whom would never get their red uniforms dirty. But by halftime, with Elizabeth leading, 24-0, it looked as if it might be the subs' night out after all. Chris and Joey shouted for Richie, and Miriam Montoya fidgeted. "They're very good boys," she said. "Football is a good thing for them, I just wish it wasn't so dangerous. Chris failed science and health and gym last year, and now he's doing better because of football. Even Joey isn't watching so much cartoons." Suddenly, she turned on the pretty girl next to Chris. "How old are you?" "Fourteen." "You got too much makeup on." "That's what I tell her," Chris said, laughing. Miriam Montoya was not amused. She lowered her voice. "When Richie was 14, he got a girl pregnant. She was 13. It was an accident. They're good kids. She's in a Catholic school now, Richie doesn't see his son very much. I thought it was the end of my family; I had to go into family therapy." The rain came in the second half. Elizabeth's exuberant cheerleaders raised umbrellas, and the Minutemen scored only 14 more points, Moore's excuse for not bringing in the subs. Miriam Montoya looked relieved. "Such a dangerous game," she said. "But Coach Moore is like a father to them, they go to him for advice, tell him things they wouldn't tell me." Richie looked sour as the team trotted back to the fieldhouse, past Chris, who looked disappointed, and Joey, who winked at Moore, who had to laugh. Joey entwined an index and middle finger. "Me and the coach are like this," he said. "Next year, I'm going to be the mascot. This season, I'm just the little friend."

466-> Christmas Tree's Fate: Helping Life as Mulch
Tossing out old Christmas trees on garbage day is a waste of potentially rich, fragrant mulch for the garden. For the last three years, the New York City Department of Sanitation has chipped Christmas trees, but lack of funds canceled this year's program. The Green Guerillas, a nonprofit group that helps urban gardeners, is helping to fill the void. "We're trying to help local groups recycle their own trees, which saves transportation and trucking, and puts nutrients right back into the soil," said Barbara Earnest, the executive director. "Last year, we delivered 60 huge truckloads to gardens all over the city. But this year, we're trying to find a local way to do it." City soil tends to be alkaline, due to its proximity to brick, rubble and mortar. "So the combination of wood and needles, which is an acidic mulch, can help balance the existing soil," Ms. Earnest said. Trees can be taken to one of the sites listed below between 10:30 A.M. and 3:30 P.M. You can either take the mulch home or donate it to the garden where it is chipped. (The tree at Rockefeller Center, by the way, is chipped in New Jersey and used to mulch paths at a Boy Scout camp. One year, according to David Murbach, manager of the gardens at Rockefeller Center, it was used as a mast on a sailing ship.) TODAY Tremont, the Bronx: Rancho Borecua Garden, East 178th Street and Monterey Avenue. SATURDAY Lower East Side: El Jardin del Paraiso, East Fourth Street between Avenues C and D.

467-> Making a Difference; Saving Wang, a Challenge Even for Superman
Richard W. Miller's track record over the years as a turnaround artist has been impressive, but he may have met his match, judging by last week's bankruptcy filing by Wang Laboratories. Before joining Wang in 1989, he played major roles in putting the Penn Central Corporation and RCA's consumer electronics division back on their feet. In fact, when General Electric acquired RCA in 1986, Mr. Miller successfully managed the merging and restructuring of the combined G.E. and RCA consumer electronics division. But when Mr. Miller went to Wang, which is based in Lowell, Mass., he found himself with the daunting task of steering a $2.8 billion computer giant with rapidly declining revenues, rising costs that seemed out of control and huge debt. When the company's founder and chairman, An Wang, died of cancer in March 1990, Mr. Miller became chairman and chief executive. He had already begun to slash away at Wang's $1.1 billion debt, laying off thousands of employees, closing plants and selling off assets. Indeed, for a while Mr. Miller's performance at Wang seemed golden as he reduced the employee head count to 13,000, from 28,500, and stabilized the revenue freefall. That was then. Now, after his efforts to raise desperately needed capital met with little success -- and after "three years of living on the edge," in Mr. Miller's words -- Wang filed for bankruptcy protection. Adding insult to injury, some analysts say that maybe Mr. Miller was the wrong person in the wrong place. Without computer industry experience, Mr. Miller, a 51-year-old Harvard Business School graduate, made strategic moves that analysts question. Most notably was a deal he struck with I.B.M. in June 1991 to resell I.B.M.'s RS6000 RISC work stations and its AS/400 minicomputers in return for a quick $25 million in cash. Analysts applauded the decision to sell the RS6000 but the inclusion of the AS/400, a direct competitor to Wang's VS minicomputers, raised eyebrows. Mr. Miller contends that Wang customers were a "dead base" who were not buying the VS anyway, and that Wang stood to gain revenues by moving customers to the AS/400. A former Wang salesman said: "The truth is that Miller, even if he was Clark Kent, couldn't have turned things around. They were too far gone when he got here." Mr. Miller said he intends to "finish the job he came to do." He noted that Wang's board passed a resolution on Monday -- the day before the company filed for bankruptcy -- stressing support for the current management team.

468-> Correction
An article on Jan. 19 about the return of diseases once thought to have been eliminated misstated the incidence of diphtheria in the United States and of strep throat in New York City. No increase in diphtheria has been recorded in the last 10 years in the United States, and no documented increase in strep throat in New York City in recent years.

469-> Consumers' Borrowing Restrained
Consumers kept a tight rein on their use of credit in November, the Federal Reserve Board said today, paying off more in car and bank loans than they took out. As a result, outstanding credit balances expanded by a slight $27 million after revised growth of $1.67 billion in October and $43 million in September. Originally, the Fed said October consumer credit expanded by $802 million. Consumer reluctance to borrow and spend in the face of high unemployment is considered a key factor in the economy's difficulty in struggling out of recession. Purchases of goods and services by consumers fuels about two-thirds of economic activity, so a spending slowdown quickly leads to production cuts. The most obvious area of continuing slack credit demand was in loans for new cars, which fell in November by $952 million after contracting by $211 million in October and $1.68 billion in September. Consumers paid off more in car loans than they took out in each of the first 11 months of 1991 as car dealers rang up their poorest sales year since 1983. Credit charged on credit cards expanded in November by $1.01 billion, lower than the increases of $1.59 billion registered in October and $2.62 billion in September. Other credit, including bank loans but not home mortgages, was cut back by $160 million in November after growing by $235 million in October but shrinking by $288 million in September. Credit for the purchase of mobile homes grew in November by $125 million after a $51 million increase in October. This category was down by $603 million in September, the Fed said. At the end of November, consumers owed a total of $733 billion.

470-> Panel to Study Aerial Photos for Hints on P.O.W.'s
A Senate committee investigating the fate of Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War has turned its attention to reports that satellite photography may have picked up messages from prisoners as late as 1988. The panel, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, plans to hold hearings on this issue on Oct. 15 and 16 but has not decided how much will be public, Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the committee chairman, said in an interview on Tuesday. The committee has been holding closed intelligence briefings on the issue, and many once-classified Government documents have been made public. "There are some people saying these should be closed," Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said of the hearings next week. "My general approach to government is: If in doubt, have it out in the open." Many officials are reluctant to risk discussion of intelligence-gathering methods in public. The photographs under investigation, analyzed in newly released Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency documents, seemed to show letters or symbols marked on the ground or incorporated in building markings. The signs appear to match those that service personnel were told to use to identify their locations in captivity. Some analysts concede the possibility that the symbols could be military code, but say they have no evidence that Americans created them. Vietnam has insisted since 1973 that all American prisoners of war, including those in Laos, were returned that year. The two most compelling cases of apparent messages involve markings spotted on the roof of the Dong Mang prison camp, near Cam Pha in northern Vietnam, in May 1976, and the letters "USA" and possibly "K" -- an assigned code -- seen on a ricefield near Sam Neua, Laos, in 1988. The C.I.A. analyzed the Dong Mang report in July 1976 and concluded, "We were unable to find any conclusive evidence that this prison might contain American P.O.W.'s." Photographs apparently showed a pattern worked into roof coverings during repair work. One of the symbols appeared to be "K" in Morse code; others, less clear, may have read "NT" and "TA." Analysts have not explained what those letters might mean. In the Laotian ricefield, a January 1988 photo picked up "USA" in 11-foot-tall letters over an area where it had not been the previous autumn and would not be the following spring. The "K" seemed an older marking. "Paddies in this area are generally harvested in October or November and are allowed to remain fallow until planting season in February or March," a Government report said in December 1988. "It is likely that the symbol was made after the 1987 harvest, but before the paddy was replowed and flooded for the 1988 planting." Missing Americans were known to have disappeared in the area. But American-backed anti-Government Laotians also operated there, and United States officials in Southeast Asia suspect that the letters could have been dug into the ground by the rebels, some of whom have close ties with Americans who have been active in the P.O.W.-M.I.A issue. Some of those Americans are veterans who may have known the location codes, leading some analysts to say that both the Americans and the rebels might want to embarrass the Communist Government of Laos and publicize the issue in the United States. Today, the committee released closed-door testimony given on July 1 by Ross Perot, the Texas businessman and candidate for President. A large part related to his trips to Vietnam and Laos in 1969 and 1970. Mr. Perot told the committee counsel that on several occasions between 1969 and 1987, he had discussed possible trades of money or equipment for prisoners. Once, in 1970, Mr. Perot said, the North Vietnamese Ambassador in Laos offered to release prisoners in return for medical equipment. Mr. Perot also said in July and in public testimony in August that he had met several times with a Communist Pathet Lao official who, he said, acknowledged holding prisoners.

471-> CHRONICLE
One way to take the temperature of the times is to chart the career of ADRIANA MNUCHIN. In the 1970's, she established the store Tennis Lady, which became a chain of 21 tennis-fashion stores in the United States and Canada. In the 1980's, she established Cashmere-Cashmere, a group of four stores that sell cashmere designs. In March, she and her husband, ROBERT MNUCHIN, will open an inn in Washington, Conn. "I have always tried to do something that speaks to its time," Mrs. Mnuchin said yesterday from Tecate, Mexico. "In the 1970's, tennis was coming of age, it was shown on color TV, more women were getting into it. In the 1980's I started Cashmere-Cashmere because I thought those were the cashmere years, and I sold the business when I perceived that was over." Is there something prescient about Mrs. Mnuchin? Take note. In the summer of 1990, she and her husband, who stepped down as managing partner in Goldman, Sachs & Company to become a limited partner -- another sign of the times -- bought the Mayflower Inn. "We tried to look into our crystal balls and decided that in the 90's people would go back to traditional values, to comfort surroundings, to comfort food," Mrs. Mnuchin said. "We wanted to look backward and bring good values," They have renovated the inn and furnished it with 19th-century English and American antiques. There will be a number of landscaped gardens and a fitness club, too. "You have to have that to say hello to the 90's," she said. "But if you had to describe the style, it's somewhere between Ralph Lauren and J. Crew elegance. What this says is that people are looking less at power and money and more for what is real in life. We all want more romance, and we want to go back to mother's kitchen."

472-> It's Finally Agreed: Germany to Regain A Stolen Trove
After a year and a half of wrangling, representatives of the German Government and the heirs of Joe T. Meador, an American Army officer who stole a nearly priceless collection of medieval treasures from a mineshaft outside of Quedlinburg in the final days of World War II, completed an agreement yesterday to return the artworks to Germany. First, however, the glittering, thousand-year-old treasures -- which Klaus Maurice, the chief German negotiator, called "one of the most important collections of religious art of the early Middle Ages" -- will be displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art for seven or eight weeks beginning March 7. Officials of the museum had agreed to store the artworks during the legal battle in exchange for the right to exhibit them when a settlement was reached. After the exhibition in Dallas, the treasures are to be shipped to Berlin for conservation at the Fine Arts Museum of the Foundation for Prussian Cultural Heritage. They will be exhibited there in the late summer. Afterward, the artworks will be returned to the small Lutheran church, formally called the Stiftskirche Domgemeinde Quedlinburg, where many of them had been kept in a Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, for centuries. A Suitable Resting Place The Rev. Friedemann Goszlau, the minister of the Stiftskirche, said in a telephone interview last week that the Bonn Government was spending about $1.5 million to make the church's Schatzkammer a modern three-gallery exhibition complex for the display of the treasures beginning in 1993. The terms of the settlement, reached after months of sparring in and out of Federal District Court in Dallas, fine tune the oral agreement made at a meeting in London a year ago. They include the payment by the German Government of $912,500 to Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the brother and sister of Joe T. Meador, who died in 1980. In exchange, the Meadors relinquish all claim to ownership of the treasures. This payment increases their total gain from selling the treasures to the Germans to $2.75 million, a sum that has shocked the art world since the Meadors admitted in court that their brother "inappropriately removed" the treasures from Germany. Another controversial part of the settlement is that three separate departments of the German Government have supplied the Meadors with "To Whom It May Concern" letters that may be sent to appropriate agencies of the United States Government informing them that the matter has been resolved amicably, and that the Germans do not want the United States Government to take any action against the Meadors. 2 Countries' Laws These letters, absolving the Meadors of wrongdoing, are not referred to in the written agreement, however. The reason, according to a participant who spoke on condition that his name would not be used, is that the Meadors feared they might be accused of forcing the silence of complaining witnesses. Asked about this, Randal Mathis, the Meador family's lawyer, said, "Everyone on both sides worked hard to make certain that the settlement did not violate any German or American law, whether civil or criminal." Mr. Mathis acknowledged his expectation that the letters from the German Government would help the Meadors in their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice. Last January, the tax agency made public its ruling that the Meador siblings were wrong not to have filed an estate-tax return when they inherited the treasures. Henry Holmes, a spokesman for the I.R.S., said that the agency was now determining the value of the treasures as of 1980 when Joe T. Meador died, and would levy a tax on that basis. Some critics of the settlement have said it would be inappropriate for the German Government to attempt to influence law enforcement in the United States. A lawyer involved in the case who spoke only after being assured anonymity, said the agreement on this point had been worded artfully. "The German Government has a right to ask the United States Government to prosecute a lawbreaker," he said, "but what they're saying in this case is that they don't insist on it. They believe they can go that far without offending international doctrine, whether by treaty or general practice." After a monthslong investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice is now deciding whether to prosecute the Meadors for possession of stolen property or transporting it across state or international borders, said a member of the investigating team who spoke on condition that his name not be used. "A lot of things can affect a decision to prosecute," the Justice Department official said. "These are elderly people, hometown people. It's not as if they were a couple of yuppies who would get much less sympathy, especially down here." The German Government has been negotiating with the Meador family for the return of the Quedlinburg treasures since the summer of 1990. When the Meadors threatened to move the treasures out of the country, the lawyers for the German Government filed suit in Federal District Court. The settlement came about, said Mr. Mathis and Thomas Kline, the chief of the team of American lawyers who represented the German Government, because the Germans recognized that although their case was strong the outcome of a jury trial in Texas would be uncertain. Swayed by Old Angers A source within the German team said the German Government feared that a jury verdict might be influenced by smoldering resentments from World War II. For that reason, also, the source said, the Germans will not vigorously press the Meadors to assist them in tracking down two relatively minor items from the treasure believed to have been stolen from Joe T. Meador toward the end of his life. It is thought the items may still be in Texas. The Dallas Museum of Art has also been criticized for its involvement in the case. Richard Brettell, the director of the museum, acknowledged having remarked some months ago that if the museum could have an exhibition like the Quedlinburg show once a year he "wouldn't have to worry about this year's projected deficit." But Mr. Brettell said he was "sick of being told the museum's role in this was money grubbing." "Our interest was to preserve the art in a neutral place during the trial, and we are now pleased to present the treasures because they are important works of art," he said. The treasures have not been seen publicly since the early days of World War II when the Nazi Government stored them in a bank vault and later moved them to the mineshaft outside of Quedlinburg, in central Germany. They include the gold, silver and jewel-emblazoned biblical manuscript from the ninth century called the Samuhel Gospels; a similarly decorated manuscript dated 1513; a lavishly decorated box for religious relics which is said to have belonged to Heinrich I, the 10th-century ruler of an early configuration of German states; a liturgical comb dating to the seventh or eighth century; five reliquaries of cut rock crystal dating to the 10th century, and a heart-shaped vessel believed to have been fashioned in the 15th century. Bible Is Staying Home The Samuhel Gospels, which a German expert has described as being as valuable as a van Gogh painting, is now undergoing conservation in Berlin and will not be returned for exhibition. Dr. Charles T. Little, the curator of medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art who studied the treasures at the Dallas Museum last year and advised the museum in the preparation of its catalogue, said that the rock crystal flask in the form of two birds is "one of the finest pieces of its kind; this transparent crystal was unknown in Europe and seemed quite marvelous to the early Germans." "The liturgical comb is also very important," Dr. Little continued. "It was probably a personal affect of Heinrich I, and is one of the earliest Islamic ivory carvings in existence, dating to the eighth century. It has balance, elegance and a great curvilinear shape that is quite sumptuous."

473-> The Rule of Law
To the Editor: Henry Siegman (letter, March 5) acknowledges that my summary of the legal status of the West Bank "makes sense," yet maintains that "legal arguments are largely irrelevant to the political realities that Israel and the Israelis face" and that "the legal status of the territories could not be more beside the point." If individuals or nations should arbitrarily decide that the rule of law is not applicable to conflicting claims, where are we, and what have we got to work with? The answer can only be unrestrained human ferocity, abetted by axes, knives, pitchforks, Scuds. Woe to the soul professing the moral life -- or to the soul of a nation -- that finds the rule of law irrelevant or beside the point. CYNTHIA OZICK New Rochelle, N.Y., March 5, 1992

474-> FOOTBALL; Today, a Big Game. Next Year, the Big Ten.
In many ways, Penn State's 1992 football campaign will begin Saturday afternoon. Although the unbeaten Nittany Lions have victories over Cincinnati, Temple and Eastern Michigan, the game against Maryland (0-3) at Beaver Stadium marks the first test for a team of uncertain potential. The projected starting quarterback, Kerry Collins, broke a finger playing volleyball just before the start of preseason practice. His replacement, John Sacca, bruised his shoulder during Penn State's 24-20 victory over Cincinnati. Their replacement, freshman Wally Richardson, led Penn State to a 49-8 romp over Temple. Then it was Sacca's turn, as he returned to spark the Nittany Lions to a 52-7 victory over Eastern Michigan. "I don't have a good sense of where we are as a team yet," said Richie Anderson, a senior tailback. "I didn't learn much from the three games we had. Hopefully, we'll be tested against Maryland." A Bittersweet Feeling Beyond the games, however, this is in some ways a bittersweet season for Penn State. It is the last year that the Nittany Lions will compete as an independent. Three seasons ago, Penn State sent shock waves through college football by announcing that effective in 1993, the university would join the Big Ten conference. The move created a domino effect, sending other schools scrambling to form alliances and television deals. The most profound change for Penn State has taken place within the university itself, where alumni, players and fans must bid farewell to a long, proud tradition. "If I had a vote, I would have stayed an independent," said O. J. McDuffie, a standout wide receiver. "I enjoyed playing an independent schedule, playing who you want, traveling the country. It's different from this conference stuff, when you play the same old schools every year." Joe Paterno did not hold an election and did not take a poll. At the risk of provoking what he thinks will be the short-term ire of alumni, players and fans, the head coach, who is now 65, and Bryce Jordan, who was then the university's president, looked at the changing terrain of college football and made a concession to economic realities. Tradition and autonomy were sacrificed for the security of conference play. "I know a lot of people don't like the idea of it," Paterno said. "There are guys out there who are used to Penn State playing Pitt every year and West Virginia, Syracuse and those kinds of games. Once they get used to a Michigan-Penn State game and a Penn State-Ohio State game as big games, it'll be a good thing. I don't know if it's the best thing for Penn State football because as an independent we had our own way about a lot of things. "But when you look at the big picture -- unless we just blow it and are not competitive in basketball, are not competitive in wrestling and football -- this should be a very positive thing for all our sports, men and women." Plenty of Negative Publicity The emotion of a final independent campaign and the virtual assurance of a bowl bid -- the Nittany Lions have already been invited to the Blockbuster Bowl as long as they achieve a winning record -- have been intensified by a rare flurry of negative publicity that some of the players think has changed the way the community views the team. During the off season, five Penn State players were arrested on an assortment of charges, including allegations against an incoming freshman of possession and delivery of drugs in the player's hometown. In July, McDuffie, a senior, was charged with disorderly conduct in connection with a fight at a bar where many of the university's black students congregate. McDuffie said he interceded when the police arriving on the scene acted with what he thought was undue and excessive force. The police were white; the students involved were black. "That was one of times I felt it was my responsibility to stick up for my race," he said. "I was really irate about the entire situation. I had never seen anything like that before. I'd never seen a police officer snatch a black man up for no reason. I didn't think twice about reacting to it. I felt good about it; I got in trouble for it." The police denied that race was a factor or that excessive force was used. McDuffie was given probation and assigned to do community service. A month later, two Penn State football players were charged with burglary. Paterno indefinitely suspended the players, although both remain in school. "It's a really weird situation because no one is used to anything like that has happened around here," McDuffie said, referring to the burglary. "It caught everybody off guard. But I think it brought us a lot closer together as a team. I think right now a lot of people are against us and we've got to depend on each other for support."

475-> Review/Music; World Folk Styles, Transformed
The music presented by the Kronos Quartet on Saturday night in Alice Tully Hall seemed, at first, to have little to do with the changing purple, green and yellow lights shining on the pipe organ onstage, or the amplification of the string instruments, or the performers' punkish outfits. In fact, far from being high-tech, the program was mostly built around transformations of folk musics by non-Western composers. All of the works were written for the Kronos players -- David Harrington and John Sherba, violinists, Hank Dutt, violist, and Joan Jeanrenaud, cellist. Hamza el-Din, for example, a Sudanese virtuoso on the oud (an African lute) was commissioned by Lincoln Center to compose "Escalay" (1989). The string players imitated drones and vocal lines reminiscent of North African and Arabic music, and Mr. Din provided rhythmic accompaniment on the tar, a hand-held drum. Hermeto Pascoal's "Marcando Tempo" (1991), in its New York premiere, had a pop flavor derived from the commercial culture of the composer's native Brazil. The Zimbabwean composer Dumisani Maraire described his "Mai Nozipo" (1990) as a portrayal of his mother's life. Playing African drums, he joined the quartet in repetitions of a simple eight-bar folk song with a catchy melody, repeated with slight variations, another commission from Lincoln Center. Mr. Maraire, who teaches ethnomusicology in Zimbabwe, then explained that a "unique" aspect of "African polyphony" was its use of "musical layers." He taught the audience a five-note scalar chant, the quartet played its own repeated patterns, and he sang in apparent improvisation in the New York premiere of "Kutambarara" (1990). The result was a tonal hootenanny with African ornamentation. In each case, the ersatz folk music was played with fairly routine accomplishment by the quartet. But one need only hear traditional oud music, or Brazilian song, or African ritual drumming, to get some idea of the extraordinary sounds being imitated in these unsophisticated compositions. Even in the world premiere of "Nong Rock" -- another composition commissioned by Lincoln Center -- the composer, Jin Hi Kim, had very little use for the Western string quartet parts. The work's main interest was in her subtle and virtuosic solos on the komungo, a Korean six-stringed zither. In this context, Philip Glass's String Quartet No. 5 was the exception, instantly distinguished by its more subtle use of counterpoint, its sensitivity toward instrumental voices, and its attention to overall structure; its aura of melancholic pop was not always convincing, but at least the work had a distinctive voice. There are arguments that the Kronos is building new audiences, that it is playing a unique role in cultural interaction. But there is already a distinguished tradition of non-Western influence on Western composition; the attempt to understand other musics has even been a distinctive characteristic of Western culture. Most of the composers on this program, though, imitated aspects of Western music without mastering them, diminishing their own musics in the process. The Kronos compounded the multi-cultural problems. Aided by the imprimatur of Lincoln Center, it invoked the prestige of the string quartet form while mocking its claims. The most revealing work on the program was the New York premiere of "Lieu, dWig, Wand/Bay/Tow, v&" (1991), written by the Canadian composer John Oswald and also commissioned by Lincoln Center. The composition uses what the composer has called "plunderphonics": it is meant to dismantle the music as much as the title typographically dismantles a composer's name. In this case, the main piece being plundered was Beethoven's Op. 130 String Quartet. Fragments were played -- sometimes no more than a single chord -- and then interrupted as the players, in posed disgust, tossed loose pages of the score on the floor. The detritus gradually accumulated, accompanied by audience laughter. The Beatles' song "Roll Over Beethoven" had more wit, but this piece precisely defined the spirit of the Kronos Quartet. While historically the string quartet was considered the most intellectual and rigorous of musical ensembles, these players are rejecting such qualities in favor of a cleverly packaged form of post-modern folk music, complete with mood lights and costumes. This approach does not build audiences or enrich traditions. In fact, on Saturday it actually cheapened all it touched, both high and low.

476-> CREDIT MARKETS; A Turbulent Session Ends Lower
Treasury bond prices ended marginally lower yesterday in a turbulent session influenced by stronger-than-expected economic statistics and some questionable trades in the Chicago futures market. "It's been a volatile day, what with the data and the ruckus in Chicago," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities. The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond ended down 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.61 percent, up from 7.60 percent late Wednesday. Bonds fell early in the day after the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to 368,000 in early October, the lowest level in more than two years. The decline of 15,000 claims in the week that ended on Oct. 10 was the third straight drop, and some experts believe the unemployment rate should decline if claims remain below 400,000. Surprise to Market The report surprised the credit markets, which expected an increase of 15,000 in applications for unemployment insurance. Higher unemployment increases the chances the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move that increases bond prices. The market was also whipsawed by what traders called possibly improper transactions in the Chicago futures pits and an unusual intervention in the market by the Chicago Board of Trade to correct them. Traders and analysts said someone who might not have had proper trading credentials made a series of large trades in Treasury bond futures that sent the market sharply lower. The transactions caused bond prices to plunge about a point. Traders said the Board of Trade intervened, helping bond prices retrace their losses in the early afternoon. Bond prices resumed falling late in the day, after the Government reported a much larger-than-expected growth in money supply, signaling that the economy might be more robust than bond traders believed. Traders and analysts said the market was facing two big problems right now. One is a fear that Bill Clinton will be elected President and stimulate the economy through higher spending, which the market considers inflationary. The other is the prospect of oversupply. The Treasury is auctioning 2-year and 5-year securities next week. It is expected to issue about $37 billion of 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities next month. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities fell between 3/32 and 1/8 point and intermediate maturities fell between 5/32 and 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value. The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.83 to 1254.69. Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.98 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points, to 2.93 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.26 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points, to 3.17 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.48 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points, to 3.35 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose to 3 percent, up from 215/16 percent late Wednesday. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9415/16 , down 7/32 point.

477-> Cuomo Offers Plan to Stimulate Recovery in New York Economy
In a State of the State address that mixed exhortation and confrontation, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo pledged today to help lift New York out of the grim hold of the recession and challenged lawmakers to undertake major improvements in the way the state manages its own finances. The centerpiece of the Governor's recovery program was his call for an $800 million bond act that he said would spur construction projects across the state and create thousands of jobs. The proposal would not go before the voters until November, a fact bemoaned by some lawmakers today even as they praised the concept. "We must pump confidence and capital and jobs into our own state economy," said the Governor, whose 55-minute address marked the 10th year he has presided over the traditional start of Albany's legislative season. "We must build a new New York with our own hands, without waiting for Washington." [ Excerpts, page B9. ] Locked in Bitter Feud The Governor spoke against the stark backdrop of near-paralysis in the State Capitol, where he and lawmakers have been locked in a bitter and largely fruitless feud over how to close nearly $5 billion in budget deficits. In an apparent bid to go over the heads of those legislators, the Governor proposed summoning a special constitutional convention to force changes in the way the state's budgets are put together. The Legislature would have to approve the convention, but it would then be run by popularly elected delegates. Such a convention, which last met in 1967, would consider a measure that would allow the Governor's proposed budget to take effect temporarily in any year that the Legislature did not pass a budget on time, which has happened for the last seven years in a row. Other measures advanced by Mr. Cuomo would dock the pay of the Governor and all the lawmakers for every day the budget remained late -- it was adopted 65 days past the April 1 deadline last year -- and institute a "limited initiative" ballot with which the public could force lawmakers to vote on specific bills, including the budget. But while Mr. Cuomo characterized the convention as "one grand stroke of intelligent populism," many lawmakers derided it as demagoguery and said they were skeptical it would ever come about. And the confrontational aspect of the day was aptly symbolized by an unusual exchange between Mr. Cuomo and a Democratic Assemblyman, Anthony S. Seminerio of Queens, who interrupted the speech with an angry outburst from his seat. "Don't tell me I won't get paid for my work -- that's political nonsense," Mr. Seminerio bellowed at the Governor. "We're here every day, 14 or 15 hours a day." The economic proposals outlined by the Governor today combined his new call for the bond act with a package of major initiatives he has already announced, including such improvements in the infrastructure in the New York City area as a light-rail system to connect the region's airports with existing transportation lines and a huge office and housing development in Hunters Point, Queens. And he offered several new proposals in the health and housing fields that touched on major problems but, in their relatively modest scope, illustrated the difficulties of finding financing for an all-out assault on social ills in the current economic climate. Among these were a health education campaign to counter the recent rise in tuberculosis and measles cases and a $40 million revolving-loan program to help out first-time home buyers. Medical Programs The Governor said he would propose creation of six neighborhood emergency medical-treatment centers from Buffalo to Harlem and an "Early Care" medical program aimed at keeping infants and toddlers healthy, a move that he said might build the foundation for a universal health care program that has been shunted aside in recent years here as unaffordable. And he pledged to consider privatization measures that ranged from the very small, like a pilot program to contract out laundry services for state mental wards, to the very large, including a proposal to sell the publicly owned World Trade Center. Mr. Cuomo is expected to outline ways to pay for these new ideas when he presents his budget proposal for the 1992-93 fiscal year on Jan. 21. The Governor pledged today that there would be "no new taxes" in his plan. For the first time, the State of the State address was followed by an offical Republican response that was carried on many of the same public-television stations that broadcast Mr. Cuomo's speech. It was delivered by the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who used it to reiterate his calls for reductions in Medicaid and welfare spending. "The growth in these programs has fueled tax increases, taken money away from road repairs and schools, and caused a structural imbalance in our budget that threatens our very ability to provide for people," he said. Senator Marino said after the speech that his party had decided to "go on the offensive" in asking for the air time. "We thought the best way to do that is to enunciate our position, even though I don't enunciate well," he said. An Interesting Contrast The speech today in the ornate Assembly chamber offered an interesting contrast to Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the State address in the same place 60 years ago, which offered a similar lament about Washington's inability to deal with harsh economic times. "In any state of this union of states, the complete solving of those economic problems which are national in scope is an impossibility without leadership and a plan of action by our national government," Mr. Roosevelt said in 1932. Today, Mr. Cuomo said, "The national Government, unable or unwilling to handle the challenge, gradually has shifted the burden to the states." While Mr. Roosevelt's address was widely interpreted as a declaration that he would run for President, Mr. Cuomo's attack on Federal policies produced no similar speculation today because last month he firmly took himself out of the race. He cited New York's budget morass as the chief factor precluding a Presidential bid. There was something vaguely wistful, then, about Mr. Cuomo's assault on Washington since it was coming from a man who portrayed himself today not as a potential President but as one of just dozens of governors struggling against a terrible national tide. Still, he sought to use the moment as an uplifting paean to his state, which he described as "an Empire State that has helped build this great nation from the very beginning." Mr. Cuomo may well face an uphill struggle in securing approval of the major initiatives he outlined today. The last bond proposal, the $1.97 billion environmental bond act, was defeated by New York voters in 1990 amid concerns about adding to the state's long-term debt. Even if the Governor gets his constitutional convention, there is no guarantee that it will change anything. The 1967 convention worked for months and proposed sweeping revisions in the organization of state agencies and the courts, only to have the entire plan rejected when it was put before the voters. Mr. Cuomo certainly did not exempt himself from his general criticism of the way things have been run in Albany. "I'm not proud of what I have done," Mr. Cuomo said in a reference to the unresolved fight over the budget. "I'm the chief executive. I was supposed to produce a result. I failed, but so did you."

478-> China, in Shift, Accepts U.S. Shipping Concerns
China agreed today to allow two American companies to compete directly with Chinese rivals in shipping the nation's cargo, resolving a longstanding dispute over market access. The Chinese concession, which comes at a time of mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing, is expected to facilitate trade with China and perhaps reduce transportation costs. It also is the first time that foreign companies will operate wholly owned subsidiaries in China's transportation business and directly compete with Chinese rivals. China's decision averted a possible upward spiral of retaliatory measures that ultimately might have affected as much as half of the total two-way trade, estimated to be about $24 billion last year. The decision coincided with unrelated trade talks in Washington, in which a deal was struck this evening on protection of intellectual property. "The company is very pleased," said Gary D. Gilbert, a Hong Kong-based vice president of Sea-Land Service Inc., a CSX Corporation subsidiary and one of the two American carriers granted approval to conduct business in China without Chinese agents. The other is American President Lines Ltd. 'We're Free Traders' "We're free traders," Mr. Gilbert said. "We're in the business of moving commerce between countries, and the more free trade there is the better we like it." Limited access to the Chinese market has been a major complaint of American companies and trade negotiators. The maritime dispute was reportedly raised by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during his visit to Beijing in November. It apparently was not directly linked to other trade issues. "In so far as the individual negotiations, it is unrelated, but when looking at things like the attitude in Congress, it becomes one more log in a big fire," said a foreign businessman involved in trade between China and the United States. "It's all part of what we feel are barriers to market access." China had effective control over the flow of goods into and out of the country, requiring American carriers to work solely through two Chinese booking agents, who in some aspects of the business were their direct competitors. In contrast, Chinese carriers were free to operate relatively openly in the United States. Inquiry Was Begun In July, the United States Federal Maritime Commission began an investigation into the treatment of American shipping companies in China. If the commission had determined that China indeed was unfairly restricting access, it could have imposed a charge of $1 million on each Chinese vessel that called at an American port. The Chinese side could also have retaliated with corresponding measures. Presumably to avoid such stiff penalties as well as an ensuing trade war, China agreed to loosen its restrictions and allow two American shipping companies to establish subsidiaries and operate branch offices in China. Half of all trade between the countries is carried by Chinese or American ships and would have been affected by the dispute, while the remainder is hauled on ships of third countries. Sea-Land hauls about 13 percent of the trade between the United States and China; American President holds about 10 percent of the market.

479-> Milhaud's Opera About Columbus To Get U.S. Staging
The big rally for Christopher Columbus happens at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday, when Philip Glass's new piece, "The Voyage," marks in musical terms the 500th anniversary of America's discovery. But between the dress rehearsal on Friday morning and the first performance on Monday night a counter demonstration of sorts -- some might call it a student protest -- takes place across the East River at Brooklyn College. For Mr. Glass is not the only author of a big-scale Columbus opera. Darius Milhaud and Paul Claudel wrote one almost 65 years ago, and this "Christophe Colomb," in a brave production by the Brooklyn College Opera Theater, will play at Whitman Hall Saturday night at 7:30 and Sunday at 2 P.M. The performances represent an intersection of anniversaries, the other being the centennial of Milhaud's birth (he died in 1974). "Claudel's idea of Columbus was prophetic for its time," says Richard Barrett, a tenor turned conductor who has directed the opera theater through its first seven years. "There was at one time a movement to make Columbus a saint. This opera includes Aztecs who mourn the destruction of their world by the European wave that followed his discoveries." Claudel's play and Milhaud's setting of it operate on a scale as large as Glass's, but its premises are perhaps different. "The Voyage," we have been led to understand, celebrates quest and exploration in general; "Christophe Colomb" examines the ironies of Columbus's success and failure; its vignettes include not only his discoveries but also his penurious end, at the obscure inn where he died, unable to pay the landlord's bill. Professional, but Learning Putting on an opera as ambitious as this seems a heavy undertaking for a school. The principals, on the other hand, are graduate students at Brooklyn College, singers with professional experience still pursuing advanced degrees. David Parsons sings the title role; Louisa Jonason and Anne Knoche are alternating in the part of Isabella. Elsewhere, the requirements are huge: 46 roles, a chorus of 40, 15 actors, a pit orchestra of 61. John Shefler's set -- a tilted, raked, circular stage within a ship's skeleton -- will do without the film and slide projections of the original productions. (In 1931 these were radical innovations.) "Christophe Colomb" is bound together by Claudel's highly dramatic narration; the Brooklyn version will be in an English translation by Arnold Perry. "The music has been our biggest problem," says Mr. Barrett. "It took a long time to teach the chorus to hear the orchestra playing in one key and then get it to sing in another one. The changes in rhythm and meter are difficult for the orchestra. Just writing the English translations into the parts was a lot of drudgery." "Paradoxically, being a student production helped us," says Mr. Barrett. "We don't pay the performers. There are no union restrictions on time. I estimate we had 70 choral rehearsals and 20 more for the orchestra. This is a co-production with the Empire Arts Center in Albany. We did the opera there at the Kitty Carlisle Hart Theater on Friday night and went up a few days earlier to prepare. We have had some nice grants, from the Florence Gould Foundation, the Brooklyn College Foundation and the CUNY Research Foundation, but the main expense was travel and housing." Neglected by France Madeleine Milhaud, the composer's widow, who is in New York for the various commemorations, points out that the first performances took place in Berlin, not Paris. A lack of an organized professional opera chorus in France was one reason given in 1931, but she says that Paris has to this day left "Christophe Colomb" and Milhaud's other operas (including the admired "Bolivar") unproduced. This production, says Mr. Barrett, is the first American staging of "Christophe Colomb." There have been concert versions of varying completeness, one by Dimitri Mitropoulos and the New York Philharmonic in 1952 and one in San Francisco in 1968 with Gunther Schuller conducting. The opera exists in several versions, the difference being the order of the plot. Mrs. Milhaud explains that her husband had a change of heart after the premiere, deciding that the opera should end with Columbus's discovery rather than his death. Claudel was telephoned, she says. His reply: "It's your opera now. Do what you want." "Christophe Colomb" is an example of Milhaud's willingness to engage any subject in musical discourse, no matter how big or how small. Claudel, for his part, anticipated the ambivalence that Columbus's achievements were later to generate among the socially conscious. Mr. Barrett says, "I think this opera is a voice from a previous time, one that asks us to observe, but not necessarily to celebrate."

480-> Art in Review
Jack Pierson Tom Cugliani Gallery 40 Wooster Street SoHo Through Feb. 29 Jack Pierson's first solo exhibition has a feeling of fresh, yet slightly jaded vulnerability, like a new talent in a B movie. Casually installed, it offers washed-out color photographs pinned to the wall (a highway disappearing into the distance, a deserted beach, a dressing table in a cheap hotel room) and illegible scraps of black and white photographs (these a bit adolescent), also pinned to the wall. Also on hand are three works that use found plastic letters from store signs to spell out extra-poignant words haphazardly. In one piece, the letters of "Hopeless" and "Helpless" intersect; another says "Sexlessness" and a third simply pleads "Stay." Effective as some of these pieces are, their primary function is to set the stage for Mr. Pierson's many drawings, the best part of the exhibition. These drawings center for the most part on fragmentary words and phrases written in blunt, angry print, in a suave cursive or in tiny letters that suggest set type. Sometimes smudged and smeared, they speak repeatedly of longing, loneliness and failed love. One resentfully announces "You went to Hollywood. I WENT TO HELL." In another the letters of "you" and "me," written repeatedly on top of each other, stack up in violent clusters. They bring to mind both David Hockney and Jean Michel Basquiat, but their condensed and suggestive narratives seem to be very much Mr. Pierson's own.

481-> School Workers in Maryland Are Forced to Take Furlough
With a $15 million deficit in its school budget, Prince Georges County, Md., has begun furloughing employees and shutting down its entire school system. "We're cutting corners in every possible direction, but even after doing all that, we still needed to cut another $6 million," said Bonnie S. Jenkins, spokeswoman for public schools in the county abutting the District of Columbia. "We have no fat to cut." Ms. Jenkins said the district had no choice but the furloughs. Other options, she said, included layoffs. With the furloughs, employees will lose five and a half days' pay. The furloughs began Feb. 12, when employees lost a half-day's pay, and are to include full-day closings on Feb. 18 and 28, March 2 and May 22. Employees will also be furloughed on June 17. Saving $2 Million a Day Although shutting down the schools will save transportation and heating costs, most of the savings will come from salaries. Personnel costs make up 85 percent of the the county's school budget, and for each day schools are closed the system saves $2 million. In protest, county teachers staged a job action late last year, doing only tasks stipulated in their contracts. Ed Drapeau, a junior at Northwestern High School, complained that the protests only hurt the students. "The teachers are taking it out on us," he said. That observation, though, drew disagreement from Lewis A. Robinson, executive director of the Prince Georges County Educators' Association, the teachers' union. "The children will be hurt more if we continue the pattern of allowing" cutbacks, Mr. Robinson said, adding, "Teacher morale is at an all-time low." What is more, teachers say, instituting a furlough is tantamount to breaking their contract. The union gave up a 6 percent raise for their members this year, Mr. Robinson said, "and now the employer is turning to us and saying we want to reduce your pay." 180 School Days Required But in ordering the furloughs, the county leaves the school system vulnerable to falling below the 180 days that are required for a year if bad weather forces schools to close additional days. The Maryland Department of Education is required to grant a waiver for any school year with fewer than 180 days of instruction, but the State Board of Education in November voted against waivers. Only civil disaster, natural disaster or particularly severe weather would merit a waiver, said Ronald A. Peiffer, spokesman for the State Department of Education. "The state board does not think the current fiscal situation will fit under civil disaster," Mr. Peiffer said. Jewell Gould, director of research for the American Federation of Teachers, said many local officials had not seriously considered raising taxes to deal with budget deficits like the one in Prince Georges County "The lack of courage on the part of some of the county executives in Maryland is pretty disgusting," Mr. Gould said.

483-> Gay Teachers Say Board in Queens Is Intolerant
Two gay teachers stepped forward yesterday and publicly criticized a Queens school board for refusing to let teachers use a curriculum guide that urges schoolchildren to respect and appreciate gay people. The teachers, Daniel Dromm and Kim Kreicker, said the decision by District 24 to reject the guide had created an atmosphere of intimidation and intolerance in schools that are among the city's most diverse -- with children from a variety of ethnic groups and family situations, including some with gay parents. Other Boards Defiant "Gay people throughout the city are no longer living in the closet," said Mr. Dromm, a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 199 in Sunnyside. "They are developing relationships and they are open about it. We, as educators, must face that need in the schools." The criticism from Mr. Dromm and Ms. Kreicker is the latest clash in the controversy over the Board of Education's efforts to introduce a curriculum in elementary schools that seeks to promote tolerance toward ethnic groups, gay men and lesbians and people with AIDS. The nine-member board for District 24 -- which has more than 27,000 students in Maspeth, Glendale, Middle Village, Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst -- rejected the 443-page curriculum guide in April. Some members said that they could not accept the three pages in the guide that told teachers that they "have an opportunity to give children a healthy sense of identity" and so "should include references to lesbians-gay people." Those pages were contrary to family values in the community, the board members said. Four other school boards -- Districts 8 and 12 in the Bronx, District 20 in Brooklyn and District 31 on Staten Island -- have rejected the sections of the text dealing with homosexuality, but only District 24 has rejected the entire guide, said Frank Sobrino, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. Mr. Fernandez has given the defiant boards until Oct. 31 to present an alternative curriculum. In a news conference at the headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers, Mr. Dromm and Ms. Kreicker said that they came forward because they thought the school board and its president, Mary Cummins, had sent a message of intolerance by rejecting the curriculum. Both work in District 24. Their criticism was reported in yesterday's New York Newsday. Bias at an Early Age "It's very frightening for us," said Ms. Kreicker, who has worked in the city's schools for three years, this year teaching English as a second language at Intermediate School 61 in Corona. Sandra Feldman, the president of the teachers' union, who also spoke at the news conference, said that Mr. Dromm and Ms. Kreicker were both excellent and respected teachers who had showed courage. "It's terribly wrong for them to have to feel uncomfortable in any way, shape or form," Ms. Feldman said. Mr. Dromm, a teacher for 15 years, the last eight in the city's schools, said some children in his school have gay or lesbian parents and that classmates, even at an early age, show bias. In one case, he said, children taunted a girl because her mother was a lesbian. "And here I was as a gay teacher," he said, "and I felt that because my hands were tied by the district, I wasn't able to do as much as I really wanted to do for that child."

485-> SIDELINES: STORMY MUSHING; A Shivering Reflection of the Iditarod
RICK SWENSON has had almost a year to think about the storm he went through in winning the Iditarod, Alaska's annual 1,163-mile sled-dog race from Anchorage to Nome. On the final day the temperature dipped to 20 degrees below zero and the wind rose to 40 miles an hour. Swenson pressed on to win the Iditarod for a fifth time, a record. "It was the worst storm I've ever come across," Swenson said recently. "Nine years before I might have said the hell with it and turned back. I could hardly see my feet." But he knew the finish line was close and that thought kept him going. This year's Iditarod begins on Feb. 29 and Swenson thinks he has a good chance to win again. "This is what I live for," he said. "The adventure, the challenge." He is 41 years old, lives in Two Rivers, Alaska, and has competed in 16 Iditarods.

486-> NASA Extends Shuttle's Flight by One Day
Space agency officials added a day to the mission of the space shuttle Atlantis today so that its crew could conduct more research on the atmosphere. The shuttle, which was launched into orbit last Tuesday, had been scheduled to end its eight-day mission on Wednesday. With the extension to nine days, the new landing time was set for 6:20 A.M. Thursday at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Informed of the extension by Mission Control, Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr. of the Marine Corps, the mission commander, said: "That's great news! The guys are really excited about it and had been looking forward to it." The Crew Was Prepared Three previous shuttle flights were extended for scientific reasons, and the seven-member Atlantis crew had been preparing for the possibility. "After going through all this work and all this effort, an extra day is a big thing," Dr. Michael Foale, a Briton who is a mission specialist on the Atlantis, said in a preflight interview. "It will represent more than 10 percent of the science." In the first shuttle mission devoted to the environment, the astronauts have been conducting tests of Earth's atmosphere, especially the ozone layer, which protects against dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and is believed to be damaged by pollution. Today the lid on a canister holding an ozone-measuring instrument in the shuttle's payload bay was periodically cranked open to take ozone readings. The instrument calculates atmospheric ozone by observing solar ultraviolet radiation and the resulting radiation that scatters off Earth's atmosphere and back toward space. The data will be used to calibrate similar instruments orbiting Earth's polar regions on satellites. The crew may also have accomplished a scientific first: creating double layers of electron charges, a phenomenon previously seen only in the laboratory. One of the astronauts, Dirk D. Frimout, said that when xenon gas was fired into space he saw an intense glow like a burning candle atop the gas ejector as well as bright patches in the shape of a cone. Researchers plan to repeat the experiment to verify the results. Dr. Frimout, a Belgian physicist, and the three other scientists aboard Atlantis also spent today photographing the southern lights and airglow, a shimmering layer of light above Earth. Nature has obliged with somewhat more auroras than expected since Atlantis reached orbit. Scientists attribute the number to high solar activity. The colorful streaks of light are created in the high latitudes, most often near the poles, when atmospheric atoms and molecules interact with charged particles from the sun. The astronauts also took time out to answer questions from schoolchildren in Alabama and Texas. Although most of the questions on the list were about the atmosphere, one wanted to know if the astronauts got sick in space. Dr. Byron K. Kichtenberg a payload specialist, replied, "For us, it ranges the gamut -- the whole spectrum, from just a little bit of sensitivity in your stomach to those times when you have to use those little bags like they give you on the airplane."

487-> Elizabeth Chase, 77, An Adviser to Javits 1
Elizabeth Coykendall Chase, a former campaign adviser to United States Senator Jacob K. Javits, died on Sunday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 77 years old and lived in Stamford. Mrs. Chase, a writer and public relations specialist, counseled Mr. Javits in his first successful race for the House of Representatives in 1946. She also was public relations adviser to the New York Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, in the 1950's. Mrs. Chase, a native of Iowa, attended Iowa State College and graduated from Wellesley College in 1936. Before moving to Stamford, she lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., for 25 years. She was president of the New York and Ridgewood Wellesley Clubs, a founder of the West Bergen Mental Health Center and president of the Ridgewood College Club and of the Ho-Ho-Kus Garden Club. Her interests in Stamford included the Friends of Ferguson Library, the Stamford Garden Club and the Easter Seal Rehabilitation Center. She was a Time magazine researcher in Washington in the 1930's. In the 1950's and 60's, she was a founder and president of a New York public relations firm, Attitudes Inc. She was also a speech writer for corporate executives and a book and newsletter editor. She is survived by her husband, W. Howard Chase; two daughters, Anne, of Glen Rock, N.J., and Alison, of Kinnelon, N.J.; one son, Thomas, of North Plainfield, N.J.; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

488-> Where Kids Get Their Guns
Murderous gunplay among students at Jefferson High School finally focused New York City's attention on a problem of adolescent gunslinging that began in the 1980's. Plans to stiffen school security make immediate sense, but New York officials could do much more to limit the flow of illegal guns, locally and nationally. This week a new hot line set up by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms opened for business. New Yorkers may call 1-800-ATF-GUNS with confidential tips on people illegally possessing and trafficking in firearms. Phone operators pass along the intelligence to a task force consisting of a dozen Federal agents and an equal number of city police officers. The effectiveness of the hot line -- planned long before the Jefferson High shootings -- remains to be seen. Hot lines in smaller cities have encouraged fearful relatives or neighbors to report youngsters carrying guns, leading police and Federal agents to make arrests, confiscate weapons and shut down smuggling operations. New York City's gun problems clearly exceed the time and attention of two dozen officers, but the program still deserves a try. If city officials, civic groups and the news media publicize the hot line widely and loudly, a widespread response would create an overwhelming case for more resources, paid for partly by Washington. Beyond that, New Yorkers might think more aggressively about reaching beyond their borders to disrupt illegal trafficking. The smugglers who sell guns on city streets purchase most of them in only a few states like Virginia, where gun dealers ask few questions. Why don't Mayor David Dinkins, Police Commissioner Lee Brown and other high-ranking New York City officials pay calls on Gov. Douglas Wilder, Virginia legislators and their counterparts in other supplier states to solicit their help in reducing mayhem on New York streets? Even if such appeals don't change other states' laws, they would underscore the national nature of the problem, dramatizing the case for stronger Federal action. Finally, Albany could pass a bill imposing strict liability on manufacturers and purveyors of guns used to commit crimes in New York. Such liability allows victims of gun violence to recover damages from producers and dealers without having to prove negligence. The inherent danger of producing guns that appear designed for a criminal market justifies compensation for the crime victim. Anyone doubting the need for such liability ought to consider a recent article in The Wall Street Journal describing how California companies earn millions annually by selling cheap, easily concealed handguns all over the country. Legitimate dealers charge up to $80 for a gun that costs only $13 to produce, while illegal traffickers may collect $300 for it on the street. The liability bill would create a new resource for crime victims -- and give gun suppliers a powerful reason to consider their customers' intentions.

489-> Immigrants Left Homeless After Transient Hotel Blaze
Nineteen people were injured, 13 of them firefighters, and more than 150 people left homeless yesterday morning in a wind-whipped, five-alarm fire at a transient hotel in midtown Manhattan, fire officials said. The firefighters sustained burns and smoke inhalation while fighting the two-hour fire at the Hotel Mansfield Hall, at 226 West 50th Street near the theater district. Most were treated at the scene, while four firefighters went to the burn unit of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and two to Bellevue Hospital, said Deputy Commissioner Tom Kelly, a Fire Department spokesman. All were treated and released. Four residents of the 350-room hotel between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, were also treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and exposure to the cold, as were two police officers. The first alarm came at 6:40 A.M. and within three minutes the first fire units arrived to find the fire spreading quickly up an air chute into the left side of the building. "There was heavy volume of fire on all seven floors," Mr. Kelly said. "There were very strong, gusting, southerly winds which hampered firefighting operations." Fire marshals were investigating the cause of the fire but there was nothing to indicate it was suspicious, Mr. Kelly said. One man left homeless by the fire, Bassirou Fall, 38 years old, of Senegal, who sells clothes and African artifacts on the streets of New York, watched the fire take the building and the $65-a-week room he had lived in for five years. "It was very quick for the fire to hit all the rooms," Mr. Fall said, as a friend translated. "Many people lost their possessions. It's mostly people of African descent living inside. Mostly they're from Senegal, the Ivory Coast, Guinea and Mali." By 8:30 A.M., the fire was brought under control in an effort that involved more than 200 firefighters and 40 pieces of equipment, including three tower ladders that were used to rescue a half-dozen people. The fire heavily damaged the left side of the building, and the right side suffered smoke and water damage. Rescue Effort Difficult Complicating firefighting operations, he said, were language problems and a reluctance by many to leave, despite the danger. "They did not not want to leave all their worldly possessions behind," Mr. Kelly said. "As they came out, many of them were carrying their clothes, attache cases and display cases that held the things they sold for a living." From 150 to 175 people were evacuated and relocated, officials said. Warren W. Zorek, the chairman of disaster services for the New York chapter of the American Red Cross, said the displaced people would be sent to a temporary shelter in the auditorium of the Red Cross headquarters at 150 Amsterdam Avenue and other hotels.

490-> TENNIS; Stich Wins Quickly and Easily To Create Time for More Golf
When it comes to his tennis, which is a subject that periodically bores him, Michael Stich doesn't question the source of his motivation. Some days he's content merely to compete for the sake of winning, other days he's in a hurry to win because it's his passport to the golf course, the place where he forgets about tennis and fine tunes his 18 handicap. His countryman Boris Becker may have a two-spot edge in the tennis rankings, but out on the fairways, the fifth-ranked Stich is building a reputation as the ace of every German foursome he joins. Today, with showers forecast throughout the desert that frames the Newsweek Champions Cup, Stich was inspired to get through his morning quarterfinal against Sergei Bruguera of Spain in 53 minutes, a 6-1, 6-2 victory, in order to beat the rain to the back nine. But not as fortunate were the next pair of quarterfinalists, seventh-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain and unseeded Andrei Chesnokov, the Muscovite who upset the defending champion, Jim Courier, in the third round. Their match was halted by a brief shower that struck with Chesnokov, who was flawless with his baseline passing shots, just two serves short of a 7-5, 7-5 victory. After more than an hour's delay and a frantic squeegee session, Chesnokov advanced to meet Stich in Saturday's semifinals. Little Confidence "It should be very difficult for me to beat him," said Chesnokov. The Russian, ranked 36th, said Stich's strident serve-and-volley game would give the German the advantage. Stich, seeded third and the only one of the top six seeds to reach the quarterfinals, applied constant pressure on Bruguera. "I played a pretty perfect match; I had the right tactics," said Stich, who needed just four aces, saved the only break point against him and backed Bruguera into a series of overhit bloopers. Stich said a reunion with his coach, Mark Lewis, who not only instructs him in tennis but keeps him company on the daily golf outing, helped him make an attitude adjustment after two stormy weeks in Memphis and Philadelphia, where he had pronounced himself sick of tennis. Vacation Plans For the moment, Stich is enjoying his tennis again, especially since he knows he has a four-week hiatus coming up. And he felt confident, he said, about celebrating his vacation with a victory here. "I know I can beat all these guys," he said. "I don't have to worry about it." Unlike several other serve-and-volley artisans who said that the gritty court surface here favored clay-court specialists like Bruguera, Stich said he had no complaints about the playing conditions. "After all, I didn't lose a set yet and I'm in the semifinals, so I think I'm pretty happy with the surroundings," he said. "Yes, the courts are pretty slow, the balls are pretty bad, but sometimes you don't worry, and sometimes you can't take it," said Stich, who is skipping next week's event at Key Biscayne, Fla., because he has no tolerance for the blustery, humid setting. In a later match, 12th-seeded Michael Chang defeated Andrei Cherkasov, 6-4, 6-2. Chang will play Francisco Clavet, who defeated 16th-seeded Jakob Hlasek, 6-1, 6-2.

492-> Dinkins Aide Trades Charges With Woman Over Advances
In a tangled, emotional drama played out against a backdrop of New York City mayoral politics, a newly appointed Deputy Mayor and a former female subordinate traded charges and countercharges yesterday over her allegations of sexual harassment. The public surfacing of the five-year-old dispute between the city official, Randy Daniels, and his former assistant, Barbara Wood, reverberated against the mayoral ambitions of their former employer, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, and the man he would like to unseat, Mayor David N. Dinkins. At a somber City Hall news conference, the Mayor expressed support for Mr. Daniels, who was accused by Ms. Wood in 1987 of sexual advances and threatening her job if she did not have sex with him. Mr. Daniels was then Mr. Stein's press secretary, and Ms. Wood was one of Mr. Daniels's assistants. But Mr. Dinkins also held out the possibility that the growing public clamor over Ms. Wood's allegation might make it difficult for Mr. Daniels to do his job. Mr. Daniels, whose appointment as Deputy Mayor for Public and Community Affairs was announced last week, is scheduled to begin his new job at City Hall on Nov. 2. The Mayor said that "at this juncture" he expected Mr. Daniels to start work then. Mr. Daniels forcefully denied the accusation yesterday, as he had previously, and he vowed not to step down. He also contended that Mr. Stein's office was responsible for leaking the allegations to reporters and he claimed the motivation was political. For the first time, Ms. Wood yesterday told her own version of the events that she says took place five years ago. Ms. Wood, now a reporter for New York 1 News, the all-news cable station, was interviewed for 30 minutes. The interview was aired in the midafternoon, and business basically stopped throughout City Hall as city officials and reporters clustered around television sets. In a calm, muted manner, Ms. Wood said she went to work for Mr. Daniels a few days after Labor Day in 1987. Within weeks, she said, Mr. Daniels began making sexually suggestive remarks. She declined to state specifically what he said to her, except to describe his words as "crude" and "vulgar." "I don't want to quote him," Ms. Wood said. "He made it very clear to me that he would not help me if things didn't go his way," Ms. Wood said. At another point, she said, "He talked about things that were sexual that he and I could do, that I could do." Ms. Wood stopped often during her recounting of what she said happened to take deep breaths. She said that the comments went on for four to six weeks and that gradually she realized that it was, in her view, "a put-out or get-out situation." Ms. Wood said she thought her job, and perhaps her career, would be threatened if she did not cooperate. Went to Staff Members Ms. Wood said she finally went to members of Mr. Stein's staff and ultimately to Mr. Stein himself with her complaints against Mr. Daniels. She said that staff members wanted her to document the complaint but that she was determined not to press a complaint. Asked why, she said, "Because of this, because of the attention, because of the job." "I didn't want to document it because I didn't want it to come to this," she said. Ms. Wood said she had decided to speak publicly because several newspapers had named her in articles yesterday. Mr. Daniels, who denied the allegations in telephone interviews on Wednesday, mounted his own counterattack late yesterday. He held a news conference at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, with which he has long had an affiliation, and in forceful, sometimes strident terms, he defended himself. "It's a classic New York smear campaign," Mr. Daniels said of the dispute. "Make no doubt about it, it's political." Mr. Daniels, a former CBS network television news reporter who is now a political and public-relations consultant, contended that the accusations had surfaced after they were spread around by Mr. Stein or his staff. "The fingerprints are everywhere," he said. Mr. Stein yesterday denied that he had leaked word of the allegations to reporters. Mr. Daniels contended that Mr. Stein, with whom he said he had been on friendly terms, had not believed Ms. Wood's allegations five years ago. And he accused Mr. Stein of resurrecting the allegations now to hurt Mr. Daniels and Mr. Dinkins. Mr. Stein has said he intends to oppose the Mayor in next year's Democratic mayoral primary. A 'Larger Political Game' Mr. Daniels said, "I believe Miss Wood is a very small pawn in a much larger political game." He also vowed not to be forced from office by the dispute. "I shall not retreat one inch," he said, stabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. "You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know why this effort was launched, the intent behind it and where it's coming from," Mr. Daniels said. "This is a political hit aimed not only at me. It comes from people with blind ambition and lust for power at any price: ladies and gentlemen, the mayoral campaign has begun." Along with Mr. Stein, several of his senior aides denied that they had leaked word of the allegations. Although it is not known how other New York newspapers learned about the allegations, The New York Times first heard of their existence on Wednesday from a lobbyist outside the city government. The lobbyist, who spoke with a reporter for The Times on the condition of anonymity, was not asked where the information had come from. On Wednesday evening, after inquiries from several reporters, senior members of Mr. Stein's staff discussed Ms. Wood's allegations on the record. Among the many disputes that emerged yesterday was whether Mr. Stein eased Mr. Daniels out of office after Ms. Wood leveled her accusations. 'Unhappy With Him' Mr. Stein said that he had. "You couldn't fire him because a formal charge was not made," Mr. Stein said in an interview. "I certainly let him know that I was unhappy with him and then he moved on." But Mr. Daniels, suggesting that he felt betrayed by an old ally, said he had left Mr. Stein's office 9 or 10 months later when he was offered a position as the press secretary for Sir Lynden O. Pindling, then the Prime Minister of the Bahamas. Mr. Daniels noted that Mr. Stein's office held a party for him when he resigned and that the Council President presented him with a proclamation, which Mr. Daniels held up at his news conference, saluting him. Mr. Daniels also said that if Mr. Stein had believed Ms. Wood's allegations, he would have dismissed him immediately. "I am certain that Andrew Stein, if he believed this, would have fired me," he said. Mr. Daniels also repeated assertions he made on Wednesday that, when he gave notice to Mr. Stein, the Council President asked him to stay on and even offered him a job as his chief of staff as an enticement. Mr. Daniels said that Mr. Stein had invited him to a fund-raiser last year and that, when rumors surfaced in early 1991 that Mr. Daniels was being considered for an opening as the Mayor's press secretary, Mr. Stein asked him not to take the job. Mr. Stein, for his part, denied that he tried to persuade Mr. Daniels to remain on his staff or offered him a better job. "It's just a lie, a 100 percent unadulterated lie," Mr. Stein said. "Not only did I not object, as soon as he left, we were very happy about it." Felt Betrayed But Mr. Daniels said that after Ms. Wood made her accusations, Mr. Stein gave him a raise and "praised me as the best press secretary he ever had." He also indicated that he had considered Mr. Stein to be a friend and that he felt betrayed by Mr. Stein. The explosive squabbling was not limited to Mr. Daniels and his former employer. The Mayor said he had learned about the allegations just hours before he appointed Mr. Daniels last week. Asked by reporters why he had proceeded with the appointment, Mr. Dinkins said he had found Mr. Daniels's explanation plausible -- and he tried to shift some of the blame to Mr. Stein. Mr. Dinkins noted that Mr. Stein was quoted in New York Newsday last week, just two days before the appointment, saying that Mr. Daniels was "a good man who will do a good job for the city." Mayoral aides said Mr. Stein made the remarks despite having known about the accusations for five years, and they suggested that Mr. Stein could not have given the allegations much credence if he was willing to publicly endorse Mr. Daniels. Mr. Stein, in turn, called yesterday for an independent investigation into Ms. Wood's allegations, which she made in private to Mr. Stein and several of his aides in the fall of 1987. She declined to file a formal complaint and left the office about a month later. In response to a question, Mr. Stein said he did not know of any witnesses to the reported conversations between Ms. Wood and Mr. Daniels, but he contended that an independent panel could "sort out" the issues. Proposal Rejected The Mayor rejected Mr. Stein's proposal, saying that the city's Department of Investigation could be trusted to pursue the matter as part of a customary background inquiry of top appointments. Mayoral aides questioned why Mr. Stein himself had never investigated the allegations. In a statement issued last night after Mr. Daniels's news conference, Mr. Stein said Mr. Daniels "appears to be a desperate man," and he called again for an impartial inquiry into Ms. Wood's allegations. Mr. Stein also compared the dispute between Mr. Daniels and Ms. Wood to the allegations brought last year by Anita F. Hill against Clarence Thomas. The Mayor, however, said Mr. Daniels's defense was reasonable, particularly given Mr. Stein's comments about him last week, and he said he believed Mr. Daniels. Mr. Dinkins was asked at his news conference early yesterday afternoon if he would like Mr. Daniels to resign. "I can't say that," he said. "You see, I have been in a circumstance wherein people have accused me of that of which I was innocent. I think that he is entitled to better treatment than that. But if he is different than we suspect, then believe me things will take care of themselves."

493-> Making a Difference; When a No. 1 Customer Goes Broke
Robert L. King, president and chief executive of the FoxMeyer Corporation, was worn out from long days of attending the Olympics in Barcelona. But when a telephone call woke him from a nap on Aug. 4, Mr. King found himself tossed into an unscheduled wrestling match: dealing with scandal and bankruptcy at his biggest customer, the Phar-Mor Corporation. FoxMeyer, the nation's third-largest distributor of pharmaceuticals, is owed $74 million by Phar-Mor, the deep-discount retailer that sought court protection from creditors last Monday. Donald T. Spindel, an analyst at A. G. Edwards Inc., in St. Louis, estimates that Mr. King ultimately may have to write off about $20 million, and that Phar-Mor's troubles could drag down FoxMeyer's sales growth below 15 percent a year, from its usual 20 percent or more. The name comes from two distribution companies that merged in the mid-80's. Mr. King, a onetime pharmacist who is 42 years old, has kept FoxMeyer's sales flying despite the loss of two big customers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart, in the last few years. When he received the call about Phar-Mor, Mr. King was in Paris, where he was continuing his vacation after the Olympics. During the six hours he spent that day sizing up FoxMeyer's potential loss, he said he had "an awful lonely feeling, sitting across the ocean staring at the funky phone." Still, Mr. King says that FoxMeyer can adjust to the debacle of Phar-Mor, to which he's still shipping goods. Going from $3.1 billion in sales last year to $4 billion this fiscal year, which ends next March, "shouldn't be any problem at all," he said. In addition to riding the rising sales wave, FoxMeyer is expanding through acquisitions, exclusive distribution deals and its franchise service for more than 700 independent druggists, called Health Mart. The wholesale business for pharmaceuticals soared to $34.8 billion in sales last year, from $7.5 billion in 1980, according to Paine Webber Inc., and distributors led by the McKesson, Bergen Brunswig Corporation and FoxMeyer could play a role in 85 percent of all drug sales by 1995, up from 75 percent in 1990. On Thursday, FoxMeyer said it would buy the warehousing operations of Snyder's Drug Stores, a regional chain in the Upper Midwest, and become Snyder's exclusive supplier of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, health and beauty aids and general merchandise. National Intergroup Inc., which owns 69 percent of FoxMeyer's shares, appeared to endorse Mr. King's path Wednesday when it announced that it might increase its stake to more than 80 percent. FoxMeyer's shares, sold by National Intergroup at $14.50 a share last year in an initial public offering, closed Friday at $11.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

498-> Machine Tool Orders Up 6.4% in February
Orders for American-made machine tools rose 6.4 percent last month from January's level, in another sign of renewed economic growth, according to a report to be released today by an industry trade group. The trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, calculated February's orders at $231.4 million, up from $217.4 million in January. The amount of February orders was down 5.6 percent, however, from the $245.2 million of February 1991. Together with January's figures, year-to-date orders for machine tools totaled $448.8 million, up nine-tenths of a percent from $445.0 million in the first two months of last year. Of the $231.4 million in total orders, $200.6 million were placed by American companies and $30.8 million were sold for export. "Domestic orders are off to a good start," Albert W. Moore, president of the association, said in a statement. He noted that domestic machine tool sales had topped $200 million for two consecutive months, while in 1991 domestic sales topped $200 million only three times all year. The association's statistics combine figures for two kinds of machinery: metal-cutting and metal-forming machines. Each are used to produce a significant number of manufactured goods, from refrigerators and cookware to automobiles and aircraft, and are regarded by economists as one of many indicators of the nation's economic condition. With exports depressed in recent months, Mr. Moore expressed determination to press ahead with efforts to gain foreign market share, despite concerns that foreign markets may recover more slowly than domestic industries. "The slow- or no-growth condition in much of Asia and Europe does not mean we should pull back," Mr. Moore said. "Instead, it is precisely the time to invest more in export promotion." At $30.8 million, export orders of machine tools were more than double the $13.2 million of January, but down sharply from the $80.1 million of February 1991. "Japan and Germany have always found economic downturns in foreign markets a good time to intensify their efforts and gain foreign market share," Mr. Moore said. "The machine tool industry is now global, and the U.S. industry must continue the successful strategy of diversifying our markets." Actual shipments of machine tools in February grew faster than orders, soaring 27.2 percent, to $203.2 million, from $159.8 million in January. The individual statistic that changed most sharply in February from the previous month was export orders for metal-cutting machinery, rising to $19.6 million, from $5.2 million in January. The February total was small, however, compared with the $72.5 million posted in the same category a year earlier.

503-> Suit Accuses District 9 Official of Corruption
School District 9 in the west Bronx embraces a ragged neighborhood of troubled schools where only 32.5 percent of the students read at an appropriate level for their grade and where corruption is a perennial ailment. A principal was once arrested for buying crack, two married school board members admitted moving a school's baby grand piano into their home and another board member was accused of threatening an administrator with a gun. Now, a former acting principal, Helaine N. Atlas, has charged in a $1 million lawsuit that a school board member asked her for $18,000 if she wanted a secure appointment as principal of Public School 4 at 1701 Fulton Avenue. "Corruption is not only condoned; it's expected," said Ms. Atlas, who at the time was the school's acting principal. Drum and Bugle Corps And her husband, Brent J. Cutler, who worked until last year as an executive assistant to the district superintendent, charged in the same lawsuit that the school board's president had pressed administrators to contribute to a drum and bugle corps that paid the president a $35,000-a-year salary. George Palermo, a District 9 board member until last spring and the man whom Ms. Atlas accuses of seeking the $18,000 payment, has not responded to messages left at his home and at the school district. Carmelo Saez, the current school board president, denies any wrongdoing. The couple's allegations, school officials say, are being investigated by Edward Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for public schools, for possible criminal charges of bribery and coercion. Mr. Stancik, who was appointed last year after disclosures of corruption in District 9 and other districts, refused to confirm the inquiry. Ms. Atlas charges in her lawsuit that in January 1991 Mr. Palermo had lunch with her at a neighborhood restaurant, El Regalo de China, and offered her a permanent appointment as principal if she would pay him $18,000. Elaborating in an interview, Ms. Atlas said Mr. Palermo told her over a meal of chicken and broccoli that he "was broke and wasn't making ends meet." Ms. Atlas said she never paid Mr. Palermo and never received an appointment. A majority of the nine-member board would have had to approve Ms. Atlas's appointment. She and her husband are now teaching in a neighboring school district but want to win restoration as administrators. Mr. Palermo was removed from the board in April after Mr. Cutler accused him of brandishing a gun in a threatening manner out of fury that his office had been shifted. Mr. Palermo denied having a gun but pleaded guilty to a charge of menacing. In the same suit, Mr. Cutler accused Mr. Saez, the board's president, of repeatedly pressing him to raise money for a drum and bugle corps that Mr. Saez operated. Mr. Saez was the $35,000-a-year director of United Nautical Cadets, a community group that ran the New York Lancers Drum and Bugle Corps and operated tutoring, drug and teen-age pregnancy programs with over $300,000 in anti-poverty funds from the city's Community Development Agency. 'Had to Get Money' On his first day on the job in 1990, Mr. Cutler said in the lawsuit, Mr. Saez told him that the Lancers "had to get money." A short time later, he said, Mr. Saez told him that "if he was to retain his position as executive assistant" he had to "assure that $23,000 was raised for the Lancers." Then, Mr. Cutler charged, Mr. Saez offered him 25 percent of any funds he could raise for the Lancers. Mr. Saez was forced to resign from the Nautical Cadets last spring after the Community Development Agency accused him of seeking reimbursement for $1,051 in musical instruments purchased from a business that Mr. Saez owns. Responding in a telephone interview, Mr. Saez said Mr. Cutler and Ms. Atlas were "gold digging for some kind of monetary benefit" and "taking some half-truths and lies and putting them together in a sequence." He acknowledged that he had asked Mr. Cutler to raise money but said he had done so because Mr. Cutler had "sold himself as somebody with a lot of connections." "It was never tied to any duties here," Mr. Saez said.

504-> Connecticut Examines 2-Year-College Merger
Connecticut could save $7.5 million a year under a plan to merge the state's 17 community and technical colleges into five regional institutions. The Commission to Effect Government Reorganization approved the plan on Friday. Approval from the Legislature is also required. The proposal would eliminate 11 president positions and more than 100 other jobs but would not close any campuses. The new two-year system would be placed under the Connecticut State University system, with one central office and board of trustees. The University of Connecticut would remain a separate entity, but responsibility for its undergraduate programs at its regional branches would move to the new Connecticut State University and College system. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has proposed cutting the current $383.5 million general fund budget for higher education by $21.2 million next year. University of Connecticut officials oppose the plan. They said they do not have two-year programs that are easily transferable to community colleges.

Mr. Baker closed his tour of the Caucasus and Central Asia by meeting with President Islam Karimov and the opposition leaders in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, before flying with Mr. Karimov in his personal jet to visit the ancient Silk Route city of Samarkand. In Samarkand, Mr. Baker donned his cowboy hat and toured the mosaic-tiled 15th-century Muslim schools at Registan Square. Later, he flew off to Moscow for arms control talks with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on Monday. A Presidential List American officials said President Karimov, in his meeting with Mr. Baker, pulled a notebook out of his pocket and ticked off the American principles he was ready to embrace, as part of Washington's conditions for establishing diplomatic relations. These include commitments to free elections, respect for human rights and minorities and establishment of free markets. As happened on Mr. Baker's stops in other republics, Mr. Karimov, a former Communist party boss who originally expressed support for the August coup against the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, seemed to be taking a leaf of ideas from Mr. Baker's book. As Mr. Baker said, "The President in our meetings in effect recited those principles back to me today. I am well pleased by what I heard." From the start of his tour to Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Mr. Baker has acknowledged that while such declarations may be insincere, it is nevertheless useful to get public statements of allegiance to basic democratic principles, since it will establish a baseline against which to judge the leaders and determine the shape of American relations with them. The only problem with that argument, say some analysts, is that it ignores the fact that the United States may need and want relations with these countries for purely strategic reasons and should not get carried away with setting up human rights as the only yardstick, since it may soon have to be ignored. Abdul Rakhman Pulatov, one of four opposition leaders with whom Mr. Baker met, also argued that it was now time for the United States to establish an embassy in Uzbekistan, but he spoke of different reasons than President Karimov did. "I think that the sooner diplomatic relations are established, the better it will be for those forces that do not have democratic freedoms," said Mr. Pulatov, who heads a group called Birlik, or Unity, a populist Uzbek nationalist movement. "Politically we have no freedom at all, although officially we are registered. The totalitarian regime has been destroyed in Moscow, but in Tashkent it continues to exist." A Case Study Uzbek politics illustrate the generally unpalatable choices the United States has in considering which political forces, if any, to back here. On Dec. 29, Mr. Karimov won an election with 85 percent of the vote, but Birlik, the most popular opposition movement, was not allowed to field a candidate, nor was the Islamic Party of Rebirth. Moreover, the opposition movements in this nation of 20 million are hardly confirmed supporters of what the West refers to as democracy, but rather reflect shades of Uzbek nationalism and populism with a liberal patina. Ten percent of Uzbekistan's population, and half that of Tashkent's, is made up of Russians, Ukrainians and other Europeans, who tend to back Mr. Karimov because they believe he would best protect them from both the Islamic fundamentalists and the Uzbek nationalists, who want to purge the country of all Russian cultural influences. Uzbekistan's 45,000 Jews also generally support President Karimov. One prominent Jew, Issak R. Shimonov, said at his tiny Sephardic synagogue in Tashkent this morning that schools had been opened and teachers and rabbis brought from Israel. "Our community has experienced a revival," he said. "Fewer people are leaving now." That loosening of controls over religious groups applies even more to Uzbekistan's majority Muslims. Mufti Mukhamed Sadik Mukhamed Yusef, spiritual leader of the country's Muslims and its banned Party of Islamic Rebirth, declared recently: "The time has not yet come for me to be nominated president, but it will come." The truth, explained an Uzbek Foreign Ministry official, is that with Moscow no longer keeping an iron fist on the country, "no one really knows what the real balance of political forces are inside our country, there are no polls here and no social studies." American officials traveling with Mr. Baker also acknowledge that while the United States must forge ties with the leaders in Central Asia, the internal politics that will shape these republics remains a mystery. While it is true that Iranian influence on the Muslims exists, the Iranians hardly have the field to themselves. Not once while Mr. Baker traveled throughout Central Asia was a Moslem call to prayer from a mosque heard. While he was in Tajikistan, the language of choice in the hotel dining room seemed to be not Persian but Hebrew, spoken by a visiting Israeli agricultural delegation invited to advise the Tajikistan Government. Next week the foreign ministers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia are to tour the region, offering their own versions of Islamic politics and aid. "There are a lot of currents pulling in a lot of different directions out here," a Baker aide remarked.

506-> Indians Turning to Tribal Colleges For Opportunity and Cultural Values
For years Ted and Jenny Eagle moved through a rhythmless dance of dead-end jobs, empty pockets and, in desperate resignation, drunken staggers. The life of American Indians on the High Plains has proved little more promising for them than it was for their ancestors a century ago, when official policy held native tribes on vast and vacant reservations. But the Eagles, who live on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation here with their four children in a two-bedroom mobile home on a field of junked cars, recently decided to aim for a better life. Last fall Mr. Eagle, who is 44 years old, and Mrs. Eagle, 36, enrolled in college. They went to the only place they believed would believe in them: Standing Rock College, one of 24 colleges in the United States owned and operated by American Indians. It is a decision a relatively small but growing number of Indians are making as they increasingly turn to their own institutions for answers, understanding and their own brand of traditional values. 'Sensitive to Their Culture' "I think tribal colleges do for native Americans what predominantly Hispanic institutions do for Latinos, what historically black colleges do for African-Americans," said Richard C. Richardson Jr., professor of educational leadership and policy studies at Arizona State University. "They provide an institution that is sensitive to their culture and focuses on the needs of the communities that they represent." That sensitivity was the original motivation for tribal colleges, which were created because Indians living on reservations had few opportunities to obtain a postsecondary education near where they lived. And if they left their areas to get a higher education, many often dropped out because the mainstream colleges were generally unprepared or unwilling to deal with Indians' special needs. Long after blacks, Jews, Roman Catholics and other ethnic and religious groups had established colleges to serve their special needs, American Indians founded a string of their own colleges. The first tribal college, the Navajo Community College, was founded in 1968 on the Navajo Reservation in Tsaile, Ariz. Now there are 24 colleges on reservations and two more predominantly Indian colleges run by the Federal Government. But only 15 are fully accredited. All but three are two-year community colleges. Most Graduates Have Jobs The average tribal college student is 30 years old, female and has children, according to the American Indian College Fund, a nonprofit group that began to raise money for Indian colleges in 1989. More than 80 percent of those who do graduate are employed, fund officials said. The fund does not keep conclusive data on the number of students who drop out each year. But it notes that most of the dropouts eventually return. Last year at Standing Rock, 24 percent of the students dropped out; officials say this is generally typical of most tribal colleges. Some educators said they were concerned that Indian colleges that emphasize tribal values and traditions may be not be adequately preparing their students for work and life in the larger society off the reservation. In some tribal colleges, for example, competition among individual students gives way to a more Indian tradition of students working together to achieve. At one college an attempt is made to have male professors teach only male students because Indian tradition dictates that women teach women and men teach men, a tribal college official said. But in the case of people like the Eagles, a tribal college offers unusual sensitivity to their circumstances, special assistance to help them attend and a reasonable expectation for success that can lead them to aim for higher goals than they had thought possible. "When I came here I just wanted to get the basics so I could go to trade school," said Mr. Eagle, who left school at the age of 13 to break in horses for room and board. "When we signed up, our advisers talked about human services, and we kind of got interested in that." Because of their advisers' confidence in them, the Eagles said, they decided to set a more ambitious goal: becoming counselors for addicted adolescents. While sometimes makeshift, threadbare and meagerly staffed, the tribal colleges nonetheless represent a sharp departure in Indian education; historically, formal education has been imposed on tribes by outsiders, often with disastrous effects, tribal leaders and educators say. "Since white society came here, we were told that we were inferior," said David L. Archambault, the former president of Standing Rock College. "We were told everything about us was not good -- our language, traditions, culture." Tribal colleges, he said, strive to give American Indians a quality education while teaching them to preserve and enhance their understanding of a culture that has narrowly escaped extinction. "We have integrated native American history and culture in noncultural courses," said Ron McNeal, the new president of Standing Rock. "We use Indian examples in science, chemistry and biology, showing how our traditions contributed." Enrollment Statistics While precise numbers are sketchy, about 13,000 full- and part-time students attend the 24 tribal colleges -- those situated on or near Indian reservations -- and the two other Indian colleges operated by the Federal Government's Bureau of Indian Affairs, according to a survey of the colleges recently conducted by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a group representing all Indian colleges. Altogether, about 103,000 Indians were enrolled in college in 1990, the United States Department of Education, compared with 10.6 million whites, 1.2 million blacks and 758,000 Hispanic students. The nation's Indian population is about two million, according to the 1990 census. Typically small, tribal colleges have enrollments ranging from 80 to 1,800. And almost all the institutions are poorly financed. Most manage on modest annual assistance from the Federal Government -- about $3,000 for each Indian student -- plus private donations and tuition. But tuition is generally low, considering that most students come from areas steeped in multi-generational poverty, alcoholism and unemployment rates as high as 80 percent. Most of the tribal colleges are situated in the High Plains. Nearly two-thirds are clustered in North and South Dakota and Montana, with names like Dull Knife Memorial Community College, Little Hoop Community College and Oglala Lakota College. Only three of the 26 are four-year institutions; one, Sinte Gleska University in Rosebud, S.D., also offers a master's degree in education. Impressive Results By concentrating of Indian culture the colleges, already isolated geographically, may increase the Indian students' general isolation, said Dr. Richardson of the University of Arizona. But he and other education experts concede that close attention and sensitivity to Indian needs by tribal colleges have yielded some impressive results. "We've been most impressed with their concern for individual students and their recognition of the range of problems some of their students face, and their efforts to deal with them in a very practical and immediate way," said Jon W. Fuller, president of the Consortium for the Advancement of Private Higher Education, a nonprofit group that supports small private coleges. Discussing Indians who attend non-Indian universities, Mr. McNeal, the president of Standing Rock, said: "The problem is, when they go on to four-year institutions the success rate for the first year isn't nearly as good as that of the tribal colleges. There, they don't have the support system to allow students to achieve. Mr. McNeal, who is 33 and wears his hair long, much the way his great-great-great-grandfather, Sitting Bull, wore his, said a tribal college's mission is clear: "First and foremost, give your students the tools necessary -- an education -- to live and define themselves. That means being native American living in a predominantly non-Indian society." Varying from one tribal college to another, students are offered a wide range of courses, including standard college courses like English, mathematics and history. Many emphasize practical skills, especially those needed on reservations today. Topping the list are usually studies in land and resource management and human welfare and health services. A Mobile Classroom On a recent morning, Standing Rock College was busy with the commotion of students and teachers making their way to class. Outside, a sign with hand-painted letters in the shape of giant feathers makes the college -- two modest, single-story buildings on a muddy clearing -- look more like a tourist trading post than an institution of higher education. A recreational vehicle is parked outside. Equipped with portable computers, it is a mobile classroom that travels to the reservation's distant towns to offer college courses and high school equivalency classes. Ted and Jenny Eagle are lucky. They live only five miles from the college, and drive here each day in their old Oldsmobile because there is no public transportation. "I can't even get a clerical job because I don't have a one- or two-year certificate from a learning institution," said Mrs. Eagle, who wears her long hair parted neatly down the middle. "I looked at different avenues I could take and I had to make this decision for myself, my family and my children." A Struggle for Survival Mr. Eagle said he and his family had struggled for years to survive, sometimes turning to public assistance. He has earned money doing construction work, driving trucks and school buses and buying, selling and trading old cars and their parts. After a trucking accident 19 months ago left Mr. Eagle unable to do strenuous physical work, the couple decided to go back to school. When they graduate from Standing Rock, they plan to go to a four-year college off the reservation and earn bachelor's degrees. The Eagles said they want to counsel young Indians on the reservation to avoid the mistakes they made with alcohol. But it was a lack of a sufficient education, Mr. Eagle said, that stood as his greatest obstacle. "Some of the time it really got rough," he said. "It seemed like we tried almost everything." Now, they said, they are trying education.

508-> Southern Africa Hit By Its Worst Drought Of the 20th Century
As cornstalks lie withered on baked soil and dams show perilously low levels of water, southern Africa is in the grip of its worst drought this century, and meteorologists warn that it is spreading north to engulf the entire eastern side of the continent. While drought is commonplace in certain regions of Africa, weather and food experts say this year's dry spell is extraordinary for its sweep through food-exporting countries, which normally escape severe drought. Kenya Needs Imports "There is now a major drought from the Cape to Cairo that is really a serious, serious matter," said Harold Norton, the representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Kenya, who has worked in Africa for the last 25 years. "All the countries from South Africa to East Africa, all the way to Cairo, will be importing grains this year." To feed its own people, Kenya, which usually exports food, will have to import 500,000 tons of food this year and ask for humanitarian aid to feed refugees from Somalia, Mr. Norton said. With the nations of the former Soviet Union making bigger than ever demands on the West's food supply, Mr. Norton and officials of the United States Agency for International Development said allocations of food aid would have to be adjusted if the normally self-sufficient African countries are to be helped. "The United States is beginning to reassess food needs worldwide in order to help southern Africa," said Ted Morse, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office in Zimbabwe. The failure of rains, accompanied by unseasonally hot temperatures for the planting seasons in South Africa and Zimbabwe, means that these two food-exporting countries will have to import vast amounts of grain for the first time in memory, food experts said. In Zimbabwe, the hardest-hit country, acute water shortages are threatening the shutdown of industries centered around the town of Bulawayo, and schools have already started to close. In the arid north of Kenya at Marsabit, cattle belonging to the nomadic Turkana and Boran tribes, are dying, and thirsty people stand by the roadside begging for water from passing vehicles. An urgent warning by the World Meteorological Organization's drought-monitoring center for eastern and southern Africa says the coming seasonal rains will be weak in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. The head of the center, Dr. Workneh Degefu, said poor rains in Ethiopia would also affect Egypt because the major source of the Nile River is in western Ethiopia. The Sudan, which from time to time exports grain, will be importing food this year because of drought, Mr. Norton said. Weather experts said the poor rainfalls resulted from the meteorological phenonmenon known as El Nino, which refers to unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean, which affect global atmospheric circulation. Peter Usher, the head of the climate-change unit of the United Nations Environmental Program based in Nairobi, said that when El Nino occurs, there is often drought in northwest Brazil, East Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that global warming is affecting the weather in Africa, Mr. Usher said. "Shorter-term weather phenomena like El Nino are able to have a greater effect than global warming in Africa." The long rains that usually come in December and January to aid planting in southern Africa did not materialize, he said. And the short rains, meaning more violent, abrupt rains across equatorial eastern Africa, were very weak in the latter part of last year, he said. Food Reserves Already Low In southern Africa, the drought has hit at a time when food reserves were already low because of poor harvests last year. The Southern African Development Co-ordination Council said in a bulletin in January that all or parts of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe were affected by the drought and were suffering food shortages. The region may have to import more than seven million tons of food from August this year to May 1993, compared with normal imports of two million tons, according to F.A.O. and A.I.D. estimates. South Africa alone, usually the world's sixth-largest exporter of grain, will have to import four million tons of corn, according to the F.A.O. Estimates of the corn crop run as low as 25 percent of normal. In neighboring Namibia, the deputy director of agriculture, Lutz Matthiesen, said 80 percent of the commercial corn crop had been lost. "Whether widespread rains fall in March and April or not will only make a marginal difference to the situation," he said. But in Zimbabwe, where it is already difficult to buy corn meal, the dietary staple, the effects of the drought have extended far beyond the crops. In Bulawayo, the western industrial center, water rationing in homes permits a little over 420 quarts a day. "That allows a small bath and some left over for washing," said Daniel Kinnear, an environmental expert who lives there. "People are obeying the rationing because they are scared." Only 12 weeks of water supply is left in the local reservoirs, and industries, including the big textile mills, face closure, officials say. The once vibrant Zimbabwean dairy industry is in ruins. "In just two years we have been reduced from a sophisticated first-world dairy industry to one of subsistence and mere survival," said Alan Burl, the president of the Commercial Farmers Union. About 30 percent of the commercial cow herd may be slaughtered because stockfeeds will have to be imported and thus will be too expensive, said Doug Pascoe, the director of the National Association of Dairy Farmers. And Zimbabwe's food shortage has a ripple effect on surrounding countries. Mozambique, for instance, has relied on Zimbabwe's corn to feed the large number of people displaced by the civil war, and food for more than one million Mozambican refugees in southern Malawi has come from Zimbabwe. Farther north, in Kenya, the drought has aggravated already low farm production caused by marketing or pricing factors, many say. In the capital, Nairobi, the effects of drought have been clear for the last month. Butter has disappeared from the grocery stores, and milk is difficult to buy because of low output in the dairy industry. Many residential homes are without water as the water authority tries to distribute what is left of the supply fairly.

509-> Smog Proposal In California
A "smog exchange" for Southern California, in which polluting companies would buy credits from clean ones, won preliminary approval on Thursday night. The 2,800-company exchange is intended to give businesses incentives to meet clean-air goals rather than to order them to comply through specific regulations. "There's gold in that brown haze," Henry W. Wedaa, chairman of the Air Quality Management District, said before the board voted 8 to 1 to order its staff to design the program over the next year. The plan would still need a final approval by the board. The proposed Regional Clean Air Incentives Market would include big polluters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Of the total number of companies covered, 2,000 emit 85 percent of smog-forming hydrocarbons, 700 release 95 percent of all polluting nitrogen-oxide emissions, and 100 emit nearly all of the sulfur oxides. The plan calls for issuing companies permits that have a certain value like shares of stock -- not in dollars but in pounds of pollutants. The permits would be for hydrocarbons or oxides of nitrogen, the primary components of smog. Each year, the stock "value" would shrink, forcing companies to reduce emissions. Businesses that exceed clean-air goals could sell pollution credits to dirtier companies. The plan would eliminate about 40 existing or proposed clean-air rules.

510-> BASKETBALL; Brooklyn's Last Hope Is Lost in Manhattan
For a few hours yesterday afternoon, the Cinderella run of Lafayette High School in the Public Schools Athletic League basketball playoffs reached unimagined heights. But then came the fall, crash and burn. The Frenchies were eliminated by small but quick Brandeis High School, 56-50, last night at Manhattan Community College. Their dream of going to Madison Squre Garden for the championship game next Saturday died at the free-throw line, where they missed 12 of 21 attempts. "Our old nemesis," said the disappointed coach, Ira Levine, who had never come this far in his 11-year coaching career. Al Burt led Brandeis with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Antonio Carrasquillo had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Frenchies. Lincoln High School, ruler of Brooklyn, defending champion of the city, had been wishing Lafayette the best, after losing earlier in the day to Manhattan Center, 69-51. "They're the only ones left and I hope they do it," said Don Marbury Sr., who has sent four basketball-playing sons to Lincoln from his home in Coney Island, including 14-year-old Stephon, Lincoln's freshman point guard. Manhattan Center Wins He was standing in the corridor at Manhattan Community, trying to make some sense of the loss at the hands of smaller, less-heralded Manhattan Center with the Lincoln coach, Bobby Hartstein. Lincoln had come into the game with 22 victories in 24 tries, 16-0 in the strong Brooklyn Division I, but Manhattan Center's Running Rams blew Lincoln away with a mixture of slashing drives and jump shots, with a pair of 5-foot-10-inch guards, Cameron Giles and Sherman Jones, combining for 35 points. Lincoln's best shooter, Darryle Flicking, hit 6 of 20 shots from the field. The Rams' badly outsized center, 6-1 George Williams, nonetheless outplayed 6-7, Seton Hall-bound Tchaka Shipp, with 13 points and 11 rebounds. Then, as the seconds wound down, Williams stood in the middle of the floor and started to cry. To his credit, Hartstein, despite this bitter ending, would have none of that. All he and Marbury could come up with was respect for Manhattan Center's stunning performance. "They hit incredible shots the whole game," said Hartstein, remembering one in particular that "one kid just threw in over his head." "It was just destiny," said Marbury, shaking his head. Determining Factor? Maybe, they conceded, it was just another sign that something big was in the cards for Levine's Frenchies. The senior Marbury said it would please him to see Lafayette and Carrasquillo, its 6-9 center, pick up the ball for Lincoln. He thought Carrasquillo, who gives Lafayette a weapon against the presses of the quick Manhattan teams, might be the determining factor in who wins the title. "I saw Bobby play against Lafayette and it's hard to press them," he said. "They just lob the ball to Antonio on the in-bounds play and go from there. "It would be a great thing for that kid, too, because if you'd have seen Antonio four years ago, you wouldn't believe it was the same kid. He used to come out on the court in Coney Island like this." Marbury hunched his shoulders halfway to the floor. "Ira's done a great job with him, with that whole team," he said. "It'd be a great story if they did it." With no disrespect to Manhattan intended, Coney Island was dreaming of a Lincoln-Lafayette final. Those two schools both reached the baseball semis last spring, where Lincoln lost to Tottenville before Lafayette won the title. Most of Lincoln's players are from Coney Island, as are a few of Lafayette's, including Carrasquillo and Hardin Desire. Lincoln's Turn to Lose Dexter Wooten was to be Lafayette's point guard until he was shot three times in November. His brother, Derrick, who was shot two days before Dexter, goes to Lincoln, but was cut this year by Hartstein. "Would've been a nice familylike thing," Marbury said. Not to be. First Grady, the runner-up to Lincoln in Brooklyn Division I, had been excused from the playoffs by Brandeis. Yesterday it was Lincoln's turn. When Levine's team gathered at the school in Bensonhurst for the trip into "the city," the players had no idea Lincoln had lost. They found out when they reached the gym. The Frenchies, for at least a few hours, were the kings of Brooklyn. THE SERIES SO FAR This series of articles has focused on the efforts of the Lafayette High School basketball team as it has sought to overcome the urban handicaps of meager financing, danger in the streets and the loss of a top star who was hurt in a shooting last year. The three previous articles followed the players through the early rounds of the Public Schools Athletic League playoffs.

511-> Robert Hyland, 71, CBS Radio Executive
Robert Hyland, the senior vice president of CBS Radio and general manager of KMOX radio, died on Thursday at his home here. He was 71 years old. He died of cancer, his family said. Mr. Hyland joined the network-owned KMOX 41 years ago as national sales manager and was credited with its later position as one of the nation's top news-talk stations in terms of advertising. William Paley, the founder of CBS, called KMOX "the jewel in CBS's crown." Mr. Hyland was the only radio executive at CBS to be named a senior vice president. He was offered the presidency of CBS Sports and of the CBS Radio Network, but turned them down to remain in his native St. Louis. His list of firsts in the industry include the inauguration in 1960 of the talk format that has since been adopted by some 2,000 radio stations around the world. Under Mr. Hyland, KMOX was also the first CBS-owned station to endorse a political candidate. Mr. Hyland was president of the St. Louis Zoo Commission and board chairman of St. Anthony's Medical Center. He was a founding member of the organization responsible for the building of the Gateway Arch, which has become a symbol of St. Louis. He is survived by his wife, Pat; two sons, Robert 3d and Matt; a daughter, Molly; a brother, William, and six grandchildren.

512-> Spectators Stand in Line for History
They took the 10:43 P.M. train from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and after a drink, finally made it to the glassy front of the United States Courthouse in Brooklyn. At 2:15 A.M. yesterday, Frank Mora and Gary Dayton were the first in line to see John Gotti's trial -- but not by much. The 17th person arrived at 5:10 A.M. -- and was the last yesterday morning to squeeze into the courtroom, leaving behind a daylong trail of disappointed Gotti watchers. "This is a bit of American legal history being made -- it will be up there with the Al Capone trials," said one of the earliest arrivals, Pat Russo, 23 years old, a law student. Since Salvatore Gravano took the stand on Monday to testify against his former boss, Mr. Gotti, the number of spectators has risen from about 50 each day to well over 100, court guards say. And every morning, more people are coming earlier and earlier for one of roughly 34 seats -- 17 in the morning session, and the next 17 on line in the afternoon. Those who make it are the most obsessive of court buffs and they must strain to see Mr. Gotti and Mr. Gravano from the courtroom's last two rows. But they say it is worth the wait. "I think he's sleazy," Gale Burnick, 42, said of Mr. Gotti. "I do believe he is a very powerful man but I don't like what do does at all." Ozzie Conforti, 75, a retired Army mechanic from Staten Island, did not see it that way. He is what is known as a "C.B.C." -- a certified court buff. This is his fourth Gotti trial, and the experience makes him talk like a sportscaster: "He looks very pale, maybe a little on the scary side," Mr. Conforti said of Mr. Gravano. "But Gotti looks good, a lot of color in his face. He looks like he got back from Florida. "Between you and I," he added, "I don't think he's that bad a guy. I wouldn't mind having him as my neighbor."

513-> Kelly Saletan Has Wedding
Kelly Ruth Saletan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Saletan of Upper Saddle River, N.J., was married last evening to Richard Scott Grunther, a son of Dr. and Mrs. Howard Grunther of New York. Rabbi Philip H. Berkowitz officiated at Abigail Kirsch at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown, N.Y. Mrs. Grunther, 25 years old, is the public-relations manager for the children's book division of Random House in New York. She graduated from the University of Rochester. Her father owns Brother's Poultry, a distributorship in Brooklyn. Mr. Grunther, 25, is a product manager with Whitehall Laboratories, a pharmaceutical manufacturing division of American Home Products. He graduated from Colgate University. His father, a radiologist in New York, is a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical School.

514-> Fox Signs Chevy Chase For a Late-Night Show
The Fox Broadcasting Company moved to join the increasing competition in late-night talk shows yesterday by announcing that it had signed Chevy Chase to be the host of a comedy-talk show. Fox said Mr. Chase had agreed to a multi-year deal that would allow him to develop and produce series for its television production company, 20th Television, and to star in a feature film for 20th Century Fox. The deal hinged on the agreement that Mr. Chase, who gained fame in the original cast of "Saturday Night Live," would return to late-night television. Because of the comedian's previous commitments, the new Chase series will not begin until fall 1993, Fox said. The show is to be on six nights a week, including a Saturday show composed partly of repeated material from that week. The Saturday show would set up Mr. Chase to compete with his old show on NBC.

516-> THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; Alzheimer's Dilemma: Whether to Tell People They Have the Disease
YOU notice your memory is off a little. You pause in a conversation, unable to find the right word. It is harder to keep track of things. When asked about something you have just read, the answer escapes you. You cannot remember someone's name. Sometimes you even forget where you are. After shopping, you do not remember where you parked. You misplace the keys. You forget to meet your spouse at the bank as planned. At tennis, you sometimes serve to the wrong court. No one comments on the memory lapses, but as they get worse and worse family members know that something is wrong. Eventually they insist you visit a doctor. But in making the appointment, they tell the doctor they fear the diagnosis will be Alzheimer's disease. From the outset, they insist that the doctor keep the diagnosis from you. This reticence is not uncommon. But now it is being openly questioned. After years of increasing frankness between doctor and patient, Alzheimer's disease may be the last taboo. People who learned long ago to speak frankly about cancer, AIDS and a host of other medical problems still cannot bear to acknowledge that a relative has Alzheimer's or another dementing disease. And the doctor may be willing to oblige. Few tasks are sadder than telling patients they have a fatal illness, and in many ways, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the most devastating of all. Alzheimer's, whose cause is unknown, produces slowly progressive dementia and deterioration of the brain. It affects an estimated two million Americans. It can occur at any age but strikes with increasing prevalence in old age. It has become a leading cause of death among Americans 65 years and older, though doctors sometimes omit it from death certificates. Alzheimer's is not only fatal, but it robs people of one of the most fundamental things that make them human -- memory, personality and the ability to think. Should doctors tell patients that they are in the early throes of Alzheimer's? Many people reflexively say yes. But there are plenty who argue that telling the truth might cause more harm than good. These people fear that a patient aware enough to understand the diagnosis might commit suicide or suffer some other catastrophic reaction from learning the terrible news. Whether to tell Alzheimer's patients their diagnosis is a question that needs to be addressed more openly, Dr. Margaret A. Drickamer and Dr. Mark S. Lachs of Yale University said in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Precise statistics are lacking on how often doctors tell patients they have Alzheimer's disease. There is no universal policy, because it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in its early stages. Early Alzheimer's usually involves only memory problems. Recall of recent events goes first. As the disease progresses, distant memory goes, too. Later, Alzheimer's can also involve physical deterioration. Walking, speaking and swallowing can be difficult. Incontinence is common. As Alzheimer's advances, people may wander aimlessly from home. Because people with Alzheimer's have impaired memory and a strong tendency to deny their condition, doctors usually discuss the diagnosis with the patient and the family, separately as well as together. This is when doctors practice the art of medicine, the humanistic side that involves sensitivity and discretion and that cannot be specified in textbooks. They judge personalities and family relationships and individualize what they say. And how much information can be successfully communicated depends in part on how far advanced Alzheimer's is when a patient first seeks medical care. Because patients often hide their condition, by the time family members notice something is wrong the disease may no longer be in the early stages. Doctors who treat Alzheimer's say they have to deal with two principals: the patient and the family. And patients and families may be at odds with each other. Some patients know something is wrong but hide it. Others voluntarily seek medical care on their own, demand to know the diagnosis, but are adamantly against telling their family. Other patients are coerced into a visit to a doctor by family members who suspect the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and they often have compelling arguments against telling their mother or father. Some doctors say they usually specify Alzheimer's with families and in the medical records but often use some other phrase like "senile memory problem" in talking to patients. So confusion can result because doctors' notes in the records may include observations that patients and families say they were not told about. The case against telling an Alzheimer's patient the diagnosis, as outlined by the Yale doctors, hinges on the imprecision of current diagnostic tests and lack of effective therapy. A definitive diagnosis can be made only from an autopsy. Because there is no specific blood or other test for Alzheimer's, the diagnosis is generally made by excluding other conditions and by eliciting information from the medical history and from psychological tests. But psychological tests cannot precisely distinguish memory loss due to early Alzheimer's from normal aging and other problems. It is common for people as they move into their 40's and beyond to fail to find the exact words in conversation and to become more forgetful than when they were younger. Thus, in the early stages of Alzheimer's, doctors may be able to tell patients only that they have a possible or probable case of Alzheimer's. The diagnosis may become clear only with repeated examinations to discern progressive memory loss. But the course is often unpredictable. By the time the diagnosis is clear, an Alzheimer's patient may no longer be able to comprehend the new information, making discussion almost futile. The dilemma about telling the diagnosis is greatest for patients who can understand at least something about their problem, and they are among the ones most vulnerable to depression or suicide. A major reason against telling someone is the stigma that patients and others attach to Alzheimer's. The social ostracism and discrimination for Alzheimer's can rival that associated with AIDS. But usually there are more powerful and persuasive reasons to tell. People have the right to make responsible decisions affecting their finances, wills and their care as they become sicker and more dependent on others. To decide, people must be given the most accurate information about their condition while their minds are intact. Experts say even patients with early Alzheimer's can be competent to make wills. Doctors are sometimes asked to document that patients understand what they are doing, and know whom they are including and excluding as heirs and why. New therapies for Alzheimer's can be developed only if patients say they are willing to volunteer for research studies. Thus, Alzheimer patients need to make their wishes known while they are competent to do so. But there are problems because Alzheimer's is widely considered to be the last medical taboo. Many affected people keep silent about Alzheimer's, just as years ago others refused to say they had cancer. With wider public discussion about cancer and progress in developing new therapies for it, most American cancer patients now are told their diagnosis. But the taboo holds in other countries and cultures. In the United States, many Alzheimer families now say a relative has cancer because they perceive cancer to be a more socially acceptable diagnosis. In fact, at families' requests, a San Francisco clinic devoted to memory and Alzheimer's removed the word "Alzheimer's" from a sign over its door. Knowing the diagnosis of Alzheimer's can benefit patients and families because they can learn how to deal with the behavioral and other changes that usually appear as the disease advances, said Dr. Barry Reisberg, a leading expert at New York University. Many Alzheimer's patients wake up frequently during the night. They can be paranoid, thinking friends and relatives are stealing from them and wanting to call the police. They can hallucinate and be noisy, keeping others up at night. Some become combative and hit a spouse for the first time in a long, harmonious marriage. Knowing that these actions are part of the disease can make them easier for friends and family to bear. Knowledge of the diagnosis can help in other ways, said Dr. Leon J. Epstein, an expert in geriatric psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco. For example, serious depression is common among Alzheimer's patients and it often responds to drugs, Dr. Epstein said. But the Alzheimer's does not. The day may come when a test will allow people to learn as young adults their precise chances of developing Alzheimer's. Many will welcome such an advance. But others, who cannot handle that knowledge, will not. But without a cure or effective therapy, the dilemma over whether to tell or not may become even greater for doctors, patients and families.

517-> Gains by Anti-Immigrant Parties Rattle Bonn
Shocked by the success of far-right parties in state elections on Sunday, German political leaders vowed today to work urgently to resolve the explosive immigration question, which had been exploited by the right. Party officials agreed to hold discussions to find a compromise, and Parliament scheduled a debate and vote on new proposals for April 30. During the campaigns leading to the two elections Sunday, the far-right said that by accepting too many foreign residents, Germany was becoming a multi-cultural society against the will of its citizens. Results in Two States In the southern state of Baden-Wurttemburg, part of Germany's industrial heartland, the far-right Republican party won 10.9 percent of the vote, entitling it to 15 seats in the 146-seat legislature. Another rightist party, the German People's Union, won 6.3 percent in the farm state of Schelswig-Holstein, where it will get 6 of the 89 seats. Neither party had previously held seats in any state legislature. The Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Helmut Kohl did poorly in both states, but the opposition Social Democrats also lost ground. Disenchanted voters from both parties evidently turned to the far right. "All of us, including the Christian Democrats, have good reason to think carefully," Chancellor Kohl said at a news conference today. Must Accept Limits, Kohl Says Mr. Kohl also acknowledged that underlying dissatisfaction about the cost of German unification might have driven some voters toward radical parties. He invited his critics to suggest which of Germany's foreign and domestic burdens should be reduced. "One or another of the things we want to do, we are not going to be able to do," Mr. Kohl said. The Republican Party, now Germany's main far-right political group, is dominated by a former member of the Nazi SS, Franz Schonhuber. His fortunes, and those of his party, had seemed to be fading, but since the election he has been proclaiming himself a symbol of German renewal. Leaders of the German People's Union seek to distance themselves from pro-Nazi sentiments. But they insist that most Germans want to live in a racially pure country, and blame many domestic problems on the influx of foreigners. The immigration crisis has been building for some time. Migrants lured by relatively generous social benefits are pouring into German at the rate of more than 1,000 a day, most asserting that they were politically persecuted in their homelands. Although public anger over the issue is rising, political leaders have been unable to agree on a solution. Chancellor Kohl and his supporters favor altering the constitution to restrict the right to asylum, but Social Democrats say that will not be effective. A growing number of officials are suggesting that Germany adopt a quota under which a limited number of foreigners would be allowed to settle here each year, even if they had not been persecuted at home. By adopting such a system, however, Germany would be accepting its status as an "immigration country," something that is anathema to many citizens. Why the Right Did Well Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the country's director of immigrant affairs, called on the major political parties today to "stop blocking a solution" to the asylum issue. "We must finally come up with an immigration policy that is clear and understandable to everyone," she said in a statement. One loser in the elections, Erwin Teufel, Premier of Baden-Wurttemburg, attributed the surge in support for rightist parties principally to the asylum issue. Mr. Teufel will likely retain his office, but for the first time in 20 years, his Christian Democrats will have to rule in coalition. "I have said before that there is no more than a 2.5 percent base vote for far-right parties in Germany," Mr. Teufel said. "For them to win more votes than that, they have to have a special issue. This time they had the asylum issue. "I am quite sure that these people can be won back to the democratic parties when this issue fades. When that happens, the Republicans will be voted out of the state legislature as quickly as they have been voted in." Not everyone was so sanguine. Heinz Galinski, head of Germany's largest Jewish organization, warned, "Whoever plays down this dramatic shift to the right as just a protest vote is deeply mistaken." Statistics show that most foreigners flowing into Germany are coming from crisis zones like Yugoslavia and poverty-stricken lands like Romania. Chancellor Kohl warned today that Western countries would have to support large-scale aid to these regions if they hoped to avoid further increases in immigration. "If we don't want them to come to us," he said, "we have to help them so they can have better lives at home."

519-> U.N. Agencies Would Find a Welcome Just Across East River
To the Editor: As "New York Rediscovers the U.N." (editorial, June 2) points out, the negative impact on New York City if four United Nations agencies that are being wooed to relocate were to leave, would be immense. The loss would be greater than the hundreds of millions of dollars of revenues generated through salaries, expenses, tourism and conferences. The stature of New York as an international center is at stake. Relocation of these agencies could be the harbinger of the departure of most, if not all, United Nations operations. Western Queens is an ideal location for the four agencies, as well as other United Nations administrative operations. There are two facilities that can accommodate the world body's needs. You fail to mention that Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, has a Jan. 1, 1995, relocation target date. The International Design Center of New York is one of the final sites under consideration. Its facilities could readily accommodate Unicef and the other agencies. La Guardia Community College would welcome as its neighbor an adjacent Unicef-United Nations campus. To the best of our ability, we would make our facilities and resources available to support their operations including a highly diverse staff and student body that speaks more than 65 languages. The presence of Unicef in western Queens would give additional incentive to develop the Hunters Point area, which could, in part, be designed to accommodate the long-term needs of the United Nations, including a conference center. It is critical that the New York political and business leadership come together to support a single comprehensive plan that will insure the continued presence of the United Nations and its operations in New York City. RAYMOND C. BOWEN President, Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College, CUNY Long Island City, Queens, June 8, 1992

522-> COMPANY NEWS; 'Savior' Tells Olympia Its U.S. Unit Defaulted
Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong billionaire and partner of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. in several properties, has notified the company's American subsidiary that it defaulted on a $57.5 million mortgage on a lower Manhattan office building. Mr. Li -- one of the richest men in Hong Kong -- was regarded as a savior of Olympia & York just eight months ago, when he bought a $160 million maturing bank mortgage on 60 Broad Street from CalFed Inc. But now he could force Olympia's American subsidiary into bankruptcy protection if he seeks a judgment against it. Some high-level Olympia executives flew to Hong Kong this week to try to placate Mr. Li. Olympia & York Developments Ltd. declared insolvency in May and is now under the protection of a Toronto bankruptcy court. Its British arm, which built the Canary Wharf project in East London, is also bankrupt. Trying to Avoid Bankruptcy The Reichmann family of Toronto, which owns and controls the conglomerate, is trying to avoid having the American subsidiary seek bankruptcy protection. That subsidiary, which has more than 22 million square feet of commercial space in New York City and a scattering of smaller buildings throughout the country, is about $5.9 billion in debt and in technical default on virtually all its mortgage obligations. After meeting with Mr. Li, some Olympia executives will fly on to Tokyo to try to gain the support of the company's Japanese creditors for a general restructuring of its American assets. It is not clear whether Mr. Li's default notification was intended to establish his position as a secured creditor should there be a sudden bankruptcy filing or he intends to force the company's hand in court. He has a 49 percent interest in an Olympia & York partnership that owns 60 Broad Street, and it is not widely known what kind of guarantees or other claims he might have against the company. Executives of the company's American unit have been working feverishly for several months to keep creditors from pressing their claims in court. Most major bank lenders seem supportive of the company's restructuring efforts, but some banks with small loans, especially Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden and Bank Leumi of Israel, have been less willing to cooperate, according to bank executives and others involved in the talks. In addition, the company issued billions in public debt that must be renegotiated. Investors Are Sought The company has retained Lazard Freres & Company, the New York investment bank, to seek investors for some of its assets. It managed to retain an option to participate in a major mixed-use development in San Francisco despite having failed to make a $2 million payment due last week. An agreement with the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency gives it eight months to exercise an option to buy its way back into the development. Olympia has already spent about $25 million on predevelopment land purchases and planning costs for the project and stands to lose that if it does not exercise its option. In a separate matter, a $33 million loan made to an Olympia & York unit and secured by notes from the JMB Realty Corporation, a large Chicago real estate company and investment manager, will be restructured so Olympia will not have to come up with the full amount of the loan this Friday.

524-> Martin McKneally, Legion Commander And Attorney, 77
Martin B. McKneally, a former New York state and national commander of the American Legion who served one term as a Republican Congressman and later pleaded guilty to income-tax evasion, died on Sunday at the Castle Point Veteran's Administration Hospital near Beacon, N.Y. He was 77 years old and lived in Newburgh, N.Y. He died of pancreatic cancer, said one of his sisters, Catherine Curry of Cornwall, N.Y. As national Legion commander in 1959, Mr. McKneally declared that the American Legion was cutting its public ties with its 40 & 8 Society because of the society's rule limiting membership to white people. He said the group would be forbidden to use the American Legion name or emblem. As commander he also criticized some movie producers for employing writers who had been blacklisted as subversive or politically radical, and he declared that the Legion would, as he put it, continue to fight for the extermination of un-Americanism in movies until it was "nonexistent." Mr. McKneally was born in Newburgh, the son of a plumbing contractor. He went to schools in Newburgh and was graduated from Holy Cross College in 1936 and from Fordham University Law School in 1940. He was in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank of major and serving as a staff officer in the Pacific. He then practiced law in New York and Newburgh. He was state Legion commander in 1956 and 1957 and national commander in 1959 and 1960. He was elected to Congress in 1968, but he lost in a bid for re-election in 1970 after charges that he had failed to file some income-tax returns. In December 1971 Judge James T. Foley of Federal District Court in Albany placed him on probation for a year and fined him $5,000 after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he had filed no income tax on income of $24,000 for 1965. The judge said his was a "crime of omission rather than commission." In addition to Mrs. Curry, Mr. McKneally is survived by two other sisters, Dorothy Leavy of Wilmington, Del., and Elizabeth Auffredou of Cornwall.

527-> 6 Rescued After 'Bulletproof' Ship Goes Down
Six men were rescued today after their boat, perhaps the world's largest private sport fishing vessel, sank about 100 miles southeast of Cape May in bad weather. The Lady Anna began taking on water shortly after midnight, said Petty Officer Jim Krause of the United States Coast Guard. The boat is owned by a major New Jersey developer, Hirair Hovnanian, who was on board at the time. "We don't know what happened," Mr. Krause said. "They never had time to find out. It sank within 5 minutes." All fixtures, hinges and screws on the 121-foot vessel are said to be gold-plated. The aluminum-hulled craft was described as "close to bulletproof" in a yacht magazine. Mr. Krause said the Coast Guard, which put the boat's value at $10 million, did not believe the vessel had hit anything because it was sailing in 428 feet of water. He said the weather was "very bad," with 20-knot winds and 10- to 12-foot waves. The six men drifted in a life raft for about four hours before two Coast Guard helicopters noticed their flashing beacon about 4:30 A.M. Besides Mr. Hovnanian, 61 years old, the men on the vessel were Capt. Frank Lumbrecht, 40, of Boynton Beach, Fla.; Michael Nelson, 42, of Palm Beach, Fla.; Ken Scherf, 39, of Sydney, Australia; Jack Mayer, of Brick, N.J., whose age was not given, and Michael Christensen, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The men were not seriously injured and refused medical treatment, Mr. Krause said. He said they were returning to Florida. While the Coast Guard said the Lady Anna was the world's second-largest private sport fishing vessel, Jim Gilbert, editor in chief of Showboats International, a Florida-based publication that specializes in mega-yachts, said it was the largest. An interview with Mr. Hovnanian appears in the September issue of the magazine, in which he discusses a dispute over the cost of the ship with its builder, Denison Marine Trade Center in Dania, Fla. Kit Denison, the company's president, said that Mr. Hovnanian took the incomplete vessel from his shipyard around midnight on July 15, 1991, and still owes him $398,000. But in the magazine interview, Mr. Hovnanian said the disagreement existed with the builder over a charge he said was "somewhere between $10 and $15 thousand" and claimed he took the ship because Mr. Denison was going to drydock the boat. Gone in the Night The cost of the Lady Anna, Mr. Hovnanian said in the interview, was about $2 million over the original contract. Mr. Denison, in a telephone interview today, said: "He did remove the vessel illegally. He came into the yard and hauled the boat out, and he did it at night." Mr. Denison said that Mr. Hovnanian claimed he paid $1.3 million too much for the boat. Mr. Denison would not provide the total cost of the ship's construction but said it was over $5 million. Mr. Denison said he had not filed a lawsuit over the dispute. Mr. Hovnanian could not be reached for comment. A woman answering the phones at Hovson, Mr. Hovnanian's company in Toms River, N.J., said employees had been told not to speak with reporters. Marc Nadeau, of the naval architecture firm Langlois & Nadeau, said the boat's hull was very strong. He said the magazine article called it "close to bulletproof." "That hull will take anything the ocean dishes out," Mr. Nadeau said.

When BARRY TUCKWELL, the French horn player, married SUE ELLIOTT on June 21, they asked their friends not to send wedding presents. Instead, they suggested contributions to the Maryland Symphony Orchestra and the Maryland Theater in Hagerstown; Mr. Tuckwell founded the orchestra, and Mrs. Tuckwell is president of the theater. So far, the couple said yesterday, the contributions total $9,089. "We wanted to do something for the orchestra and the theater," said Mrs. Tuckwell, who is also director of customer relations for the Potomac Edison Company. Mr. Tuckwell added: "Besides that, we have plenty of knives and forks."

529-> Homeless Man Denied Hearing
A Federal appeals court has denied an additional hearing for a homeless New Jersey man who charged that his civil rights were violated when the Morristown library ejected him. Richard Kreimer, a homeless man whose penchant for litigation has made him a household name in Morristown, had won a decision in Federal District Court preventing him from being expelled by the local library, which said that others patrons were disturbed because he stared at them and had offensive body odor. Judge H. Lee Sarokin had ruled that the library's regulations violated the First Amendment by curtailing Mr. Kreimer's access to books, newspapers and other library materials. But, in March, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit here overturned Judge Sarokin's opinion. A three-judge panel ruled unanimously that a library is a limited public forum that can restrict access in order to further the goals of the library. That ruling did not affect an agreement in which Mr. Kreimer agreed to drop a lawsuit charging police harassment in exchange for $250,000 from the town and library. After the panel ruled, Mr. Kreimer requested a hearing before the full court, which has 11 judges. The request was denied on Tuesday, according to the clerk's office at the circuit court. Frank Askin, a law professor who heads Rutgers University's Constitutional Law Clinic, said Mr. Kreimer's remaining option was to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. "We have 90 days to file a petition," said Mr. Askin, who argued Mr. Kreimer's case before the appeals court. "I want to talk to other A.C.L.U. people before we do anything. I know Richard would like to."

530-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Soybeans Up 10 1/2¦ a Bushel; Corn and Oats Also Climb
Soybean futures prices jumped more than 10 cents a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid uncertain prospects for rain in the Midwest, where dry weather is hampering crop growth. Corn and oat prices also rose on the Chicago futures market, but wheat futures fell modestly on profit taking and harvest-related selling. On other commodity markets, oil futures rose, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Soybeans for July delivery rose 10 1/2 cents to settle at $6.14 a bushel. The advance extended an upward trend that began a week earlier. July wheat fell 2 1/4 cents, to $3.49 1/2 a bushel; July corn climbed 2 1/2 cents, to $2.59 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 2 1/4 cents, to $1.34 a bushel. Soybean prices are especially sensitive to weather because the Government has projected declining United States soybean stocks through August 1993. Gerald Zusel, vice president in the grain-trading division of E.D.&F. International Futures Inc., said yesterday's action signaled that the market expected less rain in the Midwest over the next four days than some forecasters had predicted. The most optimistic forecasts were for up to an inch of rain last night and today in southern Illinois, central Indiana and most of Ohio. However, after the close, the National Weather Service released a series of forecasts predicting warm, dry weather in the Midwest during the latter half of next week; mostly normal conditions in the region for the month of June, and a hot, dry summer. William Biedermann, research director with Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in Crystal Lake, Ill., said a lot more rain was needed in Illinois and Indiana. This month is expected to go down as the driest May on record in Illinois. "Even an inch of rain in the type of soil conditions we have right now will not last very long," Mr. Biedermann said He said crops planted on hilltops still had not germinated throughout Illinois and Indiana because it had been so dry. But Mr. Zusel said no lasting damage has been done to the soybean crop. Most energy futures ended higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil recovered from an early 20-cents-a-barrel loss and finished with a 16-cent gain. Analysts said the oil market was seeking an appropriate level after skyrocketing Tuesday on reports that Saudi Arabia might favor higher crude prices. Light sweet crude oil for July delivery rose 16 cents, to $22.11 a barrel; June heating oil expired at 60.50 cents a gallon, up 0.54 cent; June unleaded gasoline expired at 65.91 cents a gallon, up 0.68 cent; July natural gas rose 0.8 cent, to $1.625 for 1,000 cubic feet. Most cattle futures rebounded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on perceptions that Thursday's decline marked the end of a downward trend. Most pork futures fell, though, extending Thursday's losses amid expectations for another heavy hog slaughter on Monday.

531-> Diet May Play a Role In Menopause Effects
To the Editor: You report on hormonal treatments of troublesome menopause symptoms (Science Times, May 19) and indicate that other treatments are not well documented. All the more reason to examine life style and diet in a scientific way. Japanese women have a much lower incidence of hot flushes than counterparts in Europe or the United States, a striking difference unlikely to be accounted for by cultural differences. Researchers (some quoted in the May 16 Lancet) have found that the traditional Japanese low-animal-fat diet gave subjects a high urinary level of phyto-estrogens. Levels were 100 to 1,000 times higher than among subjects on a Western diet. The findings are associated with such soy products in the diet as tofu, miso and atuage. The weak estrogens found in comparatively high amounts in the urine could have beneficial effects, especially in postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels. High levels of phyto-estrogens may partly explain what makes hot flushes and other bothersome symptoms of menopause so infrequent in Japanese women. MARC CANTILLON, M.D. New York, May 23, 1992

533-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Ends the Day Mixed As Traders Take a Breather
The dollar was mixed in subdued trading yesterday, a sharp change from Tuesday's hectic dealings in which the dollar plunged. Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $347.60 an ounce, up $1.40 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose 80 cents to a late bid price of $347. Traders said the dollar rose early in the day after comments from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who, speaking in Munich at the gathering of the world's leading industrial nations, said the United States was not "seeking to depreciate the dollar." That prompted some traders to buy dollars to cover short positions, or bets that the currency's value would decline. But the activity was short-lived. The dollar sank Tuesday partly because the Bank of Malaysia sold dollars to buy marks. The dollar fell through the important psychological and technical support level of 1.5 marks, which touched off more selling. Yesterday in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 124 Japanese yen from 124.17 at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 124.80 yen. In New York, the dollar was trading at 124.70 yen, up from 124.10 Tuesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.919, from $1.9255 late Tuesday. In New York, $:1 cost $1.93, cheaper than $1.934 Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's, included: 1.4885 German marks, down from 1.49; 1.3415 Swiss francs, up from 1.34; 5.016 French francs, unchanged; 1,124.25 Italian lire, down from 1,126.25, and 1.19155 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1948. Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $347.45 an ounce, up from $345.95 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $347.20, up from $345.75 bid late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.08 to close at $347.36 bid.

534-> Heinz Profit Drops 6.4%
The food manufacturer H. J. Heinz Company said today that profits fell 6.4 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter, ended April 29, because of a $50 million restructuring charge. Heinz said earnings of $146 million, or 56 cents a share, in the quarter were down from $156 million, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter last year. Sales rose to $1.87 billion from $1.84 billion.. For the 1992 fiscal year, Heinz said net income of $638 million, or $2.40 a share, was a company record and compared with $568 million and $2.13 a share in the 1991 fiscal year. Besides its soups and ketchup, major Heinz brands include Star-Kist tuna, Weight Watchers low-calorie products and 9 Lives cat food. A Heinz spokesman said the company should realize a total of about $200 million in savings this fiscal year from cost-cutting, including $100 million in savings from eliminating 3,000 jobs in the fiscal year just ended. Heinz stock closed today on the New York Stock Exchange unchanged at $35.875.

535-> SPORTS PEOPLE: FOOTBALL; Page Takes Step Toward Judicial Post
The Hall of Famer ALAN PAGE made history on the football field. Now he is one step away from making history in Minnesota politics. Page, who in 1971 became the first defensive player to be named National Football League player of the year, earned a place in the Nov. 3 general election Tuesday by easily winning a three-man preliminary race for one of the seats on the Minnesota Supreme Court. He will face the second-place finisher, KEVIN JOHNSON, an assistant Hennepin County Attorney. If elected, Page would be the first black to hold an elected statewide office in Minnesota and the first black on the state's Supreme Court. Page has been an assistant State Attorney General since 1985. (AP)

537-> Hanson Is Said to Plan Sale of U.S. Units
Hanson P.L.C., the British conglomerate, plans to sell most of its noncore businesses, which it values at more than $1 billion, The Financial Times reported in its weekend edition. It said the plan entailed selling majority stakes in American businesses that include Jacuzzi Inc., the maker of whirlpool baths and hot tubs, and the American home-construction interests of Beazer P.L.C. David H. Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the company's North American branch, said the United States companies designated for sale had been packaged into four groups -- homebuilding, consumer products, recreation and leisure. In a departure from its usual method of selling companies, Hanson is considering public stock offerings in the American companies. Hanson is likely to keep a small stake in the four groups, the newspaper reported. The sell-off would allow Hanson to concentrate on seven main businesses it would like to expand: Peabody Coal, Cavenham Forest, Beazer U.S.A., Grove Industries and Hanson Office Products in the United States; Imperial Tobacco, and the building-products operations in Britain of ARC and London Brick. The United States sales would be the first since Hanson sold 52 percent of the Smith Corona Corporation, the typewriter manufacturer, for $21 a share in July 1989. Shortly after that deal, which raised $386 million for Hanson, Smith Corona announced a drop in sales and its share price fell to $5. It closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $9.50 a share, off 12.5 cents.

539-> Personal Health
THROUGHOUT my childhood and young adult years, I was oblivious to poison ivy, bragging that I did not seem to get it even after traipsing through patches of it that caused my kid brother perennial agony. I had no reason, I thought, even to bother to learn what it looked like. Then in my early 30's I had my comeuppance. Two days after a camping trip, I began to itch, then to burn and itch. I could not even sit. Unable to work, I raced to the dermatologist. Diagnosis: poison ivy, the result of my unwillingness to trek to the privy during a pouring rain. It turned out that my self-treatment, with a popular lotion containing calamine (an O.K. ingredient) and an antihistamine (not O.K.), had only made matters worse. To calm my raging reaction, I had to take a potent steroid and cool sitz baths for three weeks. Since then poison ivy and I have become all too familiar, although I am slowly learning to look before I step, stoop or squat and remembering to steer clear of those "leaflets three" in their myriad guises. A Ubiquitous Problem Poison ivy thrives in all 50 states and in many more forms and habitats than most people realize. It occurs mostly as a climbing vine. In the 1800's American nurserymen unwittingly sold poison ivy vines as ornamentals to the English, who still have it climbing on some old buildings. It can also grow as a small shrub, but it sometimes gets large enough to resemble a tree. Most people, however, encounter it as a low-growing plant that spreads in the woods, in clearings and along roadsides. It even grows along the edge of New Jersey beaches, so people cannot assume that any area is free of poison ivy. About 85 percent of Americans are, or will eventually become, sensitive to the allergy-producing oleoresin called urushiol, which is found within all parts of the plant except the pollen. Sensitivity may develop after one, two or even dozens of exposures, so it is never safe to assume that one is immune. Everyone should learn to avoid poison ivy and other plants that contain urushiol, including poison oak, which grows widely on the West Coast, and poison sumac, a native of the Southeast that sometimes shows up in the West and Canada. Closely related oleoresins that cause the same reaction are found in the rind of mango fruit, the leaves and branches of Florida poisonwood, the pulp of the ginkgo nut and the shell of cashews, according to allergists writing in a recent issue of Patient Care, a magazine for doctors. Poison ivy nearly always grows with clusters of three leaflets, although larger clusters occasionally crop up. The leaflets tend to be shiny, but may also be dull. The leaves turn red in the fall, and clusters of white berries form at their base. The edges of the leaflets may be smooth, lobed or notched. Poison oak, which usually grows as a shrub or small tree, also has leaflets of three with gently lobed edges, but with fine hairs and yellow berries. And poison sumac, which grows in wet areas as a tall, thin shrub, boasts 7 to 13 leaflets per cluster and cream-colored berries. How It Spreads Urushiol is found within the plant, so gently brushing against it may not cause a reaction unless the leaves or stems are injured, allowing the oleoresin to seep out. But it is not enough to avoid contact with urushiol directly from the plant. It can also be transferred to people from pets' fur, clothing and shoes, firewood, gardening tools or any other object, including hands, that has had contact with it. The surest way to remove urushiol from such objects and from yourself is with water and detergent (not soap), although water alone often works. Once urushiol gets onto your skin, it is important to act fast to wash it off. The oleoresin works by getting under the surface of the skin. Depending upon the area of the body and the amount and duration of exposure, this takes five minutes to several hours. So use the nearest source of water to cleanse exposed skin without delay. Experts say the value of old-fashioned remedies like yellow soap is overstated. Laundry detergent or dishwashing liquid work better. A person cannot "catch" poison ivy from the lesions of someone who has it or from one's own oozing blisters. Poison ivy merely appears to spread to different parts of the body because the oleoresin is absorbed at different rates. But a person can develop the rash in new areas after repeatedly coming in contact with contaminated objects, which can retain active urushiol for months or years, or by touching other parts of one's own body before washing contaminated hands. Treating the Rash The reaction to urushiol can appear in as few as six hours to as many as three days after exposure. It usually starts as an itchy area that soon gets red and that then may form blisters that ooze, crust over and lose their scabs within two or three weeks. Scratching should be avoided because it can lead to an infection. Untreated, a mild to moderate reaction will usually disappear on its own within 10 days. For relief of itching, cold compresses or cool baths, calamine lotion (without antihistamine), a paste of baking soda and painkillers like aspirin can help. Those expert in herbal remedies say that rubbing the affected skin with the crushed leaves of the common plantain, a widespread lawn weed, rapidly relieves itching and speeds healing. Dermatologists say that over-the-counter hydrocortisone products (with a strength of 0.5 percent to 1 percent) are inadequate. People who have reacted violently in the past should hurry to a doctor (a dermatologist specializes in such problems) at the first hint of the rash, since home remedies and over-the-counter medications are not likely to be complete cures. Instead, for severe reactions and for rashes in delicate places that make working, sleeping or merely surviving a challenge, a prescription steroid is usually necessary. These may be applied directly to the rash, taken orally, or both. Oral medication (usually prednisone) should be started with a high dose and gradually tapered off over a period of weeks to get maximum relief and avoid a recurrence. Current methods of desensitizing allergic people are at best minimally effective and can cause severe side effects. However, people do tend to lose their sensitivity as they get older -- and wiser about avoiding the treacherous plants. Killing the Plants Poison ivy plants that are dug up should be put in plastic bags and discarded with the rubbish or buried, but not burned; urushiol carried on smoke particles can cause a severe reaction. Herbicides are a better bet. Effective agents include silvex, amitrole, ammonium sulfamate and 2,4-D, which can be applied from a distance with a garden sprayer. The plants may re-emerge, sometimes months later, and birds may also resow them, so several treatments may be needed. For high-climbing poison ivy vines, cut the vine near the bottom, kill the rooted part with an herbicide and pull down the rest of the vine after it dies. Wear long pants, long sleeves and gloves. After the battle remove all clothing with extreme care, wash yourself thoroughly, and wash your clothes with detergent or have them drycleaned.

541-> Gay Comments Prompt Call for Resignation
New York City Councilman Tom Duane called yesterday for Councilman Enoch Williams to resign as chairman of the Council's health committee because of comments that were attributed to him in The New York Post on Monday. The Post quoted Mr. Williams, a Brooklyn Democrat, as saying that discrimination against homosexuals would limit sexual activity by homosexuals and curtail the spread of AIDS. Mr. Williams, in a statement released yesterday, said the article was "inaccurate and misleading." Mr. Duane said that after the article was published, Mr. Williams had agreed to disavow his comments and to meet with advocates and workers in the fight against AIDS. But Mr. Duane said that Mr. Williams phoned him yesterday to cancel. Mr. Duane, who is gay and has tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS, said he then asked Mr. Williams to step down. Mr. Williams's statement said he intended to reschedule the meeting.

544-> UNDER THE BIG TOP -- NEWS ANALYSIS; Bursts of Fire at an Orderly Convention
Last night, for a few sweet, fleeting moments, they finally let the Democrats be Democrats. The managers at Madison Square Garden let former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, the Peck's Bad Boy of this year's politics, spell out his plans to overturn the nefarious American "system." They asked Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts to evoke the glow of Camelot once more. They let former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, surely the year's most surprising Presidential contender, talk about his own quirky prescriptions for his party. And they called on the party's often Delphic orator in chief, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, to set the place alight. These were the losers, the men not nominated, the paths not taken, and there were contradictions aplenty. Mr. Tsongas wants the party to pay more attention to the needs of business, and Mr. Brown wants it to pay less, to cite an obvious example. Mr. Kennedy scorns the conspiracy theories of Oliver Stone, the film maker, but the Democrats gave the disputatious Mr. Stone a moment to speak for Mr. Brown. The 4,928 delegates and alternates packed onto the floor and into the first balcony at the Garden didn't seem to mind. A little contradiction, a lot of zeal, a dose of the offbeat and a flash or two of ego supplied the ideal antidote for a convention in danger of choking on its own decorum. Mr. Cuomo came on to the roll of kettledrums and the sight of red-and-white "We Love Mario" signs, then showed again his easy command of all the oratorical skills of another time, before television, when the likes of William Jennings Bryan and Franklin Delano Roosevelt captivated Democratic conventions. Mr. Cuomo's voice rose and fell, his cadence accelerated and slowed; he was sarcastic at one moment, expansive the next, then full of scorn and fury a few minutes after that. As he had in San Francisco in 1984, he wowed his party and made not a few of its members wish he had run. The delegates loved it when he attributed to President Bush "the politics of decline, decay and deception," when he said the country needed a President to halt a Republican attempt "to tell us what god to believe in, and how to apply that god's judgment to our schoolrooms, our bedrooms and our bodies," and perhaps most of all when he told the Democrats that the 1992 nominee was "an admirable aberration" in a world of "fragile and thin-skinned politicians." Governor Cuomo's peroration echoed the New Deal and Fair Deal as he celebrated the old American verities -- verities that the American electorate once saw exemplified by the Democratic Party, verities the party yearns to make its own again this year as it pursues the elusive middle-class vote. "I want to sing," he said in one of many soaring moments, "proud songs, happy songs, arm in arm with workers who have a real stake in their company's success, who once again have the assurance that a lifetime of hard work will make life better for their children than it's been for them." Roll-Call and Commercials The time-worn, ever-popular hokum of the roll-call followed, complete with commercials for local industries, causes, attractions and heroes, and a few unity-bucking votes for Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania and Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado. When Mr. Clinton went over the top, confetti poured from the ceiling. A tradition-shattering visit by Mr. Clinton and his family, who walked several blocks to the arena from Macy's, closed the evening on an effervescent note, with the delegates' roars leaving no doubt they were pleased with their choice. At conventions like this, with everything cut and dried, with nothing really left to fight over, eloquence is at a premium. And before last night only Elizabeth Glaser, a woman suffering from AIDS, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson had generated real bursts of emotional electricity. Last night Mr. Kennedy came close as he opened the parade of not-quite-nominees to the podium: three who sought the Democratic nomination and failed to get it, and one, Governor Cuomo, who has never brought himself to enter the race, despite entreaties to do so for almost a decade. 1964 Tribute Recalled Mr. Kennedy's role was an eerie reprise of one of the most emotional moments in the recent history of nominating conventions. When the Democrats met at Atlantic City in 1964, John F. Kennedy had not yet been dead for a year, and his brother Robert F. Kennedy was called upon to introduce a memorial film. For 16 long minutes he stood, unable to speak above the great roar of applause washing over him. Then he reduced uncounted millions to tears by quoting from Act III of "Romeo and Juliet": "When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, for he shall make heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun." Last night Edward Kennedy, the last surviving male member of his generation of a family at once blessed and haunted, spoke after a film tribute to Robert Kennedy -- "gone now," as he said, "nearly a quarter of a century." The film was introduced by Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts, Robert Kennedy's oldest son. Senator Kennedy quoted not Shakespeare but the modern English poet Stephen Spender in remembering his slain brothers: "Born of the sun, they traveled a short while toward the sun and left the vivid air signed with their honor." And he found moving language of his own when he said of his brothers, "Their truest history is written in your hearts and the hearts of people everywhere who refuse to be content with things as they are." Most of the delegates do not like Mr. Brown at all; they view him as a trouble-making upstart. But he delivered his radical message with verve -- denouncing what he called "government of, by and for the privileged," railing at the world of contacts and access and power brokers and pledging to "create power for the powerless." His heavily outnumbered backers on the floor, mostly political neophytes, launched a high-spirited if carefully orchestrated demonstration. Amid the mass-produced placards, a hand-lettered sign stood out with a theme of last-ditch defiance -- "You can't paint a picture of unity with the paintbrush of suppression" -- but the crowd quickly subsided when asked to. Bill Clinton's personal formula for electoral success -- his platform, his selection for Vice President, his orderly approach to things -- has shaped the 1992 Democratic National Convention. The watchwords here have been restraint, organization, unity and that old wet blanket, dignity. The delegates accept it, at least most of them. Mr. Clinton won the nomination against all the odds, after all, and he has convinced them, at least intellectually, that his way is their best hope for taking back the White House this fall. But it is all a bit bloodless, satisfying but not thrilling, for a party that relishes a good brawl the way the Republicans relish a good balance sheet. The Way Things Were When the convention voted down a commission for Democratic Party renewal early in the evening, the Brown forces booed and chanted. Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta, presiding, quieted them easily enough, and he smiled a little at the brief reminder of the way things used to be. The health police have taken away the smoke-filled room, and now the responsibility police have taken away the shouting matches that used to cause convention chairmen to shatter their gavels in frustration. To Peggy Noonan, who has been watching the proceedings through the eyes of a speech writer for both Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Democrats looked like "people fighting against their own nature." Not during the nostalgic look back to the Kennedy era. When Senator Kennedy called for a "return to the ideal of compassion" after 12 years of "wintry indifference" sponsored by the Republicans, his declaration sounded more like an endorsement of the values of Democratic campaigns past than an echo of this year's cool new rhetoric. The Senator himself identified the whole liberal agenda: women's rights and abortion rights, gay rights and civil rights, health care and urban renewal, "war against poverty, not war against the poor." The thing that matters most about Bill Clinton, he said, is that "he has sought to heal." Mr. Tsongas restated his central campaign themes, including his new brand of economics that Mr. Clinton often ridiculed in the primary campaign. The elegant phrase has never been Mr. Tsongas's forte, but the Clinton campaign could find a worse battle cry than his plain-spoken indictment of the Bush and Reagan Administrations: "They told us it was morning in America. They told us we could have it all. They lied."

546-> COMPANY NEWS; Cannon Pictures In Debt Talks
Cannon Pictures Inc. said it was restructuring its long-term debt and might reorganize its business operations. The Beverly Hills, Calif., film producer said in its Form 8k filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was negotiating with its primary lender, another financial institution, and other parties concerning the company's financial condition and business relationships. "The results of these negotiations may have a material effect" on Cannon's financial condition and "future business prospects," the filing said. The filing said Cannon's independent auditor had advised that the company delay filing its annual report to the S.E.C. until it had resolved its financial situation. Cannon said it planned to file the annual report by April 27. Company officials were not available to comment and a spokesman declined to elaborate on the filing.

547-> Japan Is Trying New Approach In Trade Battles
In what Japanese officials say will be the first step toward an aggressive strategy for confronting the United States on trade issues, a Government advisory council has turned the tables and attacked the United States for breaking a number of international trade rules. In a report released this morning, the United States was described as having the most unfair trade among the world's industrialized nations. An official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the underlying aim of the council's report was to provide a blueprint for Japan's new strategy for handling trade disputes -- trying to move away from the past practice of negotiating directly with the United States over trade problems and instead referring them to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world organization that oversees trade. 'The Basis for Discussions' "The intention is to use GATT frequently," the official said. "This report will be a guideline for our approach to solving trade problems, the basis for discussions with our major trading partners." Whether the full Japanese Government adopts this policy as a vigorous new approach, and how successful it might be, remain to be seen. However much Japan may prefer the multinational arena, it is likely to be forced to deal with Washington directly when members of Congress, the Administration or prominent American industries have major complaints. But such a shift could have a big impact on Japan's often bitter relationship with its largest trading partner. In Washington, Kathleen A. Lydon, the assistant United States trade representative for public affairs, said the United States believed that resolving trade disputes through GATT was "one of the best" approaches to take. In its report, a subcommittee of the Industrial Sector Council, a private-sector advisory group to the trade ministry at the heart of Japanese policy-making, examined how closely Japan's trading partners adhered to rules governing international trade. It concluded that the United States failed in 9 of 10 areas. The report accused the United States of these unfair trade practices: *Washington too often imposes unilateral solutions on trade problems, instead of seeking to settle matters through international forums. *The United States abuses rules that permit a country to halt the sale of other nations' products at prices below cost or below fair market value, a practice known as dumping. *The United States arbitrarily alters tariffs and frequently resorts to negotiating "voluntary" restraints on another nation's exports, as it did with Japan on autos, steel and machine tools. *"Buy American" laws, some of which were enacted after President Bush's trip to Japan in January, restrict Federal Government purchases to mostly American goods and services and discriminate against Japanese products. American trade officials have frequently made this complaint about Japan. Ms. Lydon said she had not seen the report and could not respond to its specific complaints but added, "Everybody knows that the United States has the most open markets in the world, and our interest is in seeing that other nations follow suit." As for the criticism of voluntary restraint agreements, she said, "We would much prefer to see them open their markets than to manage the number of items they export." The report ranked the European Community next to last among Japan's trading partners, failing in six categories. Hong Kong and Singapore were cited as the fairest traders. Other countries examined were Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand. The document comes as Japan is under pressure from a number of countries over its trade practices. Although Japan's trade surplus with the United States appears to have stabilized at about $40 billion a year, its surplus with Asia and the European Community has been rising sharply. Japan's overall surplus this year is expected to be more than $110 billion, the largest in the world. Japan feels the GATT rules offer it a better forum, since they give far less weight to trade imbalances by themselves. The report dismissed such imbalances as meaningless. "Although some point to Japan's large trade surplus as evidence of a closed market, this argument is refuted by basic lessons of economics," it insisted. The United States conducts an annual trade survey in which it judges how open the markets of its trading partners are. Japanese officials said Tokyo's unfairness report would also be an annual exercise from now on. Japan is negotiating with South Korea over the large Japanese trade surplus with Korea, and Japan's surplus with the European Community was a record $27.4 billion last year, a 48 percent increase from 1990. It appears likely to grow this year. Nonetheless, Japan was angered when the European Community recently expressed its disappointment at the growing size of the trade gap. The Europeans issued a formal review of their relations with Japan that emphasized the trade problems. That prompted the Japanese Government to say it was sending a tough letter in reply, expressing its unhappiness that the community chose to emphasize trade over political and other areas where Japan believes relations have improved. The new report said it had three objectives. The first was to come up with a new definition of unfair trade, largely by referring to GATT rules. But it excluded trade in agricultural goods, an area in which Japan is often criticized because of its ban on the import of rice. The second objective was to suggest that all countries deviated from the GATT rules to some extent. And last, the report was an attempt to move away from direct discussions between countries for resolving trade disputes and toward taking them to GATT instead.

549-> Ralph Erickson, 88, Retired Loomis Coach
Ralph Winthrop Erickson, the former athletic director of the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Conn., died on Saturday at the Avery Heights nursing home in Hartford. A longtime resident of Windsor, he was 88 years old. His family said he died of cancer. Mr. Erickson got his start in sports as captain of the basketball team at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in physical education. His hope to pitch for the Boston Braves was dashed by an injury, and he spent 10 years coaching boys' and girls' sports in Windsor, Vt., instead. In 1937, Mr. Erickson moved on to Trinity College in Hartford to coach and then served as a captain in the Army Air Force in World War II directing physical training. He joined the Loomis staff in 1946, coached the baseball, football and basketball teams and built the school's indoor athletics program. Stricken by cancer, he lost a leg and hip in 1965 but kept coaching on crutches until his retirement in 1969. Mr. Erickson is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Barbara Wishart, former headmistress of the Chaffee School; a daughter, Betty Ann Ludington of Stamford, Conn.; a sister, Ruth Nash of Williamsburg, Mass.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

550-> HOCKEY; Roenick Says He Will Play
The Chicago Blackhawks aren't saying whether Jeremy Roenick has a broken thumb, but the star center wore a cast on his right forearm during practice Friday at Chicago Stadium. Roenick, who scored 53 goals in the regular season, said he planned to play in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals on Saturday. "We've come too far and done too much," said Roenick, who has 10 playoff goals but just 2 shots on goal against the Penguins. "And it's much, much too big." The injury occurred in Thursday's 3-1 loss to the Penguins. "Jeremy was slashed early in the second period by Kevin Stevens and a subsequent slash by Rick Tocchet," Blackhawks Coach Mike Keenan said. Roenick missed most of the final 30 minutes of the game.

552-> COMPANY NEWS; FEDERAL-MOGUL TO PAY $213 MILLION FOR TRW UNIT
The Federal-Mogul Corporation, a Detroit-based auto parts maker, disclosed in documents yesterday that it would pay about $213 million for TRW Inc.'s replacement-parts distribution business and take a $14 million fourth-quarter charge to cover the cost. Details of the acquisition, which was announced on Aug. 23, were included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Federal-Mogul said the charge would cover expenses like job cuts, relocations and asset disposals. It estimated that the total costs would be about $28 million. But by eliminating the overlapping jobs, the company said, it could save about $21 million a year beginning in 1995. The deal involves a buyout of Cleveland-based TRW's replacement-parts distribution business, which has annual sales of more than $300 million.

555-> Sports of The Times; How Long Can Handley Survive?
ON Sept. 26-27, the weekend of the Giants' bye in their National Football League schedule, the "Giants Experience," described as a "fantasy-type fan festival," will be staged at Giants Stadium. Tour the locker room. Compete in passing, pass-receiving and field-goal kicking contests. Two dozen players will be available for conversations, autographs and photos. Tickets will be $10, with proceeds going to the Giants Foundation and the Tomorrow's Children Fund. But any Giants fan's real fantasy would be to confront somebody who isn't scheduled to be there: Coach Ray Handley. Not that long ago, the Giants Experience was celebrating Super Bowl XXV and Super Bowl XXI victories, or at least qualifying for the playoffs. But now the Giants Experience is suffering through an 0-2 start while wondering when Handley's team will start winning. Or if it will. If the Giants lose again Monday night in Chicago and keep losing, how much longer can Handley survive? Maybe longer than you think. And longer than he deserves. Only once in their long and patient history have the Giants ever changed coaches in midseason. When the 1976 team skidded to 0-7, Bill Arnsparger was discharged and John McVay was promoted from the staff. Those Giants dropped to 0-9 before a 3-2 finish salvaged a 3-11 season. But the most favorable factor for Handley's retention is General Manager George Young, who named Handley when Bill Parcells suddenly departed 16 months ago. Young doesn't seem to know the words to "Ray Must Go." Asked yesterday to assess Handley's status, Young waved his arms and said: "I'm not making any assessment of the coach. He's a hard-working guy. He does everything he's supposed to do. He relates to everybody in the organization. The coach is not an issue." But to the fans who chant "Ray Must Go," the coach is an issue. To many of the Giants players, the coach is an issue. But if the coach is not an issue to George Young, that's significant. According to his contract, Young has to consult the co-owners, Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch, when he decides to hire a coach, but not when he decides to fire a coach. If the Giants keep losing, Young's contract also wouldn't keep Mara and Tisch from suggesting that maybe a new coach is needed. Especially Tisch, the billionaire businessman who thought he was buying $70 million worth of fun when he purchased 50 percent of the franchise early last year. That fun has dissolved into frustration. It's not so much that Handley is 0-2 this season. Any coach and any team can get off to a bad start. But including last season's late games Handley is on a 1-5 streak, and over his two seasons he's now 8-10 and dropping fast in the popularity polls of all those Giants loyalists spoiled by Parcells's two Super Bowl triumphs. More than anything else, Handley is not what Parcells was: a good communicator. In their locker-room meetings, some of Handley's players don't always know where he's coming from. Some members of his defensive unit didn't respond until he inadvertently insulted them at halftime of Sunday's eventual 34-28 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. They believed that Handley had surrendered to the Cowboys' 27-0 halftime lead and would insert younger players. In their anger, they persuaded the defensive coordinator, Rod Rust, to simplify the assignments. Keep in mind that the Giants defense didn't stiffen until the Cowboys understandably relaxed with a 34-0 lead. Rust's defenses have been identified by his players as the reason for their lapses in allowing 65 points in the first two games. But it was Handley's decision to hire Rust. The head coach knew the risk of Rust's more sophisticated philosophy for players who thrived on the attack-dog style chalked by Parcells and his coordinator, Bill Belichick. Ever since Handley took over, the head coach has also kept his quarterbacks confused. As a result he has often confused the entire team. Jeff Hostetler felt deceived when Handley didn't restore him as the starter after he recovered from a damaged back and pelvis that kept him out of the 31-14 loss to the San Fransisco 49ers. Phil Simms felt forgotten last season when he wasn't restored as the starter after recovering from the broken foot that kept him out of the Super Bowl XXV playoffs. Just as George Young pretends that the coach "is not an issue," Ray Handley keeps pretending that the quarterback situation "is not an issue." But the way the Giants are stumbling, soon they won't be an issue.

557-> Credit-Card Use in February Up as Other Borrowing Fell
In what may be a sign of reviving buying interest, the Federal Reserve Board said today that consumers expanded their use of credit cards in February, although they paid off more debts than they incurred. Overall consumer installment credit -- the type of debt that requires monthly payments -- fell by $199 million in February after growing by a slight $53 million in January. The January figure was a sharp revision from the Fed's original report, in which it said that installment credit had fallen by $183 million at the beginning of 1992. But the biggest single category within the consumer credit report, "revolving," or credit-card, credit, expanded by $1.19 billion in February following a $312 million expansion in January. That was in line with Commerce Department reports showing that retail sales grew a strong 2.1 percent in January and 1.3 percent in February. Many department-store purchases, from clothes to home appliances, are paid for with credit cards. But auto loans shrank by $476 million in February after increasing in January by $347 million. Sales of new cars have been slowly rising, and factory orders for cars rose in January and February. Total outstanding bank loans, aside from home mortgages, fell during February by $550 million after declining in January by $139 million. The total of credit owed for mobile homes fell by $358 million after decreasing by $466 million in January. Recent surveys suggest that consumer confidence has begun to increase amid mounting, if mixed, signals that the economy is recovering from recession. Last week, increases in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index as well as the Conference Board's consumer confidence measure suggested an improving economic situation in March. So far, however, growth has been too slow to provide a big lift in job opportunities that economists say is necessary to sustain economic expansion. The Labor Department reported Friday that only 19,000 non-farm jobs were added to payrolls in March, and the unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, the same as in January.

558-> Fed Proposes Bank Limits
The Federal Reserve Board proposed new rules today to govern business relationships between smaller banks that contract with larger ones, called correspondent banks, to clear their checks, collect bills and conduct other financial transactions. The Fed proposed limiting the financial exposure a smaller bank can have to a large bank that is not strongly capitalized. Congress required last year that the Fed set new limits. . Under the proposal, a bank's exposure to its correspondent bank could not exceed on average 50 percent of its capital -- which provides a cushion if it runs into financial problems --if the correspondent bank is only adequately capitalized. There would be no limits for well-capitalized banks. Examiners would use their judgment, rather than a strict test, to determine if the rule wasviolated. The sensitive Fed funds market could be affected if correspondent banks could not buy as much money from the smaller banks, some analysts said. But since the rule would be phased in over two years, the market would be likely to have enough time to adjust, with new players picking up the business, they said. The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, expressed concern that the rule not supplement the more sophisticated system of analyzing interbank risk that most banks already have in place.

559-> Ex-Soviets Road to Capitalism Hits a U.S. Bump
A half- dozen newly independent republics in the old Soviet Union, still fumbling their way toward free markets and fast food, received a bracing lesson in American capitalism today. The Commerce Department said they were selling uranium at unfairly low prices and proposed a punitive import tariff that would more than double the price. The preliminary ruling, which will be followed by a final determination in early fall, was issued in response to complaints from American uranium producers. The decision puts the Bush Administration in the embarrassing position of moving to cripple exports from some of the most impoverished republics while the United States is rallying international aid for them and criticizing Western Europe for excluding goods from Eastern Europe. Struggling to set up governments and find officials trained in Western economic practices, the republics made little effort to defend themselves in a case concerning one of their most important exports. "These guys are pretty naive over there, and they have sort of a blind faith in the American system," said James C. Cornell of the Stamford, Conn., office of Nukem Inc., a German nuclear fuels trading firm. "They're just not equipped to go in there and understand what Commerce is doing. It's hard for Americans to understand." The collapse of the ruble and poor living conditions mean that the republics' mining and ore processing costs are the lowest in the world, so that their export prices probably do cover their costs with money left over for profits, Mr. Cornell said. Today's decision, which proposes a 116 percent tariff and requires importers to start posting bonds for this amount immediately, drew a blistering response from the republics' American lawyer in the case. "It appears that the left hand of our Government does not know or care about what the right hand is doing, and the net result is to the detriment of the taxpayers and electricity consumers of the United States and the people of the six new struggling nations," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was the chairman of the Republican National Committee through most of the Reagan Administration. Current and former Bush Administration officials defended the decision as the unavoidable outcome of a highly litigious and technical process over which they have little control. A long succession of laws has progressively limited the discretion of successive administrations to influence the results of trade cases for diplomatic and national security reasons. "Our dumping procedure is a quasi-judicial process," a Commerce Department official said. "There is no political influence." If today's decision becomes final, as appears likely, then uranium prices on the spot market may nearly double from their current levels at $7.80 a pound. But much of the world's uranium is sold under long-term contracts between mines and electric utilities, especially in Asian and European markets. Uranium is used in nuclear power plants, but at the current price it accounts for a negligible portion of their costs. In practice, the law still gives Administration officials a little flexibility over cases in which goods may have been dumped on the American market at low prices. Many decisions must be made on which costs to include in calculating production costs. But even with political influence, it is difficult to affect the final decision by more than a few percentage points, officials familiar with the process say. The republics botched some Commerce Department forms and failed to file others, making a detailed cost evaluation impossible, forcing the department to follow the American producers' suggestion of assuming that the republics' costs were comparable to those in Britain, Canada and Namibia. The republics have filed separate legal cases contending that they should be excused from the petition because the case began before the breakup of the Soviet Union. One republic that may be hurt most by the decision is Kazakhstan, which only last weekend met American requests that it eventually destroy its nuclear weapons or transfer them to Russia. Today's decision appears to hold virtually no political benefit for the Administration to offset the international embarrassment. After more than a decade of decline, the American uranium industry now employs about 4,000 people, most of them in rural Western states like Wyoming that are already solidly Republican. Congress has taken virtually no interest in the case, in contrast to other trade cases that have drawn numerous letters to the Commerce Department from legislators backing larger industries in their home districts. By law, American nuclear weapons use uranium mined in the United States. The big increase in United States imports of Soviet uranium for civilian use came with a reduction of bilateral tensions in the late 1980's. Imports Soared Last Year Imports soared to $110.4 million last year from just $2 million in 1986. The United States has enjoyed a rapidly widening trade surplus with the former Soviet republics, exporting $3.58 billion worth of goods to them last year and importing goods worth only $812.8 million. The uranium imports have kept the bilateral trade surplus from growing even faster. The American uranium industry's trade association welcomed today's ruling. "The industry hopes that the department's action will restore some stability to the market, which has been devastated by this massive unfair trade," said Michael McMurphy, the president of Uranium Producers of America. Uranium prices fell last year from $12 a pound to a low of $6.75 a pound in November as the foundering Soviet Union exported much of its production and stockpiles in a desperate bid for foreign exchange. The Commerce Department found that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were exporting at unfairly low prices, while the other six former Soviet republics did not produce or stockpile uranium. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are the two biggest exporters, followed by Russia, Mr. Cornell said. Uzbekistan, already one of the poorest republics, faces particular trouble now because it has little else to export, said Barnett R. Rubin, the director of the Center for Central Asian Studies at Columbia University. Kazakhstan, on the other hand, should be exporting large quantities of oil within several years as a result of last week's contract with the Chevron Corporation to develop the giant Tengiz oilfield there, he added.

561-> COMPANY NEWS; T.W.A. Cuts Service, Trying To Emerge From Chapter 11
Trans World Airlines announced cutbacks in service yesterday as part of an effort to return to profitability by slimming down and reducing costs. The reductions in flights are part of the carrier's plan, which is to be presented to a Federal bankrutpcy court later this month, for emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which T.W.A. entered in January. The plan calls for the retirement of about 20 wide-body Boeing 747's and Lockheed L-1011's, shrinking the airline's fleet from 187 airplanes to 167. Concessions From Unions The plan includes a 15 percent cut in labor costs through wage, benefit and work rule concessions from all of T.W.A.'s unions, whose leaders agreed to the terms last month. The last major piece of the reorganization plan to be negotiated is a settlement of the underfunding of T.W.A.'s pension plans. Talks between between Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of T.W.A., and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have resulted in narrowing of differences in the last month. Under the reorganization plan, the carrier will suspend service to Istanbul, Moscow, Copenhagen and Stockholm. It will also no longer serve eight domestic cities: Austin, Tex.; Ontario, Calif.; Palm Springs, Calif.; Salt Lake City; Sioux City, Iowa; Sioux Falls, S.D.; Syracuse, and Tucson, Ariz. The winter schedule will provide 700 daily flights to and from 62 domestic and 18 foreign cities. Currently the airline has 778 flights daily. The carrier said it planned to serve many of its domestic cities with narrow-body aircraft, with flights concentrated at its hubs at Kennedy International Airport, St. Louis and Atlanta. In return for their cuts in wages and benefits, T.W.A. workers will get a 45 percent equity stake in the airline, while creditors, who have agreed to forgive about $1 billion in debt, will get a 55 percent stake. The carrier must still submit the plan to the bankruptcy court for approval, and the members of the various unions have to ratify the pay cuts.

562-> France Blocks the Way
No issue has more far-reaching implications for the future prospects of the world economy than the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. . . . The aim . . . should be to complete the Round before the end of 1991. -- Final statement, London economic summit conference, July 1991. A successful Uruguay Round will be a significant contribution to the future of the world economy. . . . we expect that an agreement can be reached before the end of 1992. -- Final statement, Munich economic summit conference, July 1992. Two economic summits, two dismal failures. The leaders of the seven industrialized powers didn't unblock international trade talks. A torrent of trade, worth a trillion dollars to world economies by the year 2000, has again been denied. Blame isn't hard to place. France, alone, refuses to negotiate. The six-year-old trade talks are premised on a grand compromise. The industrialized countries would open their markets to imports of textiles and food from the third world; the poorer countries would accept protection for imports of services, patents and copyrights. Great progress has been made but agreement has been blocked by the European Community's refusal to dismantle protectionist farm policies. The Europeans are the only countries to reject a proposed solution to the farm dispute, the Dunkel plan, as the basis for final negotiations. What they've accepted instead are unilateral reforms that go part of the way. Some observers criticize the U.S. for not accepting these reforms. They say that by bargaining for everything the U.S. risks getting nothing. But this criticism is mostly off target because the E.C. position leaves open so many pivotal disputes. For instance, the internal E.C. reforms don't directly solve the problem of export subsidies that lead to dumping exports and ruining third world farmers. The U.S. and the rest of the E.C. could probably reach agreement quickly. But the French Government insists -- at least until a September referendum on European unity -- on protecting a handful of politically powerful farmers at all cost. There is room for the U.S. to compromise on its insistence that the E.C. hit the Dunkel plan's target for export subsidies. But until the French start talking, no agreement is possible. A trillion dollars in economic growth hangs in the balance.

To the Editor: "Into the 21st Century, Bleakly" by Daniel Bell (Op-Ed, July 26) laments parochialism among American intellectuals. But the pages of little magazines have in the last 25 years been open to work from around the world. My own journal, The Manhattan Review, for example, has for a decade published translations of work by dissident poets from Eastern Europe and China. A host of other journals also bring new foreign writers to the attention of American readers -- TriQuarterly Magazine, Beloit Poetry Journal, Graham House Review, Mr. Cogito, Maryland Poetry Review and Quarterly Review of Literature, to name a few.

566-> BASEBALL; Sheffield's Slam Powers the Padres
Padres 5, Reds 1 Gary Sheffield's second grand slam of the season powered San Diego to a 5-1 victory and moved the Padres to a game of second-place Cincinnati in the National League West. San Diego has won seven of eight games while the Reds have lost four of five and dropped five and a half games behind first-place Atlanta, their biggest deficit of the season. Sheffield, batting .512 during a 10-game hitting streak with six homers, went 2 for 4 to raise his National League-leading average to .343 and increase his runs batted in total to 83, tied for the league league with Darren Daulton of Philadelphia. Jim Deshaies (3-2) scattered seven hits in eight and one-third innings and walked one, losing his shutout on Darnell Coles's r.b.i. single in the ninth. Deshaies hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in six starts since his July 9 promotion from Class AAA Las Vegas (Nev.) of the Pacific Coast League. Sheffield's 25th homer climaxed a five-run second off Chris Hammond (6-7), who walked four in the first two innings as San Diego took control. Expos 4, Cardinals 1 MONTREAL (AP) -- Dennis Martinez allowed two hits in seven innings as Montreal beat St. Louis and closed to one and a half games of National League East-leading Pittsburgh, which lost to Atlanta. Montreal extended its winning streak to a season-high six as it sent the Cardinals to their fifth loss in seven games. Martinez (13-10) struck out seven and walked two in winning his third consecutive start. John Wetteland pitched a hitless ninth for his 27th save. Rheal Cormier (3-10) gave up five hits, struck out nine and walked two. St. Louis has scored only 11 runs in Cormier's 10 losses. Cubs 4, Astros 2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Ryne Sandberg homered in the first inning and doubled home the go-ahead run in the fifth as Chicago stopped its four-game losing streak. Mike Harkey (3-0) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and six hits in seven innings, his longest stint since returning from shoulder surgery on June 20. Paul Assenmacher got four outs for his seventh save. Darryl Kile (2-7) gave up four runs and six hits in six innings as Houston dropped to 7-11 on its 26-game road trip. Blue Jays 9, Indians 5 CLEVELAND (AP) -- John Olerud and Candy Maldonado hit consecutive home runs to power a seven-run explosion in the third inning, and American League East-leading Toronto beat Cleveland. David Wells (7-6) benefited from Toronto's 13-hit attack by limiting the Indians to three runs on eight hits over five and one-third innings. He walked one and struck out five. Derek Bell had three hits and robbed Cleveland's Glenallen Hill of an extra-base hit in the fourth with an over-the-shoulder catch while running into the fence in left-center. Toronto jumped on Indians starter Rod Nichols (2-3) for eight runs and eight hits in the first two and two-third innings. The Blue Jays had seven hits in the third, six off Nichols. Dave Winfield drove in two runs with a single before Olerud blasted a Nichols pitch for his 11th homer, a three-run shot to right-center. Maldonado followed with a lofty opposite-field home run to right, his 14th. Orioles 3, Royals 1 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Leo Gomez hit a two-run homer and Rick Sutcliffe continued his domination over Kansas City as Baltimore beat the Royals to keep pace with Toronto in the American League East. Sutcliffe, who lives in the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit, struck out four and walked four in six and two-third innings as he extended his record against the Royals to 6-0. Sutcliffe (12-11) gave up seven hits as the Orioles stayed two games behind Toronto, which beat Cleveland, 9-5. Angels 2, Athletics 1 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Chad Curtis hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning for California. Gary Gaetti singled with one out in the seventh and moved to second when Dave Stewart (8-7) was charged with a balk while facing Von Hayes. After Hayes flew out, Curtis homered. Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 38th homer of the year in the second for Oakland's only run off Bert Blyleven (6-5). Tigers 9, Rangers 6 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) -- Lou Whitaker homered and Gary Pettis hit a pair of triples and each drove in three runs to help Detroit beat Texas. Tiger starter David Haas improved to 2-0 in his second major-league start, allowing eight hits in six and two-third innings. He walked one and struck out four before getting relief help from Kurt Knudsen. Brewers 8, Red Sox 7 MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Gantner hit reliever Jeff Reardon's first pitch for a home run in the 13th inning to give Milwaukee the victory over Boston in the first game of a doubleheader. Gantner's leadoff homer was his first since last September. Reardon (2-1) gave up Gantner's third home run since 1987. James Austin (3-2) pitched a perfect 13th for the victory.

567-> For Fall, Think Vests, Ties And, Yes, Longer Skirts
Sportswear, the jewel in the crown of American fashion, is leading the march into fall. Orders from retailers are up as much as 50 percent over last year, manufacturers report, and little resistance is expected from consumers to visible style changes like longer skirts. Vests are the new addition to separates dressing, which is a key to the sportswear concept. They are worn under jackets, which continue to be the No. 1 wardrobe item, and occasionally over them. Ralph Lauren reports that a dress built like an elongated vest is his top-selling number. It was ordered in two versions, with the knee-baring dress outselling the calf-length one. But in this collection and others, longer skirts are making a smooth entry into the fall fashion market, arousing little opposition from retailers, who believe their customers are ready for the change. Worn with dark stockings and heavy shoes or boots, the length seems irrelevant. The customers themselves will have a chance to vote starting this week when the first styles by the leading sportswear designers start showing up in the stores. Long and Longer Donna Karan offers a choice of longer lengths, with some covering the knees and some descending almost to the ankles. The skirts that just cover the knees are tapered to avoid an awkward, bulky line. The longer ones are slit to show some leg. Calvin Klein said that his longer skirts sold well this spring and that he had no doubt that the buying pace would accelerate in the fall. "Spring buying was not concentrated in New York," he said of longer styles. "It happened all over the country." At the same time, interest in trousers has stepped up. "We booked more pants than we ever did before," said Joseph Stafiniak, vice president of sales at Anne Klein. "Normally, we sell twice as many skirts as we do pants. This time, buyers bought as many pants as they did skirts." At Ralph Lauren, pants, especially skinny styles, are considered essential to the "whole dandy look, which is a key to the season," Mr. Lauren said. Among the other fashion features that seem to have been accepted for the new season are the snugger fit of jackets, as in Mr. Lauren's dandy styles with fitted waistlines, and an emphasis on muted colors for basic outfits. Men's wear fabrics, like pin- and chalk-striped woolens, are important. From Karan, Lots of Black Donna Karan's fitted jackets have been proportioned to look right with her varied skirt lengths as well as with pants. "Black is about 75 percent of the collection," Ms. Karan said. "Color is introduced in sweaters." The colors are mainly claret, green and gold. Other accents are white shirts, belts and long chiffon scarfs, which Ms. Karan likes to wrap like a man's tie. The tie itself is a little grace note that adds freshness to fall styles. Mr. Lauren likes real men's ties, punctuated with classic tie pins. Chains and watch fobs are other accents. "The styles in the fall collections are exciting but not earth shattering," said Louis Dell'Olio, the designer at Anne Klein. "That seems to be the right note: buyers don't want earth-shattering and neither do their customers, they believe." Both retailers and manufacturers agree that the emphasis in fall sales will be on individual pieces that look new and give a fresh look to the clothes a woman already owns. Nobody expects a return of the 1980's shopping frenzy. "A long skirt, a fitted jacket, a white shirt," Ms. Karan said. "That's all a woman needs to face the new season."

568-> COMPANY NEWS; Judge Orders 2 Cascade Officials Out
A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge today ordered the chairman and president of Cascade International Inc. to step down as soon as replacements could be found. Judge Robert Mark ruled that the retailer's chairman, Aaron Karp, and president, John Sirmans, were "tainted" by the fraud and misconduct that occurred under the former chief executive, Victor G. Incendy, who disappeared in November. The judge faulted both executives for standing behind Mr. Incendy's public statements about company assets despite "numerous red flags" indicating the information was false. The authorities said Mr. Incendy had lied about the finances of the company and exaggerated the number of its stores in statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'A Pawn or Knight' 'It is clear Victor Incendy couldn't have perpetrated massive fraud," the judge said, "without Karp or Sirmans." "Whether as a pawn or knight," he continued, Mr. Incendy used Mr. Karp to file false public statements and relied on Mr. Sirmans to "exploit" creditors. The judge also said Mr. Karp and Mr. Sirmans lacked the retailing experience necessary to run the company and had too many conflicts of interest to do so properly. Mr. Karp, who was general counsel, and Mr. Sirmans, then executive vice president, took over Cascade International's operations after Mr. Incendy vanished. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. Last fall, the S.E.C. stepped up an investigation into charges that Mr. Incendy, who started the company in 1984, inflated its assets, profits and revenues in public reports in an attempt to lift its stock price. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also began looking into reports that Mr. Incendy, who owned much of the company, sold unauthorized shares of stock worth $25 million. Mr. Karp and Mr. Sirmans face claims from three major banking creditors that are owed $16 million, and more than a dozen lawsuits from shareholders. Creditors Urge Ouster The creditors argued that Mr. Karp and Mr. Sirmans should be ousted because their close ties to Mr. Incendy gave them a personal stake that ran counter to the interests of the company. The executives were seeking to limit their personal liabilities, not advance the company's welfare, the banks argued. The banks were joined by a court-appointed examiner who said his investigation found evidence that Mr. Sirmans was actively involved in the fraud. The examiner, James S. Feltman, also found that the two executives, who had limited retailing experience, had mismanaged the company during the last six months. Mr. Karp testified that he had filed false public reports because Mr. Incendy gave him bogus data and rebuffed his efforts to acquire more information. He said that Mr. Incendy's gifts to him, including shares of stock worth $225,000 and a new Mercedes-Benz for his wife, did not color his judgment. He said he confronted Mr. Incendy as soon as he had an inkling, a week before Mr. Incendy's departure, that something might be amiss with the stock sales. Mr. Sirmans, who said earlier this week that he was under F.B.I. investigation, said he lacked authority or access to information despite his senior position. The company is now earning only about $400,000 a month in sales from 33 clothing stores, the examiner reported. He estimated the liquidation value of its assets at about $500,000.

Switch TRACY MURRAY from the leaning to the jumping column. After family discussions with about half the 27 N.B.A. teams and in fulfillment of a dream, the 6-foot-8-inch U.C.L.A. junior forward, who averaged 21.4 points and 7 rebounds a game last season, has decided to enter next month's National Basketball Association draft. So has JIM JACKSON of Ohio State, who confirmed at a news conference yesterday that he would pass up his senior year to turn pro.

573-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Up in U.S. Trading After Falling Earlier in Day
A burst of buying sent the dollar higher in hectic domestic trading yesterday despite continued indications that the economy is still mired in recession. The dollar fell overseas and also declined in early domestic trading following the release of a Conference Board report showing consumers' confidence in the economy plunged in February to the lowest level since 1974, when the nation was gripped by a severe recession. Many traders were expecting the report to show an improvement in sentiment, but fears of rapidly rising unemployment kept consumers pessimistic. The news sent the stock market lower and evoked a response from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who called the survey results disturbing. But investors took advantage of the dip in the dollar to step in and buy the United States currency with an appetite that made the session "possibly the most exciting day in the market so far this year," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA. He said dollar purchasers ran the gamut from mutual fund managers to corporations to speculators. "The sentiment remains awfully bullish, and it's partly feeding on itself," Mr. Chandler said. The dollar's resiliency "mushroomed into a very, very strong dollar rally," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. He said the curreny's strength was built on several factors, including anticipation that better days lie ahead for the United States economy while concerns build over the economic strength of Germany and Japan. "People are anticipating a divergence in the performance of the United States economy and the other economies as the year goes on," he said, which support the bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.32 yen, up 0.06 yen from Monday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.45 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.90 yen, up from 129.20 yen on Monday. In London, the British pound rose to $1.7560, from $1.7473 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7380 to buy one pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.7467. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6595 German marks, up from 1.6528; 1.5065 Swiss francs, up from 1.4935; 5.6410 French francs, up from 5.6185; 1,245.25 Canadian dollars, up from 1,240.00, and 1.1860 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1892.

575-> William Bunney, 89, Biochemist Who Was Officer of E. R. Squibb
Dr. William Edward Bunney Sr., a biochemist who was formerly a director and vice president of E. R. Squibb and Sons in charge of worldwide manufacturing, died Jan. 8 at the University of California-Irvine Medical Center while on a family visit to Southern California. He was 89 years old and lived in Surry, Me. His family said he died of heart failure. Dr. Bunney, who held a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois, took part as a researcher in the discovery of an essential amino acid in humans, worked to stabilize diphtheria toxin for use as a vaccine and helped develop DPT, a single-shot vaccine still used to immunize children against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. During World War II, he received an award on behalf of Squibb from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who cited the company's role in developing methods for the large-scale production of penicillin, which was beginning to save countless lives. Years later, President John F. Kennedy asked him to head one of the first scientific exchange missions to the Soviet Union. Dr. Bunney, who was born in Tacoma, Wash., started his career in the antitoxin and vaccine laboratories of the Massachusetts State Department of Public Health in 1927, moved to the laboratories of the Michigan Health Department in 1931 and joined Squibb in 1938 as director of biological products. He became a vice president in 1952 and retired in 1965. Dr. Bunney, an accomplished baritone, was a soloist in several church choirs. Having spent his summers in Surry for many years, he also sang with a local opera society, the Surry Opera Company, and joined it on a Russian tour two years ago at the age of 87. Dr. Bunney is survived by his two sons, Dr. William E. Bunney Jr. of Laguna Beach, Calif., and Dr. Benjamin S. Bunney of Guilford, Conn., and six grandchildren.

576-> Yeltsin Takes to Now-Restive Streets
Boris N. Yeltsin toured the docks and empty stores of St. Petersburg today in his campaign to maintain the patience of a people sorely tested by soaring prices and unrelenting shortages. Drawing instant and divided crowds wherever he stopped, the Russian President issued the same mix of stern threats, appeals for initiative and promises of sausages to come that he had carried to Bryansk and other cities around Russia. "This year will be difficult for all of us!" Mr. Yeltsin shouted over a portable loudspeaker system to a pressing throng outside a food store, in which only butter was left and that at a price few could afford. "We were held up because all these 74 years we were digging a deep pit. If we had waited another year and a half we would all be buried. I know it's difficult, but even in these difficult times I ask for mutual trust." The reception was mixed. Placards, jeers and shouts attacking the price increases greeted Mr. Yeltsin wherever he went, and striking taxi drivers were gathered outside the city hall. Everywhere the issue was prices, prices, prices as people yelled out the litany of costs suddenly lifted beyond the limits of most pocketbooks, and shops still empty. One woman showed a bag with two loaves of bread. "That's all I've found since 6:30 this morning!" she shouted. Four numbers were printed on her hand in ball-point pen -- her place in four neighboring lines. "That's for meat," she said, pointing grimly to the number 522. As he had at previous stops in his tour, Mr. Yeltsin intimated that "provocateurs" were deliberately pushing prices higher than necessary to derail his reform, and promised to take action. Not many believed the explanation. "What can he do?" grumbled the woman with the number. "There are no products. Whatever should be done should have been done long, long ago." Still, for now, there was little direct hostility for Mr. Yeltsin, and for many people it was still a chance to glimpse and hear "Czar Boris," as many in the crowd called him. And many gave him credit for taking to the streets, especially in a city as traditionally militant and as divided as St. Petersburg. Public opinion polls showed that Mr. Yeltsin still held a 40 percent approval rating in St. Petersburg, but it also showed growing support for the far right. Old Allies Fall Out It was also evident, however, that opposition to Mr. Yeltsin no longer comes only from the far fringes of the political spectrum. In his tour of the city, Mr. Yeltsin also tangled openly with his host and former supporter, Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak, who like many other recent supporters of the President now seemed to draw a political distance. At the Baltic Sea docks, Mr. Sobchak openly challenged Mr. Yeltsin's appeals to the dockers to take possession of their enterprise, arguing that "nowhere in the world does a major port belong to a workers' collective." Mr. Sobchak's defiance was mild compared with what was happening back in Moscow. There, Ruslan Khasbulatov, the politician Mr. Yeltsin had personally supported for Speaker of the Parliament, openly attacked the price increases and called for a new government. The evening Russian television news program speculated that Mr. Khasbulatov was looking to join Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi and perhaps Mr. Sobchak in a new opposition, using the unpopularity of the price increases as their launching pad. The issue was expected to come to a boil when Mr. Yeltsin goes before the Russian Parliament on Thursday. In the streets, the immediate and pressing problem was food. Since prices were freed on Jan. 2, prices had risen at least fourfold, but the anticipated supplies had not materialized. "This is for a limited time," Mr. Yeltsin pleaded. "I ask your patience for eight months." Mr. Yeltsin's last stop was at a clothing factory that he praised as a successful example of privatization. By this time the winter light was fading and the frost grew more bitter, but still a clutch of people gathered. "Let's wait and see him," an elderly woman urged her husband. "Why?" he replied without breaking his tired stride. "I have nothing to say to him, and he has nothing to say to me."

577-> Art in Review
Mel Chin Queens Museum of Art Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Through Feb. 2 The 17 works in Mel Chin's show (organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis) include paintings, installations and works on paper, but it is the sculpture that proves of interest. Generally speaking, the simpler it is the better. In "Forgetting Tiananmen, Kent State, Tlatelolco," reeds of dried flowers have been embedded in slabs of cast stone and then chipped free as if exhumed. The work honors specific individuals, but it is also a metaphor for suppressed history brought to light. "The Sigh of the Cross" is more complicated. It consists of an enormous upright sickle with a jagged blade, a rope stretched down its length and a box with a faded scarlet cross punctured by the tip of the sickle. A wall text reveals in great detail that it symbolizes the expulsion of the Red Cross from drought-stricken Ethiopia by the Mengistu Haile Mariam Government in 1988. This explanation has the effect of changing the piece almost instantly from an esthetic object to a didactic puzzle in which every material component assumes a precise and predetermined role. Whether this calculated perceptual shift expands or narrows the often overt programmed works in the show is debatable. In the case of "The Sigh of the Cross," vitality drains away from the sculpture in direct proportion to the intricacy of the scenario imposed upon it. The issue raised here -- how sculpture and political content can coexist -- is one with which artists in the 1990's will continue to struggle. Mr. Chin's is an honorable attempt at an answer, but it leaves the question open.

578-> COMPANY NEWS; Three Paper Companies Post Losses
Three of the nation's largest paper and forest products companies reported third-quarter losses yesterday, blaming low prices, weak demand and excess capacity. The Georgia-Pacific Corporation and the Champion International Corporation traced widening operating losses to weak demand for their paper and wood products and to low pulp and paper prices. Bowater Inc. blamed low newsprint prices for its loss, compared with profits at the same time a year ago. Following are the results of the companies' third quarters: Georgia-Pacific The Atlanta company, the nation's No. 2 forest products manufacturer, said its losses increased 19 percent, to $37 million, or 43 cents a share, from $31 million, or 36 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The 1991 results included an after-tax loss of $12 million for asset sales. Sales rose slightly, to $3.06 billion from $2.97 billion. The company said pulp and paper profits dropped to $23 million in the quarter from $67 million a year earlier as sales fell to $1.44 billion from $1.50 billion. Earnings in building products increased to $201 million from $129 million in the quarter a year earlier as sales increased to $1.62 billion from $1.47 billion. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Georgia-Pacific shares closed up 25 cents, to $50.125. Champion The Stamford, Conn., company said its operating losses widened to $19.5 million, from $7.4 million a year earlier. One-time items, including sale of a timberlands and plywood plant in Oregon, gave the company final earnings of $51 million, or 47 cents a share, for the quarter. In the 1991 third quarter, extraordinary items gave the company earnings of $5 million, or 4 cents. Revenue increased slightly, to $1.26 billion from $1.23 billion. Champion stock dropped 37.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange, to $24.375. Bowater The Darien, Conn., company posted a loss of $17.9 million, compared with earnings of $7.1 million, or 17 cents, in the quarter a year ago. Sales increased 17 percent, to $366.2 million, from $312.0 million a year ago. Results for 1992 include the operations of Great Northern Paper Inc. in Maine, which was acquired by Bowater at the end of 1991. Bowater stock closed up 12.5 cents a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $18.375.

579-> COMPANY NEWS; CHEVRON AND KAZAKHSTAN SAID TO AGREE TO OIL VENTURE
The Chevron Corporation and the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan have agreed to a 50-50 joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oilfield, Russian news agencies said yesterday. Tengiz is regarded as one of the world's top 10 fields, with likely reserves of as much as 35 billion barrels. Current output is just 60,000 barrels a day. The Itar-Tass news agency said Chevron's chairman, Kenneth Derr, met with Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, recently and the two agreed to begin a joint venture Jan. 1. Russia's Interfax agency said a Chevron representative had been named managing director and the board would include directors from Kazakhstan and Chevron.

581-> COMPANY NEWS; Profits Rise For 2 Large Drug Makers
Two large pharmaceutical companies, Merck and American Home Products, reported robust double-digit earnings growth yesterday for the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30. But a third drug maker, the Upjohn Company, said quarterly profits fell slightly after the company took charges for early retirements and pensions. Sales of all three were helped by the declining dollar overseas. Details of the three reports follow: Merck Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, said net income rose 16.7 percent, to $645 million, compared with $552 million in the corresponding period of 1991. After adjusting for a stock split last May, Merck's earnings equaled 55 cents a share in the quarter, compared with 47 cents, . "It was a decent quarter," said David F. Saks, a drug analyst at Gruntal & Company. Revenues of Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., were $2.46 billion, up 16.4 percent, of which four percentage points resulted from the sliding dollar. Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, said sales growth in the quarter was led by the maker's Vasotec and Prinivil heart drugs, Mevacor and Zocor cholesterol-lowering drugs, and Pepcid and Prilosec ulcer treatments. Vasotec and Mevacor are the largest selling in fields where competition is growing. Sales of Proscar, Merck's new treatment for enlarged prostate symptoms in men, were "consistent with our expectations," Dr. Vagelos added. Analysts said Proscar was unlikely to show significant sales before early in 1993. Merck's shares rose 25 cents yesterday, to $43.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. American Home Profits at American Home Products rose 11.1 percent, to a record $428 million, or $1.37 a share, compared with from $385 million, or $1.22 a share, in the third quarter of 1991. Revenues for the big New York-based health-care and consumer products company were up 12.3 percent, to $2.11 billion, including two percentage points of foreign exchange gains. John R. Stafford, the company's chairman, said the results reflected a "solid performance" in prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Pharmaceutical sales, led by post-menopausal hormones, oral contraceptives and infant formula, gained 12 percent in the United States and 23 percent overseas. Over-the-counter sales rose 13 percent, led by Advil analgesic and cough and cold remedies. American Home Products' shares gained 87.5 cents yesterday, to $68.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Upjohn The Upjohn Company said net income fell 1.6 percent, to $138 million, in the quarter from $140 million in the 1991 period. The earnings of Upjohn, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., worked out to 77 cents a share, flat for the quarter. It said net income would have been $153 million, up 9.2 percent, before the restructuring charges. Upjohn's revenues rose 7.5 percent, to $894 million. Upjohn's shares were unchanged yesterday at $31.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

583-> Time to Reorganize Bloated Academia
To the Editor: The budgetary problems of colleges and universities are, unfortunately, a consequence of a long overexpansion and reallocation of resources to "higher education," which began with the assumption that a college degree was the capstone of a complete education, to be made achievable for everybody. This new vision had two immediate consequences: it devalued the high-school diploma, discarding the notion that blue-collar work was honorable and productive, and redirected students to seek professional academic careers regardless of ability. In providing this new vision of educational achievement, resources were showered on expanding colleges and universities, inevitably leading to waste and bureaucratic bloat, while on the other hand less costly educational alternatives were rejected. However, it is an economic truism that not everybody can have everything. Recent rises in tuition and costs are merely a reassertion of this old adage, which was long masked by the need for graduates in the economy's overexpanded service sectors. The relative success of community colleges shows how we can solve the problems of general public education and preserve the quality of our higher institutions of learning. The downsizing of colleges and universities should be accomplished by an immediate substantial raising of educational standards at all levels instead of financial restraints, and simultaneous introduction or expansion of alternative educational paths (apprenticeships, trade school), which will provide for the technical work force we so desperately need. If we do this, we will restore on the one hand the value of a high school diploma and on the other we will curb the expansion of unneeded service careers. The process will undoubtedly be painful and extended, as any reallocation of resources always is, but as recent remarks from overseas make quite clear, it is absolutely necessary. RICHARD HYSE St. Petersburg, Fla., Feb. 3, 1992 The writer is professor emeritus of economics at SUNY, Oswego.

587-> BASEBALL; I'll Catch You Later, Says a Tearful Carter
Gary Carter, the affable, clutch-hitting catcher who brought his broad smile and his big bat down from Montreal in 1985 to help guide the Mets to their championship season in 1986, announced yesterday that he was leaving the Expos once again, this time to retire and begin what will be an almost certain journey to Cooperstown, N.Y. He becomes eligible for the Hall of Fame in 1998. As the 38-year-old Carter announced that he would call it quits at the end of this season, his 18th major league campaign in a career that began and will end with the Expos, a cloud replaced his trademark smile and he broke into sobs. "I was contemplating and praying about retirement for some time," he said at a news conference at Olympic Stadium before last night's game against the Cubs. "My body cries out," added Carter, five seasons with the Mets and one season apiece in San Francisco and Los Angeles before he returned to Montreal for his final campaign. By some measures, Carter, whose career totals now include a .262 batting average, whose knees have been a problem in recent seasons. "It hurts. I like to think that I could continue, but I'm not comfortable with the numbers I've had in the last few years." Carter, an 11-time All-Star who will remain with the Expos organization as, among other things, a batting instructor, is batting .216 this season with 5 home runs and 28 runs batted in. He said the happiest day of his life was when he signed a minor league contract with Montreal in 1972 -- and the saddest was the day he was traded to the Mets after the 1984 season. "People will remember me as an Expo," he said. "My identity is with the Expos, not anyone else." Will Remain With Expos In some places that may be true, but not in New York. Carter, a California native, broke in briefly with the Expos in 1974, and then spent 10 full seasons in Montreal. After that came 324 home runs and 1,224 runs batted in for 2,295 games, had his biggest years in Montreal. It was there he had career highs in slugging average (.525) in 1977, and in both batting average (.294) and runs batted in (a league-leading 106) in 1984. But it was after he came to New York in 1985 that Carter's leadership came to the fore. It didn't take him long to demonstrate one reason the Mets had given up four players, including Hubie Brooks, to acquire him. In the 10th inning of the season opener at Shea Stadium on April 9, 1985, Carter hit a bases-empty home run to beat the Cardinals. Months later, in September, he went on a tear. He hit 13 home runs that month and drove in 34 runs as the Mets tried, and ultimately failed, to beat out the Cardinals in a bitter division racae. At one point in September, Carter tied a major league record by hitting five home runs over two consecutive games. One of Carter's main assets to the Mets was his proven ability to coax the best out of young pitchers. And by the end of the 1985 season, Dwight Gooden, the National League rookie of the year without Carter's assistance the year before, had soared to what remains the best season of his career, a 24-4 record that made him the unanimous choice as the youngest pitcher to win the Cy Young award. Although Carter had a higher batting average (.281) and more home runs (a career-high 32) in 1985 than he did in 1986 (.255 and 24) it was in his second season in New York that Carter's leadership and the Mets' inherent talent converged to take the team to victory over the Houston Astros in the playoffs and over the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Typically, Carter played a key role. After getting just one hit in his first 21 at-bats in the championship series against the Astros, it was Carter who hit the game-winning single in the 12th inning to capture Game 5 against Houston. And after the Red Sox won the first two games of the World Series at Shea Stadium, it was Carter who was instrumental in helping the Mets square the series at two games apiece at Fenway Park. Carter hit a double in a big four-run first-inning rally in Game 3 and smashed two home runs over the Green Monster in left field in Game 4. And in the famous 10th inning of Game 6 at Shea Stadium, with the Red Sox one strike away from the World Series championship, it was Carter's single that started the rally that ended when Mookie Wilson hit the game-winning and Series-tying dribbler through the legs of first baseman Bill Buckner.

588-> In Changing World, the Catholic Workers Hew to Their Course
A sign promising "coffee, companionship and free manual labor" brought a few regulars to the smoky auditorium where they were painstakingly hand-folding and stamping 90,000 copies of The Catholic Worker, the paper that still costs a penny and has hardly changed since its founding in 1933. The job takes about a month. But at Maryhouse, the 55 East Third Street "house of hospitality" for the poor where Dorothy Day lived and died, disciples of the movement she and Peter Maurin founded still hold dear such Catholic Worker traditions as the value of working with one's hands. "After Dorothy died, we bought a Macintosh," said Matthew Tessitore, 56 years old. "It's the only piece of technology allowed in the building." This small concession to the computer age, after much prayer and discussion, is one way the movement has changed since Miss Day died, in 1980, at the age of 83. But more remarkable still are the ways in which the movement has stayed the same: proudly, impossibly impractical and ever on the brink of insolvency. A Life of Voluntary Poverty The most recent edition of the newspaper, which is published eight times a year, includes an editorial on the Spanish Civil War, reprinted from 1936, with an editor's note on its applicability to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The movement, born nearly 60 years ago on the Lower East Side, is not exactly struggling to stay current. Instead, its adherents have carved out a corner of Manhattan where most of the conventions and preoccupations of the 90's do not apply. Living in "voluntary poverty," Catholic Workers divide their time between prayer, study, civil disobedience and work with the poor. They do not vote, own personal property or buy insurance. Only a few earn any money, from outside jobs, and some of those are "tax resisters" unwilling to subsidize government spending. The "disorganization," as they call it, is not a registered non-profit agency; it accepts no government or foundation money. Catholic Workers disdain the bureaucracy of social work and reject most of the vocabulary used to describe their work. Their two houses, Maryhouse and nearby St. Joseph House at 36 East First Street, are not homeless shelters, but homes for about 60 fellow travelers. The people who live there are not "clients" but housemates. The Catholic Workers visit the ill and the elderly, and offer a soup meal to several hundred guests every Tuesday through Friday. This life was the lasting vision of Miss Day, an earthy mystic who was also something of a literalist; when her Lord said shelter the homeless and feed the hungry, she took him at his word. After Miss Day's death, "People didn't think we'd survive," said Jo Roberts, the 27-year-old managing editor of the newspaper, who is from England. But a recent listing showed a record 126 Catholic Worker groups in the United States and abroad, with New York adherents considered the movement's purists. Residents of the two houses in the Bowery quote her often, sometimes in the present tense. The Maryhouse office, which has dust older than some of its residents, is lined with photos: Dorothy as a teen-ager, Dorothy as an old woman, Dorothy here and there with her wonderful cheek bones and terrible clothes, a kerchief tied around her head. Still, many people who have lived in the house for years have never seen Miss Day's old room on the second floor, which is now used by a longtime resident. "It isn't a shrine to Dorothy," who didn't believe in any cult of personality, said Jennifer Belisle, 24. A Stringent Moral Theology Miss Day lived widely and then deeply, complaining as a young journalist for communist and labor publications that there seemed to be no place for reflection in a business that required her to interview Trotsky one day and Vincent Astor's butler the next. Before her conversion to Catholicism, she had an abortion, a divorce and a child out of wedlock. Afterward, she embraced a moral theology that left little room for discussion. When the priest Philip Berrigan left the clergy to marry, Miss Day disapproved and refused to let him continue writing for The Worker. In her 20's, she spent long, boozy nights dancing and arguing politics at Greenwich Village cafes with friends like Eugene O'Neill. And at 30, she joined a church that she said she loved beyond all reason. "I loved the church for Christ made visible," she wrote in her book "The Long Loneliness" (Harper Row, 1981). "Not for itself, because it was so often a scandal to me." Now that she is no longer around to defend herself, there has been considerable support for a campaign to canonize her. "I won't be dismissed that easily," she said in her old age. Those Workers who were too young to have known Miss Day seem no less determined to define themselves and the world on their own terms. Meaning from Work "You're not caught in any compromises" at the Catholic Worker, said Carmen Trotta, 29, a Long Island native who said his own moment of truth came when he was a college football player waiting in a Wisconsin hotel lobby before a game. "I was reading Elie Weisel's 'Night' and the passage where he is running, side by side with his father, from a concentration camp, and he starts to pull ahead of his father. I began to cry and I stopped myself and thought, 'Here I am in this football uniform and there are all these custodians to take care of the grass and equipment and technicians and coaches for me to play a game that has no meaning.' " He has been with The Worker for seven years, making soup and mopping up -- work that has meaning for him, but is hardly what his parents had in mind when they sent him to a private college in Iowa. "One of the few things all of us have in common is that our families wonder how we could have gone off the rails so dramatically," said Ms. Roberts. A Knock at the Door On a recent morning in the huge open kitchen and dining room at St. Joseph House, a cook named Tiny had been stirring the pot since 5 A.M., with ingredients donated by merchants. Dishing up soup of an indeterminate color, he sang along with the radio, "Cause you've got personality, plus you've got a brand new ca-aa-ar," while other Catholic Workers served the men and a few women seated at long cafeteria tables. During the course of the meal, one visitor asked to be fitted for a new pair of pants, while others called out the requests of any New Yorker eating out: "Can I get a different kind of bread?" "This table hasn't been wiped." As soon as the meal was over, the work of preparing dinner began. And every few moments, there came a knock at the door, wanderers mostly, wanting a cup of coffee or a copy of the paper. Then a neighbor dropped by to say she was donating 80 pounds of chicken in thanksgiving for an answered prayer. Workers say that's the way they've always gotten along. An Intellectual Component Asked to explain their movement, the Catholic Workers frequently contradict one another. There are no shorthand explanations, and general conversation is not particularly linear. But most are students of philosophy, and the intellectual component of the movement is a major draw. At Friday night meetings that have attracted good crowds for decades, the fall lineup includes talks on cultural crises in India, the work of Czeslaw Milosz and genocide in East Timor. Every Saturday, the group protests outside the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, where 13 were arrested on Aug. 9, the anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. After deciding they had been neglecting their commitment to civil disobedience, they painted their faces white that day and threw blood on tanks inside the museum. Most people in the group have been arrested more than once, and say the whole experience takes about three hours, including time spent going out afterward for a cup of coffee. But on a recent weekend, only Sabra McKenzie, a 23-year-old from Orange County, California, was available for protest duty. At each day's end, the call goes through the Maryhouse, "Vespers!" and the group sits down to another Catholic Worker mainstay. Among the prayers is a petition for guidance; for even here, things are changing. The neighborhood isn't what it once was: It's better, and gentrification has led some to wonder whether Lower Manhattan needs them as much as some other areas might. The Catholic Church has changed, too, and amid devisive debates about the place of women and a celibate clergy, some Workers find it difficult to reconcile Miss Day's radical politics and conservative theology. The New York group already survived a 1987 split, when a contingent of longtime residents left the community, which they felt should more actively address injustices suffered by gays and lesbians. And some Workers also struggle with how far the newspaper should go in criticizing the church. "You would think Dorothy's politics would have led her to be more critical of the church, but you can't do that faithfully within the Catholic Worker," said Mr. Trotta, suggesting that in the end, even a life dedicated to the poor is not without compromise. "This is not the peace of the kingdom," said Jane Sammon, who has lived at Maryhouse for 20 years. "But it is an attempt to try to live another way."

589-> Appointment Will Not Alter Family Control
The appointment of a new publisher at The New York Times yesterday entailed no change in the ownership structure of the newspaper or its parent New York Times Company. Since the purchase of The Times by Adolph S. Ochs in 1896, control of the newspaper and related properties has rested with his family. In February 1990, on the death of Mr. Ochs's daughter, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, control passed to her four children through the automatic termination of a trust established by her father. That trust held 83.7 percent of The New York Times Company's Class B stock; holders of the Class B stock, which is not publicly traded and has unlimited voting rights, elect 9 of the 14 board members. Class A stock, which has limited voting rights, is held by some 13,000 individuals and institutions. Holders of Class A stock, which has been traded on the American Stock Exchange since 1969, elect five board members. Four New Trusts At Mrs. Sulzberger's death, the Class B stock passed to four new trusts benefiting her children and their descendants. Mrs. Sulzberger had 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. These are Mrs. Sulzberger's four children -- each a trustee of all four trusts: *Marian S. Heiskell, a director of The New York Times Company and other companies. She is the widow of Orvil E. Dryfoos, who was president and publisher of The Times at his death in 1963. She is married to Andrew Heiskell, former chairman and chief executive of Time Inc. *Ruth S. Holmberg, a director of The New York Times Company and publisher of The Chattanooga Times in Tennessee, which was part of the Ochs estate. Her husband, A. William Holmberg Jr., is president of The Chattanooga Times. *Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger, a physician and a director of The New York Times Company. *Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company. In 1986 Mr. Ochs's grandchildren and great-grandchildren made agreements to restrict sales of the Class B stock outside the family, in effect maintaining family control of the company. These agreements provide that the Class B stock held in the four trusts cannot be sold unless it is first offered to the other family shareholders and then to the company, at the prevailing price for Class A shares. If neither the family nor the company wants to buy it, the Class B stock must be converted into Class A stock before being sold to outsiders. Individual holders have the option of exchanging their Class B shares for Class A, which can be traded at any time. But the trustees of the four trusts are directed to retain the trusts' shares unless they unanimously determine that the trusts' primary purpose -- "to preserve the editorial independence and integrity of The New York Times" -- can best be achieved by selling. If the trustees agreed to sell Class B stock to someone other than the family or the company, they would first be required to convert it to Class A. Upon the death of any child of Mrs. Sulzberger, the three others are to appoint a new trustee; under the agreements, the trustees of all four trusts must be the same, at least for matters concerning the Class B stock. Trustees of the old Ochs trust held 369,405 shares of Class B stock, 83.7 percent of the total outstanding. That stock -- along with 3,324,645 of the shares of Class A stock held by the Ochs trust, about 4 percent of the total outstanding -- was split among the four current trusts. On the company's current board, the directors elected by Class A shareholders are John F. Akers, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., George B. Munroe, Charles H. Price 2d and Donald M. Stewart. Those elected by Class B shareholders are William R. Cross Jr., Richard L. Gelb, Marian S. Heiskell, Ruth S. Holmberg, Walter E. Mattson, George L. Shinn, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Judith P. Sulzberger and Cyrus R. Vance. Starting in the early 1980's the Times Company has diversified considerably in the communications industry. The company's revenues for 1990 were $1.776 billion, with earnings of 85 cents a share. Yesterday the stock closed at $26 a share, up 50 cents. The Times Company classifies its business into these groups: *Newspapers: The Times and 24 other daily and 8 weekly or twice-weekly newspapers (in Florida, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi and Maine). *Magazines: 17 magazines, including Family Circle, McCall's, Child, Golf Digest, Tennis, Cruising World and a number of related publications. *Broadcasting and information services: five television stations, an AM and an FM radio station (WQXR in New York City), a news service, a feature syndicate, The New York Times Index and various licensing operations. The company also has substantial equity interests in two Canadian newsprint companies and in a Maine paper manufacturing partnership. The company has a one-half interest in The International Herald Tribune.

591-> COMPANY NEWS; Acquittals In Penny Stock Case
Eleven defendants and three companies have been acquitted in a penny-stock case brought after a two-year F.B.I. sting operation. The verdict, which came Friday after a six-week trial and 17 hours of jury deliberations, was a setback for the Justice Department's campaign against white-collar crime. Operation Pennycon was considered one of the biggest and most expensive securities fraud investigations in Colorado history when the indictments were announced last April. The defendants were charged with 16 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud. Each count carried a penalty of up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000. The case was built around the work of a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, John Coffey, who posed as a high-rolling Denver-area broker. Mr. Coffey testified that he had tried to entice people in the penny-stock industry to participate in a scheme to artificially raise the price of shares in a blind-pool company called Terminal Acquisitions Inc. Blind-pool companies raise money from investors for unspecified ventures. Terminal Acquisitions stock went from 1 cent to 8 cents a share in February 1991, and then was dumped on the European market. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which cooperated in the sting operation, suspended trading after four days, prompting phone calls between the undercover agent and the defendants. Tapes of the phone conversations were at the heart of the Government's case. During cross-examination, defense attorneys dismantled Mr. Coffey's testimony by focusing on the agent's lack of knowledge about trading penny stocks and Mr. Coffey's failure to put defendants on notice that he wanted them to break securities laws. After the verdict was announced, the defendants said they were pleased they had been exonerated. An assistant United States attorney, Gerald Rafferty, who prosecuted the case, said: "The jury has spoken. That's all I have to say." The defendants were Moshe Rimson, Joseph Christie, Sheldon P. Prager, Robin M. Rushing, Brent Gundersen, Sam Padolfo, Preston S. Pandolfo, Virgil M. Peterson, Vincent M. McGuire, Victor Boykiw and Richard Sumrall. The companies involved were the General Bond and Share Company, Alpine securities of Salt Lake City, and M. Rimson & Company.

593-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Head of Minolta in U.S. Gives Up President's Job
After 22 years as the head of the American subsidiary of the Minolta Camera Company, Sadahei Kusumoto is finally going to be able to concentrate on the part of the job he likes best: representing Minolta to the outside world. Mr. Kusumoto, who is currently president and chief executive of the Minolta Corporation, will become chairman and chief executive on Jan. 25, turning over the post of president to Osamu Kanaya, who will also be named chief operating officer. "We were only selling cameras when I first came from Japan in 1954," Mr. Kusumoto said. "Now business equipment is bigger than cameras, and it's much more complicated." Mr. Kusumoto, 63, has been among the most visible Japanese executives in the United States and, according to Minolta, he has now been here longer than any other Japanese manager of an American subsidiary. During his tenure, the Minolta Corporation's sales have risen to $780 million from $11 million. In recent years, Mr. Kusumoto has been active in the United Way and has advised other Japanese executives on the importance of philanthropic activities in American corporate life. He has also organized contacts between Japanese and black executives to fight perceptions of Japanese racism. The combination of those activities and a heavy travel schedule to maintain relations with Minolta's 500 equipment distributors has increasingly left his desk in Ramsey, N.J., stacked with work related to internal problems, Mr. Kusumoto said. Now such day-to-day problems will become the responsibility of Mr. Kanaya, 57, a Minolta Camera director who has held a number of financial, planning and administrative positions since joining the company at its Osaka headquarters in 1957. Mr. Kusumoto said that Mr. Kanaya would be inheriting a tough assignment. "The recession here is going to last longer than everyone expected," Mr. Kusumoto said. "It's important to organize the company to deal with it. On top of the recession, we have the problem that the yen is getting stronger. It will require great attention to detail." What advice will he give Mr. Kanaya when he arrives from Japan? "Talking frankly," Mr. Kusumoto said, "is the key to success in the United States."

595-> You Can Too Buy the American Car You Want; Auto Retirement Board
To the Editor: In "Factors That Drive Up Detroit's Costs" (letter, Jan. 24), Ronald A. Glantz notes that Chrysler spent $685 a car for pensions, health insurance and life insurance in 1990. He notes that the Big Three auto makers -- General Motors, Ford, Chrysler -- have substantially greater costs per car than foreign cars manufactured in American plants and imports because they have an older work force. He recommends a tariff on imported cars and parts. This approach is in the right direction, but has a drawback -- tariff increases only lead to reciprocal foreign tariff reaction and have implications for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I have proposed an alternative plan, which has a precedent in the Railroad Retirement Board. Set up an automobile retirement board. Finance it with a Federal sales tax (nondiscriminatory, make it a straight percentage of sales price) and apply it equally to all vehicles (cars, trucks), foreign and domestic. This would prevent GATT conflicts. This would allow the Big Three, with older workers, to reduce the price of their cars by a greater amount than the sales tax, but would cost the foreign cars made in United States plants more than the sales tax in return for the elimination of retirement and other costs. For workers in the transplanted factories the benefit would be an assured safety net when they grow older; Big Three workers would not have to worry about employer bankruptcy, and the overall result would be a more level production-cost playing field.

597-> In Redrawn District, Tone Is Bitter in Congress Race
Patrick J. Roma, a Republican candidate for Congress, held a news conference at his headquarters here on Monday and did what he has done almost every day for the last four months: assail his opponent, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, as the epitome of the "bloated, out-of-control, out-of-touch Congress." The specific charge of the day was that Mr. Torricelli, a five-term incumbent, has not one but two political action committees: one state and one Federal. "It is one more example," Mr. Roma said in a voice strained by weeks of nonstop oral assaults, "one more example of what is wrong with Congress." A Quick Response Mr. Torricelli, just back from Washington and campaigning elsewhere in the district, quickly fired off a response. "Mr. Roma," he said, "is trying desperately to divert attention in this campaign from his extremist views against gun control and legalized abortion, and is willing to go to any length to avoid the real economic issues that legitimate candidates are debating nationwide." So it has gone in the redrawn Ninth Congressional District in the Hackensack River Valley, anchored by Hackensack, the Meadowlands Sports Complex and a string of older ethnic towns like Rutherford. Assemblyman Roma, a former Palisades Park Borough Council president who is in his third term in the Legislature, is running as much against the Congress as an institution as against Mr. Torricelli, whom he calls "the poster child for Congressional abuse." Mr. Roma and his campaign staff routinely pass out checks made of rubber that are drawn on the "Bouncy Savings & Loan" to focus attention on Mr. Torricelli's record with the House Bank -- 27 overdrafts totaling $11,608 over 39 months. They point to Mr. Torricelli's use of the House free-postage provision to mail $250,000 worth of letters to voters over the last 15 months, some of them to people in his new district. The courts subsequently told members of Congress that the free postage could not be used this way, to communicate with voters who are not yet constitutuents. And they point out that Mr. Torricelli voted to preserve the full free-mailing privilege when Congress was considering turning some of the money involved over to a fund for crack-addicted babies. Mr. Torricelli has rejected Mr. Roma's demand that he return the postage money. Mr. Roma also points out repeatedly that Mr. Torricelli voted last year to raise the pay of members of Congress and was one of the chief supporters in the House of former Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, who resigned amid charges of corruption. Echoing attacks that have been used against incumbents around the country, Mr. Roma says, all of this amounts to "a pattern of arrogance and abuse." For his part, Mr. Torricelli has made good use of his imcumbency, putting $1.3 million in his campaign war chest, 10 times the $125,000 Mr. Roma has been able to raise. When the candidates debate on Oct. 19 and 25, Mr. Torricelli will likely pursue two themes that have been central to his campaign: a charge of "waffling" because Mr. Roma changed his stand on abortion, and an accusation of "extremism," asserting that Mr. Roma catered to the politically powerful gun lobby by voting in the Legislature to repeal Gov. Jim Florio's ban on military-style semiautomatic firearms. In his 1989 Assembly race, Mr. Roma filled out two questionnaires on abortion, saying in one that he was opposed to it, but in the other that he supported a woman's right to choose. He has said that he simply changed his mind between questionnaires and that he now feels that abortion is "a woman's individual decision." Despite the vigor of Mr. Roma's attacks on Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Roma's press secretary, Patrick Morrissey, acknowledges that Mr. Roma is trailing the incumbent, but maintains he is "within striking distance" of overtaking him by Election Day, Nov. 3. Republican strategists are not so optimistic about the chances of their 43-year-old candidate, a lawyer and a former prosecutor in Fairview and Palisades Park. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, they cite the advantages of incumbency -- 98 percent of incumbents are re-elected -- and say the 41-year-old Congressman's $1.3 million bankroll gives an enormous advantage to Mr. Torricelli, a lawyer who has spent most of his life in politics and government, as an aide to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and later as counsel to Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Mr. Torricelli said he would use some of the money in coming weeks for a television advertising campaign attacking Mr. Roma on the abortion issue, support from pro-gun forces and his vote to repeal an increase in the state minimum wage. "Up until now," the Congressman said, "we have been doing positive ads."

598-> Grammy for High School Jazz: A Serious Swinger
Michael Leonhart speaks of jazz trumpet the way he plays it -- with elegant eloquence. "It's like a higher level of communication," the 17-year-old from the Upper West Side of Manhattan said. "There's structure, but so much room for chance, for magic, because it is so spontaneous." "The best," he said, "is when there's chemistry between the musicians and something happens that we all know will never be repeated." It was with a sophistication beyond his years that he has earned the first Grammy ever presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to the outstanding high school musician in the nation. A Professor's Praise Mr. Leonhart was not handed his Grammy during the academy's awards ceremony last night at Radio City Music Hall. Instead, his presentation took place on Monday at Fiorello H. La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts, where he is a senior. But he was in the audience at the Music Hall, along with 24 other members of the McDonald's All-American High School Band, a group selected from 27,000 student musicians around the nation. And at least one jazz expert, Dr. Leon Breeden, professor emeritus of music at North Texas State University, believes Mr. Leonhart might very well be up there among the greats some day. "When I heard his audition tape, I felt sure we had a ringer; I really mean that," said Dr. Breeden, who directs the McDonald's band. "Michael plays with tremendous sophistication and awareness," Dr. Breeden said. "His range is amazing. He takes a figure and builds on it, up and over and under; complete control of the instrument." Mr. Leonhart was selected for the Grammy by academy officials and by the vote of other members of the band. Mr. Leonhart takes the honor in stride. "I'll still have to work just as hard at my music and artistry," he said. "But who knows, hopefully it will open a few doors." His musicianship already has opened doors. Fourteen months ago, Wynton Marsalis, the jazz and classical trumpeter, invited Mr. Leonhart to his home for dinner and to compare notes, verbal and musical. "He's definitely a model for me," Mr. Leonhart said of Mr. Marsalis. "His accomplishments have opened the door for every young jazz musician." A Classical Repertoire "I'm quite involved in the classical trumpet repertoire," Mr. Leonhart said. "And hopefully I will attend a conservatory where I will study classical composition." He has applied to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, the Manhattan School of Music and the School of Music at the University of Miami. But like his father, Jay Leonhart, a bassist who has performed with Mel Torme, Tony Bennett, Clark Terry and Louis Bellson, he hopes to make a career on the jazz club circuit. He has already performed with his father at the Blue Note in Greenwich Village, and at jazz festivals. There was no escaping music in the Leonhart house. Mr. Leonhart's mother, Donna, is a jazz singer, as is his sister Carolyn, who has cut an album for a Japanese label. After bouts with the violin at 7 and then drums, Mr. Leonhart turned to trumpet at 10. "It's like a voice for me," he said, "the range of its textures, from warm, soft tones to loud, brilliant." Mr. Leonhart practices three to four hours a day. But sometimes he spends most of a night in a closet, his horn muted. "I was once at a club and heard Harry (Sweets) Edison from the old Count Basie Band," Mr. Leonhart said. "He made the trumpet sound like it was his voice singing through the horn. I rushed home, and all that night I was in the closet, trying to get an inkling of what he was doing. But I doubt I'll be able to truly understand it before I'm 80 years old."

600-> Why Shops' Names Say 'Just:' Because.
IN Manhattan, a city where the range of specialty stores can be mind-boggling, there is something refreshingly direct about places that publicly proclaim their uniqueness. In the 1991-1992 Manhattan Business directory, there are 70-plus listings for stores beginning with the word "just." Out of context, it is hard to know whether to take "just" as a compliment or a slam, though it is certainly a more melodic nomenclature than "Nothing but" or "Only." Still, stores with "just" in their names seem, well, just right -- especially if the item in question happens to be just what one is looking for. "Just" shops, with their linguistic directness and tightly themed wares, make many other less specifically titled emporiums sound unnecessarily complicated. There are lots of fashion justs ("Just Nice Fashion," "Just Silk," "Just Bottoms and Tops," "Just Because Sportswear") and lots of civilian Justs -- Just Mort and Just Abel, for example. Just Cats, Fancy Felines-Feline Fancies, at 244 East 60th Street, is the daytime haunt of the disk jockey Alison Steele, a k a the Night Bird, on WXRK-FM from 2 to 6 A.M. During the day, she is "Top Cat" -- her sister Joyce Loman is the "Marcating Director" -- of a sliver of a store that is, Ms. Steele said, "not a pet shop but a boutique." The sisters breed and sell pedigreed Persians and Himalayans and although they each live with seven cats and a poodle, they focus on cats in the store. "We sell everything for the cat," Ms. Steele said. Everything like made-to-order cat pan "houses," toys, games, bowls, collars, T-shirts -- ("Have a Mice Day" is a big seller,) and a video. "That's about birds and mice," Ms. Loman said. "Things cats like to look at." What Ms. Steele described as "the next level" consists of items for "the people the cats own." "You don't own the cat," Ms. Steele said. "He owns you. He runs the establishment." The next level, then, includes stationery, books, clocks, lamps, picture frames, hangers, bookmarks, scarves, nightshirts, sweatshirts -- even a toilet bowl brush, $35. People who are attracted to cats, but cannot live with them -- an allergic visitor to the store can only stay for a short time before succumbing to itchy eyes and a twitchy nose -- might fall for a voice-activated stuffed cat. Scratch its neck and it purrs; talk to it and it talks back ($70). And if you think that cat crazy people do not have a sense of humor, consider Just Cats' best seller over the holidays. It is a $12 bowl marked "cat from hell." "Everyone thinks they've got just the cat for it," Ms. Steele said. (Just call 212-888-CATS.) Forget about trying to talk to Just the Fax. What you hear when you telephone is, actually, just a fax -- that strident beep that makes you want to hang up in a hurry. Just Toys, at 1107 Broadway, between 24th and 25th Streets, is also not for the buying public. It is a wholesale company that makes dolls. The Little Mermaid, 101 Dalmations and the Super Heroes, are featured heavily in their venue, though these characters appear in just one form: a six-inch bendable doll. Just Counter Tops, no address, just a phone (212-734-5178) is just that. Nothing more. Well, maybe backsplashes. But that is it. "Counter tops are what I supply," said Offer Bok, who has been making house calls for the last three years. Mr. Bok, who works out of his house, carries samples with him to houses and apartments. He gives free estimates, then has the counter tops custom-made. "Everyone is different," he said. "After me, all people need is a faucet." Just Shades, at 21 Spring Street, at Elizabeth Street, claims it was the first to choose such an obsessive name. "Twenty-six years ago we opened on the Bowery," said Connie Rakower who runs the business with her husband Steve. Mr. Rakower's mother, Anne is credited with the concept. For the Rakowers, "Just" really means more and more. "Strictly shades, that's us," said Mrs. Rakower. "We're the largest discount shop of its kind on the Eastern Seaboard." With prices that range from $6.50 to $200 for in-stock shades -- dozens are displayed on functionally plain metal shelving, including the recent best sellers: heavily fringed, trimmed and braided Victorian shades ($90 and up, depending on the amount of frillinesss required). "Just bring in the lamp or the old shade," Mr. Rakower advised, because, he added: "There's only one decorator we know who can walk in without the lamp and walk out with a shade that fits." Three years ago, when he was 9, Jesse Owen thought up the name for his mother's store, Just Kidding. The shop, at 22 Harrison Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, sells children's clothes, books and toys. Margaret Owen, Jesse's mother, has put together a shop filled with playful clothes for small children. Her illustrated T-shirts are $20, and sweatshirts are $22. Swing skirts, the short, twirly kind that little girls go for, are also about $20. Even the stuffed animals are dressed. A cuddly cat is $12, his hand-knit sweater is $8. And there is a play area with a puppet theater, small chairs and books that looks as if it belongs in a nursery school. That is to keep the little guys busy while the grown-ups shop. Just Bulbs is a misleadingly small operation that has staked out the corner of 22d Street and Broadway since 1980. It is decorated with strings of Primal Lites -- bacon and egg and such-shaped lights on a string. Behind the scenes is a 24,000-square-foot, three-level stockroom, crammed with bulbs, bulbs and more bulbs. Just Bulbs is owned by Shirley Brooks and her daughter Judi, who also manages the store. Her grandmother came up with the name. "It's a fun store," said Ms. Brooks, who enjoys putting her hand on just what the customer happens to ask for. "There's a language to be learned here," she said. "It looks confusing, but it's actually very logical." "Lights are everywhere you ever thought of and lots of places you didn't," added Ms. Brooks, and then rattled off a random list of some of the bulbs the store has on hand: "fun stuff and serious energy-efficiency stuff, car headlights and elevator lights, a light for your refrigerator, lights for microscopes, lights for looking at skin conditions, lights for your vacuum cleaner and oven, and 58 colors of white in fluorescents." Bulbs seem to be a recession-proof item. "People are not going to sit in the dark," Ms. Brooks said. O.K., but what about plugs -- sometimes as necessary as bulbs? "Absolutely NO plugs. As I said before it's just bulbs." Sorry we asked.

601-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Pitt Holds Off UConn, Keeps Its Hopes Alive
Pittsburgh continued No. 24 Connecticut's second-half slump, getting 23 points and 12 rebounds from Chris McNeal and some accurate free-throw shooting down the stretch to beat the Huskies, 86-77, tonight. Pitt, one of the Big East's worst foul-shooting teams, made 24 of 28 free throws, 17 of 20 in the second half. Pitt was shooting just 61 percent from the line entering the game. Connecticut (17-7 over all, 8-7 in the conference), which was 16-1 three weeks ago, lost for the sixth time in seven games, all in the conference. The Huskies had beaten Pitt five times in a row, including two straight on the Panthers' home floor. Pitt (16-12, 8-7) kept its National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament hopes alive by stopping a three-game losing streak and winning for just the second time in its last six games. The Panthers probably need to win at least twice more to return to the tournament. Darren Morningstar added 19 points for Pitt. Chris Smith led UConn with 22 points. Syracuse 76, Boston College 70 SYRACUSE (AP) -- Lawrence Moten and Adrian Autry, both scoreless in the first half, led a second-half comeback that helped No. 22 Syracuse end a four-game losing streak. Moten scored 18 points and Autry added 14 as the Orangemen overcame an 11-point halftime deficit. It was Syracuse's sixth straight victory over Boston College (15-9, 7-8) and 16th in the last 17 meetings. Syracuse improved to 17-7 and 9-6. Villanova 61, Miami 50 MIAMI (AP) -- Villanova found its shooting touch in the second half. The Miami Hurricanes are still looking for theirs. Greg Woodard scored 18 of his 20 points after halftime in the Big East contest to help the Wildcats break open a close game and beat ice-cold Miami. The Hurricanes set school records with their 11th consecutive loss and their 20th this season. Dayton 60m Notre Dame 58 DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Robertson stole the ball twice in the closing seconds and fed Derrick Dukes for the winning layup as Dayton rallied to beat Notre Dame. Dayton (14-13) never led until Robertson stole the ball and passed to Dukes for a layup and 60-58 lead with 9 seconds to play. Notre Dame (11-12) then had two chances to tie or go ahead, but Robertson and John Richter stole the ball to prevent the Fighting Irish from getting off a shot.

603-> BASKETBALL; Italy Is Nice, But Addison Likes the Nets
One of the ways to uncover what's behind the Nets' upswing these days is to do what Coach Bill Fitch has been doing with regularity and success: Go to the bench. Last week Derrick Coleman, normally a starter, helped the Nets win two games in a role off the bench, and Kenny Anderson, the highly regarded rookie, stepped in to preserve another victory. But the reserve of the moment is 6-foot-7-inch swingman Rafael Addison, who was summoned to the rescue by Fitch in the second quarter on Wednesday night against Phoenix and responded nobly. Addison finished with 19 points in 28 minutes, grabbed 5 rebounds, made 1 steal and dished out 2 assists as he helped New Jersey rally to a 106-104 victory over the Suns at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. It was the Nets' fourth straight victory. "I didn't put Addison in for his offense; I put him in for his defense," said Fitch. "I put him in specifically because Chris Morris wasn't getting the job done and was struggling. "What Morris wasn't doing Addison had to do: react to the pressure. Mo is not as good in his shot selection. Rafael has become very versatile and he has a great temperament. Playing in Europe was a good thing for him and so was being able to come back home and play before his family and friends. He was one of the best Christmas presents I got this year." From Jersey City to Italy Addison was a star at Snyder High School in Jersey City. He went on to become an offensive star at Syracuse, leading the Orangemen in scoring as a junior, averaging 18.4 points per game. He was drafted by Phoenix in the second round in 1986 and averaged 5.8 points in 62 games as a rookie for the Suns. The Nets signed him as a free agent last October after he had played four years in Italy. Addison was not all that happy in Phoenix. "I had a great time," he said. "It wasn't the city. I was in the Suns' organization but not feeling at home, not feeling like I was a part of the team or I was in their plans." So he decided to go even farther away from home and play ball in Italy. "I enjoyed it," said Addison, who liked playing for the team in Livorno so much he wound up staying in Italy for four years. "I was going to go over for one year and then come back to the N.B.A. "They only have two Americans on each team, and as an American you've got all the pressure on you to start every game, to be the leading scorer, to get the winning basket. The only bad thing is that you practice more than you play. You play only once a week, about 30 games from August to May. You get a villa and a car to drive, all at the team's expense." Time to Come Home So why the return to the National Basketball Association, where so far this season Addison has played in 37 games, started only 3, averaged 14.7 minutes, 1.9 rebounds and 5.2 points in a reserve role for the Nets? "It was time," said Addison, whose daughter, Ashley, was born to him and his wife, Xanda, last July and whose 6-year-old son, Antonio, speaks perfect Italian. He also described his new role in basketball: I always thought offense first and then defense. Now the first thing I think about is defense. Anybody can play offense, but not everybody can play defense." "It's also nice playing here in front of my family," he added. "I'm happy to be here. I appreciate the job the Nets have given me." REBOUNDS The Nets (18-21) are perfectly poised to play the two teams immediately ahead of them in the Atlantic Division standing. There's Miami tonight at home and then the 76ers tomorrow night in Philadelphia, the beginning of a five-game road swing with other stops in Sacramento, Phoenix, Portland and Los Angeles for the Clippers.

605-> The American Way of War
To the Editor: Since Appomattox, 127 years of blinkered addicts, them what fought it and them what tell it, have it all wrong. Caleb Carr, all by his lonesome, has, at long last, exposed the lack of sensitivity and the want of political correctness displayed by those brutish louts who conducted the American Civil War. Oh, my goodness me! Mr. Carr has forced me from my blissful state of denial and has challenged me to confront my co-dependence upon the likes of Douglas Southall Freeman, Shelby Foote and -- oh, my heavens! -- that blinkered addict Bruce Catton. Sigh. The 90's are sooo difficult! Shame on you for publishing such tripe. Your logo says The New York Times Book Review, not The New York Times Polemic Review. I must go -- I'm beginning to get the sweats; I have the shakes; I'm in withdrawal. I need a Catton! Ahhh! Sweet bliss! See you on the firing line. . . . M. E. MALONE Kent, Wash. Caleb Carr replies: I am amused at the accusation that I bow to political correctness. Only months before this offending piece appeared, I reviewed another author's book on the Indian Wars and congratulated him for resisting the pressures of p.c. by documenting the wanton savagery of certain Indian groups. I was promptly indicted by Noam Chomsky for "the usual frothing at the mouth about political correctness." The notion that there have been, in American history, episodes in which neither side behaved like much more than bloodthirsty animals is apparently too morally complex for many to bear. The principal factual objection to my review seems to be my supposedly erroneous assertion that since Forrest and Sheridan did not succeed in cutting vital supply lines, their campaigns were of little historical significance. It is protested that the Confederate high command did not assign Forrest the job of going after Sherman's supply lines until October 1864, a month after the fall of Atlanta. Yet when the Governor of Georgia asked Jefferson Davis in June of that year to send Forrest to relieve the pressure on his beleaguered state, the Confederate President answered that "Forrest's command is now operating on one of Sherman's lines of communication" -- although, as Brian Steel Wills wryly observes, the Governor "might have justifiably asked to which line Davis was referring." Had Forrest been the genius so many claim, he would certainly have divined the absolutely critical importance of such a job and gone after it. He did not; and even when he finally did take the field against Sherman's lines of communication and supply in October, as even Mr. Wills notes, "his efforts were far too late to impair Sherman's ability to remain in Georgia." As for Sheridan's failure to cut Robert E. Lee's lifeline, the Virginia Central Railroad, Roy Morris Jr. states quite clearly that "there were sound strategic reasons for Grant's continued stress on cutting the railroad, but Sheridan was neither privy to the general-in-chief's innermost hopes and fears, nor prescient in his grasp of the overall situation " (my italics). These two actions were the only ones through which either Forrest or Sheridan could have affected the ultimate outcome of the war; their failure to carry them out successfully, I reiterate, makes their wartime careers of little historical significance. As to the objection that neither Forrest nor Sheridan should be judged by today's moral standards, I can only say that there were a great many people in the 1860's and 1870's -- in both the North and the South -- who understood that enslaving and persecuting blacks and murdering Indians was not only wrong but criminal. To maintain that this is a contemporary sensibility is to do no justice to those brave Americans who spoke out against the tides of racism and conquest through elimination. Nor am I suggesting that Sheridan's and Forrest's military genius should be overlooked because of their racism -- I am saying that they had no military genius, and they also happened to be racists. Finally, to the suggestion that Helmuth von Moltke's Prussian troops "would have been hard pressed had they had to face the democratic Union Army of 1865," I can only offer what I fear will be interpreted by my colleagues as a supercilious chuckle.

607-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief Executive Is Named At Municipal Bond Insurer
The Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, the subsidiary of the GE Capital Corporation that insures securities, principally municipal bonds, has named Ann C. Stern president and chief executive. Ms. Stern replaces Stephen Berger, who has been appointed executive vice president of GE Capital, a diversified financial services company based in Stamford, Conn., that is a division of the General Electric Company. Before joining Financial Guaranty, Mr. Berger spent five years as the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and before that was an investment banker with Odyssey Partners. Gary C. Wendt, GE Capital's president and chief executive, said yesterday that Ms. Stern "brings extensive legal experience, credit underwriting and management skills to the position." What is more, she knows the company well. She joined Financial Guaranty in 1984, the year it began business, as vice president, general counsel and secretary. "We were working out of boxes in cramped temporary quarters," she said in an interview yesterday. "We were so short-handed I often had to stay late to run the copying machine." The following year, Ms. Stern was promoted to senior vice president, and in 1989 she became an executive vice president. She is a member of the executive committee and a director of the company. Ms. Stern, who is 39, said she had no plans to tinker with the way Financial Guaranty does business, maintaining its conservative approach to insuring securities. But she does want to alter the company's internal structure. Financial Guaranty has 163 employees. "I want to move away from the pyramid-style of management and involve more people in the decision-making process," she said. "There is a lot of potential to be harnessed from the people who are actually out there doing business." A graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, Ms. Stern began her legal career as an associate at Brown, Wood, Ivey, Mitchell & Petty. She served as bond counsel and underwriter on municipal issues and general obligation bonds, specializing in hospital and housing revenue bonds. Ms. Stern lives in Manhattan with her husband, Steven Berzin, and their 2-year-old son, Amaury.

608-> COMPANY NEWS; Berlitz Hires An Adviser
Berlitz International Inc. said today that a financial adviser would explore the company's options, including its possible sale. The Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation will review options including a recapitalization, continuation as an independent company and the sale of a partial or controlling stake. The language training company is at the center of a dispute among six institutions, each of which have claimed a 56 percent stake in its shares which was once controlled by Macmillan Inc. The late publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell acquired the stake when his flagship company, the Maxwell Communication Corporation, bought Macmillan in 1988. But Mr. Maxwell apparently pledged the shares to different institutions in return for loans before he died at sea last fall. Two days after the publisher's death, Maxwell Communication said the stake was for sale for $265 million. The company later said the Berlitz shares had disappeared and began an effort to trace them. Maxwell Communication has since gone into bankruptcy. Berlitz retained Donaldson when a committee was created to consider sales of shares by Macmillan. Berlitz shares rose 37.5 cents today on the Big Board, to $19.50.

Minimum-wage claims by 17 of 18 Nordstrom employees who sued the retailer have been rejected, but a King County judge refused on Friday to dismiss the class-action case. Lawyers for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represented Nordstrom employees at five Seattle-area stores before a decertification election last summer, may find another worker to support the class-action lawsuit, Judge William Downing of King County Superior Court ruled. The lawsuit accuses NordstromInc. of pressuring employees to work without pay outside their normal hours on chores like taking inventory, stocking shelves, making deliveries, attending company meetings and writing thank-you notes to customers.

611-> Conference in England Weighs European Unity
European Community leaders began gathering in this central English city today for a daylong summit meeting on Friday intended to explore differences over the future of European political and monetary union, including proposals to limit the power of community bureaucrats in Brussels. But senior British officials are dampening expectations of any kind of breakthrough regarding coordination of currencies, trade or political union at the meeting, which Prime Minister John Major summoned last month. Instead, officials now describe the Birmingham meeting as, at best, a chance to lay groundwork for future agreements that might hedge the controversial treaty on European union and satisfy those members, including Denmark and Britain, which are looking to establish clear limits on the community's federal powers. If such agreements can be reached, they would be presented at the next regularly scheduled European Council meeting in Edinburgh, in December, British officials say. Turmoil in the Markets Acting in his capacity as head of government of the country that holds the community's rotating presidency, Mr. Major had called the emergency summit meeting last month after the narrow approval of the treaty by French voters. The French vote came after a narrow defeat in Denmark, and both ballots indicated increasing popular dissatisfaction with the accord. Prime Minister Poul Schlueter of Denmark said today his Government was prepared to submit the treaty for a second vote, if the community was willing to give Copenhagen an option to stay out of plans for joint currency, defense and law enforcement. In the negotiations last year, Britain reserved to Parliament the right to decide whether it would join a European currency. Britain also refused to sign the treaty's social charter, which governs workers' rights. Uncertainty about the treaty also produced turmoil in international currency markets that ultimately forced Britain to withdraw the pound from a system that had fixed the pound's value to other European currencies. Since then, the floating pound has fallen in value by about 11 percent. Schedule for Cooperation The treaty establishes a schedule for closer economic cooperation, including a single European currency, and creates a mechanism for cooperation on defense and foreign affairs. Mr. Major has said he remains committed to the treaty's central points, but he intends to use the summit meeting to help forge consensus on his own vision of a decentralized European Community which would, in the words of one British official, "close the gap between the community and its citizens" by putting clear limits on the authority of Brussels bureaucrats. At issue is the principle of subsidiarity, which would enshrine the notion that actions should be considered at the community level only when they cannot be undertaken by member states. Actions at Local Level The French, among others, are sharply opposed to any plan to draw up a list that would define which decisions should be made at which level. The Danish Government, on the other hand, pointed out that people across Europe are demanding a greater say by their national and local elective bodies in Europe-wide laws and regulations. In Brussels, Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, acknowledged that Mr. Major was facing political difficulties over his support for the treaty, and said that one of the chief aims of the Birmingham meeting "is really to help the Prime Minister and the British Government." Aides to Mr. Major say the Prime Minister was hoping the results of the meeting would help deflect criticism from skeptics within his own party who object to the diminution of British sovereignty implied by the treaty. Mr. Major has said he is determined to see the treaty ratified by the British Parliament during its next session, which opens in London next week. In London, The Daily Telegraph, a longtime supporter of Conservative governments, suggested today that Mr. Major had misplaced his priorities, by exerting so much time and energy trying to persuade European leaders to accept his more limited version of the pending treaty on political and monetary union. "At a time when the Government's rhetoric and attention should be focused squarely upon the appalling economic situation," the newspaper wrote, "the Prime Minster and his senior colleagues will persist in their efforts to promote Maastricht as the symbol of the Government's determination and purpose." The point was underscored today with the release of new figures showing the nation's unemployment rate at 10.1 percent, the highest in five years and the 29th straight month in which British unemployment has grown. Mine Closings Add to Furor The grim statistics only added to the dismay of critics still seething over the Government's decision on Tuesday to close more than half of Britain's coal mines and lay off 30,000 mine workers. Union official say the cutbacks could affect as many as 70,000 other workers in related industries. The mine closings, which are to take place over the next five months, have emerged in recent days as symbols of Britain's current economic despair, sharpening fears of worker unrest, including possible strikes. The mine and railroad workers, who intend to stage big protest marches in London next week, said they would ballot members on a possible strike later this fall. Earlier today, the National Union of Mineworkers sought an injuction from the High Court, seeking to block the first four mine closings, scheduled for Friday. Lawyers for the union said British Coal had broken both British and community law by failing to consult miners and their unions over the cings.

612-> CHRONICLE
There are many ways to tell the story of a person's life. In the case of EUGENE R. SCANLAN, who rose from the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria to its executive suite and was once executive chef at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, it will be done Tuesday evening with food. Mr. Scanlan, a former vice president of the Waldorf-Astoria, who is now general manager of the Union Club, will be honored for 50 years in the business by the hospitality and tourism division of the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity of the Archdiocese of New York. The committee is the secular fund-raising branch of the archdiocese. Mr. Scanlan was asked to propose the dishes to be served at the banquet. "I wanted a menu that reflected my career, with something from each decade," he said yesterday. So the guests will dine on glazed canapes and quiche Lorraine, reminiscent of the 1940's ("They don't glaze canape in gelatin or serve quiches heavy with cheese and cream anymore," Mr. Scanlan said), chicken soup with matzoh balls (to evoke the Fontainebleau), veal chop and rice with smothered peas (what he prepared for Pope Paul VI for the first papal trip to North America in 1965) and a salad with Brie (served to Pope Paul II in 1979). The highlights of Mr. Scanlan's career as suggested by the dishes? "Of course, the visits from the two Holy Fathers," he said, "and the time I got brazen at the Fontainebleau and made green matzoh balls on March 17."

615-> Mutual Benefit in Deal
The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company said yesterday that the Bankers Trust Company had agreed to take over its MB Variable Life Insurance subsidiary. A Bankers Trust spokesman confirmed that Bankers Trust had agreed to exchange its claims against Mutual Benefit Life for the assets of the subsidiary. Terms were not disclosed. As a commercial bank, Bankers Trust would normally not be permitted to make such an acquisition because it is not allowed to sell insurance. A Bankers Trust spokesman said the transaction was not an acquisition but an exchange of the bank's claims against Mutual Benefit Life.

618-> A LA CARTE; Starr Boggs Moving
STARR BOGGS of Westhampton Beach, one of the most celebrated restaurants on the East End, is moving from the village to the waterfront. In May, when the restaurant reopens after its annual winter hiatus, it will be at the Dune Deck Hotel, 231 Dune Road, between the ocean and bay, with a view of both. In its new site, a mile west of the West Bridge, the restaurant will seat 75 to 80. The present Starr Boggs, at 23 Sunset Avenue, will be converted into Saffron's, a casual Mediterranean restaurant operated by the owners of Ca'Nova in Manhattan. They also will continue to run All Seasons, at the Inn in Quogue, this summer. The Dune Deck location will also enable Starr Boggs to serve lunch on a large outdoor deck area overlooking the water. Clambakes will also be scheduled on the deck once or twice a month. The new Dune Deck location provides a larger kitchen, additional storage and an additional room for catered parties. The menu at Starr Boggs will not change. It emphasizes local produce and fresh food, especially fish. The American Hotel, on Main Street in Sag Harbor, has again been awarded the highest honor from The Wine Spectator, the Grand Award. Worldwide, 84 restaurants were designated in the 1992 edition for offering "the very best wine lists in the world." The American was the lone Long Island restaurant selected. With an inventory of 20,000 bottles of wine and 1,000 choices, the restaurant is cited for being especially strong in French wines and California cabernets and chardonnays. Its price policy is categorized by The Spectator as inexpensive. Four other Island restaurants received awards of excellence for "offering many good wines." They were Dar Tiffany, 44 Glen Cove Road, Greenvale; La Mascotte, 3 Crooked Hill Road, Commack; the Maidstone Arms, 207 Main Street, East Hampton, and Mirabelle, 404 North Country Road, East Hampton. La Mascotte's pricing policy is categorized as inexpensive. The three others were designated moderate. The strengths of the four lists were Dar Tiffany, cabernets; La Mascotte, French; Maidstone Arms, French reds and Napa cabernets, and Mirabelle, French. The 5 restaurants were among 942 establishments in 24 countries chosen by The Spectator. Wine-tasting meals and gourmet feasts are anything but unusual on Long Island. But the Due Torri Italian Restaurant and Rotisserie, in the penthouse at 330 Motor Parkway in Happauge, presents them with a twist. The chef, Ugo Sguanci, prepares the dinners in front of his guests. What is more, he distributes detailed recipes, so that diners can recreate all the dishes at home. Additionally, the chef and visiting experts conduct brief seminars on herbs and wines, followed by question-and-answer periods. The dinners cost about $40, plus tax and tip. Although Due Torri has the largest and most magnificent rotisserie on the Island, it is used only part-time. The proper operation of a rotisserie requires the constant attention of an experienced chef. There is an art to rotisserie cooking, a healthful method of preparing food. The chef at Bryant & Cooper's store in Roslyn, Joseph Guerra, installed a new rotisserie last summer, and it has been busy since. The biggest seller at the steakhouse's store is fish. The rotisserie's salmon is especially popular.

619-> HEADLINERS; Stepping Aside?
To the consternation of many in the West, the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from Afghanistan three years ago wasn't followed by a rebel victory there or the prompt replacement of Najibullah, the leader the Kremlin had propped up. Instead, the fighting, which began 13 years ago, just dragged on. Now, however, the combination of international pressure and exhaustion from war, along with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the drying up of financial assistance from its successor states, seem to be having an effect. United Nations officials have been saying that their efforts to help Afghans negotiate an end to the war depend on a commitment from Mr. Najibullah to step down. Last week, he finally agreed to do so -- once an interim government is formed with the consent of diverse elements of Afghan society under the United Nations' plan. Mr. Najibullah had pledged to support the plan, but the announcement was his first public commitment to step aside to give the plan a chance to work.

621-> French Youths Clean a Cave And Damage Prehistoric Art
The idea was to clean up graffiti, but a youth group in southwestern France got carried away and wiped out a bit of prehistory as well, damaging cave paintings thousands of years old. French cultural officials are furious, and say they plan to file a complaint against the group. "Absolutely stupid!" said Rene Gachet, director of cultural affairs for the Tarn-et-Garonne department, 400 miles southwest of Paris. The head of the spelunkers club that arranged the youth group's cleanup blamed officials for failing to designate the site as a historic treasure and act to protect it. The damage was done last Sunday, when about 70 members of the youth group descended on the Mayrieres cave near the village of Bruniquel, armed with steel brushes to clean up graffiti. They damaged a portion of the cave's 15,000-year-old bison paintings before realizing what they were.

628-> Centel Says It's Studying Possible Sale
The Centel Corporation, one of the country's largest non-Bell telephone companies and one of the few large cellular telephone properties not owned by a giant phone company, said yesterday that because of increasing industry consolidation, it might put itself on the auction block. As recently as Wednesday, the stock market valued Centel at just over $3 billion. But yesterday, reacting to the news, the market bid up the company's share price by $9, to $46, raising Centel's value to nearly $4 billion. Analysts said the company might be worth nearly $5 billion. They cited the potential value of the cellular telephone business, one of the fastest- growing sectors in a telecommunications industry slowed by recession. Formally, Centel, which is based in Chicago, said simply that it was looking to "enhance shareholder value" and that it had hired Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company, which specialize in mergers and acquisitions, to advise management. "All we're looking at is strategic alternatives," John P. Frazee Jr., chairman of Centel, said in an interview. "We think the consolidation of the telecommunications industry is inevitable, but we want to manage the process. A sale could be part of that, but I don't want to go into exact details of what we might do." He said there were "absolutely no bids on the table." Centel's stock was the fourth most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. With the $9 rise in price, Centel's 84.9 million shares are worth $3.9 billion. Marion M. Boucher, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said Centel shares could be worth between $55 and $60 a share, or $4.67 billion to $5.1 billion, but that the maximum price seemed unlikely. "The market is betting on the unrealized value of the cellular properties," Ms. Boucher said. "There really aren't any cellular properties left on the market, and all of a sudden this one is available." Because Centel's biggest cellular telephone subscriber areas are in Nevada, Ms. Boucher said, Pacific Telesis, the regional Bell company in nearby San Francisco, is a logical buyer. But she said Bell South, Bell Atlantic and, to a lesser extent, the more cautious Ameritech, were also possible bidders. And despite their recent large purchases of cellular properties, Ms. Boucher would not rule out GTE and McCaw Cellular, or an aggressive foreign company, like Britain's Cable and Wireless. Steady Phone Earnings Centel is attractive because it is the 11th-largest local telephone company and the 10th-largest cellular-telephone company in the country. Local telephone carriers, despite heavy regulation, are attractive investments because of their steady earnings. Centel has about 1.6 million telephone lines, about as many as Thailand, concentrated mainly in Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. All of its 1990 profits of $47 million on revenue of $1.15 billion came from local phone service. Centel lost $14.5 million on its cellular operations in 1990, but Mr. Frazee said it made a small profit last year. The cellular telephone industry, after heavy capital expenditures and substantial losses for start-up ventures, is just beginning to break even or earn small profits. Of the top 10 cellular telephone companies, which cover two-thrids of the population, only Centel's business is not owned by McCaw, GTE or a Bell company. With 16.3 million potential subscribers, Centel dwarfs the rest of the independent cellular providers in the remainder of the top 25 companies.

629-> Reviews/Dance; Philadelphia Troupe Offers a Social-Protest Work
Philadanco, founded in 1970 in Philadelphia by its director, Joan Myers Brown, has thrilled New York regularly with the bracing energy of its young dancers, and the newest visit certainly offers more of the same. But the current overflowing program of seven pieces, which opened on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street) also has a fascinating historical treat on view through the weekend. The company has just revived "Southern Landscape," a 1947 work by the distinguished choreographer Talley Beatty. He is best known today for fast-moving contemporary pieces like "The Stack-Up," a big hit with an anti-drug message that he created a decade ago for the the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Superficially, there might seem little connection between the sassy street rhythms of that work's decidedly urban landscape and the rural plantation images with a distilled gestural style of "Southern Landscape." Yet both are social-protest pieces without being propaganda; each is concerned with a different period of hopelessness for blacks. In the case of "Southern Landscape," it is the Reconstruction era. Or rather, it is a little-known aspect of that era that Mr. Beatty heard about from the novelist Howard Fast. The subtitle of "Southern Landscape" is "The end of the Reconstruction period marked the end (by destruction) of the thousands of cooperative farms that had been created after the Civil War." This phrase is hardly sufficient to explain the specifics of Mr. Beatty's imagery, which refers to terrorism by Southern whites who drove black farmers off their new farms. But as a member of the modern-dance generation that came of age in the 1940's, Mr. Beatty is a master at abstracting feeling through movement, and the overall emotions communicated can be universally understood. Nonetheless, it is virtually impossible for today's dancers to recapture the focus on essence that is so deeply embedded in such choreography. A viewer could be affected more by the form than the feeling of the central solo, "Mourners Bench." Paul B. Sadler Jr., the young soloist who cantilevered out from the all-purpose bench prop, was nonetheless thoroughly impressive for his physical daring and intensity. Yet to see Mr. Beatty in a film of the same solo is to see a person embodying grief rather than a dancer depicting a mourner. The same is true of the group sections: "The Defeat in the Fields" and "My Hair Was Wet With the Midnight Dew," which refers to the farmers' furtive nighttime burial of their dead; "Sittin' Up: Ring Shout," a cathartic ritual led by Kim Y. Bears; "Runagate Variations," with its images of flight, and "I Feel Like Travlin', Got on My Travlin' Shoes," a jubilant processional that symbolizes the migration of Southern blacks northward. Understandably, the dancers are more at home in works created for them. Milton Myers, the company's resident choreographer, knows how to showcase talent, and "Love 'n' Pain," a premiere, does just that for its six hip-swinging women obviously angry at their invisible men. Mr. Myers turns a familiar blues-solo formula, here set to seven recordings by Aretha Franklin, into something fresh. Luctricia Welters, a dancer of silken sensuality in everything she does, is a knockout as she mimes her desperation in a solo section, "Respect," while Miss Bears, terrific all evening, sets the right tone of energetic defiance at the start. All the dancers are seen as individuals, and the others are Sabrina Madison, Norma Gina Avellino, Kim Gadlin and Desiree Pina. Unusually, the women project the stronger stage presence, although there was a high-jumping male contingent within Mr. Myers's jazz piece, "Pacing." His especially good version of the Stravinsky "Ebony Concerto" brought out wit from all. The too-long program included the familiar "Rosa" by Billy Wilson, "White Dragon" by Elisa Monte and "A Rag, a Bone and a Hank of Hair" by Mr. Beatty.

630-> CURRENTS: MILAN; Beds With Architecture
AN hour before the opening, people were already milling about inside the Design Gallery Milano in Milan, ogling Ettore Sottsass' "Rovine/Ruins" collection, which made its debut on April 10. Included were a couple of very large and colorful storage units, about a dozen overscale vases and four monumental beds. But instead of being full size, the beds were shortened, defined only by their headboards and footboards, in the style of a sheet showroom. In between the headboards and footboards -- some had built-in lighting, all had architectural overtones (a chrome fence, a plastic laminate brick wall, left) -- were mounds of fresh white linen. Some people thought that was the way the beds were actually meant to be: a kind of sculptural statement, no doubt. They were assured that they were real beds and if ordered, would be available in twin or double sizes. But where was Mr. Sottsass, the designer of these nighttime beauties? "He may not be coming in tonight," a receptionist said. "He's very tired."

631-> FILM; New Insights From the Outback
Like the sound of one hand clapping, the notion of a blind photographer dances on the edge of logic. For Jocelyn Moorhouse, the 31-year-old Australian writer-director, the idea was the key to a creative puzzle. Her debut feature film, "Proof," which opens in New York today at the Angelika Film Center, concerns two exquisitely tormented young people: Martin (played by Hugo Weaving), who trusts no one because he is blind, must constantly depend on others; his housekeeper, Celia (Genevieve Picot), who loves her employer passionately, is driven by his coldness to torture him with petty cruelties. "I'd always wanted to make a film about a man like Martin, a man who can't trust," Ms. Moorhouse said one recent gray morning from a suburb of Melbourne. "A ruthless perfectionist in his judgments of other people, someone who hates himself. But it wasn't until I hit on the idea of a blind photographer that I realized, 'Ah, this is my opportunity to explore this type of man.' " "Proof," which was seen at the New Directors/New Film series on Friday, has received a slew of honors, among them special mention in the Camera d'Or category at Cannes; the 1991 Australian Film Institute awards for best film, best direction in a feature film and best screenplay; and showings at the Sundance Festival in Utah and at festivals in Toronto, Tokyo and Sydney. The film has already had commercial runs in Australia and England. The "Proof" of the title refers to the photographs Martin takes daily -- of leaves, trees, people, anything around him. To him they are documentary evidence that he inhabits the same world as sighted people. The plot is set into motion when Martin acquires a new friend, Andy (Russell Crowe). Andy agrees to look at the snapshots and describe them aloud. The new friendship has disastrous consequences for Martin's tense, but precisely balanced, relationship with Celia. Despite its serious themes and involuted plot, "Proof" is steeped in black comedy, a genre for which Ms. Moorhouse discovered her gift while still a student at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in Sydney. The discovery was accidental. She made a short, "Pavane," as a class assignment. "Very Bergmanlike," she said. "That is, it was an attempt to do Bergman. It was basically a homeless girl who accidentally kind of, umm, impales a real estate agent. She stays with him all night while he bleeds to death, and asks him totally inane questions. Like, 'Do you have an electric blanket?' and 'Do you have a color television?' "Unfortunately, everybody thought it was a black comedy. I was devastated." She amended at once, "No, I wasn't. I realized after a while that I had failed in my attempt to do something profound, but I had done something extremely, unintentionally funny. It was a great learning process." After graduating from film school in 1984, Ms. Moorhouse went to work as a script editor and writer for Australian television, eventually creating a successful series for children. At the same time, she worked on the screenplay that was to become "Proof." It took four years. "I was writing it as my secret little project that was keeping me sane," she said. "I didn't know it would take so long." It was filmed in 1990 during six weeks in Melbourne. Featuring actors with little film experience (though Mr. Weaving is well known for television work in Australia and Ms. Picot a recognized stage actress there), it was brought in on a budget of $880,000. The money was provided by two Australian Government arts agencies. Although Martin's blindness is central to the plot of "Proof," Ms. Moorhouse does not think the film is fundamentally about blindness. On the contrary, she believes we are all in the same fix as her protagonist. "None of us actually has proof of anything, especially when it comes to emotions," she said. "When you love somebody, you just decide to trust them." Nevertheless, "I do relate to Martin's handicap, because I was very sick as a child with asthma. A lot of my early life, I was terribly frustrated. My friends could take part in sports, do all kinds of things, but I'd run 10 steps and collapse." Also like Martin, who can never afford to stalk off in a rage or toss his cane in the air for joy, "I was always having to stay terribly in control, because if I got too emotional, I'd have an attack." The pacing of the film, too, is tightly controlled, a quality the director traces partly to Martin's personality, partly to the editing. "For me, making films is very much a musical sort of experience," she said. "I don't think film is truly visual. It has a lot in common with music, in terms of rhythm and appealing to an audience's subconscious." She was present throughout the editing, she added, to make sure the editor understood the rhythms she had in mind. She also labored over the soundtrack, choosing a band (Not Drowning, Waving) that uses natural sounds. And she handpicked each sound effect. "I was trying to create a kind of emotional womb for Martin," she said. "We worked like maniacs. If you take a lot of care with the soundtrack, I think you can really give your film a sense of being its own world." A storyteller since childhood, Ms. Moorhouse first planned on becoming a playwright or novelist. But at the age of 17, she saw two films that changed her life: Fred Schepisi's "Devil's Playground," about sexual tensions in a Catholic seminary, and Nicolas Roeg's "Man Who Fell to Earth." "That was when I started looking at film as a way of communicating your feelings to other people," she said. "Not just for entertainment, but to reach out." At film school, she met her husband, Paul J. Hogan, also a writer-director (and no relation to the Paul Hogan of Crocodile Dundee fame). Ms. Moorhouse's next project will be to co-produce -- with Lynda House, who produced "Proof" -- a film written by Mr. Hogan called "Muriel's Wedding." Ms. Moorhouse describes it as a "very black comedy." Mr. Hogan will direct. Ms. Moorhouse is also writing a new film, a thriller about a female forensic scientist. Set in the Australian outback, it explores "the dark side of maternal love," not only the fiercely protective side but also the profound change that becoming a mother forces on a woman's identity. Ms. Moorhouse and Mr. Hogan have a 2-year-old son, whose unexpected arrival delayed the making of "Proof" for a year. As a new mother, "you suddenly realize that the person you were is gone forever," Ms. Moorhouse said. "You have to find the new person you are, and that is frightening. I also wanted to explore the family unit, how the mysteries of maternal passion can alienate the man and drive him to pretty extreme actions." Meanwhile, there remains the question of how Americans will receive "Proof." "It's not a light and airy film," Ms. Moorhouse said. "It's obsessive, very complex." But, she added quickly, "I would hate people to think it's a highbrow, intellectual film they've got to work at. They don't. They really just have to sit there and let it seep in."

636-> Balancing Success in Schools and a Lie on the Record
One recent afternoon, William E. Ubinas, the beleaguered superintendent of Manhattan's School District 1, gave a whirlwind tour of his fiefdom, which comprises 18 schools and some 9,500 students on the Lower East Side. During the course of a couple of hours, he stopped in four schools and a dozen different classrooms, striding the halls with the loping, loose-limbed gait of an ex-basketball athlete, taking the stairs two and three at a time, picking up litter and working up a serious sweat as he greeted everyone in sight, teachers, parents and students, many of them by name. He was fed bread baked by some 5-year-olds and serenaded by a clarinet-heavy band of 10- and 11-year-olds. "This is the good part of the job," he said. "This is what you do it for." But his mood was stifled a bit when he stopped in a fourth-grade classroom at Public School 188 on East Houston Street. A boy sitting in the front row looked up from the book he was reading and asked: "Aren't you the guy in the newspaper? They want to take your job away, right?" A Final Ruling Awaits Everyone in the neighborhood, it seems, knows Mr. Ubinas (pronounced oo-BEAN-yas) and knows about his problems. Last year, Mr. Ubinas was suspended for two weeks by the district school board because he failed to disclose a 1974 drug conviction on his certification application. He was reinstated by the board after vigorous protest from district parents. Then the state began its own investigation and three weeks ago a state Education Department panel recommended that his administrator's certification be revoked. Mr. Ubinas has appealed the three-member panel's decision -- which was not unanimous -- and is now awaiting a final ruling by the State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol. If Mr. Sobol goes along with the panel's recommendation, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez would be compelled to remove Mr. Ubinas. No one contests that Mr. Ubinas, as an 18-year-old college student at Auburn University in Alabama, was convicted of possession of marijuana and sale of cocaine and sentenced to 10 years probation. Nor does anyone dispute that he never said anything about it to the district school board or that on his certification form he answered "no" to the question: Have you ever been convicted of a felony? On the other hand, Mr. Ubinas, at 36 the city's youngest district superintendent, seems to have large-scale support among district parents and many teachers, who praise his energy and devotion. Even some of Mr. Ubinas's harshest critics concede that in the two years he has been at his post, he has wrought necessary changes in a school district -- the city's smallest -- that had been plagued by stagnation and a steady egress of students. Advances in the District Since Mr. Ubinas arrived in July 1990 from Boston, where he had been an elementary school principal for six years, 14 of the district's 18 schools have signed up for the Chancellor's pet project, school-based management, and the district has implemented a number of new programs, including three alternative early childhood schools. The groundwork has been laid for the district's first high school, scheduled to open in September, and Mr. Ubinas has been widely credited for opening the door to businesses that want to collaborate with district schools. Two weeks ago, for example, I.B.M., which supports several programs in the district, designated Public School 142 as "The Technology School" and donated more than $750,000 worth of equipment. "Let me put it this way," said John Johnson, a parent interviewed at a noisy rally in support of Mr. Ubinas after the state panel's recommendation. "If you were drowning and I offered a hand to save you, I'm sure you wouldn't care what my past was." The issue, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Sobol, Patricia Keegan, is: "Does Mr. Ubinas's perjury on an application form constitute a violation of good moral character?" And thus the question of Mr. Ubinas's character is being debated on the Lower East Side with a vehemence that is extraordinary even by the normally volatile standards of school board politics. Racial Factors Cited Not surprisingly, given the character of school politics in the city, the dispute over Mr. Ubinas is given a racial cast by some. He is a native of San Juan, P. R., in a district where 73 percent of the student body is Hispanic. Mr. Ubinas says he thinks the charges against him are racially motivated. His opponents say that even though many in the community have their doubts about the superintendent, he is being protected by them as one of their own. Mr. Ubinas's detractors also say that the application form omission, what Mr. Ubinas now refers to as a "lack of judgment," is evidence of a pattern of untrustworthiness. They note that Mr. Ubinas did not confess to the conviction on his application for licenses in Massachusetts either. They also note that he involved his former Deputy Superintendent, Anthony Cavanna, in a conflict of interest by having Dr. Cavanna sign a guaranty for a lease on Mr. Ubinas's apartment. The critics also say that Mr. Ubinas has mood swings, forgets promises and bullies subordinates. Mr. Ubinas and his supporters contend, however, that this is simply his temperament -- aggressive, often overheated -- and that it is how he gets done what he has gotten done. "What am I about?" said Mr. Ubinas, who is paid $102,000 a year. "Alternative schools, developmental programs, an integrated curriculum, business patrons, parents as partners, school-based management." He said he erred politically by introducing too many programs too quickly. "My point is I don't have a generation to wait," he said. "I don't think it's Bill Ubinas they're after. It's what I stand for. I'm a symbol of change." Board Members Are Split Either to his credit or to his detriment, he has not modified his behavior, almost to the extent of courting suspicion. "Tony Alvarado is one of my heroes," Mr. Ubinas said, referring to the current superintendent of Manhattan's District 2, also flamboyant and also Puerto Rican, who in 1984 resigned as the city's schools chancellor under shadow of fiscal improprieties. "They say he's arrogant. Well, I'm a little arrogant, too." Interviews with some of those who worked with Mr. Ubinas in Boston, at the Blackstone School, a public elementary school, indicate that menacing argumentativeness in pursuit of a progressive agenda was his method there as well. Though no one would speak for attribution, more than one person said that Mr. Ubinas responded to criticism with overbearing anger and that, as one school official put it, "his mood swings went off the charts either way." On the Lower East Side, the nine-member community school board is angrily split. Six are unqualified supporters of Mr. Ubinas, two are intractable opponents, and one, D. Perry Brandsten, has maintained a conscience-stricken ambivalence. "I'm supporting him somewhat equivocally," Mr. Brandsten said. "He's a good superintendent and we're very likely to do worse with whoever would come next. But every time I feel I'm getting to trust him, something happens that makes me feel I can't." 'What Do They Win?' The "character" debate begins with whether Mr. Ubinas knowingly lied about his criminal record. He has offered a dual explanation, which he reiterated in an interview, first that he thought the criminal record had been sealed and second that it had happened so long ago he had simply put it behind him. Edward F. Stancik, the special commissioner of investigations for the New York City school district, for one, thinks Mr. Ubinas fabricated the closed-record defense. "When we first interviewed him, he never made that defense," Mr. Stancik said. In March 1991, a few months after Mr. Ubinas's 1974 arrest was reported by the F.B.I. to the Board of Education, through a standard fingerprint check, Mr. Ubinas, who served four of the 10 years of his probationary sentence, applied to close his record. Also within weeks of the F.B.I. report, Mr. Ubinas interviewed for the headmaster's job at the Baldwin School in his hometown of San Juan. He was offered the job in a letter dated Jan. 18, 1991. In an interview, Mr. Ubinas said he did not take the job because he decided "I'm not going to run." By far the most serious, and most persistent, allegation against Mr. Ubinas is that he still uses cocaine or was using it at the time he came to New York. The drug rumors are widely discussed in the school district and were one of the focuses of the city school district's investigation. Mr. Stancik said there is no evidence of drug use. Mr. Ubinas categorically and vociferously denies any drug use since his conviction. Mr. Ubinas calls the charges against him "character assassinations," motivated by board members who initially supported him but, he said, then discovered they could not push him around. After a year of battling, now on the brink of the state commissioner's decision about his future, he conceded that "sometimes it's tough to get up in the morning." "If I lose my certificate," he said, angrily, but with a hint of desperation and despair, "what do they win? What do they win?"

637-> Garden Q. & A.
Summer Bulbs Q. I would like to plant summer bulbs. Where can I buy them, and what do you suggest? -- Lucille Ishikawa, Queens. A. You're wise to be thinking beyond the spring bloomers. Now that winter frosts have faded, you should find summer bulbs at most garden centers. Summer bulbs are virtually fail-safe plants since the flower bud is already in place at the time of purchase (just like tulips); they should be planted within the next few weeks. The gladiola is a good example of a summer bulb, but less-well-known ones include the peacock orchid (Acidanthera bicolor), which has white flowers with a crimson center; the Mexican shell flower or tiger flower (Tigridia pavonia), whose iris-shaped, spotted flowers come in many bright hues; the Peruvian daffodil or Ismene (Hymenocallis narcissiflora), with fragrant white daffodil-like blooms, and the Crinum-lily (Crinum powellii), with pink flowers. Butterfly Food Q. How do I attract monarch and swallowtail butterflies? What do they feed on? -- Ruth H. Smith, New Paltz, N.Y. A. Monarchs and swallowtails feed on different plants at different stages. There are four distinct stages in a butterfly's life cycle: The egg, the caterpillar or larva, the chrysalis or pupa and, finally, the adult butterfly. "Caterpillars are built primarily for eating," said Mathew Tekulsky, author of "The Butterfly Garden" (Harvard Common Press, 1985). Mr. Tekulsky said that as a caterpillar, the monarch is partial to various species of milkweed, whose bitter juice makes it distasteful to predators like birds. In its butterfly stage, the monarch may also drink the nectar from goldenrod, thistle, cosmos, butterfly bush, lantana and lilac. During its caterpillar stage, the eastern black swallowtail is partial to members of the carrot family, which includes Queen Anne's lace and parsley. During its butterfly stage, Mr. Tekulsky said, the swallowtail prefers nectar from flowers like thistle, phlox, clover and purple loosestrife. A new book on the subject is the beautifully illustrated "A Field Guide to Eastern Butterflies" by Paul A. Opler (Houghton Mifflin; $24.95). Strange Limbs Q. I recently saw a row of trees whose branches were distorted, kind of short and lumpy at the ends. What is this? -- Andrew Dillard, Trenton. A. What you saw was the pruning technique called pollarding. This is a traditional European method for keeping trees at a fixed height and width. Every two or three years the new branch growth is cut back to within a foot or two or the trunk. This results in the swollen, distorted branch stubs you saw, which are most apparent when the plant has yet to grow its summer leaves. Pollarding is also sometimes used for shrubs that bear colorful new stems, since it assures a good supply of young wood. Fragrant Grasses Q. I'm interested in fragrant plants and wondered if there were any grasses with scent. -- Jay Johnson, Wilmington, Del. A. Several ornamental grasses give off appealing fragrances when their leaves are rubbed or broken. They include lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus) and sweetgrass or vanilla grass (Hierochloa odorata). When dried, sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) is fragrant, too. Sweet flag (Acorus calamus) is not a true member of the grass family, but it's a grasslike plant that is scented. Greening Indoors Q. I'm an apartment dweller and with summer coming I want to have greenery too -- indoors. What do you suggest? -- Maryjane W. Kirkpatrick, Boston. A. Imaginative planning can turn any windowsill into a Lilliputian tropical retreat. But be sure to match the plant with the available light. Species that do well in bright reflected light include cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior), prayer plant (Maranta leuconeura), spathiphyllum and many ferns. Plants for sills with three hours' sun include fuchsia, pony-tail plant (Beaucarnea recurvata), kaffir lilly (Clivia miniata) and jewel orchid (Ludisia discolor). On sills with at least five hours' sun, try pincushion cactuses (Mammilaria species), elephant bush (Portulacaria afra Variagata), Madagascar palm (pachypodium lamerei) or scented geraniums (Pelargonium). Also, you might look at a new quarterly called HousePlant Magazine. It is $19.95 a year. A sample issue is $3 from HousePlant, Box 1638, Elkins, W. Va. 26241; (304) 636-1212.

639-> Classical Music in Review
Paul Sperry Tenor Kathryn Bache Miller Theater Walt Whitman's poems speak to many composers, even if composers don't respond with any great unanimity. Paul Sperry's song recital last Thursday at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater presented 13 inspirations drawn from a single writing style. They ended up saying more about musicians than about poetry. From Paul Hindemith's gentle elegance ("Sing On There in the Swamp") to Charles Ives's brutal aphorism (from "Song of Myself"), Whitman offered no shaping force to a collective musical design; rather he seemed only the blank paper on which attempts at it were drawn. Brevity predominated (Otto Luening, Ernst Bacon, Ruth Schontal). Three longer songs varied in quality: Leonard Bernstein's touching tribute to Whitman's hidden loves ("To What You Said"); Kurt Weill's "Dirge for Two Veterans" in the composer's marching ballad style, then a dreary, drawn-out setting of "Come Up From the Fields Father" by Larry Alan Smith. Scott Eyerly's "I Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ" mixed the saccharine with the whimsical; Marc Blitzstein's unpublished "As If a Phantom Caress'd Me" showed distinctive harmony; Ned Rorem's "Full of Life Now" had the confident logic of a highly skilled songwriter. Mr. Sperry, who began with Schumann's "Liederkreis" (Op. 39), possesses a curiously flawed tenor voice. Rightly celebrated for his services to American music, he has the precise declamatory style that grasps English words whole and makes them speak coherently. There are also songs that hit his voice at exactly the right angle; Lee Hoiby's "Beginning My Studies" was one such window of opportunity. Schumann, however, was a poor advertisement, bothered as it was by frail and unsupported tone at quiet levels, wide tremors and errant pitch at fortissimo and a contorted facial musculature that seems to rob lines both of resonance and breath. These seemed less the product of age and wear than matters of basic technique. Irma Vallecillo was the efficient if anonymous pianist, and Benjamin Verdery played the guitar in Mr. Smith's piece. The printed German texts were a nightmare of errors.

642-> CURRENTS: MILAN; From Jewelry To Furniture
WORKING things by hand is Kris Ruhs's credo. Mr. Ruhs is a New York artist who became known for his masterful hand-wrought jewelry that was the perfect complement to Romeo Gigli's highly imaginative, Renaissance-inspired clothes. Mr. Ruhs has now added furniture to his repertory. Included in the collection, which was introduced during the Milan Furniture Fair at the Carla Sozzani Gallery, were Mr. Ruhs's cutout tin room dividers or mobile curtains, bent steel stools, mosaic-topped tables and a rather mysterious, wild-looking chair. "That's just made out of pieces of old rope wound round and round," he said. "It's taken on a bit of a personality -- a friendly one, I hope." Mr. Ruhs, who inlaid part of the hood of a car into a tabletop and bent steel into squiggly stools, added, "Everything is completely handworked." . Although some people trace an African inspiration in Mr. Ruhs's pieces, he sees it more as a "kind of primitiveness of the work rather than the idea." He never knows how a piece is going to end up when he starts working on it. "I'm always challenged along the way," he said. "I approach the work as an artist, not as a designer."

646-> Tigers Fall To Poachers
Indian poachers working for an international smuggling gang have trapped and killed at least five tigers and perhaps as many as 20 in India's best-known tiger sanctuary. A member of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's Cabinet, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today that several poachers had been captured and had confessed to the police near the sanctuary, Ranthambhor National Park, that they had killed five tigers. A wildlife expert at the park said the number killed was several times higher, and both he and the Cabinet official said the poachers were part of an international ring that smuggled tiger skin and bone to Southeast Asia. Tigers have been shot in other wildlife parks, but the killings at Ranthambhor in Rajasthan state are said to be the worst reported in decades. "They sell the skin in Delhi to smugglers and traders, and then it goes to Nepal and then to South Asia, especially Singapore and Hong Kong," said the wildlife expert, Fateh Singh Rathore. Tiger bone, hair and skin are used in some cultures as aphrodisiacs. A tiger census this year said just 17 animals were living in the sprawling Ranthambhor park, although 45 were counted in 1991. The tiger is officially a protected animal in this country, but forest officials say the illegal shootings have continued for years. Mr. Rathore said the poachers were paid 25,000 rupees to 40,000 rupees, or about $800 to $1,300, for each skin by middlemen. Although that sum is a fraction of what a tiger skin brings on the illicit international market, it is equivalent to a year's salary for some village farmers and forest dwellers.

The New Orleans Saints have signed their first-round draft pick VAUGHN DUNBAR, a running back from Indiana, to a three-year contract, a team spokesman, NEAL GULKIS, said yesterday. Other than revealing that there was no option year, the team would make no further comment on the contract. "The good thing about this is I don't have to sit," Dunbar said, referring to a potential training camp holdout. "I didn't want to have to do that, and Mr. Finks knew that. We weren't asking for crazy numbers. Just what was fair." JIM FINKS is the Saints president and general manager.

649-> COMPANY NEWS; Ralston Purina
The Ralston Purina Company, citing a focus on its core businesses, said it was developing a plan to spin off its Continental Baking Company unit to shareholders. The plan, to be reviewed by Ralston's board on May 28, could include a dividend of up to $600 million from Continental. If approved, the spinoff will occur after tax, legal and financial issues are resolved. That means Continental Baking's shares would not be distributed for up to 12 months, Ralston said. Under the plan, each Ralston shareholder would receive a proportionate number of new shares in Continental. Ralston did not say how many shares would be issued.

654-> Rabin Invokes Old Victory to Seek a New One in Israeli Election Campaign
"Israel Is Waiting for Rabin," campaign posters plastered across the country say, and for the benefit of the eight or nine Israelis who may not yet get the point, they show a photograph of Yitzhak Rabin at his no-nonsense best. The slogan alludes to an old tune called "Nasser Is Waiting for Rabin." It was from 1967, just before the lightning conflict popularly known as the Six-Day War, when Mr. Rabin was Chief of Staff of the Israeli armed forces and the songwriters were describing, whimsically but prophetically, how President Gamal Abdel Nasser and his Egyptian Army were about to have their lights punched out. The idea behind the new posters, put up by the opposition Labor Party, is to evoke a golden moment for Mr. Rabin and Israel. There is, however, another point as well, aimed squarely at vacillating voters who may be weary of the last 15 years of Likud Party governments but who feel skittish about swinging all the way over to Labor in next month's national elections. A Personalized Campaign To them, the message is unstated but clear: Forget about Labor. Vote for Rabin. In his party office here today, Mr. Rabin, Labor's leader for the last three months, spoke almost wistfully about how he wished Israelis could choose their Prime Minister through direct elections. He seemed to be suggesting there was little chance of his losing in a head-to-head race against Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Likud. There will be such direct elections the next go-around. But this time, on June 23, Israelis will vote as they always have, for a party. It could have been different, Mr. Rabin said, but Likud "torpedoed" a plan for immediate change. "Likud was afraid to put Shamir against me -- or any other candidates that they could produce," he said slowly in a voice so deep that it seemed to rumble up from somewhere around his socks. So Labor, he explained, has resorted to a campaign strategy that puts unusually strong emphasis on him personally as well as on party policies. 'The Who and the What' "It is a combination of the who and the what," he said. Two months past one's 70th birthday is not the time when most men think about a grand comeback, but if Israeli opinion polls are to be believed, Mr. Rabin has reason to hope he just might return to the office of Prime Minister that he held in the mid-1970's. There are no guarantees, of course. Israeli moods are volatile, the country's coalition politics is complex and the tendency at the moment of truth to vote the way one always has is strong. Nonetheless, Labor seems for now to be attracting once die-hard "Likudniks" wanting change. Many of these people say that feel confident that in Mr. Rabin, who as Defense Minister cracked down hard on the nascent Palestinian uprising five years ago, they have a man who will not be a pushover for the Arabs. For his part, Mr. Rabin says that he will indeed be strong on issues of peace and security. Flexibility in Peace Talks But he insists he will be more flexible than Mr. Shamir in the continuing peace talks with the Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries. He says without going into too many specifics that he will reduce what he calls unnecessary "political" settlements in Israeli-occupied territories. He is also ready, he adds, to negotiate a return of some land to Arab control but not areas like the Golan Heights and parts of the West Bank that he considers vital to Israel's security. Within a year of taking office, he hopes to hammer out an agreement giving Palestinians self-rule in the territories, Mr. Rabin says, although when it comes to timetables, "I don't want to pin it down because it might create misunderstanding." Israel's relations with the United States, which recently have come unglued, need to be mended in a hurry, he says, quickly adding that "it doesn't mean that therefore we have to act under American dictates by any means." That postscript seemed to take into account a widely held assumption here that Washington would be delighted to see Mr. Rabin displace Mr. Shamir. The last thing that the Labor leader needs is to be perceived as a stalking horse for George Bush. String of High Offices Mr. Rabin is ex-just about everything that counts in Israel: Chief of Staff from 1964 to 1968, Ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, Prime Minister from 1974 to 1977. He fell from the top office under a cloud of scandal, only to return to the Government as Defense Minister from 1984 to 1990. Looking back today on his days as national leader, he recalled important decisions made at a time when Israel was still reeling from the shock of having been caught flat-footed by the attacking Egyptian army in the 1973 war. Military preparedness was improved, he says, and interim agreements on troop deployment were reached with Egypt. But others remember that Mr. Rabin, a career soldier and newly minted as a politician, had no sense of how to cope with Israel's endless domestic squabbling. "He never understood the need to talk, to deal, to put up with a lot of jerks," a personal friend said. "So he appeared to be incompetent and unsympathetic." A Weak Public Speaker Some Israeli commentators say it also does not help the stolid Mr. Rabin that he lands -- just like Mr. Shamir -- on the low end of the charisma scale. As an orator and phrasemaker, he resembles Demosthenes only in that he sometimes seems to be speaking with pebbles in his mouth. He hit a low point in 1977 when, on the eve of national elections, he resigned as Prime Minister after he and his wife, Leah, were discovered to have kept illegal bank accounts in Washington. Yet 15 years later that scandal seems as remote to most Israelis, especially younger ones, as tales of the Maccabees. Instead, Mr. Rabin is widely regarded as a straight arrow, who admirably speaks his mind in characteristically Israeli fashion: to the point, albeit sometimes, tender souls say, he tests the outer limits of politeness. "It might be that sometimes I'm too outspoken," he acknowledged today. Mr. Rabin's comeback got rolling in February when he narrowly defeated his longtime rival, the incumbent Labor leader, Shimon Peres, in the first party primary held in Israel. Now Likud is clearly worried that he might win the general election, so much so that it has resorted in recent days to dredging up old insinuations that he has a drinking problem. On occasion, Mr. Rabin must also deal with accusations that he suffered a breakdown just before the 1967 war, based on the fact that he fell suddenly from public view for a day. Innuendo From Likud As he campaigns around the country, he is pursued by Likud hecklers carrying signs with slogans like "We need a clear-headed Prime Minister." Asked today about the charges, Mr. Rabin waved them aside. "The question of drinking is stupid," he said, and then dropped the issue. As for the supposed breakdown, he said, "I believe wars have to be judged by results." "It's true, one day I was out. I was staying at home, sleeping. But then it was 12 days before the war started. I'm not hiding it." In his memoirs, written in 1979, Mr. Rabin said he had been physically exhausted and perhaps suffering from nicotine poisoning as the result of nonstop smoking. "Since then, I proved myself," he said. "I believe I proved my capability to take decisions and to withstand pressure."

656-> GOLF; Edwards Outlasts Fehr In Memorial Gloaming
A wet and wild day at the Memorial tournament ended in deep twilight today with journeyman David Edwards parring the second hole of a sudden-death playoff to defeat Rick Fehr. The longest day on the PGA Tour so far this year came to an end after Fehr's drop from the casual water on the 17th fairway settled into a difficult lie, from which he left his 5-iron approach short of green. Fehr pitched to eight feet, and after Edwards two-putted for par from 20 feet, missed his putt to keep the tie alive. For the 36-year-old Edwards, who birdied the final two holes of regulation with putts of 20 feet and 12 feet, the victory was his third in 14 years on the PGA Tour, and his first since the Los Angeles Open in 1984. "I wasn't thinking a lot about winning, but if you hang in there in this game, it just seems like things eventually turn around," said Edwards, who earned a check for $234,000, which was the largest check of his career. "I'm not long and I'm not strong. I just have to work with what I got, and today things went my way." String of Playoff Losses For the 29-year-old Fehr, the loss was his third in a sudden-death playoff in less than a year. He lost a three-way playoff to Billy Ray Brown at Hartford last July, and in January was eliminated from a five-way playoff at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, which was eventually won by John Cook. "One victory and a lot of almosts," said Fehr, who won the B.C. Open in 1986. "That's not bad. I'm not that old yet." Both players fired final-round 67's over a drenched Muirfield Village Golf Club for 72-hole totals of 15-under-par 273. Their totals were one stroke better than those of Joey Sindelar, who opened the fourth round with a three-shot lead, and Payne Stewart, who had his best finish on the PGA Tour since winning last year's United States Open. Sindelar, who opened the day by playing the first four holes in four over par to let a rain-drenched pack back into the tournament, rallied to play the last 14 holes in three under par. He also had an eight-foot putt for birdie on the final hole to get back into the tournament, but missed it on the left edge. 'A Little Bit Embarrassing' "Sure, it was disappointing and a little bit embarrassing," said Sindelar, who was playing before fans who remembered him as an all-American at nearby Ohio State University. "But I could have bled to death out there and I didn't, so that's some consolation." Stewart also had a good chance to win the tournament when he eagled the par-5 15th hole to tie Fehr for the lead. But Stewart, whose first top-10 finish in America since the United States Open came last week at the Kemper Open, bogeyed the par four 17th when he flubbed a chip shot. He missed birdie on the final hole to finish with a 66. "I'm back to having fun, believing in myself and trusting my golf swing, and I'm seeing results from it,." Stewart said No one got quite the results that Edwards got today. A short hitter, he said the wet conditions helped him keep long-iron approaches on the greens. He made only one mistake in the final round, a three-putt on the ninth hole for his only bogey of the day, and recovered from water hazards on the par-5 7th and 15th holes to save crucial pars. "I got away with a lot of things and got some good breaks today," said Edwards, who holed a 3-iron second shot for an eagle on the first hole on Saturday. "Without breaks, I'm not good enough to beat all these guys."

658-> Board Rejects Trump's Waterfront Plan
A community board voted overwhelmingly last night against Donald J. Trump's plan for Manhattan's largest undeveloped waterfront property, a plan that would add nearly 6,000 apartments and a twin-tower office building to a neighborhood that many residents say is already more crowded than they would like. The vote by Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side was 35 to 1, with 2 members abstaining and 1 present but not voting. The outcome was what everyone from the project's opponents to Mr. Trump himself had expected. "You don't get positive votes from community boards," he said. "Even if anybody proposed all parkland, it would be unanimously voted down." The board voted after watching an animated computer simulation of a bicycle ride through the neighborhood as Mr. Trump envisions it. The colors were blander than on "The Simpsons," and buildings were shown as nothing more than flat shapes. "It's ugly," one audience member said. "It's like Wall Street," another said. "It's like Alcatraz," said a third. A crowd of 200 people attended the hearing at the Martin Luther King Jr. High School, at Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street. Known as Riverside South, the Trump plan envisions 14 apartment buildings, twin office towers, a film production studio and a 21.5-acre waterfront park. The site, once a railroad yard, stretches from 59th Street to 72d Street between the Hudson River and West End Avenue and Freedom Place. The plan also calls for extending Riverside Drive south from 72d Street to 59th Street, as well as bringing the elevated West Side Highway down to ground level and rerouting it farther inland. But many opponents said they were concerned that Riverside South would overburden the 72d Street subway station on the IRT line and the North River Sewage Treatment Center. "Too dense in size, too dense in people," said Roni Wattman, a Community Board 7 member who opposed the project. Still, she said she thought that the project had a future, though not necessarily in the form now on the drawing board. "I think it can be fixed," she said. "I don't think I'm saying 'No, never.' I'm trying to say, 'Where do we go from here?' " The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, who plans to hold two forums and another public hearing, is to make a recommendation of her own. After that, the next step in the approval process would put the project before the City Planning Commission. Ms. Messinger said last night that she was "a little bit unhappy" that the development team had not done more to negotiate at the community board level. "They might have begun to address some of these issues before the vote," she said. "It wouldn't have changed the results of the vote," but it would have sent a conciliatory signal.

660-> BASEBALL; Steinbrenner to Miss The Big Announcement
The long-awaited but anticlimactic announcement on George Steinbrenner's baseball future is scheduled for today. Barring a last-minute snag -- the Steinbrenner saga has been filled with snags -- Commissioner Fay Vincent will announce that the owner can return to active duty with the Yankees next March 1. Although the timing of the announcement was based on the commissioner's schedule this week, it comes on the eve of the start of the Barcelona Olympics, which have occupied much of Steinbrenner's time in his 23-month absence from the Yankees. Steinbrenner is a vice president of the United States Olympic Committee and is in Barcelona with the United States delegation. The commissioner's announcement will come as no surprise to Steinbrenner, nor to anyone else. Steinbrenner has known since June 1 that Vincent would modify their agreement under which he was ousted as the Yankees' managing partner on Aug. 20, 1990. Tried to Come Back Sooner Although he unsuccessfully tried to get Vincent to move even further from the original agreement, allowing him back completely or in part before March 1, Steinbrenner has also known the date of his return. Recent newspaper reports have said that Steinbrenner, having failed to get what he wanted, was causing delay of the announcement because he was waiting for Vincent to be ousted as commissioner by a group of owners who have hoped to get enough signatures on a letter asking him to resign. If that happened, according to the reports, Steinbrenner thought he could return under conditions more favorable to him. Under the conditions imposed by Vincent, Steinbrenner's actions after his return would be monitored to some extent. No Evidence of Involvement The commissioner's office has not received any indication that Steinbrenner has participated in the effort to induce Vincent to resign. That effort has apparently fizzled. Steinbrenner began asking Vincent last December to modify their July 30, 1990 agreement, but Vincent would do nothing until three lawsuits stemming from the owner's ouster were dropped. Leonard Kleinman, the Yankees' former chief operating officer, dropped the last suit April 24, and Steinbrenner formally requested a change in the agreement May 19. Vincent had been set to announce the modified agreement June 15. But he suddenly postponed the announcement while he looked into reports from present and former Yankees employees that Steinbrenner had violated the agreement by communicating with club officials. The inquiry, Vincent said, turned up nothing substantial.

661-> BASEBALL; Cubs, in Court, Get Reprieve From Realignment
In a rare ruling against an action taken by a baseball commissioner, a Federal judge temporarily blocked National League realignment yesterday, issuing a preliminary finding that Commissioner Fay Vincent exceeded his authority in ordering the Chicago Cubs to go west. Judge Suzanne B. Conlon of United States District Court in Chicago granted the Cubs a preliminary injunction in their lawsuit against Vincent. Judge Conlon said that Vincent's "unprecedented action" violated a provision of the Major League Agreement, the rules under which the business of baseball is administered. She also suggested in court that next Thursday she would entertain a motion for a summary judgment, which, given the clear-cut view in her ruling yesterday, she would almost certainly grant. That would give the Cubs the permanent injunction they seek aimed at blocking the move of the Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals to the National League's Western Division and the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds to the Eastern Division. Vincent's Lawyers Appeal The commissioner's lawyers immediately appealed Judge Conlon's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. They also asked Judge Conlon to delay her proceedings until the appeal is heard. However, even if the appellate court were to overturn Judge Conlon's decision and act expeditiously, the timing could make it too late to implement realignment for the 1993 season. The dispute pits the commissioner's power to act in the best interests in baseball, contained in Article I of the Major League Agreement, and the Cubs' contention that a team cannot be moved without its consent, a provision of the National League constitution. When Vincent ordered realignment on July 6, he said he was influenced by the fact that the National League will expand from 12 to 14 teams in 1993, with the Florida Marlins joining the Eastern Division and the Colorado Rockies joining the West. The Cubs had used their veto power to block realignment, but a group of six National League owners asked the commissioner to use his best-interests-of-baseball powers to make the league more geographically correct. The 1993 National League schedule has now become a major problem in the dispute. The league was under a July 1 deadline to submit the league schedule to the Players Association for its approval. The league asked the association to extend the deadline to July 31, which it did. Then, earlier this week, Bill White, the National League president, requested a further extension from the association. "It's going to be very difficult to wait much longer," Donald Fehr, the association's executive director, said. He added that unless the Seventh Circuit acted quickly, a further extension of the schedule deadline would be meaningless. A Deadline, but When Is It? Vincent said there was some point past which it would not be feasible to implement realignment for next season, but he said he couldn't say what that time was. "Obviously, we're disappointed," he said, commenting on the judge's decision. "We think it requires a review on appeal because we don't think she properly interpreted the Major League Agreement." When Vincent made his realignment decision, he said it was an "extraordinarily close call." But he said he ordered the changes because all of the clubs except the Cubs wanted it, and because it was especially important to get done with the addition of the two expansion teams next season. He cited a Atlanta-Miami divisional rivalry as a natural, and one that would occur only through realignment. The Cubs have said they oppose realignment because they don't want to give up their rivalries with Eastern Division teams, but just about everyone else in baseball says the Cubs don't want it because of their television schedule on the superstation WGN. The Cubs fear that playing more games on the West Coast with later starting times because of the two-hour time difference would result in smaller viewership and reduced revenues. The Tribune Company owns both the team and the station. Judge Barely Refers to TV In her decision, Judge Conlon barely mentioned television, but of division rivalries, she said, "The prospective loss of decades-old rivalries against Eastern Division teams constitutes sufficient evidence of irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law." Whether the Seventh Circuit court reviews a preliminary or a permanent injunction, its decision will be based on the interpretation of the Major League Agreement. When Charles O. Finley of the Oakland Athletics sued Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for vetoing his sale of three players in 1976, the judge hearing the case ruled for Kuhn, saying the Major League Agreement gave the commissioner "broad and unfettered" powers. The Seventh Circuit upheld the decision. Vincent said he was confident that the Seventh Circuit "will adhere to its previous understanding of the Major League Agreement in the Finley case." Judge Conlon said the circumstances of the Cubs' case distinguish it from Finley, saying that she found that Vincent had violated Article VII of the agreement. "Reading Article I in light of Article VII," she wrote in her 14-page opinion, "the commissioner lacked authority to unilaterally abrogate" the Cubs' rights under the National League constitution, which says a team cannot be moved without its consent. Article VII deals with disputes between clubs, saying the commissioner will decide those disputes unless their resolution is "expressly provided" elsewhere, such as in the Major League Rules or the league constitutions. Ruling in 1976 Fifteen years ago, Finley argued that he sold Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers and Joe Rudi in accordance with Major League Rule 9, which deals with the assignment of player contracts. He contended that Article VII thus superseded Article I. The Cubs have made the same contention. But the Seventh Circuit found that Kuhn's powers under Article I applied. In his opinion ordering realignment, Vincent specifically said he was not acting under Article VII but under his best-interests-of-baseball powers. But Judge Conlon ignored Vincent's position, saying that Article VII did apply. "Accordingly," she wrote, "there is a strong likelihood that the Chicago Cubs shall prevail on the merits." Provisions of the National League constitution, the judge added, "manifest a clear intention to protect the substantial interest of an indvidual club in its divisional assignment from adverse action by the majority."

662-> BARCELONA: TV SPORTS; Triplecast Still Hopes To Attract Subscribers
Triplecast. Triplecast. Triplecast. I'm so awash in Triplecast commercials I'm writing in Triplicate. I can't avoid the Olympics Triplecast's $40 million propaganda campaign to persuade Americans to pay pay pay $125 for 15 days of commercial-free Olympics action on three channels. The average cable subscriber will see eight or nine Triplecast commercials this week. I'm sure I've seen a hundred. "LIVE WITH NO INTERRUPTIONS. CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO WATCH WHEN YOU WANT TO WATCH IT." At least by Sunday, when it signs on at 5 A.M. for its first 12-hour live stint, all the pre-Triplecast prognosticating will be done. Will NBC and Cablevision lose $100 or $100 million? Will two million people buy it, or 200,000? How did NBC and Cablevision, the partners, get mixed up in a venture mocked regularly by David Letterman (who, it is believed, discovered that the regular female intruder to his Connecticut estate was the first subscriber)? The drumbeat of negativism has apparently not bothered Jim Dolan, the rough-hewn executive in charge of the daily operations of the Triplecast. "Bother me? Nah, not in the least," he said. "You can look for both sides of the story. If you want to look for negative, you look for negative. If you want to look for positive, you look for negative. Heh!" Dolan has been the point man in delineating the differences between the Triplecast and NBC's 161 hours of free coverage. Most notably, he has told anyone listening that the Triplecast is worth buying because it has no commercials. He said he was misquoted in saying that NBC's commercial load will be worse in Barcelona than it was for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. What he really said was this: "If there will be the same this time as there were last time, that will be a lot." Inevitably, Dolan's remarks came out as NBC-bashing. Some NBC and Cablevision executives privately wonder why he has not been reined in. Dolan doesn't view himself as a basher but as the spokesman for true Triplecast values, which just happen to differ from NBC's. "To understand the Triplecast, you have to look at what's out there for free," he said. "I'm not trying to criticize them. Even though they won't have a lot of commercials on NBC, it's still a lot compared with the Triplecast, where there are none." He added: "One out of every four minutes each hour on NBC will be a commercial or a promo. There's nine and a half minutes of NBC commercials, station time and promotions. That adds up to 15 minutes." Thus is the conundrum inherent in NBC staging a traditional Olympics on broadcast TV and being a partner in the pay-per-view Olympics. Commercials for both appear on NBC stations and on cable, clashing in the viewer's brain. To push the Triplecast, NBC's network effort must be positioned negatively as commercial-laden. To promote NBC, the Triplecast must be ignored. A corporation waging war with itself. One Triplecast spot hammers at NBC, asking a viewer if he likes "interviews with equestrian trainers" or "when action is interrupted with commercials." Phrased that way, NBC is framed. Next thing, NBC's promotions should ask: "Do you want 12 hours of continuous dressage or butterfly heats where you learn nothing about the athletes or get no commercial cues to get a brew from the fridge?" Triplecast success hinges on attracting at least 2.4 million buyers, some purchasing the $125 package for 15 days, others the $29.95 per day option. As of last week, Dolan reported there were as many as 60,000 buyers. Out of the universe of 40 million potential buyers, that's a 0.15 percent buy rate. Now, Dolan said, there are more than 60,000, but won't say how many more. A survey of large cable systems showed activity picking up, but not strangling operators. Time Warner's Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn systems have about 1,000 buyers out of 600,000 subscribers. Out of 10 million potential buyers for Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., about 15,000 have purchased. Only 329 have purchased at Dallas-based Sammons Communications out of 700,000. Dolan is betting that the buying pace will mirror the impulsive, last-minute buying characteristic of major heavyweight fights on pay-per-view. No one knows if he's right or wrong, or whether 60,000 bookings as of July 13 will equal the stated corporate goal of two million at Olympics' end. The Triplecast does not mirror megafights in one major way. Nobody needs the Triplecast to see the Olympics. The Triplecast doesn't have the Olympics exclusive, as pay-per-view does for a megafight. Plus, the live portion of the Triplecast, from 5 A.M. to 5 P.M. occurs when people are sleeping or working, and the 12 hours of replay coincide largely with NBC's prime-time coverage. "There's no guarantee it'll be the same buying curve," Dolan said. "When you lay it up against what's happened before, it looks good." Then he added: "But we're flying blind here, inasmuch as we can't say it'll turn out the way others have turned out."

663-> COMPANY NEWS; 4 Companies Cut PC Prices
Price wars in the consumer personal computer market intensified again yesterday when the Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the world's biggest computer makers, and the Compuadd Computer Corporation, a relative newcomer in the PC market, slashed prices to below $1,000 for low-end PC's. The moves were among the latest in a series of discounts involving the leading multinational PC manufacturers. Also yesterday, Zenith Data Systems, a unit of Groupe Bull, trimmed prices by a range of 4 percent to 21 percent and NCR, a unit of A.T.& T., cut prices as much as 30 percent Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., cut prices 35 percent to 42 percent on certain PC's sold in the United States. Digital managers overseas can match the discounts, depending upon appropriate competition. Compuadd, a privately held Austin, Tex., PC vendor, announced discounts of 3 percent to 16 percent throughout its product line. Compuadd also said it would ship a new V series of PC's next month, with prices starting at $899.

Woody Guthrie, the balladeer of the Depression era, would have turned 80 next week. So on Sunday, his son ARLO GUTHRIE and his compatriot PETE SEEGER will perform in Central Park, along with other musicians who have followed in his footsteps, including SUZANNE VEGA, NANCI GRIFFITH, BILLY BRAGG and the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. The Summerstage concert will take place at 2 P.M. at Rumsey Playfield off 72d Street, west of Fifth Avenue. "It is fabulous that there is a whole new generation of people discovering not just the fact of his being, but what he stood for," Arlo Guthrie said yesterday. What Woody Guthrie began with his 1,000 songs has been perpetuated by the development of "a global musical culture that respects liberty, freedom, justice," Mr. Guthrie said. "What we have seen in Tiananmen Square, in Eastern Europe, in Central and South America is equally, if not more, the result of ideas expressed through music than any political ideology." About his father, who died in 1967, he said: "Obviously, my dad was very important to me, and I am doing the same kinds of things he did. I am a folk singer, I write my own songs, travel around and work with a lot of his old buddies. "But I don't want to make him St. Woody. We didn't have an easy life with him as a father. He was gone a lot and was moody. But he did inspire a few generations of people who voice their own thoughts. It is important to understand that you don't have to talk in sound bites, and there are ways to communicate with each other that are real. My dad was wonderful at that."

665-> As for Rights, Bork Follows Madison
To the Editor: "Court Again Upholds Rights of the Individual" by Ellery Schempp and "When Dred Scott Was" by Ephraim Banks (letters, July 17) misrepresent what Robert H. Bork wrote in his July 8 Op-Ed article. Mr. Banks writes that Mr. Bork "cited the Dred Scott decision of Chief Justice Roger Taney as the first example of misuse of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868." Dred Scott, Mr. Banks states, was handed down in 1857, before the time of the 14th Amendment. Mr. Bork wrote that in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, five justices of the Supreme Court "assert that the right to abortion arises from the due process clause of the 14th Amendment." In the next paragraph, he noted that "Chief Justice Roger Taney began the misuse of due process in Dred Scott to invent a substantive right to own slaves." Taney did misuse the due process clause, but he was reading from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment when he wrote his opinion in Dred Scott. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment was incorporated into the text of the 14th. Mr. Schempp asserts that Mr. Bork's article represents "less legal scholarship and more a mischievous attempt to cloak his fervent hopes that an absolutist majority can be formed for his visceral prejudices." Mr. Schempp implies that Mr. Bork advocates unrestrained majoritarianism and that not since Robespierre has there been such a radical attack on the reserved rights of citizens and limitations of majority rule. Neither in this article nor in the 1990 book "The Tempting of America" does Mr. Bork advocate "absolutist" or "unrestrained" majoritarianism. Mr. Bork has consistently advocated following the principles James Madison laid out in the Constitution, that is, that the people have a right to govern themselves through a representative form of government and that certain rights will be placed beyond governmental authority. The Court, however, has struck down laws by the flawed notion of substantive due process, undermining the right of the majority to govern, as the Constitution provides. The practical effect of the Court's reasoning goes far beyond abortion. The Court has used its authority to impose higher rates of taxation, a function reserved in the Constitution for the legislative branch. It has also used its authority to deny the people the right to structure state governments on the Federal model. Substantive due process is a sort of John Doe warrant by which the Court can invalidate any statute, liberal or conservative. What seems to unsettle Mr. Schempp is that Mr. Bork does not find abortion explicitly enumerated among the other rights in the Bill of Rights (and it is not). Mr. Bork's argument was not that the Court should be guided by history per se in reaching decisions, but that it should be guided by a historical understanding of what a given law was thought to mean when it was enacted.

666-> BASEBALL; Players Feeling Uncertain
Major league players are peppering their union leaders with questions about lockouts and collusion in light of greater expectations that the Basic Agreement will be reopened a year early and in wake of the owners' ouster of Fay Vincent, a commissioner perceived as conciliatory to labor. That concern was evident as players kept the switchboard at the union headquarters in New York busy yesterday, one day after Vincent acceded to the wishes of 18 of the 28 owners and resigned. The concerns were also evident when Donald Fehr, the union leader, met with the Seattle Mariners and the Minnesota Twins and the players' questions focused on labor as opposed to the original meeting topic, the upcoming expansion draft. "There was a certain amount of resignation," Fehr, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said last night by telephone from Minneapolis. "The sentiment is 'They want another war again? Nice that they told us. Too bad. What can we do?' " The assumptions about reopening the Basic Agreement ebb and flow, Fehr said, and right now it is at a high as union officials predict the owners will act by the Dec. 11 deadline contained in the current agreement. "And we're telling the players that if the owners reopen, there's likely to be a lockout, and if there is, it will likely to be for a long time," Fehr said. "So, as we have been, we assume it and we prepare for it."

667-> Hewlett Warns On Earnings
The Hewlett-Packard Company said yesterday that earnings for its third fiscal quarter, which ended July 31, would fall below analysts' expectations. The company said earnings would range from 76 cents a share, which is what it earned in the period last year, to about 87 cents. Analysts' estimates average $1.12 a share. The company made its announcement after the close of the stock market. Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $24, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. "We're seeing uneven demand across our businesses," John A. Young, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Orders in some businesses, including printers and medical equipment, remain strong," Mr. Young said. "But weak capital spending is affecting orders in other areas, such as test and measurement equipment, analytical products and parts of our computer systems business." Final results will be announced Aug. 18.

670-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Mel Torme Michael's Pub 211 East 55th Street Midtown Manhattan Through Oct. 11 Mel Torme's secret weapon has always been rhythm. The singer, who opened his seventh consecutive fall season at Michael's Pub on Tuesday evening, was once nicknamed the Velvet Fog for the smoothness of his timbre. But Machine-Gun Mel would be just as apt, since it describes the rat-a-tat precision of scat singing that treats improvisations as vocalized drumbeats. That connection was underscored on Tuesday evening when the singer, who was accompanied by a splendid 15-member big band, took over the drums from his regular percussionist, Donny Osborne, for Duke Ellington's "Rockin' in Rhythm." Mr. Torme's relentlessly aggressive but steady drumming mirrored a style of vocal phrasing that seldom lingers and never flags. The set hit its peak in the next piece, Ellington's "It Don't Mean a Thing," in which Mr. Torme surrendered the drums and delivered a flurry of beautifully executed vocal jabs that ended in a knockout punch. The singer's emphasis on percussive power extended to his arrangements for the band, which included five saxophones, four trumpets, three trombones and a rhythm section. Instead of lush tonal choirs, the settings for a program that featured six Ellington standards concentrated on emphatic entrances and exits and feisty instrumental solos and duets. Mr. Torme's rhythmic mastery is the best possible career insurance against the inevitable fraying of a vocal instrument that until recently seemed almost untouched by age. Mr. Torme just turned 67. And at Tuesday evening's show, his vocal velvet seemed noticeably to have coarsened. The texture was more like brushed suede than velvet, with a few small patches of burlap sewn into the weave. For all its virtuosity, the show had its sour moments. Near the beginning, Mr. Torme offered some ignorant, mean-spirited remarks on rap, a style that is as beat-oriented as his own uptempo singing. He also sang a mocking interpretation of the Captain and Tennille's 1975 hit "Love Will Keep Us Together," which he offered as an example of the decline of modern songwriting.

A 20-year-old tourist from Rome, Italy, was shot in the leg last night as he walked near the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan, the police said. The tourist, Fabrizio Conti, was grazed in the left leg at 8:15 P.M. near the corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue, said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Tina Mohrmann. "He felt a sharp pain, saw that he was bleeding and went up to a cop," Sergeant Mohrmann said. Mr. Conti was treated at Roosevelt Hospital and released. Mr. Conti did not hear a gunshot, Sergeant Mohrmann said, and no bullet was recovered.

673-> BOXING; When Bell Rings, All Kidding Stops
A left turn and there was Hector Camacho, running past the incandescent marquees for which Las Vegas Boulevard is famous: bright lights decreeing sexy shows, cheap buffets and Liza headlining at the Desert Inn. Camacho was in a black training suit and cap. On a recent morning, a little more than a week away from his match Saturday against the World Boxing Council superlightweight champion, Julio Cesar Chavez, Camacho ran at an easy pace. The loop he traversed -- six miles by Camacho's count -- ended on Tropicana Avenue, 36 minutes 46 seconds into what figured to be a one-hour run. It ended when Camacho motioned for the white Oldsmobile that had been trailing him to halt. "That's it," he said. "Let's go to the health club." The plan was for Camacho to work 30 minutes on the treadmill and 30 minutes on the Stairmaster. At 7:29 A.M., he began running on the treadmill. At 7:32 A.M., he announced that the workout was over. Well-Deserved Shortcut Aaron Snowell, the fighter's co-trainer with Rudy Mata, raised his brow but said nothing. "I've only taken one day off since the last fight," Camacho said referring to his Aug. 1 knockout of Eddie Van Kirk. "Other than that, the training's been very successful." Camacho, 30 years old, has been fighting professionally since 1980 and should know what his body needs. Yet with Camacho, you never know. He is always a moment removed from temptation. Last Tuesday, for instance, Camacho was in Los Angeles for a news conference. Afterward, he checked out the Beverly Hills car dealership where his $150,000 white-and-red Lamborghini jeep was being outfitted with a state-of-the-art radio system. Then he had dinner in a nearby restaurant, where he gave in to impulse: he swilled half a dozen sodas. "I'd worked so hard in the gym," he said. "I couldn't resist." Camacho, who has always had problems making the weight, had been coming in at around 143 pounds at the end of each day's training, easily in striking distance of the 140-pound superlightweight limit. On the day of his soda frenzy, his weight shot up to 148 pounds. By Thursday, he was said to be back down to 143 1/2 pounds. Yet such vagaries are routine for this fighter. In recent years, every bout has come with an element of mystery as to which Camacho will materialize in the ring: some semblance of the lightning-strike, constant-motion Camacho of the early 1980's, or the jab-and-grab, safety-first Camacho of recent years who has turned into a marketable villain. You've Got to Be Kidding Those who speculate with their money don't take Camacho's chances against Chavez very seriously: Camacho, a former champion in three weight classes, is a 6-1 betting underdog. Some who have worked with him view Camacho's unfulfilled potential as a failure of character. In September 1986, after Camacho beat Cornelius Boza Edwards, and then Edwin Rosario knocked out Livingstone Bramble on the same card, Camacho's adviser, Marty Cohen, said he received a $3 million offer for Camacho to fight Rosario, in what would have been an intriguing rematch. In June 1986, Rosario hurt Camacho badly in the fifth round, but Camacho won in a disputed decision. "I told him the offer," Cohen said of Camacho, "and he told me, 'Pop, I can't make the weight any more.' I told him, 'Bull, you never forgot that punch in the fifth round.' " Mort Sharnik, a CBS-TV boxing executive in the early 1980's, agreed. "Edwin Rosario hurt him badly and wounded his confidence indelibly," he said. "Instead of becoming a serious fighter, he became a serious businessman and comedian who happened to fight." The Camacho to whom Sharnik refers has commanded more attention in recent years through peacock strut and braggadocio than through his shaky ring triumphs. But Cohen says that for all the attention the antics get, Camacho's childlike nature has crimped his development as a fighter. Zoom, Zoom, Zoom! "He still plays with toys, little automobiles that you put together, things like that," said Cohen. "And he's irresponsible. When we were up in camp in Florida, we had a cook working there. The guy did something that bothered Hector. So Hector took a gun and shot holes through the cook's busted-up car." The fighter has long shown a fondness for firearms and it has brought him trouble. In February 1988, he was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after he pointed a gun at a 17-year-old during an argument. While Camacho was being booked in the incident, he was found with a small amount of what police officers said was cocaine, although he was never charged with drug possession. The assault charges were later downgraded and fines were paid. Camacho admits he has hurt himself as a boxer by being too susceptible to a wild life outside of the ring. But in the Chavez bout he sees an opportunity to recoup his athletic reputation. "So now people are saying, 'Hector Camacho's shot,' " Camacho said. "That just pumps me up. I'm excited. This is not a job. It's an adventure." Over the years, the fistic adventures of Camacho, who was born in Bayamon, P.R., and raised in East Harlem, have taken some strange turns. The Camacho who won his first world title by upending the W.B.C. superfeatherweight champion, Bazooka Limon, in 1983 seemed certain to become a crossover hero. After the Limon fight, though, Camacho's career began to unravel. He split with his manager, Billy Giles, who accused him of "drowning in drugs." Wounded by the accusation, Camacho became inactive as a fighter in 1984 while his personal life became tattered. Storming Back Yet just when the fight world was ready to dismiss Camacho as yesterday's news, he gave a remarkable punch-and-move performance to win the W.B.C. lightweight title from Jose Luis Ramirez in August 1985. Now, Camacho is saying that a fighter like the unrelenting Chavez, undefeated in 81 bouts (with 70 knockouts) and regarded by many experts as the best pound-for-pound fighter today, gives him the focus he has been lacking in recent years. Even through his outrageous Macho Man phase -- the Camacho of the sequined outfits and prankish behavior -- he has managed to keep his market value up through a series of unremarkable ring performances that have left his record at 41-0 with 18 knockouts and one no contest. Camacho remains a figure of intrigue, enough so that he has been guaranteed $3 million for fighting Chavez, who is guaranteed the same. It is in keeping with that quirky nature of his that through the years in which Camacho was trying to drum up a big-money bout with Chavez, he was out there partying with him as well. The last time was in April after the 30-year-old Chavez beat Angel Hernandez in Mexico City. The Jet Crowd "We flew in a private jet to Culiacan, Chavez's hometown," Camacho said. "Spent time at his house. Went to the beach and had fun. It was something out of the ordinary. A lot of drinking beer, man. He'd hand you a beer and no food. 'Hey, where's something to eat?' Forget it. All they do is drink." And Camacho? He remains boxing's leading flake. And although at this date, it seems a stretch for him to believe that he can beat Chavez, Camacho has what unique characters possess: an unshakeable belief in their own magic. "I know this guy," Camacho said of Chavez. "He's a little puzzled. Doesn't know what to make of me. I tell you, brother, we are in a fight."

674-> BASEBALL; McDowell Becomes First to Win 20th
White Sox 4, Tigers 3 White Sox 4, Tigers 3 Jack McDowell became baseball's first 20-game winner this season by pitching the Chicago White Sox over the Detroit Tigers by 4-3 today in the first game of a doubleheader. Tim Raines led off the eighth with a tie-breaking homer, his third of the season, to give the White Sox a 4-3 victory in the nightcap. McDowell (20-7) won his fifth straight decision. He became the first to win 20 for the White Sox since 1983, when LaMarr Hoyt won 24 and Rich Dotson won 20. McDowell fell behind 2-0 before retiring a batter. Tony Phillips opened the game with a double and scored on Lou Whitaker's 17th home run. After that, McDowell held Detroit to only more run in seven-plus innings. Twins 8, Mariners 4 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Shane Mack singled home the go-ahead run in the eighth and Minnesota took advantage of Seattle relievers' wildness to score four runs in the inning. Seattle pitchers walked four batters and threw two wild pitches in the eighth as the Mariners lost their sixth straight game despite Ken Griffey Jr.'s fourth career grand slam. Griffey is batting .469 with three home runs and 11 r.b.i. during an eight-game hitting streak. Blue Jays 5, Royals 0 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jimmy Key broke a three-game losing streak with a four-hitter and hot-hitting Joe Carter knocked in three runs, giving him 104 r.b.i. for the season as Toronto beat Kansas City. Roberto Alomar singled for Toronto, giving him a 14-game hitting streak. Rangers 6, Red Sox 1 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) -- Jose Canseco hit his first home run for Texas and Kevin Brown won his 19th game as the Rangers beat Boston. Canseco, playing his fifth game since being traded from Oakland to Texas, hit a two-run shot in the seventh inning. It was his 23d homer of the season. Pirates 5, Cubs 2 PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his eighth homer in 45 at-bats and Pittsburgh kept the pressure on Montreal in the National League East, beating Chicago. The Pirates maintained their four-game lead over the Expos. Doug Drabek (12-10) improved to 14-7 lifetime against the Cubs by pitching a three-hitter for his eighth complete game of the season. Drabek has pitched at least 8 innings in 12 of his last 14 starts. The homer was Bonds's fifth in 19 at-bats over eight games. So far this month, he has reached base 25 times in 36 plate appearances, going 10 for 21 with 15 walks. The Cubs also learned today that shortstop Rey Sanchez might be lost for the season. Sanchez will undergo four days of tests for a bulging disk in his lower back. Astros 2, Reds 0 HOUSTON (AP) -- Andujar Cedeno broke up Chris Hammond's no-hitter leading off the sixth inning and in his next at-bat snapped a scoreless tie with a double as Houston beat Cincinnati. The loss dropped the Reds seven and a half games behind Atlanta in the N.L. West. The three umpires in the field, Ed Rapuano, Joe West and the crew chief, Terry Tata, wore white-lettered "Fay" on the back of their caps in tribute to Fay Vincent, who resigned as commissioner under pressure on Monday. The plate umpire, Steve Rippley, joined in the support but did not wear the hastily printed name because his mask obscured his cap. "He was a great friend to the umpires," Tata said. "We just wanted to show our respect." The umpires at the St. Louis-at-Montreal game wore similar hats. Braves 7, Dodgers 5 ATLANTA (AP) -- Terry Pendleton hit a two-run homer to break a tie and Atlanta went on to the victory over Los Angeles. Pendleton's homer, his 20th of the season and 91st r.b.i., followed a walk to Jeff Blauser in the fourth inning off reliever Tim Crews (0-2). It broke a 4-4 tie and helped send the Dodgers to their 10th loss in 12 games. Expos 6, Cardinals 1 MONTREAL (AP) -- Larry Walker hit a three-run homer as Montreal ended a three-game losing streak by beating St. Louis. Only 13,704 attended the game. It was the first Montreal crowd under 20,000 since July 20, when 17,315 watched.

675-> Losing Its Luster, 'Star Wars' Is Object of Lawmakers' Budget Ax
One year after Congress approved record spending on missile defenses to protect the nation against nuclear attack, lawmakers are revising spending plans for much of the "Star Wars" anti-missile system. While Congress is likely to cut the current $4.15 billion level of financing by only about $150 million for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, lawmakers are redistributing that money and fundamentally changing the direction and pace of the overall program. In military budget and appropriations bills under consideration in the House and Senate, lawmakers have sharply cut research for globe-orbiting rockets that would destroy enemy missiles and have delayed until 2002 the earliest date the Pentagon would deploy land-based missile interceptors. Last year Congress set the deployment goal at 1996. Reasons for Pulling Back The change stems from reduced urgency to field unproven land-based defenses against an accidental nuclear strike, from mounting post-cold-war pressures to shift military spending to domestic programs, and from the unraveling of a fragile Congressional consensus on last year's plan. "There is some pulling back because of the fiscal crunch, strengthening Russian-U.S. relations and the fact that the path we were on had a very risky acquisition schedule," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Unlike other weapons systems with built-in political support where their factories are situated, like the McDonnell-Douglas F-15 fighter in St. Louis and the General Dynamics F-16 jet in Fort Worth, the anti-missile program has no political center of gravity, because its spending is spread in relatively small amounts around the country. A Senate appropriations subcommittee voted today to cut the Bush Administration's Star Wars request to $3.8 billion for the coming fiscal year, from $5.4 billion. Last month, a majority of the Senate supported a motion to cut the amount to $3.3 billion, a plan that could be revived Thursday when the Senate considers a $274.5 billion military budget for 1993. The House has already approved $4.3 billion for the anti-missile program for next year, setting the stage for a compromise with the Senate later this fall. The Pentagon is likely to face deeper budget cuts next year with the lapsing of a 1990 budget agreement between Congress and the White House that barred raids on military spending for domestic programs. Lawmakers say the Star Wars program, and its $8-billion-a-year projected cost after 1993, will stand out as a bull's-eye for budget-cutters. Indeed, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, has said that if he is elected he will cut $15 billion to $20 billion in Star Wars financing. Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, led the fight last year against committing Congress to an early deployment of the land-based interceptors, fearing that it would lead to abrogration of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Only money for short-ballistic missile defenses, the "theater defenses" like improved versions of the Patriot missile, which played a starring role in the Persian Gulf war, is sacrosanct; no one opposes the $1 billion the Administration has proposed for the 1993 fiscal year. On the other hand, financing for the "Brilliant Pebbles" program of missile-killing rockets orbiting Earth is withering rapidly. "We're on a path for theater defenses and research activity on everything else," Henry F. Cooper, the director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the agency that operates the anti-missile program, said in an interview. "We'll end up with a program that will protect our allies but not America." The program received more criticism this week when Congressional auditors found that its managers had repeatedly exaggerated the program's achievements. Mr. Cooper called the arguments made by the General Accounting Office "old news, if they were ever news at all." A year ago, the anti-missile program was riding a crest of support after the gulf war and the breakup of the Soviet Union. In the Missile Defense Act, Congress ordered the Pentagon to develop a single land-based interceptor site by 1996, or whenever the appropriate technology was developed. But elements of the program, particularly Brilliant Pebbles and land-based interceptors, began losing momentum earlier this year. First, American intelligence officials estimated that potential enemies were a decade away from developing long-range missiles that could reach the United States. Then in June, the Pentagon's top program analyst, David S. C. Chu, said the plan to field unproven prototype interceptors by 1996 or 1997 would breach Pentagon acquisition guidelines that require a series of performance tests. Under orders from top Pentagon officials, the Star Wars office restructured the plan, outlining options that used prototypes but also illustrating how a normal acquisition schedule could produce proven land-based interceptors by 2002. That is now the course that Congress prefers. "We were able to win on the Missile Defense Act because there was a perceived need for missile defenses," said a senior Senate Republican aide. "Democrats who always opposed S.D.I. rode out that storm because they couldn't fight it. Now, the storm's faded and we're back to where we were before." Lawmakers now say the anti-missile program has been stripped down to the short-range missile defenses and a core of support for limited ground-based defenses that comply with the A.B.M. treaty. "We're still taking cognizance of the threat," said Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "But obviously the approach to S.D.I. has been impacted by developments in the world."

676-> U.N. Reports an Attempt to Bomb Guards' Car in Iraq
Officials with the United Nations said today that three of the organization's guards in northern Iraq had discovered a bomb attached to the bottom of their car, but were able to defuse it before it could explode. The officials said that the incident took place on Thursday and that a strong protest had been lodged with Baghdad. The Iraqi Government has denied any involvement with attacks on international forces operating in northern Iraq. It was unclear why the United Nations waited three days to announce the incident, but the officials described it as the most recent example of growing tension between Iraqis and United Nations personnel, who have been serving in the country since Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf War last year by a United States-led multinational force. Car Is Vandalized A group of Iraqis wielding steel bars smashed the windshield of a United Nations car near Baghdad last week, and a Swedish soldier on United Nations guard duty was wounded two weeks ago when an unidentified gunman opened fire on his vehicle in northern Iraq. The United Nations is bracing for another possible confrontation with Baghdad on Monday, when a new team of weapons inspectors arrives, making the first such trip into the country since United States and allied war planes began patrolling the skies over southern Iraq last week. The United States-led coalition says the air shield is intended to protect Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi air assaults The allied threat last week to shoot down any Iraqi aircraft that ventures below the 32d parallel drew a response today from President Saddam Hussein, who accused the United States and its European partners of seeking to dismember Iraq and the Arab world and seize control of its oil. But in a broadcast speech read on his behalf by an unidentified narrator, he did not threaten to challenge the allied no-flights zone, nor did he promise that Iraq would defeat the coalition militarily. Instead, he said the allied campaign would bring them "nothing but the indignation, anger and rejection" of the Iraqi people. It was not explained why Mr. Hussein did not deliver the speech himself, as had been anticipated. Iraqi Reaction Muted Iraq has made no move to challenge allied warplanes in southern Iraq since they took control of the skies over the south of the country on Thursday. The United Nations said the incident involving the booby-trapped car took place when three United Nations guards were stopped at an Iraqi Government checkpoint near Kirkuk, in the north of the country. They were driving toward areas farther north that are under the control of Kurdish rebels. They said they saw a man tampering with their car and later discovered and defused a 2.2-pound bomb affixed to the undercarriage by a magnet. The bomb had been set to go off in two hours, when the guards would have well beyond Iraqi Government lines. "Obviously this was extremely serious and we are taking it very seriously," said Gualtiero Fulcheri, the United Nations coordinator for Iraq. -------------------- U.S. Sees No Threat ABOARD U.S.S. LA SALLE, in the Persian Gulf, Aug. 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- Although some Iraqi warplanes are flying just north of the exclusion zone imposed by the United States and its allies, this is nothing to be concerned about, the top American general in the region said today. Lieut. Gen. Michael A. Nelson, commander of the American military task force in the region, said there continued to be no flights south of the 32d parallel, "and nothing extraordinary can be seen north of the line." Air Force and Navy pilots have told journalists that during their patrols over southern Iraq they occasionally see "blips" on their radar screens showing Iraqi planes operating just above the 32d parallel. But they said that the planes were 30 miles or more north of the line, and that they were not testing the allies' reactions in any way, like darting briefly toward the exclusion zone or using radars to aim their weapons.

677-> HORSE RACING; For Picked 6, Payoff Is Racing Hall of Fame
Just across Union Avenue from the race track that has created legends and champions for 125 years, the Racing Hall of Fame opened its doors today to three great horses from the past and three celebrated riders and trainers from the present. To Scotty Schulhofer, the man who saddled Fly So Free and other superstar horses, it was "the ultimate winner's circle." To Jerry Fishback, the steeplechase champion, it was "the ultimate goal." To Sandy Hawley, the Canadian jockey who has ridden nearly 6,000 winners, it was the place where "my dream came true." Krone Is There, Too They were inducted into the hall along with Lady's Secret, Johnstown and Slew o'Gold, three of the historic winners of the last half-century. And they were flanked by a phalanx of horsemen already enshrined in the Hall of Fame, notably Woody Stephens, Ted Atkinson, MacKenzie Miller, Leroy Jolley, Elliot Burch, Pat Day and Angel Cordero Jr. The ceremonies were staged in a huge tent alongside the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame on a sparkling day before an overflow audience. Even Julie Krone, the reigning queen of New York jockeys, made the pilgrimage from the stable area to the museum to meet the elite, and she later reported: "It's the first time I've ever been inside the Hall of Fame, and it's captivating." The Honor Roll The only serious message of the day was delivered by the keynote speaker, Ralph Wilson, a longtime owner and breeder of horses who also owns the Buffalo Bills football team. He bluntly told the horse people that "racing is overexposed," and suggested they cut back the number of racing dates. These were the winners at today's ceremonies: *Flint S. (Scotty) Schulhofer, for 16 years a star steeplechase rider, and a man who has trained four racing champions: Smile, Mac Diarmida, Ta Wee and Fly So Free. He also saddled Cryptoclearance, who won more than $3.3 million. And he now trains the star 2-year-old colt Tactical Advantage, who won the Saratoga Special last Sunday, and he will saddle Fly So Free this Saturday in the $500,000 Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park. *Sandy Hawley, for 24 years one of the ranking jockeys on the continent. On four occasions, he has been the leading rider in North America; on nine occasions he has been No. 1 in Canada. Only Chris McCarron and Pat Day have a higher average number of winners for their careers. *Jerry Fishback, five times the champion steeplechase rider in the country. He is also the third highest in steeplechase victories with 301 winners during his career of 20 years. *Lady's Secret, the daughter of Secretariat who became Horse of the Year in 1986 and who won 25 races and $3 million. She was owned by Eugene Klein and trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who flew from California to accept the plaque. *Johnstown, who won the Kentucky Derby by eight lengths and the Belmont Stakes by five lengths in 1939. He was owned by William Woodward Sr., and trained by Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons. *Slew o' Gold, the son of Seattle Slew, who won $3.5 million running in the money 18 times in 21 races. He was a champion in 1983 and 1984.

678-> IRAQ TO BAR U.N. FROM MINISTRIES
Two days before an international inspection team is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad for another round of weapons searches, Iraq announced today that it would bar the inspectors from all its ministries. The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, reported that Culture Minister Hamed Youssef Hammadi said such searches were political and intended to humiliate Iraq. President Bush, speaking to reporters in Colorado, responded sharply to the news, saying the United States would help guarantee that United Nations inspectors could enter any building they believed might contain information or material related to Iraq's weapons programs. The team is to look for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles systems. 'Every Right to Inspect' "I can't tell you what the inspection targets will be, but if they proved to be in the ministries, the United Nations has every right to inspect, and we will help guarantee that right," Mr. Bush said, adding that President Saddam Hussein "will comply with United Nations resolutions." In New York, a spokeswoman for Rolf Ekeus, who heads the special commission charged with inspecting Iraqi sites, said Mr. Ekeus, who is now in Bahrain with a 22-member inspection team, had not been officially told of the Iraqi announcement, but had heard about it in news reports. The team is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad on Saturday, the United Nations said. The spokeswoman for the special commission, Agnes Marciallou, said: "We have no official reaction. Iraq has not relayed anything official to us." The new challenge from Mr. Hussein comes after a three-week standoff in July, when Iraq prohibited a team from entering the Agriculture Ministry. When the confrontation ended, after threats of force from the United States, American inspectors on the team were barred from the building. Bush Is 'Fed Up With Him' Asked today whether he was not getting tired of Iraqi resistance to inspections, Mr. Bush said, "I've been fed up with him for a long time." The regional chief of the commission, Doug Englund, expressed concern about continuing threats to the safety of United Nations personnel in Iraq. The latest was a gunshot by an unidentified assailant aimed at a United Nations guard outside a Baghdad hotel. "We continue to have concern about security," he said as the inspection team assembled in Bahrain. Guaranteed safety for inspection teams and free access to any building to search for banned weapons are the two demands that the commission made during the confrontation over the Agriculture Ministry.

680-> Allen Friedman, 71, Ex-Teamster Who Wrote of Links to Mob, Dies
Allen Friedman, a former union official who was the co-author of a book on mob influence after being prosecuted in 1983 in a case involving the teamsters president Jackie Presser, died on Tuesday in Cleveland. He was 71 years old. He died of heart failure at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital, his family said. From childhood, Mr. Friedman's life was entwined with Mr. Presser's. Mr. Friedman's sister was Mr. Presser's mother. Mr. Friedman, who was only several years older than Mr. Presser, was reared by his sister and Mr. Presser's father after his own parents died. Both men rose in Cleveland's teamsters' unions, and Mr. Presser eventually became the head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. They were also linked in their mutual downfall. In 1983, Mr. Friedman was convicted of embezzling $165,000 from Local 507 by collecting pay as a no-show employee. The Government charged that Mr. Presser had arranged for Mr. Friedman to receive $1,000 a week for merging Local 752, which Mr. Friedman headed, with Mr. Presser's Local 507. Mr. Friedman denied wrongdoing. He said he was unable to work full-time after a heart attack. His conviction was vacated by a Federal judge in 1985, after defense lawyers sought a new trial. They argued that the Justice Department had concealed Mr. Presser's role as an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that it had authorized his actions. The Government dropped the case. Mr. Friedman, who had served 11 months in prison, was freed. Mr. Friedman and Ted Schwarz wrote "Power and Greed" (Franklin Watts, 1989) on the mob and the teamsters. The book, whose first page asserted, "I never met an honest man," described Mr. Friedman as starting as an enforcer for a Cleveland local. In the book, he admitted his involvement in beatings, arson, theft and other crimes. A New York Times review called the book "a veritable smorgasbord of juicy, if unsubstantiated, tidbits." Mr. Friedman was divorced. Surviving are four daughters, Tami Kowit of Cleveland, Toni Friedman of Denver, Michalene Martin of Denver and Jacqueline Friedman of Columbus, Ohio.

681-> ON HORSE RACING; Bettors Can Now 'Screen' More of Their Picks
If you go to the Meadowlands this afternoon for a day at the races, you won't see any live horses on the track until 7:30 in the evening. But you can spend the afternoon sitting in front of television monitors and betting your money on 21 races beamed in from Pimlico in Maryland and Freehold in New Jersey. Then, if you have any investment cash left, you still have the 10 regularly scheduled races on the Meadowlands track in the evening, this time featuring live horses, plus 12 more races on teleivision from Garden State Park to keep you from getting bored. If you come back tomorrow, they will start the television show at 9:30 in the morning with races from England and Scotland. Later, the action will be relayed from Freehold, Pimlico, Garden State Park and even Philadelphia Park. Plus the 10 live races at night. So, in two days' time, you can bet on more than 100 races without leaving the building. They call it simulcasting, and too many racing people are welcoming it as the wave of the future, the ever-expanding betting opportunity that will rescue the business of horse racing with their technology and your money. It lurched into a new dimension last Saturday in another betting extravaganza staged at 40 race tracks, offtrack parlors and simulcasting "outlets," which were linked in something titled the National Pic 6. They run six races at six tracks in an hour's time, if you can believe that, and you try to pick all six winners. They tell us that 10 people did pick six winners in the inaugural orgy of betting, and they each got $40,207. It is not easy to do, because the six tracks differ greatly in the quality of weather, trainers, jockeys, horses and geography, from Calder in Florida to Louisiana Downs to Arlington near Chicago. They will do it again one week from Saturday. Yes, one of the places wired for the marathon is the Meadowlands. This may be the wave of the future in horse racing, but it still is one of the worst ideas to be floated in a long time. You can already spend your money on the lottery, casino gambling, riverboat gambling or video poker machines without seeing a horse run. But when you go to spend your money on horse racing, at least some of the time you should see a horse run. As it happens, one of those times will arrive this week when Belmont Park stages the first of two Super Saturdays, clusters of Grade I stakes races that serve as previews of the Breeders' Cup championships on Oct. 31. You can't assemble this kind of horse talent every day or even every week. But it reminds us that in horse racing, there is no substitute for horses racing. And nothing provides a story line as dramatically as the Breeders' Cup with its seven races with purses totaling $10 million and with the international stars of the sport gathering for the year's championships. The five-week summer season at Saratoga enriched the story line by placing high talent on the track every day and pointing it in the direction of the Breeders' Cup. So did the recent series of $1 million races at widely separated tracks on consecutive weekends: the Travers at Saratoga, the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in California, the Arlington Million in Illinois and the Molson Million last Sunday in Toronto. New York will join the gold rush with Super Saturday I, with four Grade I stakes and a cast of dozens of star horses. The marquee reads like this: the $500,000 Woodward Stakes with Thunder Rumble, Pleasant Tap, Sultry Song and Strike the Gold; the $400,000 Man o' War, starring Dear Doctor, the upset winner of the Arlington Million; the $100,000 Futurity for 2-year-old colts, led by Great Navigator, upset winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga, and the $100,000 Matron for 2-year-old fillies, led by Family Enterprise, winner of the Spinaway at Saratoga. Not bad. For an encore, Belmont will stage the $200,000 Ruffian on Sunday, starring November Snow and Versailles Treaty. Three weeks later, Super Saturday II will be centered on the $850,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup, flanked by the $250,000 Breeders' Cup steeplechase, the $200,000 Kelso Handicap, the $250,000 Beldame, the $250,000 Frizette and the $500,000 Champagne. And then it's off to the Breeders' Cup. At Belmont, they are calling this "a new era" in racing, the clustering of landmark races. At the Meadowlands, they're calling the explosion of simulcasting "a new era" in racing. At the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, they are calling the National Pic 6 "a new era." They may all be right. In fact, the main goal of all the shows and simulcasts is to induce you to bet your money. The only question is: Who will induce the people who breed race horses to keep breeding them so that everybody's "new era" will be filled with talented race horses?

682-> Police Battle Shining Path Rebels in Lima Prison
Fierce clashes broke out today when Peruvian police officers tried to remove some Shining Path guerrillas from a cell block at a maximum-security prison on Lima's outskirts. At least one person was killed and 13 wounded. Imprisoned terrorists threw dynamite and acid and opened fire on the officers when they tried to enter the fortified cellblock, which houses at least 150 women belonging to the Shining Path at the Castro Castro prison in the shantytown of Canto Grande, the authorities said. The police blew a hole in the ceiling of the four-story building to enter the cellblock, where the women had been on a two-day hunger strike to oppose a transfer of some inmates to the Santa Monica women's prison in the Chorillos section of Lima. Local radio reports said that more than 1,000 police officers and hundreds of army personnel were called to the prison. The Government said tonight that one policeman died and 13 people were injured, 4 seriously, in the fighting. Reuters reported that one Shining Path rebel had died and 11 other members of the movement were injured. Firefighters said that some men imprisoned as Shining Path terrorists also clashed with the police. Members of the rebel group are housed separately from other inmates at the prison. It was the first time since President Alberto K. Fujimori seized near-dictatorial powers on April 5 that a Government confrontation with opponents has developed into full-scale violence. Outside the prison, automatic weapons fire and explosions could be heard as more than 100 relatives of the inmates gathered in a tense and confrontation with the police. Police officers fired tear gas and water cannon at the crowd as family members shouted "Fujimori, assassin!" and slogans like "Glory to the fallen heroes!" Hours earlier, Mr. Fujimori had used his broad powers to decree tough prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist acts, including mandatory life terms for leaders of the Shining Path and other guerrilla groups. Other members of such groups will draw 20-year prison terms, and a six-year sentence will be mandatory for anyone found to be publishing or distributing pro-terrorist literature. The Government has been using the state of emergency declared last month to step up its fight against the Shining Path, whose 12-year guerrilla war has claimed 25,000 lives. Many of the imprisoned Shining Path women were said to fear that they would be harshly interrogated and even tortured if transferred to the other prison. They also do not want to be separated from more than 400 male Shining Path prisoners in a separate cellblock in the Castro Castro Prison. The inmates and their families had been bracing for action by the police for weeks. On April 7, two days after Mr. Fujiomri's seizure of power, police officers and members of the military surrounded the prison and took over administrative sections and cellblocks that did not contain inmates imprisoned for political or terrorist offenses. Memories of the massacre of more than 100 jailed terrorists by the police and the military at Lurigancho prison in 1986 have added to the tensions. Shining Path members at the Castro Castro prison have totally controlled their cellblock, eating their own food, at times generating their own electricity, determining who was permitted to enter, and holding rallies, marches and lectures. They had also smuggled in weapons, explosives and acid. The police action came a day after Mr. Fujimori rejected requests by a delegation from the Organization of American States to speed up his timetable for the return of democracy. -------------------- U.S. to Label Planes WASHINGTON, May 6 -- Reacting to a Peruvian attack on a United States narcotics surveillance plane last month in which one airman was killed and four others wounded, the Pentagon has ordered new identification markings painted on planes in Latin America and told pilots to obey warnings from combat aircraft there.

684-> David L. Maloof, 67, Maritime Lawyer, Dies
David L. Maloof, a maritime lawyer, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Maloof died of complications following heart surgery, said his son, David. In the early 1960's, Mr. Maloof was a founder of the Manhattan law firm of Donovan, Maloof, Walsh & Repetto, which is now Donovan, Parry, Walsh & Repetto. In 1990 he became associated with the law firm of Badiak, Will & Maloof. He was a leading authority on the loading and storage of cargo on ships, and his work in numerous court cases led to safety improvements in trans-Atlantic cargo transportation. Mr. Maloof was a native of Warren, R.I. He served as a radioman in the Army's 13th Armored Division in France and Germany during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree at Manhattan College in 1949 and a law degree from New York University, where he was a member of the Board of Editors of the Law Review, in 1951. He was a frequent lecturer in the United States and abroad on maritime law and taught maritime law as an adjunct professor at the College of Insurance from 1976 to 1985. Mr. Maloof is survived by a son, David T., of Manhattan; two daughters, Jane M. Grosso, of Greenlawn, N.Y., and Susan R. Curtis, of San Raphael, Calif., and three grandchildren.

685-> Making School Choice Real Choice
For five years, the schools of the Lower East Side have been hemorrhaging students, mostly to a neighboring Manhattan school district that has been setting up small experimental schools with seductive programs. Now the gritty Lower East Side is fighting back, setting up its own programs like a just-opened Earth School that emphasizes the environment. William E. Ubinas, the superintendent of Community School District 1, claims his Lower East Side district is even luring back students who fled to his rival, District 2, which covers midtown and the Upper East Side. That is the way choice is supposed to work, with school districts vying to outdo each other in attracting students so that the quality of all schools rises accordingly. Indeed, the competition between these two districts -- which has flourished on its own despite the existing bureaucratic roadblocks to transferring students -- offers a glimpse of the forces that may be unleashed by a plan for choice disclosed on Tuesday by Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. Imitating 13 states that have undertaken school choice, Mr. Fernandez will allow parents starting next year to send their children to any one of the city's 32 school districts, not just the school nearest their homes. Such transfers have been possible in the past, but they required cumbersome approvals. Recruitment Efforts and Catchy Programs Under the Fernandez plan, students who live in a school's geographic zone will still have priority followed by students who live within the district. But then a school will be open to students from every one of the 32 districts. Just as a few districts like 1 and 2 are already doing, other districts are expected to join the competition for students, setting up novel schools with catchy programs and energetic recruitment efforts. The creation of such new programs is one of the major arguments in favor of choice. But many school officials say there are obstacles that will minimize how effective and widespread choice is, at least in the short run. Crowding in the best schools is one. District 25 in Queens, which embraces Flushing, Whitestone, College Point and a piece of Bayside, perennially ranks among the best districts of the city in reading and mathematics test scores. But students would be wasting their time if they lined up outside the district office for places. There is hardly any room left. Home Ties Preferred Other reasons some school officials doubt there will be mass migrations of students across district boundaries are a lack of money for transportation and the predilection of parents for sending children to schools close to their homes. "A child has to have friends in the neighborhood, and you make friends in school," said Max Messer, superintendent of District 8 in the east Bronx. "You're telling a kid to spend 6 hours and 20 minutes in a school 10 miles away from his house and then go back home, and he has no friendly relationships with kids from the local school." John C. Fager, a co-chairman of the Parents Coalition, an educational advocacy group, sends his child to a gifted program in an outside district, but he worries about children who may get stuck in failing schools because their parents are not as persistent as he is. Painful to Superintendent "For those children whose parents are struggling with daily survival," he said, "searching out options out of their immediate neighborhoods often seems like a luxury." Yet Mr. Ubinas of District 1 can testify from painful experience that a substantial number of parents do make choices to send their children far from home. In 1987, the district had 10,006 students. Last year it had 8,966, a loss of about 250 a year. "If you talk about choice for poor people and you have 10 bad schools, you have 10 bad choices," he said. "My parents exercised choice. They went to District 2." District 2's registers during the same period kept growing, to 18,484 from 16,821, because its new superintendent, Anthony J. Alvarado, created enticing mini-schools within existing schools that offered specialized programs in art and science or uncommon approaches to instruction. Learning Can be Messy Mr. Ubinas, a Boston educator with a reputation for inventiveness, arrived in September 1990, and has begun several of what he calls "alternative" programs of his own. For him, stemming the flight of students was a matter of survival. "Moneywise you lose teachers, you lose support services, you lose everything," he said. "You become a dying district." The Neighborhood School at Public School 63 is modeled on educator Deborah Meier's Central Park East School, which has won a national reputation. In reading, the Neighborhood School spurns workbooks in favor of reading and writing, even if spelling is not correct. It focuses on doing, rather than sitting in front of a blackboard. Students in Laurie Engle's kindergarten class appeared to be out of control yesterday. There was the hum of constant chatter as four girls played with their hands in sudsy, green water. "Believe it or not, they're learning," said Ms. Engle, who is accustomed to answering visitors' questions about the classroom's atmosphere. "The girls are learning about free exploration. They fill the various geometric shapes with water and determine which holds the most water. It's great. They are learning and they don't even know it yet. The water's green because they wanted to make lime ice cream." Mr. Ubinas says that while his overall population continues to decline, his kindergarten register grew from 759 to 819 in two years, a small sign of renewal. His overwhelmingly Hispanic and black schools have begun to attract white children, with the percentage rising to 5 from 3 percent a few years ago, he said. "Because I don't have overcrowding," Mr. Ubinas said, "I have an excellent opportunity to implement choice."

686-> Dream Team's Special Charge
To the Sports Editor: Poor Stephen King. He has been stuck inside too long, grinding out consecutive bestsellers. He's beginning to think everything in life fits into a horror venue. I'm not a real basketball fan, but it was obvious that the Dream Team put a special charge into the Olympics. Their presence seemed to galvanize the fans, the people of Barcelona, the whole world. Wherever they went, faces glowed. Yes, these remarkable athletes are influenced by the "almighty buck." Basketball, after all, is a business like any other field. Doesn't Stephen King take advantage of every angle his bestsellers offer, paperback and foreign rights, movies, television? As far as I'm concerned, the Barcelona torch didn't really light up the Olympics. The Dream Team did. SHIRLEY TULIN Simsbury, Conn.

687-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Concrete Blonde The Academy Johnette Napolitano looks like a vampire. At the Academy on Monday night, fronting her band Concrete Blonde, Ms. Napolitano wore her bass over a white lace dress, black stockings and black ankle boots. Her long black hair hung so thick over her face that at times her head might as well have been facing backward; when the hair parted, all that was visible was the whites of her eyes. Many of Ms. Napolitano's songs are about hauntings. In "Walking in London," the title track from Concrete Blonde's most recent album (I.R.S.), the singer goes around the world but can't escape the memory of a lover: "I'm walking in London and you are watching me walk/Talking Italian and you are hearing me talk." On record, Ms. Napolitano is occasionally capable of finesse: careful guitar arpeggios, gentle pop hooks, the quiet paces of a ballad. But at the Academy, the music was thick, claustrophobic rock, airless and furious. "Walking in London" and "Bloodletting," the title track of Concrete Blonde's previous album, had wrecked blues rhythms and the distorted scrape of heavy-metal guitar, over which Ms. Napolitano belted in a voice that seemed as ancient as the Mississippi Delta. Whether she was singing about ghosts, crushed love or empty streets, she allowed no gap between herself and her songs; she performed each word and beat from the inside out. The result was that her spooky imagery and esoterica began to represent the fear, panic and anger that exist on the dark side of love. She is one of the few women singing today who is willing to express such emotions in a form that is as difficult and grotesque as the feelings themselves. Opening the show was the rap group Arrested Development, which tried awfully hard to focus on the positive side of social relations and issues. Performing in front of a banner that said "Life Music," the group exuded optimism: two women in bright-colored garb sang and did interpretive dance moves while a deejay scratched on turntables and the drummer layered spunky beats over recorded tapes. Beyond its hyper-optimistic messages, what's interesting about Arrested Development is the way the band constructs music: the rhythms delved into funk and reggae, and the women often sang phrases with the meticulous repetition of samples.

689-> TV Weekend; 3 of the Golden Girls in a New Home
Spiraling health-care costs, age discrimination: the elderly may not have much to laugh about these days but, at least as far as television entertainment is concerned, oldsters remain a hoot. Absent Bea Arthur, NBC's "Golden Girls" has been resurrected on CBS as "The Golden Palace" (Fridays at 8 P.M.), and the old girls are, well, as irrepressible as ever. And then "Frannie's Turn," also on CBS (Saturdays at 8 P.M.), offers a wacky domestic menagerie that includes a dotty mother-in-law who watches a television shopping network to order items like a "Star Trek" ankle bracelet. Oh, you kids! In "The Golden Palace," Rose Nylund (Betty White), Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan) and Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty) have bought an Art Deco hotel in Miami Beach as an investment for what they envision as their quiet retirement years. But the Golden Palace turns out to be teetering on bankruptcy, and the women are forced to return to hard, full-time work. Their skeletal staff includes Chuy (Cheech Marin, formerly of Cheech and Chong), a Mexican chef with in-law problems; Roland (Don Cheadle), a black would-be entrepreneur serving as house manager, and Oliver (Billy L. Sullivan), an abandoned 12-year-old with street smarts. Broad-based demographics in place, "The Golden Palace" is eager to let the golden girls be their familiar selves. Rose is naive, but not as dumb as people may think. Blanche goes weak at the knees at the mere thought of a man, but is not as promiscuous as she acts. And Sophia, who's supposed to be 88 years old, drips sarcasm but clearly has a heart of gold. It's all a bit too familiar, and the format is forced into some unseemly stretching. In the first episode, written by the series creator, Susan Harris, Oliver asks Roland to hide him from the new owners. "Who do you think you are?" asks Roland. "Anne Frank?" When a sitcom begins making you cringe, trouble looms. It's also looming ominously in "Frannie's Turn." Frannie (Miriam Margolyes) is a middle-aged seamstress who has suddenly realized that "if you're not young, beautiful and rich, you don't exist." Tired of being a servant to her macho Cuban husband, Joseph (Tomas Milian), she begins rebelling in a manner that the family attributes to either feminist anger or menopause. Frannie tries to stop her daughter from marrying a man just like her father. At work, she tells off her high-fashion boss, Armando, formerly Arthur of the garment center. At home, Joseph is informed he will have to go to the refigerator himself if he wants a beer. Meanwhile, Joseph's mother, Rosa (Alice Drummond), obviously a Sophia clone, may be mostly confined to her bed, but she's usually good for a wisecrack or two to perk up the laugh track. But beneath the jokes in "Frannie's Turn," there is real pain and far too much bitterness to be crammed into a sitcom. The most perceptive character of the lot could be spaced-out Eddie (Stivi Paskoski), the teen-age son in a Megadeth T-shirt, who casually treats the rest of the family with the wry disdain they so readily invite. 'The Making of Sgt. Pepper' Disney, Sunday at 9 P.M. George Martin, recording producer for the Beatles, recalls with undiminished enthusiasm how the legendary "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album was put together 25 years ago. Sitting before a studio console, Mr. Martin uses single tracks to explain how specific music and vocal effects were achieved for the psychedelic "concept" production. Influences ranging from the Beach Boys and Ravi Shankar to Lewis Carroll are cited. Photos and films from the period are supplemented by recent interviews with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The Beatles recall having been tired of frenzied tours and more than willing to retire to a studio where they would spend some 700 hours working on "Sgt. Pepper." Being written off in parts of the media at the time, the Beatles needed a hit. With the album finished, Mr. Martin says, "I remember sitting and rubbing my hands and saying, 'You just wait.' " More than eight million copies of the album have been sold to date.

691-> Law for Disabled
To the Editor: Your "New Federal Law For the Disabled Slow to Take Hold" on July 12 does a lot to underscore the problem of accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The accessibility standard referred to in the article is the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). There are over 44 million Americans with disabilities covered by the act. The greatest impact in terms of achieving accessibility lies in new construction. It is in this area that the law is very clear concerning what has to be done: all new construction must comply with the standard. In addition, current estimates are that compliance will only add 1 or 2 percent to the cost of new construction. The retrofitting of facilities to comply with the standard is very often extremely expensive and on occasion may not be even feasible. But the law views "readily achievable" as an ongoing process and what is not readily achievable today may be so tomorrow, either through technological advances or increased economic resources of the entities covered by the act. RONALD P. KOZBERG Mountainside, N.J. The writer is president of Expert Strategies, a consultant on the disabled.

692-> Review/Dance; Sketches With an Underlying Order
Susan Rethorst's "Sometimes to Grace," presented at Performance Space 122 on Friday night, appears to spill out of nowhere and move through its own rarefied time and place in ways that call to mind the very different dances of Merce Cunningham. Ms. Rethorst has her own quiet but insistent choreographic voice. And the new quintet for women, danced in rather tatty practice clothes and without music, offers a clear view into Ms. Rethorst's fascinating work. At first, particularly with the occasional sounds of Friday's last demonstrators and the police outside in the East Village streets, "Sometimes to Grace" looked like a series of inconsequential little movement sketches. A woman entered, sank to a crouch and cupped the air and floor with her hands as if in a dream, in a still, poetic image that also ended the dance. Another woman entered with a plain wooden chair, one of six that eventually made their way onto the stage to form, with alertly resting and moving bodies, a mysterious landscape. The women came and went in no very ordered-looking sequence. There were moments when they overtly acknowledged one another's presence. Ms. Rethorst broke up small gatherings with peremptory murmurs, like a schoolteacher or a mother. Beneath her determined, intense concentration and the air of inapproachability it gives her, Ms. Rethorst is quite a comic. Sometimes the women seemed to be dancing together simply because they shared the stage space. But for the most part, the dancers looked isolated from one another, as if moving in their own world in curious eruptions of looping, stamping motion. By the dancers' clothes, however, it was clear that "Sometimes to Grace" was as carefully ordered as a piece of fine writing, its "sentences" coming to full life through the unwritten words and spaces between the lines. Ms. Rethorst's accomplices, as magical as she in their individual ways, were Susan Braham, Jeanette Engler, Erin Fitzgerald and Vicky Shick. David Herrigel's bold and sensitive lighting was like a sixth presence in the dance. The program was completed by "Sons of Famous Men."

694-> In Health Care, Technology Is Not the Villain
To the Editor: Professors at medical schools are paid more than other faculty. Physicians make staggering incomes. Hospital rooms cost more than the fanciest hotel rooms. And yet in "The Hard Choices in Health Care" (Forum, July 19), William B. Schwartz tells us that rising health costs are caused by "the rapid introduction of valuable and extremely expensive new technology." Medical technology is a small part of health care expenditures. In 1988, the nation spent $544 billion on health care; shipments of medical instruments and supplies totaled $25.3 billion and of drugs, $44.0 billion -- technology was less than 13 percent of the total. In most industries, new technology leads to both improved quality of service and increased productivity. Health care seems to be the exception; here, new technology leads to increased costs and higher labor content. The alternatives to the rising costs of health care are government regulation or increased competition, two concepts despised by the health care industry. The public has a perception that the quality of medical care has decreased while becoming more costly. Dr. Schwartz concludes that we have no alternative but to "pay the staggering bill imposed by new medical technology." That a medical professional should prescribe such advice is no surprise. A. MICHAEL NOLL Los Angeles, July 20

696-> Art in Review
Francesco Clemente Gagosian Gallery 136 Wooster Street SoHo Through Oct. 31 Francesco Clemente is one of the few high-profile painters around whose best work is in watercolor. He has fully mastered the technical difficulties of the medium and puts them to dramatic use in this show of recent work. All the paintings are dated 1992; none are titled. They are divided into two groups: a series of over a dozen large paintings on paper executed in Jamaica and about 50 smaller works, many no more than a few inches in height, done in India. The Indian paintings make an especially strong effect. Most seem to be modeled on religious images associated with tantrism, whose practice involves goddess worship and sexual rites. Many of Mr. Clemente's forms are tinted a brilliant vermilion, the sacred color emblematic of blood. The nude human figures are often dancing or in erotic poses; some are radically foreshortened or compressed, others are little more than detached limbs or grimacing faces. The works suggest both Hindu manuscript painting and personal notebook entries. The watercolor is applied with the density of gouache and captures a sense of religious fervor with exceptional immediacy. The large Jamaica watercolors, painted in beautifully handled scrim-like washes with a subdued, transparent palette, look expressively diffuse by comparison. A weakness here, as in much of Mr. Clemente's other work, is his tendency to settle for images that have a kind of weird exoticism without being about anything in particular. The Jamaica paintings have arresting moments, but their ideas are hard to locate and they lack the concentrated verve of the Indian pieces. In the long run, concentration is an element Mr. Clemente's art cannot do without if it is to sustain interest.

697-> A Nonprofit Book House Outside the Mainstream
Andre Schiffrin, who was removed as managing director and editor in chief of Pantheon two years ago amid a controversy over its financial health and editorial direction, announced yesterday that he was starting an independent, nonprofit publishing house. The New Press, which Mr. Schiffrin will head as director and editor in chief, is being financed by more than a dozen philanthropic organizations, including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc. The goal of the New Press, Mr. Schiffrin said, is to publish books that major commercial houses see as too risky or unprofitable, covering social and educational issues and appealing to audiences that he says are often ignored by mainstream publishers. The New Press's first list, which will begin appearing in April, includes "Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession," by Studs Terkel; "AIDS Agenda: Emerging Issues in Civil Rights," a collaboration with the AIDS Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, edited by Nan D. Hunter and William B. Rubenstein, and "Early Black Photograhers 1840-1940," a postcard book from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, edited and with a preface by Deborah Willis-Thomas. Publishers as 'Gatekeepers' Mr. Schiffrin said he had long been troubled by the idea that publishers are "gatekeepers" of the issues brought before the public for debate and that the increasing number of corporate takeovers of publishing houses had created an informal "market censorship," in which unpopular or unprofitable themes "don't make their way through to the public." "There is a gap between the commercial houses and the university presses, and we think we can fill it," said Mr. Schiffrin. He added that in previous publishing posts he had been guilty of the very market discrimination that the New Press was founded to redress. As models for the new publishing house, he offers the Public Broadcasting System, the recent growth of nonprofit theaters and the changeover of both Ms. magazine and Harpers into nonprofit publications. An Alternative "We felt it was essential to create a new structure for publishing in much the same way that PBS created an alternative to commercial television," he said. By collaborating with education programs and cultural institutions and by using extensive direct-mail marketing, Mr. Schiffrin said, the New Press intends to reach out to readers from minority groups and the poor, readers, he says, whom most publishing houses neglect because they don't create best sellers. . The New Press is being advised by committees in such areas as financial strategies, art criticism, education and public policy. The committees are made up of experts in those areas, writers and publishers from commercial houses.

698-> American Airlines' New Class
In an effort to extend a concept long familiar on international flights, American Airlines said yesterday that on Feb. 4 it would begin offering business-class service on flights between New York and Los Angeles. It appeared that the move was made at least partly to make more room in first class and that it would come at the expense of passengers with frequent-flier miles who wished to upgrade their tickets. Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president of marketing, said that more passengers often wanted to fly first class than could be provided for and that such seats were sometimes taken by passengers who had upgraded their frequent-flier miles. No First-Class Upgrade Fliers will no longer be able to upgrade to first class, but can do so to business class. Although Trans World Airlines Inc. has had such a class on its transcontinental flights, it has been more the result of shifting planes with such seats from international service to domestic service in the off-peak seasons. American, with nine daily flights from John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens to Los Angeles, is the largest carrier on the route. Other carriers, like United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, T.W.A.and MGM Grand Air, offer daily flights but less frequently. United's Business Service United already offers business class on about 100 of its domestic flights from six cities around the country, including from Chicago to Los Angeles, from Chicago to San Francisco, and from Dulles International Airport outside Washington to Los Angeles and to San Franciso. Lynn Martenstein, United's vice president of corporate communications, said that as of Feb. 1, the airline would offer such service on 149 of its domestic flights and that it had planned to add the class on flights between New York and Los Angeles. Mr. Gunn described the new service at a news conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Rearranging Seats Under the new configuration of a fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airliners, American will offer 28 first-class seats, 52 new business-class seats and 157 coach seats. Historically, the configuration has been 34 first-class seats and 256 coach seats. The first-class class fare from New York to Los Angeles is $1,288 one way and the full coach fare is $752 one way. The new business-class fare has been $902 one way on a trial basis for several months, as American tested the service. The carrier said it might raise the fare to $998 when the service began. Mr. Gunn and Donald J. Carty, American's executive vice president of finance and planning, said that even with fewer total seats, the new fare class would still increase revenues, since all first-class passengers would be paying full fare and another 52 seats would be available at the higher business-class price. The idea comes at a tough time for the industry, as companies are seeking to cut travel costs. Mr. Gunn conceded that it would take time to get business fliers used to the service. "We will not overnight create a U.S. business class-market," he said at the news conference. "I think we will build it." But he added that it was a logical extension of business-class service on international flights, where it has been a money maker for airlines. Business class will essentially provide better food, wider adjustable seats in a separate section, as well as separate bathrooms from coach. Each seat would have its own video system, where one can watch movies. Fliers will find a separate bin for their carry-on baggage. American will also have exclusive check-in counters for business-class fliers. The service is basically patterned after American's Flagship service, which was introduced two years ago when the airline began on a huge expansion of its international system. The idea for adding business class germinated when American decided to re-outfit its DC-10's. Since the interiors were going to be redone, the idea of adding business class domestically was researched and adopted. 'Nothing New' Kevin Murphy, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, agreed yesterday that the concept made sense, since it was merely applying a strategy that had worked on international flights. "It's nothing new," he said. "It's not as innovative as it sounds." Nevertheless, he said he thought the new class would bring more revenues, since many business fliers wanted an upgraded service on the longer flights to the West Coast. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the stock of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, fell $1.625, to $73.375.

699-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats; Clinton, on Tour of Western States, Chides G.O.P. for Investigating His Mother
Continuing his two-day campaign swing through Western states, Gov. Bill Clinton spent today reaching for normally Republican and independent voters while repeating his attacks on President Bush. Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of at least 10,000 people along the Puget Sound waterfront in Seattle, the Democratic Presidential nominee took advantage of the latest report of Republican efforts to dig up damaging information about him to twit his opponent. Referring to a report in The Washington Post that the State Department had investigated the passport files of his mother, Virginia Kelley, Mr. Clinton said, "It turns out that the State Department was not only rifling through my files, but actually investigated my mother, a well-known subversive." He continued: "It would be funny if it's not so pathetic. This is a crowd so desperate to hold on to power they have forgotten that the purpose of power of government is to use it to help people and to lift them up." Defending His Mother's Honor The report of the State Department's actions gave Mr. Clinton the opportunity of a politician's dreams, to defend his mother's honor, and it filled the Clinton campaign with a sense of delight, evidenced in the jokes that ran through the day Pretending to guess at the contents of his mother's file, Mr. Clinton told reporters that President Leonid I. Brezhnev of the Soviet Union was calling his mother, who has a passion for the race track, "to get tips on the third race at Oaklawn every night." Mr. Clinton also kept up his implicit, careful assault on Ross Perot, the independent candidate, whom some Clinton strategists are said to view as a threat to Mr. Clinton's lead in several states. The Clinton campaign today began broadcasting a 30-second commercial that accuses Mr. Bush of allowing, and even encouraging, foreign corporations to operate in the United States even though most do not pay taxes. Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, accused the Clinton campaign of "using funny figures to make a point that is not substantiated by the facts." Apparently confident that the votes of the faithful are secure, and driving for the maximum possible victory, Mr. Clinton, in every speech, takes the time to preach outside the choir, competing for the votes of Republicans and of Perot supporters. "This election has taken on a remarkable texture in the last few weeks as we have broadened the base of our campaign beyond party to people, embracing Republicans and Democrats and independents, former Perot supporters," the Arkansas Governor said in typical remarks today. Typical as well in these Western states, where Mr. Perot has his greatest support, are implicit attacks on the candidate who pitches himself as a Washington outsider. "There's been a lot of talk in the last few days about who represents real change," he said in Seattle. "Let me tell you, folks, there are -- of all the choices you have in this election -- only one has never been part of the Washington insider establishment. Only one has ever balanced a government budget. Only one has ever done anything to restrain the influence of lobbyists and promote political reform, and only one has ever passed a program through a contentious legislature to increase jobs and improve education. And that candidate is the candidate of the new Democratic Party, Bill Clinton, and Al Gore." Secure Base and Broad Support The effort against Mr. Perot is part of the campaign's strategy to win Republican and independent voters like those who have leaned toward Mr. Perot in this region. To this end, Mr. Clinton stuck largely to safe and mainstream topics today, and made in every speech an effort to depict himself as a "new Democrat" apart from the more liberal factions of his party. The reason he is doing this is that he has the greatest luxury in politics, a secure base and broad support, and that was clear here in Eugene. And so, in speeches in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming earlier this week and in Oregon and California today, Mr. Clinton was the Democrat who wasn't there, sometimes presenting himself as the candidate of an entity called the New Democratic Party, sometimes as the candidate of no party at all. "This is not a matter of party," he said here today. "It's not about labels, and it's not about leaders, it's about people." There is, Mr. Clinton said over and over in his speech to thousands of people spreading several blocks around the stage, a "New Democratic Party," led by a new-model Democrat, one who would never tax and spend, who was tough on crime, who wanted to tax the rich more but still recognized the virtues of capitalism, and who believed, as he said here, that the Government "ought to give people a good lettin' alone on things that are truly private." Both Mr. Clinton's mood and his New Democratic message suggest the state of things these days for the Democrats. The reason Mr. Clinton feels he can take time to push for independent voters was overwhelmingly clear in today's second event, a speech at the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, a college and a city of solidly liberal sentiments. More than 10,000 people, most of them young, filled MacArthur Arena to overflowing and cheered Mr. Clinton. Facing this most liberal of audiences, Mr. Clinton came out, apparently for the first time in a speech, in opposition to a resolution on the Oregon ballot that would repeal measures designed to protect homosexuals from discrimination in hiring, housing and other areas. "Many people look to the West and see tomorrow, they see the shape of America to come," Mr. Clinton said. "I ask you to send a message to America about what kind of country we are by resoundingly defeating Resolution 9." The young men and women roared their approval at that line, and almost every other one. Yet, even with an audience that could be expected to lean much more left than right, Mr. Clinton did not, apart from his statement on Resolution 9, stray from New Democrat themes.

Sol LeWitt John Weber Gallery 142 Greene Street SoHo Through tomorrow Sol LeWitt has derived a lot of mileage from geometry. During the 1980's, he translated his earlier open-work cubic structures into frescolike wall paintings, and the 100 gouache-on-paper "drawings" in this show recall that work. Each has a single cube form painted in the colors Mr. LeWitt favors: darkened tones of blue, violet, yellow and red. Although individually framed, the gouaches hanging together on the wall create the impression of a larger crystalline form, and as a group they have the lightness that has always given Mr. LeWitt's rigorous images a measure of poetry. The gouaches also serve as a much-needed foil to the show's other work. This is an immense constructed sculpture titled "Horizontal Serial Piece, 1991-1992." More than 40 feet long and 10 feet high, it takes the form of an ascending set of stepped platforms, which narrow into a long flat-topped wall or walkway. The piece was designed to be built of cinder blocks at an outdoor site eventually, and the incremental stacking of the single geometric element explains the "serial" of the title. The full-scale version on display in the gallery is constructed of white painted wood, which roughly simulates the look of cemented blocks. The sculpture is imposing enough as a textbook application of Mr. LeWitt's basic reductivist vocabulary, and even has wit as a cartoon version of Minimalist "presence." But by adding little more than bulk to the ideas he has already explored, Mr. LeWitt gets what could be a new direction for his sculpture -- big and solid -- off to a rather leaden start.

703-> 12 Indicted On Violence In Drug Ring
Twelve people described as members of the "Supreme Team," which Federal authorities call a drug ring that terrorized southeastern Queens during the 1980's, were indicted yesterday in a string of violence that included at least nine murders. Law-enforcement officials said the indictments involve one of the drug rings that, with organizations once led by Lorenzo (Fat Cat) Nichols and Howard (Pappy) Mason, have dominated crack distribution in southeastern Queens in the last decade. Among those charged was Gerald Miller, a 29-year-old Queens man known as Prince, who was described in the indictment as the principal leader of the ring since 1987. He was acquitted last May of state charges that he ordered the murder of three Colombian drug dealers. Both Mr. Nichols and Mr. Mason are in jail. If convicted of the new Federal charges, all the defendants could face up to life in prison, and Mr. Miller would face a mandatory life sentence without parole as the ring's leader. A Joint Investigation United States Attorney Andrew J. Maloney noted that the latest indictment resulted from a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York City Police Department. The ring sold $500,000 of crack a week, Federal authorities said. They said the ring operated in the vicinity of the Baisley Park Housing Project and other sites in Queens, including the yard of Intermediate School 72. Several murders were carried out, the authorities said, by tying up the victims, beating them to death and dumping the bodies in empty lots. The nine murders cited in the Federal racketeering charge included the three Colombians involved in Mr. Miller's acquittal on state charges last May. Mr. Maloney said Federal law permitted those slayings to be included in the racketeering charge. Second in Command From the early 1980's until 1987, Mr. Miller was second in command to the ring's founder, Kenneth McGriff, the indictment charged. It said he became the principal leader in 1987, when Mr. McGriff went to prison on related drug charges. Seven of the defendants were already in jail serving sentences or awaiting trial on other drug charges, while four others were arrested yesterday and one was still being sought, said Leslie R. Caldwell, a prosecutor handling the case. Besides Mr. Miller, the defendants were identified as Wilfredo Arroyo, Roy Hale, David Robinson, Shannon Jimenez, Harry Hunt, Fabio Arciniegas, Julio Hernandez, Waverly Coleman, Ronald Tucker, Cynthia Brown and Raymond Robinson.

704-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Chairman Named For British Regulator
Andrew Large, chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange, has been named chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the agency that regulates Britain's investment industry. He will succeed Sir David Walker, 52, whose five-year term ends on May 31. Mr. Large, 49, has been chairman of the exchange since October. He also heads Large, Smith & Walter, a London corporate consulting firm. In 1986, Mr. Large became the first chairman of the Securities Association -- now merged with the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers to form the Securities and Futures Authority -- a self-regulating organization that reports to the Securities and Investments Board. He also served as a member of the board of the London Stock Exchange and on the Panel for Mergers and Acquisitions. Mr. Large began his career in marketing with British Petroleum. In 1971, he joined the Orion Bank and eventually became a managing director. At Orion, he specialized in international capital-raising and investment advice. In 1980, he was one of five executives who left Orion to found the Swiss Bank Corporation International, the London-based investment arm of the Swiss Bank Corporation. He became chief executive and deputy chairman of the London unit in 1983. Mr. Large was also a member of the board of the Swiss Bank Corporation, which he left in 1990, and was responsible for developing the bank's international capital-market and investment banking activities in London and other leading financial centers outside Switzerland. Mr. Large received a master's degree in economics from Cambridge University in 1964 and an M.B.A. at Insead, the French business school, in 1970. He is chairman of the London Commodity Exchange and serves on the boards of several companies.

705-> California Closes a Bank
The California Banking Department today closed the Independence Bank of Encino, which had been secretly owned by the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Independence said the decision came as a surprise, particularly since it had received a capital infusion of $5 million under a Dec. 19 plea agreement signed between the liquidators of B.C.C.I. and Federal regulatory agencies. A spokesman for the state banking department said the bank was closed because it was insolvent. As of today, the bank had deposits of $530 million and assets of $555 million, the spokesman said. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1991, Independence lost $44 million, he added.

706-> ALBERTVILLE; Koch Pledges Allegiance to The Statute
Some people thought they saw Bill Koch nod when he passed President Francois Mitterrand of France tonight. Others perceived an ever-so-slight dip of the wrist. But the first United States controversy of the Winter Olympic Games faded into the Alpine night: Koch, the cross-country skier and American flag-bearer, didn't break his country's law by dipping the flag. United States Olympic officials were surprised to find they had a potential problem when Koch told a news conference five hours before the ceremonies that he was considering dipping the flag when it passed before the dignitaries of the host country. That is customary among the delegations of certain countries, but it goes against United States law. As soon as a United States Olympic Committee official was notified of Koch's remarks, Harvey Schiller, the committee's executive director, was asked to tell Koch that the decision was not his to make. So Koch, who had retired after the 1984 Olympics and is attempting a comeback at 36 years, played it straight. He led the long line of Americans into the stadium and past the reviewing stand where Mitterrand sat, not far from Vice President Dan Quayle. The flag didn't dip. It was a surprisingly uneventful moment in Koch's long, unexpected trip to Albertville. But for a while it had the United States contingent holding its breath. "Olympics is a world event and maybe it's not the place to have excessive amounts of nationalism," Koch said at his news conference before the ceremonies, taking a global view. "If I don't dip the flag, at least I'll make some gesture of appreciation to the host country or try to offend as few million people as possible." Koch went on to explain that he was told that most countries dip their flags. Actually, he was misinformed. Indeed, tonight, only 4 of the 64 flag-bearers tipped the flag in honor of Mitterrand: Bermuda, Canada, Monaco and Croatia. But Koch didn't. He simply led the American delegation -- with the men wearing outfits that could have been designed by a 1930's Ivy League mobster. The highlights of those outfits were burgundy snap-brimmed hats adorned with a feather and long navy coats. The women's outfits were the same, but in opposite colors. Immediately behind Koch, the U.S.O.C. president, William J. Hybl, doffed his hat with a sweeping gesture as the American delegation passed the V.I.P. stand. Koch's earlier statement had provoked a surprised, and annoyed, reaction from the U.S.O.C. press chief, Mike Moran. "This is something he was instructed not to do and he agreed not to on Friday night," said Moran. "It is not up to the flag-carrier." The question of dipping the flag passed into sports legend after the 1908 Games, which were held in London. The United States flag-bearer was a shot-putter, Ralph Rose. Rose was said to be distressed because the United States flag, along with Sweden's, was the only one not flying in the stadium. Other countries dipped their flag in front of King Edward VII. Rose gained lasting fame by proclaiming that, "This flag dips for no earthly king." After World War II, Federal statute 829 was adopted, stating: "The United States flag shall not be dipped to any person or any thing." Koch was voted the flag-bearing honor Thursday night by the seven team captains on the U.S. squad. He is the only American to have captured a cross-country skiing medal. He won the silver in 1976 at 30 kilometers, using a controversial skating style. Then, to the 20-year-old skier's chagrin, his father legally changed his own name to Koch Is It, hoping to cash in on the popular ad campaign by Coca-Cola. Koch would not comment today on his father's action, saying only: "It's personally difficult for me. I don't want anything negative to the Olympics relating to me." 'I Was Worried About My Future' Koch also competed in the 1980 and 1984 games. Then he quit. "At that time I was married and had two children," he said. "I was worried about my future. I needed to prove to myself I could support my family. In hindsight, it was unnecessary." He went into several fitness-related businesses, divorced his wife, remarried and is now separated. Although he said he did well in business, Koch conceded much of his recent financial support comes from a skiing foundation. Last year, at the urging of his friend Lyle Nelson, who was the United States flag-bearer at the 1988 Winter Games, Koch attempted a comeback. 'The Last Train' "I figured probably it was the last train and I better get on it," he said. Koch, at least for a while, seemed blissfully unaware of the brouhaha his flag statements had created. During his news conference, he spoke blithely of the joys of age, how Bjorn Borg, George Foreman, Mark Spitz, Jimmy Connors all had made comebacks, or were trying to, at relatively advanced ages for their sports. "No matter how things come out, the Games touch people's lives in a lot of ways," he said.

707-> Charges Dropped On Jets' Dawkins
Dale Dawkins, a special-teams player for the Jets, was cleared today of charges of driving while intoxicated. Blood samples taken from Dawkins at the scene of an accident on Dec. 16 showed no evidence of alcohol or drugs, the Nassau County District Attorney, Denis Dillon, said. Dawkins broke his right leg when he lost control of his car and it hit a tree. A state trooper investigating the accident believed Dawkins was driving while intoxicated and took a blood sample.

708-> Foster Mother Faces Charges Of Killing Girl
A 36-year-old foster mother in the Bronx was charged yesterday with murder for beating her 6-year-old niece, immersing her in a tub of cold water and then taping her mouth shut, according to court records. The woman, Mary Ann Ayala, was also charged with two counts of attempted second-degree murder for choking the dead girl's 4-year-old sister and putting her in a cold tub. The girls, Millison, 6, and Stephanie, 4, are the daughters of Ms. Ayala's brother, and Millison had officially been placed in her care as a foster child. Millison was pronounced dead at Montefiore Hospital Saturday afternoon after a frantic Ms. Ayala brought her there after telling a neighbor that the child had stopped breathing. Paramedics responding to an anonymous call later brought Stephanie to North Central Bronx Hospital. She was later transferred to Montefiore, where she was reported in stable condition in the intensive-care unit yesterday. Millison's death focuses attention on the number of children who have died at the hands of their foster mothers. A recent city report showed that in 1990, three children in the care of foster mothers died. Neighbors' Suspicions Several neighbors said this weekend that they had seen evidence that Ms. Ayala mistreated the children, and a former neighbor said he called Child Welfare authorities to report that the children were mistreated. Child Welfare authorities said Saturday that state confidentiality laws prohibited them from commenting on the case, and police investigators said they have not yet been able to determine when the reports of abuse were made and to what agencies. But Detective Howard Landesberg of the 52d Police Precinct said his office had no record of complaints against the family. Ms. Ayala, who lives at 2995 Botanical Square in the Bedford Park section, was charged in Bronx Criminal Court yesterday with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. When Justice Vincent A. Vitale announced that she would be held without bail, Ms. Ayala's 16-year-old daughter, Flora, cried out. "Mami, mami," she said, falling into the arms of her uncle, Roberto Ayala, who was among the handful of relatives present. Ms. Ayala herself, wearing a denim blue, fleece-lined jacket and her hair pulled back, looked emotionless and mostly stared at the floor during the brief hearing. Afterward, some family members defended Ms. Ayala. "My sister is a caring and loving person," Roberto Ayala said. Stephanie and Millison are the children of another brother, he said, but he refused to comment further on the family's situation or the girls' injuries. Some neighbors yesterday said they had seen signs of abuse. Others, however, were surprised by the news, including Vivian Torres, whom Ms. Ayala called Saturday to say that Millison was not breathing. Ms. Ayala left Stephanie with Mrs. Torres and her husband, Greg Lorenzi, and ran out into the street to look for a cab to take Millison to the hospital, the couple said. A few minutes later, the police received a tip that another child at the same building was also not breathing. Mr. Lorenzi said he called an ambulance when Stephanie appeared to be losing consciousness. But he said he and his wife had no idea the children were being abused. "When the baby was up here, I just thought she was sick," Mr. Lorenzi said yesterday at his apartment. "I have a son, too, and he used to get seizures, so I just thought something was wrong with her, but not anything like this. I never put two and two together. A Tub of Cold Water "It's such a shame," he said, explaining that his wife, who has known Ms. Ayala for several years, was "a wreck" since learning that Millison had died and that Ms. Ayala was accused of beating the two girls. Documents introduced by prosecutors in court yesterday stated that Ms. Ayala caused the 6-year-old's death "by striking her with a shoe, squeezing the neck of Millison Ayala with her hands," and then placing her into a tub of cold water "for an extended period of time," which caused her body temperature to fall below 85 degrees. Ms. Ayala then taped Millison's mouth shut, the court documents showed. The records said she also immersed Stephanie in a cold bath, causing her eventually to become unconscious. Detective Landesberg said that Stephanie appeared to be improving on Sunday. "She's up and about now," he said. "She seems to be alert and eating. I don't know if she's talking, but she's in good spirits." At the apartment building where Ms. Ayala lived with her brother's daughters and her own two children, Benjamin, 17, and Flora, neighbors stood in small knots in front of the building, talking about the arrest. Three Years of Care "I used to see her walking the two girls to school everyday when I was on my way to school," said Kimberly Butt, 13, who also lives in the building. "I knew who she was because in the summer time she used to talk to her friends from her window. Nobody ever thought anything like this would ever happen." Ms. Ayala's next-door neighbor, Maria Magdalena Ramos, said she never suspected that the children were mistreated. "She always had the little girl, Millison, very dressed up," she said. "The little girl always appeared clean and neat." She said that Ms. Ayala had had Millison about three years, but she did not know how long she had been caring for Stephanie. But Luis Caballero, who used to live across the courtyard from the Ayalas and whose sister still lives there, said he had called child welfare authorities to report that the sisters were being abused. "She treated them like they were devils," he said in a telephone interview late Saturday night. A Neighborhood of Children His sister, who did not want her name used, said, "The kids looked miserable. They were terrified of her. She would have them kneel in front of the wall for five hours." She said that child welfare investigators visited Ms. Ayala after her brother called, "and they never did anything." Colon Avaroa, who lives across the hall from the Ayalas, also said that Ms. Ayala beat Millison. The neatly maintained building, where apartments are arranged around a landscaped courtyard, faces a Metro North station and the New York Botanical Garden. There are mostly families with young children here, and neighbors said the children tend to know each other because they play together in a nearby park or in the courtyard. The Ayalas lived on the first floor, in an apartment that faces the train station and the street. No one answered the door of the Ayala apartment yesterday. But from the hallway, sobs could be heard from inside, shortly after neighbors saw Benjamin and his girlfriend walking into the apartment. "He's very upset," Detective Landesberg said about Benjamin, whom they had questioned earlier.

709-> A 1930's Visionary Who Looked Back And Saw Santa Fe
BEFORE the Range Rovers, the howling coyote sculptures and Santa Fe (the fragrance), there was an architect named John Gaw Meem, whose wildly romantic Spanish Pueblo revival houses, built primarily in the 1930's, set the stage for it all. Mr. Meem arrived in this luminous landscape of pinon and juniper in 1920. From 1924 until his death in 1983, he designed houses and churches, municipal and university buildings that married the spirit of native pueblo architecture with the necessities of the modern world. With deliberately battered corners and other atmospheric effects, he created what Chris Wilson, a cultural historian, calls "pueblo getaways from the modern world." Despite the recent preponderance of blue-corn gourmets and Anglos longing to be Navajos, Mr. Meem's imagery -- exotic fantasies of life in the Southwest -- endures. His houses, which number around 150 in and around Santa Fe, were designed for wealthy, spirited clients, including East Coast sophisticates and women of opinion. In the early 1930's, Amelia Beard Hollenback, who was the first woman to photograph a Hopi snake dance, instructed Mr. Meem, "I want something extremely informal that will let us amuse ourselves with old ways and old things, but may Heaven preserve it from looking Arty!" "Daddy was fortunate in having very paternalistic clients," said Nancy Wirth, Mr. Meem's daughter, who still lives where she grew up, in a two-story stone house designed by her father in 1937. "He used to say that the best clients were the ones who sat down with him, told him what they wanted and then went to Europe for the year." Mr. Meem's influence is found in the portals of the Plaza in Santa Fe, which were added in 1969; in a 1929 renovation of La Fonda Hotel; in the Laboratory of Anthropology, and in the main campus of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, which contains some 30 buildings designed by Mr. Meem. But it extends to more than his architecture. As chairman of the city Planning Commission, he helped develop the city's first master plan in 1947, which helped protect the character of downtown Santa Fe. As chairman of the New Mexico Society for the Restoration and Preservation of New Mexico Mission Churches, Meem the preservationist personally restored dozens of historic mission churches, including those at Acoma, Laguna and Zia pueblos. Today, the cult of John Gaw Meem, who was an engineer by training and never completed his formal architectural training, flourishes among regional architects. Last summer, the Historic Santa Fe Foundation, a private preservation group, organized a special John Gaw Meem house tour. "He's arguably the single most important person in the way the city looks today," said Mr. Wilson, who is writing a book for the University of New Mexico Press called "The Myth of Santa Fe." His buildings, Mr. Wilson added, "still serve as the ideal image of Santa Fe style." In other words, John Gaw Meem made Santa Fe safe for Ralph Lauren. Mr. Meem drew inspiration from regional architecture, but his designs were very much his own. In a 12-room summer house built in 1930 for Eleanor Brownell and Alice Howland near Bishop's Lodge, it is necessary to duck one's head and step high over the raised thresholds when passing through the antique doors. To simulate the earthen floors of early New Mexican houses, which were treated with ox blood to keep them free of dust, Mr. Meem used a dark-brown mastic covering somewhat like linoleum. The house is arranged like a traditional hacienda, with a chain of rooms gathered around a placita, or open courtyard. The late architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting, who wrote a monograph on Mr. Meem, referred to such houses as "inscapes," a poetic meeting of pueblo spirit and the material world. Laban Wingert, a Santa Fe architect, has the delicate task of helping a couple who remodeled the house unsympathetically bring it back to Mr. Meem's original plan. "Mr. Meem had such a wonderful sense of form," he observed. "Every corner and projection was thought out." Each Meem house is a miniature world: quiet, comforting spaces with flickering fireplaces that keep the tumult of the modern world at bay. Like the houses of the California architects Greene & Greene, they seem both aged and ageless, appearing to have magically sprouted from the soil. These days, cutesy shops overrrun the Plaza and the most authentic-feeling place downtown is Woolworth's. It is difficult to imagine that in 1920, the pueblo style, which now attracts tourists like flypaper, was on the decline. When Mr. Meem first came to Santa Fe, to recuperate from tuberculosis, the vogue was not flat-roof adobe dwellings but pitched-roof houses with expanses of glass imported from St. Louis and Kansas City. Along with the artist and photographer Carlos Vierra and others, Mr. Meem advocated a return to vernacular styles, the more weathered-looking and beat-up, the better. "Some old forms are so honest, so completely logical and native to the environment," he once wrote, "that one finds -- to one's delight and surprise -- that modern problems can be solved and are best solved by use of forms based on tradition." Santa Fe was hardly the typical small town, even in 1920. It was the adventurous bohemian's alternative to Paris and Greenwich Village. During his stay at the Sunmount Sanatorium, Mr. Meem hobnobbed with other wealthy patients. As there is today, there was an unusual abundance of potential commissions for the right architect. Mr. Meem's houses, photographed by Ansel Adams and Laura Gilpin, contemporaries he hired to record his work, physically embody the Santa Fe fantasy. They have mellowed beyond preciousness and are almost excruciatingly civilized. From chunky wooden chandeliers made from church beams to rustic plank flooring, they are distinctive for their understated but abundant use of ornament, much of it adapted from graphic pueblo and Spanish designs. In one living room, for instance, Mr. Meem designed a herringbone-pattern ceiling using vigas (unmilled ceiling beams in the natural shape of a tree), and latillas (golden-colored aspen poles stripped of their bark). Lowly details like mirror frames and radiator covers were excuses for handcrafted stamped-tin motifs drawn from Indian and Spanish sources. Mr. Meem's sense of graciousness also led him to lavish attention on hallways and other forgotten household spaces. A number of Mr. Meem's best clients were collectors who scoured the countryside for church beams and other antique architectural details. Amelia Hollenback, who spent the autumn months in Santa Fe to attend Indian ceremonial dances, was an astute and voracious collector. "It's lots of fun," she wrote Mr. Meem of her shopping sprees while her house was being planned. "I wish we were building a village." Completed in 1932, her house was the apotheosis of the genre, a "domestic cloisters for the Southwest," in Mr. Wilson's words. Like many of Mr. Meem's houses, it has intentionally wobbly silhouettes and rounded corners, giving the impression of having been eroded over time. The size of the rooms was dictated by the dimensions of the old beams Miss Hollenback collected. Among her prizes, seamlessly incorporated into the architecture, are a large number of Spanish colonial doors, carved beams from Acoma and Gran Quivira, a historic pueblo site, and a rare carved portal beam from 1828 decorated with hex signs and archaic Spanish writing. "Amelia was out collecting the things that everyone else was throwing away," said Mary Jean Cook, who now owns the 15-room house with her husband Dr. Edward S. Cook. "Meem listened to her ideas, and thank God he did." The Cooks purchased the house, which was hardly used after its completion, in 1971. For the last 13 years, Mrs. Cook, a musician and historian, has been working on a book on Miss Hollenback, who has become something of an alter ego. Miss Hollenback left some 6,000 photographs in a trunk, and her ballgown still hangs in the closet. Mrs. Cook carries her briefcase; the Cooks' cat is named Amelia Hollenback. Much to Mrs. Cook's delight, Miss Hollenback kept detailed records of both the building process and her collection, noting on a tag the date and origin of each piece. Mrs. Cook is so committed to retaining the original feeling of the house that she does the mud work on the portale walls and fireplaces herself, based on Mr. Meem's own "recipe." Many owners of Meem houses seem to share this maternal, curatorial feeling. "My philosophy is, don't monkey with it," said Dr. Orville Linck, a retired English professor, who lives in a small Meem house on Delgado Lane. "It's the livability of the place. You get into it, and it's a part of you."

710-> American Electric Power: A Help . . . Or a Hindrance?
To the Editor: American Electric Power paint itself green? The problem is identified in the article's subhead: "But a wildlife preserve and new light bulb may not be enough." It's not. A.E.P. seems to expect kudos for spending $1 billion to meet acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. That would be noble except for two key points. First, it's spending $1 billion of rate-payers' money, not its own. Second, it can meet the act's requirements at less than one-third that cost. As noted in the article, a key component lacking in all A.E.P. planning is commitment to any energy conservation programs. In fact, A.E.P. doesn't plan to distribute the e-lamp to its own customers. Central to A.E.P.'s compliance plan is building a scrubber at its Gavin plant. But there is an alternative plan -- including a combined strategy of energy conservation programs linked to reduced utilization of its high-emitting plants, fuel-switching at several other units and a small number of emission allowance purchases -- that would save consumers $820 million by 1999. The A.E.P. plan doesn't only hit consumers in their household budgets, it could also end up costing them their jobs. It is estimated that repercussions from the 3.9 percent rate increase (to pay for the $1 billion scrubber) include the loss of almost 7,000 jobs in the A.E.P. service territory. Our plan would save more than 5,500 jobs and raise rates only 1 percent. With all the negative economic impacts of the A.E.P. plan, one would think that it was a model of environmental planning. Not so. The scrubber plan, while reducing SO2 emissions, will create a 383-acre landfill of scrubber sludge, destroying 14 acres of wetlands. A.E.P. also expressed concern about present legislative trends toward reductions in CO2 emissions. It is ignoring a potential first step: Reducing utilization at high-emitting plants would cut all emissions -- SO2, NOx, CO2 and air toxics. This would be of much greater environmental benefit than over-controlling one pollutant -- SO2 -- while maintaining or actually increasing other pollutants. While a wildlife preserve is exciting, and the e-lamp shows promise, A.E.P. is missing the boat. Consumers and the environment are the big losers.

711-> C.D. Rates Down Slightly
Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit continued to ease slightly in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates. "The easing is entirely in the short-term accounts," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "The five-year certificate of deposit yields have been cautiously nudging upward for the past five weeks. Investors should not expect a quick rebound in rates like those that followed the bottom of previous down cycles. Any upturn is bound to be slow and sluggish at best." Among New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yield dropped 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent. Among savings institutions, money market account rates averaged 4.04 percent, off 2 points from a week ago. The steepest drop among money market accounts in banks in the New York area was at Emigrant Savings Bank, which lowered its rate on such accounts by 15 basis points. American Savings Bank had the sharpest drop in three-month certificates, with a cut of 10 points, while Banco Popular cut its six-month certificate by 16 points. The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area declined by relatively small amounts, down 2 points, to 3.60 percent for money market accounts, and down 2 points, to 3.85 percent, on six-month certificates. By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, the average rate was 3.96 percent and 4.08 percent, respectively.

712-> Dahmer Jurors Tell of Emotional Impact
After being bombarded for three weeks with graphic, relentless accounts of horrifying acts in the trial of the serial killer Jeffrey L. Dahmer, one of the jurors said the emotional toll finally became too much. "I dealt with it by leaving the room and crying," said Elba Duggins, who served on the jury that found on Saturday that Mr. Dahmer was sane when he killed and dismembered 15 men and boys. The ruling means that Mr. Dahmer will spend the rest of his life in a state prison. If he had been found insane, he would have been hospitalized in a state mental institution and eligible to petition for release every six months. For the jurors, testimony, which included descriptions of cannibalism and sex with corpses, posed such frightening and revolting images that two psychiatrists met with them afterward to give them an outlet to talk, cry or vent rage. "There's going to be irritability, sleeplessness," on the part of the jurors, said Dr. Roger Bell, a psychiatrist from the University of Louisville, who was hired by the State of Wisconsin to counsel the jurors. "But on the whole, they've handled it really well." Besides the horrifying accounts and photographs of dead bodies, the jurors spent day after day in the same room with Mr. Dahmer. They were urged by the prosecutor, E. Michael McCann, to look closely at the defendant. "Those hands strangled," he reminded them at one point. And the jurors could see the victims' families, whose incalculable pain showed on tear-stained faces, and the numbed, lost expression on the face of Mr. Dahmer's father. The psychiatrist said the jury had formed close bonds. Some referred to other jurors as family. "They became a real group," Dr. Bell said. "They provided a network of support for each other." As a handful of jurors spoke to reporters shortly after the verdict was announced, some of them appeared weary and a bit shaky. Ms. Duggins said it was helpful to meet with the therapists. "The talking, the sounding board -- it's always good," she said. On Monday at the sentencing, family members of the victims will get a chance to tell of the effects that the killings had on their lives. In determining whether Mr. Dahmer was sane, the jurors were instructed to decide two questions: Did he suffer from a mental disease? If so, was he able to comprehend the "wrongfulness" of his conduct, and could he have "conformed" to the law? After closing arguments on Friday afternoon, the jury was sequestered in a downtown hotel, where members ate dinner and decided they were too tired and drained to begin deliberations. When discussions began Saturday morning, seven jurors said they believed that Mr. Dahmer was sane; five said he was insane. The 12-member jury needed a consensus of 10 to reach a verdict. Despite their differences, there was no confrontation, no exchange of harsh words. "We all agreed there was a problem here," Ms. Duggins said. "It was whether or not we defined it as a disorder or a disease." At first, five jurors said they believed that Mr. Dahmer had such a mental disease. But three of them eventually joined the others who believed that Mr. Dahmer was a strange man, indeed, but that he knew what he was doing. Karl Stahle, who joined a handful of other jurors in speaking to reporters afterward, articulated the prevailing view. "Dahmer was a real con artist," he said. "He was even able to fool the police and almost get away with it. He was above average in intelligence. And if he had gotten loose that last time, he might still be out there doing it." Focusing on the Facts That view was a central tenet in the prosecutor's closing arguments, who told jurors, "He's fooled a lot of people; please, please don't let him fool you." But the jurors said the closing arguments played no role in their decision. Instead, they said the discussion turned on the facts of the case, especially Mr. Dahmer's apparent ability to cover his tracks after a murder. Nor were they affected by Mr. Dahmer's cool, controlled demeanor at the trial. "He had just one thing in his mind -- to satisfy his ego," Mr. Stahle said. "He didn't think about anyone else, or their feelings. He wasn't sick. He was smart." Russell Fenstermaker was one of two jurors who maintained that Mr. Dahmer had a mental disease. But he said he would not have found the defendant to be legally insane, since he believed that Mr. Dahmer could have controlled himself. Since a consensus of 10 found that Mr. Dahmer did not have a mental disease, the question of control was never formally addressed. During the trial, the jurors would focus on the facts in court. But in the evenings at the hotel, they were not allowed to discuss the case. "At night, we came together as friends," Ms. Duggins said. Mr. Stahle said he left the trial believing that he was a very lucky man. "I have a family to go home to," he said.

713-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MIDWEST; Memphis St. Tops Arkansas On a Freshman's Late Shot
David Vaughn followed his own miss with 8 seconds to play today, lifting Memphis State to an 82-80 upset over Arkansas in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Midwest Regional. Vaughn, a nephew of Coach Larry Finch, scored 26 points on 11-for-15 shooting for Memphis State (22-10), which beat Arkansas, ranked ninth by The Associated Press, for the second time in six weeks. Memphis State hadn't been in the final 16 since 1985. Lee Mayberry missed a long 3-pointer with 3 seconds left as Arkansas (26-8) continued its slide since reaching the Final Four in 1990. The Razorbacks, who had a 12-point second-half lead, lost in the round of eight last year. Good Day for Backup Darrell Hawkins, a backup, had 22 points for Arkansas, including two free throws that made it 80-80 with 55.3 seconds left. On its next possession, Memphis State worked the 45-second clock near expiration before Vaughn took a 16-foot jumper that hit the rim and came off. The freshman then chased down the rebound and put in the winner. Vaughn scored the final 6 points for Memphis State, which was playing without its top ballhandlers, Anfernee Hardaway and Tony Madlock, who had fouled out. Todd Day, a Memphis native who wanted to atone for Arkansas' 92-88 loss at Memphis State on Feb. 8, scored 14 points on 5-for-7 shooting, including three 3-pointers, in the opening 4 minutes 53 seconds as the Razorbacks took a 19-6 lead. But he missed the only three other shots he attempted, committed five turnovers and fouled out with 6:48 to go. The game marked the end of the careers for Day, Mayberry and center Oliver Miller, all of whom are expected to be taken in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft. The trio combined for 36 points on 15-for-35 shooting in their finale. The Tigers trailed by 50-38 early in the second half and 64-56 with 8:33 left when Billy Smith hit his first of two 3-pointers down the stretch. Smith followed with a steal and dunk to cut the deficit to 3 points. After Hawkins made a free throw to put Arkansas ahead, 67-63, Vaughn sank two foul shots and Smith made another 3-pointer to give Memphis State its first lead, 68-67, with 6:28 remaining. The Tigers built their lead to 76-70 before Hawkins, who averages 6.3 points and had a career-high of 14, rallied Arkansas back to a tie. In the first half, Arkansas wasn't able to pull away despite Memphis State's 16 turnovers -- partly because the Razorbacks gave away the ball 11 times themselves. The Tigers, who finished with 23 turnovers, had only 10 in the Feb. 8 meeting. Texas-El Paso Advances DAYTON, Ohio, March 21 (AP) -- Johnny Melvin scored the go-ahead basket and Eddie Rivera added a short jumper to rally Texas-El Paso (26-6) to a 55-50 opening-round victory over Evansville on Friday night. "El Paso's defense was excellent," the Evansville coach, Jim Crews, said. "They took the angles away. They had a good insurance policy with David Van Dyke back there to block shots. They also recovered well when the pass came out so we couldn't get good shots." Melvin scored on a spinning move around 7-foot-1-inch center Sascha Hupmann with 2:50 to go, putting Texas-El Paso ahead, 51-50, after it had trailed by as many as 9 points midway through the second half. After Mark Hisle and Todd Cochenour missed long jumpers for Evansville, Texas-El Paso gained possession and worked time off the clock before Marion Maxey missed a layup. But Texas-El Paso regained possession on a tie-up under the basket and got a new 45 seconds on the shot clock. The Miners worked the ball around the perimeter before Rivera slashed to the right side of the lane and hit a 13-footer for a 3-point lead with 26.2 seconds left. Although needing 3 points for the tie, Evansville took the ball inside to Hupmann, who missed a short jumper with five seconds to go.

717-> After a Brush With Death, Wallace Leaves the Hospital
After surviving a life-threatening illness, former Gov. George C. Wallace today left Jackson Hospital here, where he had been under treatment for nearly a month. Mr. Wallace, 73 years old, was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 25 and only hours later was listed in critical condition, suffering from septic shock, a usually fatal disorder caused by an overwhelming infection to his blood system. At one point his heart stopped, and doctors had to revive him. Today the four-term Governor, who must use a wheelchair as a result of an assassination attempt 20 years ago, paused briefly and smiled to reporters outside the hospital before being loaded into his van, which took him home.

718-> Officials Reportedly Balked Over Subpoenas on B.C.C.I.
Documents show that Justice Department officials denied a request from the United States Attorney's office in Miami to enforce subpoenas in several countries against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, NBC News reported today. NBC said it had obtained internal Justice Department documents indicating "possible foot-dragging" last year by Federal prosecutors in the B.C.C.I. case to protect United States allies in the Persian Gulf. The ruling family of the Persian Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi owns 77 percent of B.C.C.I. NBC said that the Justice Department had denied there were any improper delays and that the Department had said it had approved subpoenas where it found them appropriate. Earlier Guilty Plea B.C.C.I. pleaded guilty to Federal racketeering charges earlier this year and agreed to forfeit a record $550 million in United States assets. NBC said the documents show that the then-acting United States Attorney in Miami, Dexter Lehtinen, wrote last year to the head of Justice's Criminal Division seeking permission to enforce subpoenas against B.C.C.I. in nine countries. NBC said letters show that the Justice Department at first denied Mr. Lehtinen's request entirely, then eventually permitted subpoenas in only two countries. The countries were not specified. Mr. Lehtinen, whose nomination to become Miami's United States Attorney was twice rebuffed by the Senate, is scheduled to appear Thursday morning before a committee investigating the B.C.C.I. affair. In another letter written last year, it appears that the acting Attorney General at the time, William P. Barr, directed Mr. Lehtinen not to indict B.C.C.I. and five bank officials just one day before a money-laundering indictment was to be handed up, NBC said. The indictment was not approved by the Justice Department until three months later, according to NBC. Mr. Barr replaced Dick Thornburgh as Attorney General late last year. Mr. Lehtinen, who also oversaw the Government's prosecution of the deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, resigned in January.

719-> Top G.M. Executives Took Pay Cut in '91
Officers and top executives of the General Motors Corporation suffered a 36 percent pay cut in 1991, according to the auto maker's 1991 proxy statement, which was published today. G.M. directors, who replaced G.M.'s president last week and removed Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive, as head of the board's executive committee, also sliced executive pay. The company, which lost $4.5 billion in 1991 -- the worst loss in American corporate history -- said the "reduced level of compensation for G.M.'s entire officer group in 1991 reflected another year of declining business conditions and lower corporate results." The United Automobile Workers union, which has criticized G.M. in the past for raising executive salaries while workers were laid off, this year gave it grudging credit that it had "tempered" executive compensation. But the union said in a statement that executive salaries were "still out of line -- way out of line." Mr. Stempel, 58 years old, was G.M.'s highest-paid executive, receiving $1 million in salary. Mr. Stempel also received $33,333 from G.M. as part of a savings stock program. Mr. Stempel's pay was down 31 percent from $1.44 million in 1990. In 1989, a performance incentive pushed his compensation to $1.78 million. Also last year, Mr. Stempel received stock options covering 100,000 shares, at an exercise price of $40 a share. G.M. shares closed today at $39 each, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Lloyd E. Reuss, who had been president before the board demoted him to executive vice president last week, received $725,000, down 28 percent from just over $1 million the year before. Mr. Reuss, 55, was replaced as president by John F. Smith Jr. Mr. Smith, 54, earned $575,000 last year, down 26 percent from $779,000 in 1990. G.M.'s top seven executives earned $4.38 million in 1991, down 42 percent from $7.51 million in 1990 and down 61 percent from $11.26 million in 1989. Over all, G.M.'s top 57 officers and executives earned $14.81 million, down 36 percent from the $23.27 million they were paid in 1990. Last week, the Ford Motor Company, which reported a record loss for 1991 of nearly $2.3 billion, said its chairman, Harold A. Poling, took a 6.6 percent pay cut, earning $1.14 million in salary and compensation.

720-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; New York Ballot Rules and State Party Help Clear Bush's Path
There is no Republican primary in New York State today, because Patrick J. Buchanan could not overcome the arduous requirements of the state's election law as well as an all-out mobilization by the Republican State Committee to make sure President Bush faced no opposition. Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, has scaled back his campaign, and his absence from the New York ballot is a boon to Mr. Bush. The lack of a primary means the President has been spared money, staff time and the prospect of wading through the same contentious political scene that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California have been attempting to negotiate on the Democratic side. "New York, being the media capital of the world, is not the place to have a divisive primary with someone like Pat Buchanan, who does a great job with the press," said William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman. The shutting out of Mr. Buchanan did not happen by accident. It came as a result of what is generally described as the most exclusionary election law in the country and the sophistication that the state Republican Party, considered a laughing stock less than two years ago, used in employing the law to protect the interests of the President. Although Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan could enter the primaries in many other states simply by paying a filing fee, in New York they each had to collect 1,250 signatures in each of 34 Congressional districts in a period of roughly five weeks to field a full slate of delegates around the state. This can be exceedingly difficult in heavily Democratic districts, like those covering the South Bronx and most of Brooklyn, and in sprawling upstate districts where, in the words of one Republican leader, "there are more cows than people." Mr. Powers, who became chairman of the state committee 15 months ago after a disastrous campaign for governor by the Republicans, organized the state apparatus for the petition gathering period, which began Dec. 31 and ended the first week in February. Being first out of the gate is crucial. Once a Republican voter signs one candidate's petition, the voter cannot sign a petition for another candidate. This gave the President a leg up on Mr. Buchanan, who declared his candidacy in November and whose forces in the state were in disarray until well into the petitioning season, said Arthur W. Thompson, a Nassau County Republican who assumed control of the operation for Mr. Buchanan in January. Several facts worked against Mr. Buchanan. The New York primary is being held earlier in April this year than it was in 1988, and the petition season ended before the New Hampshire primary, where Mr. Buchanan collected nearly 40 percent of the vote and substantial voter enthusiasm that spread beyond the state. Democrats entertained the idea of waiving some of New York's restrictive election laws in early March to help former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who was then still officially in the race on the Democratic side, but whose petitions were deemed to be vulnerable. Mr. Bush's team turned in about 140,000 signatures. Mr. Buchanan's campaign said it collected thousands but did not bother to turn them in when it was clear they were far short. In the end, said Angela Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan's sister and adviser, "it was a financial decision on our part" to abandon the fight to get on the New York ballot. The only way the campaign believed it could possibly qualify was to hire a consultant for $1 a petition signature, or roughly $50,000, when the money was sorely needed in New Hampshire, she said.

721-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Citing Rift With Board, Head of Sealy Resigns
Malcolm Candlish, the executive hired to run the Sealy Corporation after its leveraged buyout in 1989, said yesterday that he was resigning. Mr. Candlish, chairman, president and chief executive of the nation's largest mattress company, said that "differences in management philosophy and style have developed" since the First Boston Corporation took control of the company and its board last year. He said the differences "have impacted my ability to fully and actively manage the company." Mr. Candlish, 56, said he planned to remain with the Cleveland-based company until the end of the year. His successor is likely to come from outside the company, he said, and a search firm has been hired to look for a replacement. As for his own plans, he expressed confidence that he would find another job by the end of the year. Mr. Candlish and First Boston differ on "the role of management versus the role of the board," he said. "It's a question of who does what and where the responsibility lies in getting things done." First Boston, which through an affiliate controls four of the seven board seats, declined to commment of Mr. Candlish's resignation. But Robert B. Calhoun, a Sealy board member affiliated with First Boston, said, "We are disappointed in Mr. Candlish's decision and appreciate his willingness to assist in the transition period." Mr. Candlish, a former chief executive of the Samsonite Corporation, was hired by Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, the investment banking firm that acquired Sealy in 1989 for $1.1 billion. First Boston had made a large bridge loan to Gibbons, Green, which was unable to arrange permanent financing after the buyout, leaving First Boston stuck with the debt. In a restructuring completed in November, First Boston exchanged its debt in the company for equity. It now owns 93.6 percent of Sealy and is expected eventually to take the company public. Mr. Candlish said he would be leaving Sealy in an excellent financial and market position. For the three months ended Feb. 29, Sealy posted its first profitable quarter since the buyout. The company had sales of $148 million, an increase of 8 percent over the comparable period last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation -- considered a good way to measure the earnings strength of a leveraged buyout -- increased more than 30 percent for the quarter, to $20.5 million.

722-> Valerie Jacobson Weds J. J. Kelleher
Valerie Lynn Jacobson, the daughter of Beverly and Donald Jacobson of Lake Mohegan, N.Y., was married yesterday evening to Joseph John Kelleher, a son of Helen Kelleher of Ramsey, N.J., and the late Michael Kelleher. The Rev. Rick Nelson, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Colonial Terrace in Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., with Rabbi Joseph Gelberman attending. Mrs. Kelleher, 27 years old, is an associate in the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. She is a Johns Hopkins University graduate and received a law degree cum laude from Fordham University, as did her husband. Her father is the general counsel to Pergament Home Centers in Melville, L.I. Her mother is a vice president of the Bank of New York in White Plains. Mr. Kelleher, 29, is an associate in the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in New York. He graduated from the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture. His mother is a legal assistant in New York for the American Bureau of Shipping, which sets standards for ships and offshore drilling rigs. His father was a Department of Sanitation worker in New York.

723-> AIDS Research Cuts Seen
The Bush Administration's proposed spending on AIDS research, though larger than this year's allocation, would force some cuts in research, according to a top health official. "Scientifically, we're not able to do everything we feel is justified," said the official, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, associate director for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Fauci offered this assessment Monday at a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on health and the environment. The Administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1993 recommends $873 million in AIDS research spending by the N.I.H., well below the nearly $1.2 billion level sought by the agency. The current appropriation is $841 million. Total Government spending on AIDS research is larger, however. Work done by other Federal agencies pushes the figure to $1.5 billion, Dr. Fauci said. Under questioning by committee Democrats, Dr. Fauci said the proposed spending would mean a reduction in some N.I.H. research teams and programs and "certainly will slow down" work toward a cure. Nevertheless, he said he expected to begin efficacy trials of one or more possible vaccines by the end of 1993. Mr. Bush's budget proposal came under attack from subcommittee chairman Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, who said the President asked the National Commission on AIDS last year what more he could do to fight AIDS. "If the President really wants to know what more he can do, he could begin by asking his own N.I.H. scientists." Mr. Waxman said.

724-> Baseball; Tartabull May Be Put On the Disabled List
The injury news continued to be alarming for the Yankees today when they revealed that Danny Tartabull might be placed on the 15-day disabled list Friday because of a pulled hamstring in his left leg. The $25.5 million player has already been restricted to designated-hitter status this season because of a sprained right wrist. Tartabull injured the hamstring in the seventh inning against Cleveland Monday as he raced from first to third on Randy Velarde's single. He will be examined in New York Thursday and will most likely have a magnetic resonance imaging procedure to determine the extent of his most recent injury. If the diagnosis is severe enough to warrant extensive rest, the Yankees will put him on the disabled list Friday and the move would be retroactive to Tuesday. Tartabull understands that Manager Buck Showalter cannot continue to operate with only 24 players and is aware the examination could provide him with an unexpected rest until May 6. "If there is an injury, he has got to do something about the roster," said Tartabull before the Yankees-White Sox game tonight at Comiskey Park. "Right now, I can't even run." Tartabull said he has trouble walking because of the tight hamstring and conceded he would not be surprised if he were placed on the disabled list. Showalter said it is possible Tartabull would be sidelined and added, "We want to get both of the injuries well." The Yankees would like to get their injured players well quickly, but that prospect is slim because the list of hurt players is growing longer. Mike Gallego has not played yet this season because of a bruised right heel, Pat Kelly is on the disabled list with a sprained ligament in his left thumb, Scott Kamieniecki is coming back from cervical disk surgery, Don Mattingly's back always has to be watched closely and several players have recently been weakened by a virus. But Tartabull's injury occupied the spotlight today because of his huge five-year contract, his powerful bat and his previous reputation of constantly having nagging injuries. Tartabull has averaged only 132 games during his last six years and has been on the disabled list three times in three seasons. He is not thrilled about the possibility of another visit there. "I try not to think about it," said Tartabull, who is hitting .308 in 12 games with 1 home run and 10 runs batted in. "It only frustrates me more than I already am. I want to play. I want to be out there now." As Tartabull limped out of the trainer's room at Comiskey Park today, he did not look in condition to play baseball. The hamstring was massaged, given muscle stimulation and ultrasound and bathed in a whirlpool. He gingerly participated in batting practice today and swung easily at the pitches. First, Tartabull hurt his wrist diving for a fly ball in spring training and now he injured his hamstring while running the bases. Tartabull's hustle was commendable, but it may wind up giving him an unwanted 15-day break. Before the game, Tartabull desperately tried to wish the latest injury away. "I just wake up every day," he said, "and hope it's gone."

725-> BASEBALL; Optimistic Mets Have Hopes of Saving Their Relievers
The Mets in 1991 would look to their bullpen and the relievers would stare at each other. The uncertainties in the dugout would often lead to the following exchange of uncertainties in the bullpen. "Who me?" "Not now." "No way." And so as often as not, when the games were coming apart for the Mets last season, their call for arms was too regularly a cry in the dark. The sad, searing images are hard to delete from the memory: John Franco, after repeated failures, entering one more deadlocked game in a slow trot and amid growing apprehension; Jeff Innis, having pitched the prior two days, being summoned to enter yet another game in the second inning; Doug Simons, the underaged and overmatched lefty, turning on the mound to follow the flight of an Eddie Murray home run. An underappreciated Al Pena traded off for a minor leaguer, Tony Castillo. "I look around now, though, and I see the makings of a quality, defined bullpen," said Innis. "It's a comforting sight." A Structured Abandon Manager Jeff Torborg shares that perspective, and he has at least publicly pledged to employ his bullpen with a structured abandon, unconcerned by the egos of his highly paid, highly competitive starters. He sees in Franco an experienced closer, in the recently acquired Paul Gibson the capable, durable lefty the organization has sought since 1990, in Tim Burke a professional setup man, in Wally Whitehurst and Innis the kind of flexible arms that can adapt to a variety of assignments. "It was clear that a lot of guys didn't know what their roles were there last season," said Whitehurst in something of an understatement. Some Rough Edges Left How Torborg deploys his relievers and copes with his starters stands to be an early and enduring challenge for the man who has managed only in the American League. His aggressive use of relievers was a function of his never having to pinch-hit for them. It will be intriguing, too, to observe Torborg consoling an overheated David Cone after he has hooked him in the sixth inning. "I told the starters, I don't care who gets the win," said Torborg. "That's not an easy sell for the starters, but that's what I do. I like to go to the bullpen. I like the fresh arm and playing the percentages with right-handed and left-handed pitchers." There are, however, rough edges to what on paper may seem like a polished bullpen. Burke, after being a central figure in the collapse of the Mets in July and August, rediscovered his sinker during the season's final month. He has to demonstrate that those September numbers -- four earned runs over his last 32 2/3 innings -- are the true reflection of his ability. "I had never learned how to throw a sinker; the one I'd been using my whole career was a natural one that I held and fired without much thought or sophistication," said Burke. "I learned another, with a different grip and different release, and the difference was large." Whitehurst, after his abject decline as a starter over the second half of the season, will have to acclimate himself to the routines and reduced spotlight of the bullpen. "I think I can have an effective role there," said Whitehurst, who has been listed in the race for the fifth starter's job more out of courtesy than conviction. Need Franco's Help Gibson, whose breathtaking falloff during the course of last season was attributed to overuse and fatigue, must dispel the doubts cast by left-handered batters who hit .345 against him in 1991. And above all else, the Mets need Franco to be sharp and steady as he was in 1990, and to shed the emotional hangover of a disorientingly dismal 1991. "The closer is the foundation of all bullpens," said Burke. "John Franco can be a great foundation to start from." It remains to be seen what will happen when the season begins and the telephone rings in the bullpen. The hope is that the pitchers won't have to guess who's being summoned and that the Mets won't have to guess what kind of a performance is in the offing. INSIDE PITCH BOBBY BONILLA, the club's most glamorous off-season acquisition, will not report here until Thursday because of the recent death of a brother-in-law. He will thus miss the first workout for the entire club. . . . Shortstop KEVIN ELSTER termed the recent discomfort in his right shoulder the result of a strength test and "not an important kind of discomfort."

727-> Cuttings; For Window Boxes, a Change Of Pace (No Impatiens)
Everybody's been asking lately: "What can I plant in my window boxes and containers? What can I use besides geraniums and that vine that trails down. . . . What's it called?" Trailing vinca. Ick. I have the same warm feeling for New Guinea impatiens. For all impatiens, in fact, except for white. And that chunky dusty miller, too. If I never see another window box of geraniums and trailing vinca and deep pink and purple impatiens "accented" with chunky dusty miller, I will give up all alcohol and caffeine. I will go to church. I will give all my money to the first compost society that can balance its books. Now for a few suggestions to get everybody going, including myself. No matter how big or small your garden is, containers grouped about a doorway or gate -- or an old-fashioned window box spilling over with plants (they don't have to have garish colors) -- are definitely homey. The sight of this welcomes the weary traveler. It says, "Here is a place where the denizens see beauty in the small things." Where you might be offered a seat in a sunny room and talked into a bowl of fresh cucumber soup with dill. And crusty bread. And your choice of sun-brewed herb tea or a bracing gin and tonic with mint from the garden, instead of lime. I like the idea of seasonal plantings. Midspring, for instance, is the time for wide pots of red tulips and blue forget-me-nots. Or cream-colored tulips and blue-black pansies. Or a smaller pot full of early crocuses or species tulips, and something to set them off, like hardy thyme, that could fall gracefully over the sides. I saw something like this in "Seasonal Container Gardening" by Kathleen Brown (Penguin, $30), a good book to browse through for ideas. Here's one of Ms. Brown's suggestions for a window box that blooms from January through mid-May: In the winter Erica carnea Springwood White, or winter-flowering heath, begins to bloom, complemented a bit later by the fragrant yellow dwarf iris, Iris danfordiae, and the golden foliage of Erica arborea Estrella Gold, which looks like a tiny gold tree. Still later there will be crocus, anemone and narcissus. There is also, I hate to say, a little vinca spilling over the sides, but it's the hardy periwinkle type: Vinca minor Alba (because of its white flowers) and Vinca minor Aureo-variegata (blue flowers). It looks nice with these exotica. As spring rolls in, the heath produces cascades of full bloom. The crocuses, Crocus chrysanthus Blue Pearl (actually white with pink edges), open and the white and blue vinca bloom. Then come the white and blue daisylike blossoms of anemone blanda, pale yellow Double Campernelle narcissus and the more delicate Narcissus tazetta Minnow. The book also describes a great hanging basket: bright yellow Prince John violas mixed with Peach Blossom tulips and pink Dresden China daisies. You may not be able to find such plants in your local nursery and will have to substitute. But next year, order the bulbs you will need for your spring containers. And try your own combinations, of course, inspired by the luscious catalogues. In January, order the seeds of unusual pansies and violas and such to start indoors. (Do you begin to see why so many people settle for dull old geraniums and impatiens?) Now then, for summer. Sometimes the simple things can be the most striking. Like big pots of deep blue or white agapanthus, the African lily. The flower stalks rise two feet over the lilylike leaves, bearing umbels of bell-shaped flowers. Plant two or three in well-drained soil, with plenty of sun. They look very noble set by a doorway. Another possibility for shady spots is a pot of nothing but mophead hydrangeas. I used to dislike these big bosomy blossoms, but now I think of them as voluptuous opera singers. They are at their best singing solo in a shady, moist place. For the hot and dry places, how about a pot of white marguerites? The simplicity of their sharply cut petals and yellow centers is as cooling as iced tea on the porch. I saw a great window box at the Philadelphia Flower Show: nothing but Rosmarinus officinalis prostratus, a blue-green low-lying rosemary with white stems that set off the weathered wood of the box and the gray shingles of the fisherman's shack behind it to perfection. The tiny yard was planted in other herbs, set off here and there with lavender and white evergreen candytuft. A clamshell path curved up to the door. It was simple and enormously satisfying, and it told much about the imaginary person who lived inside. If you are a farmer at heart you might consider an ornamental arrangement you can eat, like purple cabbages planted with violas and white sweet williams. Jim Wilson's "Landscaping With Container Plants" (Houghton Mifflin, $35) shows such a combination at Calla way Gardens in Pine Mountain, Ga. Mr. Wilson also suggests putting heat-lovers together, like rudbeckia with dwarf salvia, moss roses and sweet alyssum. And there's a picture of a pot of pale green lady's-mantle and ivy-leaved geraniums -- whose blooms tend to be more delicate than the puffball types -- that makes me retract my mean remarks about them. I love the fragrant ones, actually, and it's nice to put these where people will brush past them. So even if it snows this weekend, go to the nurseries and see what's there. And there's plenty of time for ordering fast-growing annuals, like morning glories and nasturtiums, which look wonderful spilling out of window boxes. And don't forget to add a moonflower or two, for a haunting fragrance at night.

728-> BASEBALL; First Results Are In: Morris Wins For Jays and Twins Top Brewers
Sooner or later, Jack Morris was bound to give up a run. Morris, who finished last year with the most memorable shutout in World Series history, started this season with eight more scoreless innings this afternoon. He made his debut for Toronto a winning one, pitching a five-hitter and leading the Blue Jays past the Detroit Tigers, 4-2, in the first game of 1992. Cecil Fielder and Rob Deer hit homers in the ninth inning against Detroit's former ace. But this time Morris did not need a shutout, as he did in Game 7 of the World Series, when he pitched a 10-inning, seven-hitter that gave Minnesota a 1-0 victory over Atlanta and gave him the most valuable player award. Morris, who became a free agent soon after the Series and signed with Toronto for $10.85 million for two years, was pitching for his third team in three seasons. The Blue Jays got him to be their ace, and that he was. Record-Tying Start Morris struck out seven, walked three and was in trouble just once before the ninth. He made his record 13th consecutive opening day start -- breaking a tie with Tom Seaver and Robin Roberts -- and threw his sixth season-starting complete game. Pat Borders hit a two-run homer and John Olerud also connected off Bill Gullickson. Dave Winfield, also playing his first game for Toronto, went 3 for 4, and drove in 1992's first run with a first-inning single. The Tigers threatened in the second when they loaded the bases with two outs, but Morris struck out Milt Cuyler on a checked swing. Last year, in Morris's first game back in Tiger Stadium after 13 seasons in Detroit, Cuyler hit a grand slam to key a rout. Gullickson, one of only four 20-game winners last season, lost the first opening-day start of his 10-year career. He gave up three runs on eight hits and walked one in six innings. The Blue Jays got to Gullickson early. Roberto Alomar, the second batter, doubled and scored on Winfield's two-out single. Winfield's third consecutive hit, an infield single in the fifth, was No. 2,700 in his 20-year career. Borders Is Heard From In the fourth, Borders, who started the 1991 season with an 0-for-21 slump and didn't hit his first homer until July 30, hit a homer over the right-field fence. Olerud connected into the second deck in center to lead off the sixth. Rookie Derek Bell singled home Kelly Gruber, who had doubled off Mark Leiter, in the eighth. Fielder, who led the majors with 51 home runs in 1990 and tied for the lead with 44 last season, opened the ninth with an opposite-field drive to right center. The homer did not seem to bother Morris, who cracked a smile as Fielder chugged around the bases. Deer, who had struck out in his three previous times at bat, hit a homer with two outs. Twins 4, Brewers 2 MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch, last season's rookie of the year, was the star of opening day for the Minnesota Twins. Knoblauch's fourth single of the game scored Greg Gagne with the go-ahead run in the ninth inning as the Twins opened the defense of their world championship . Gagne opened the inning with a single off reliever Edwin Nunez (0-1) and moved to second on Shane Mack's grounder. Knoblauch followed with a line single to center to score Gagne, who beat Robin Yount's throw to the plate. Kirby Puckett, who earlier hit a two-run homer, then doubled to right-center field to chase Nunez. A sacrifice fly by Luis Quinones off James Austin scored Knoblauch. Twins reliever Carl Willis (1-0) pitched one and one-third hitless innings for the victory and Rick Aguilera got the last three outs for the save. Aguilera had 42 saves in 1991. The Twins stunned the baseball world last season by moving from last place to first to win the American League West. They beat Toronto in the playoffs and won a memorable seven-game World Series against Atlanta. The loss spoiled Phil Garner's debut as Brewers manager. Minnesota starter Scott Erickson, a 20-game winner last season but slowed by elbow problems in the second half, had a 2-0 lead on Puckett's homer but couldn't hold it. He gave up a run in the fifth and another in the seventh. A sellout crowd of 52,470 watched the Brewers open a season at home for the first time in five years. Vice President Dan Quayle threw out the first pitch.

730-> 3 AFGHAN FACTIONS BACK PEACE PLAN
Three moderate Afghan guerrilla groups today backed a United Nations peace initiative to end the 13-year Afghan war, a plan already rejected by radical rebel factions. The three groups issued a statement describing the United Nations initiative as the "most appropriate option under the present conditions" for a peaceful settlement of the civil war. The plan calls for convening an assembly of all parties to form an interim government in Afghanistan. The three moderate guerrilla organizations are led by Sibghatullah Mojadidi, Ahmad Gailani and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi. The four radical Islamic guerrilla groups based in Pakistan suffered a setback last week when the Pakistani Government, the conduit for Western arms for the guerrillas, threw its weight behind the United Nations plan. Three of the radical factions have rejected the peace initiative as a conspiracy to deny them power. A fourth group criticizes it as vague but has not rejected it outright. U.N. Is Hopeful The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, wants about 150 representatives of all sides in Afghanistan to hold the assembly to choose the interim government, prepare for it to take power, end the civil war and schedule elections. Mr. Ghali's special envoy on Afghanistan, Benon Sevan, said on Friday that his talks with guerrilla leaders based in Pakistan had improved the chances of a settlement. The United Nations released a statement saying Mr. Sevan was confident that concerns expressed by some rebel leaders could be resolved "and the chances for a political settlement to this 13-year-old conflict are looking brighter than ever." The United Nations peace initiative started gaining momentum last September, when the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to end arms shipments to the two sides in the civil war by the end of the year. Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, but withdrew 10 years later after meeting with stiff resistance from the American-backed guerrillas. Bereft of its former backers in Moscow, the Afghan Government called in November for peace talks to bring a solution to the war.

732-> Officer Kills Theft Suspect
A 21-year-old man who had helped two other men steal a car at gunpoint in Brooklyn late last night was shot to death by one of two detectives who happened upon the scene, the police said. The suspect, who was not immediately identified, was shot in the neck and pronounced dead at the scene, at Knickerbocker Avenue and Troutman Street in Bushwick, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Ed Burns. A man who had been in the car at the time of the robbery, at about 11:50 P.M., was shot several times by one of the thieves, Sergeant Burns said. The man was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital where he was in serious but stable condition, Sergeant Burns said. The two other men fled in the car, he said.

Top-seeded Monica Seles has sprained her wrist and will not compete in the Family Circle Magazine Cup tournament here this week, officials said today. Seles was injured while riding her bicycle in Florida on Saturday, the tournament officials said in a statement. Seles will wear a soft cast for three to four days, they said. Gabriela Sabatini, the tournament's defending champion, took over the top seeding as a result of Seles's injury. Martina Navratilova, who won the tournament two years ago, is now seeded second. The tournament begins Monday and runs through Sunday.

734-> If Fire Strikes, Climbing Is Better Than Jumping
When the house is on fire, a fast exit is the key to survival. The first few moments offer the best chance for escape. That is why fire prevention experts recommend that families conduct fire drills at least twice a year. "You should know the routine so well that you would follow it automatically even if you were barely awake," said John Ottoson, a senior analyst with the United States Fire Administration in Emmitsburg, Md. The Fire Administration is a Federal agency charged with reducing the number of injuries and deaths caused by fire. This usually means being prepared to get out of any room two ways, either through a door or a window. Homes with a second or third story should be equipped with escape ladders that can be hung quickly from a windowsill. Best Ladders Have Stand-Offs The best escape ladders, fire experts say, are those with stand-offs, which are attachments that hold the rungs away from the exterior wall to allow for easier climbing. One such is Redi-Exit, from the Karsulyn Corporation in Lewisberry, Pa., a sturdy aluminum ladder available in 11 sizes ranging from 8 feet to 18 feet. It bolts permanently to the outside of the house. When not in use, it folds vertically to look like a drainpipe. A lever at the top of the ladder allows it to be opened rapidly, like an accordion. The only drawback might be security; an intruder could use such a ladder to climb into an upper-story window. But company officials say the Redi-Exit cannot be unfolded from the bottom, and is as difficult to climb in its folded mode as a drainpipe would be. A basic Redi-Exit kit costs $500. It comes with installation hardware and instructions. There is also a deluxe model for around $2,500; it provides emergency lighting that is turned on automatically by a smoke detector when a fire breaks out. The same automatic feature opens the ladder and activates a siren to alert neighbors. More Conventional Designs Redi-Exit is only available through suppliers to the building trade or from the manufacturer; telephone (800) 932-3948. There are also more conventional ladders. Exitable, for example, a collapsible aluminum and steel ladder from G.A.M.A Inc. of Worcester, Mass., was selected by Consumer Reports magazine as the sturdiest collapsible escape ladder and the easiest to use. Consumer Reports rated escape ladders in October 1991. The Exitable sells for $115. A less expensive alternative is a chain ladder with rigid metal rungs like the one from MLM Machine and Metal Products of Brooklyn, which sells for around $30. It was rated just below the Exitable by Consumer Reports. Still another is the tangle-free rope ladder with rigid plastic rungs offered by Dial Safety Ladder Corporation of Los Angeles. It costs $60 to $110, depending on length. The Exitable, MLM and Dial ladders all have the stand-off feature. All three are available at many hardware stores and home centers.

735-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries; CLINTON AND BROWN MAKE LAST APPEALS FOR NEW YORK VOTE
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California made their final impassioned appeals yesterday in a New York primary campaign that is virtually certain to shape the race for the Democratic nomination as well as both of their political futures. Mr. Clinton, battling to regain his status as the party's presumptive nominee, returned to the central themes of his campaign yesterday, pleading with voters to set aside any misgivings about his character and give him a chance to lead. "I have lived a lifetime of commitment and service," he said as he stormed through New York before heading on to Wisconsin and Kansas, which also hold primaries today. Underdog's Rallying Cry Mr. Brown, hoping to prove that his upset victory in Connecticut two weeks ago was merely the first rumbling of an angry electorate turning his way, urged New Yorkers yesterday to "send a powerful message: Get off the dime, Washington! We want a country that works for all of us." Echoing the rallying cry of his underdog campaign, the former California Governor declared: "Take it back, America! Take it back!" The voting today in New York, with its rich prize of 244 delegates, has come to be seen as a referendum on Mr. Clinton's long-term viability and his ability to prevail over several character issues. Tsongas, and the Draft The campaign wound down with some crucial unknowns, notably the strength of the support for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who suspended his faltering campaign three weeks ago but remains on the ballot. He says he may return to the contest depending on what happens here today. Also unclear in these final hours was the effect of the latest round of news reports about Mr. Clinton's status during the Vietnam War, which critics said raised new questions about his candor in discussing his draft history. Mr. Clinton had neglected to disclose that he had received a draft induction letter shortly before he sought a deferment by joining a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit in Arkansas. But he insisted again yesterdaythat it was not a material omission. For his part, Mr. Brown has hardly emerged unscathed from the past two weeks of what many saw as a classic New York primary: rough, unpredictable and often mean. His policy proposals, notably his support for a flat tax to replace the progressive income tax system, have drawn new scrutiny and fire. And his anti-politician persona has been tarnished by a new focus on his record as Governor of California and his long history as a politician. The New York primary has been driven, in many ways, by the complicated demographics of this state. Mr. Clinton's campaign advisers hope to base a winning coalition in part on Jewish and black voters, although Mr. Brown has fiercely competed for black support here. In the Democratic Presidential primary four years ago, Jewish voters accounted for 25 percent of the vote statewide, while blacks accounted for 24 percent, a turnout that analysts say was swelled by the presence of the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the ballot. Mr. Brown's efforts to court Jewish voters were stymied by his embrace of Mr. Jackson as his choice of running mate. Because of his 1984 characterization of New York as "Hymietown," Mr. Jackson remains unpopular with many Jewish voters. Vote for a Loser In general, Mr. Brown has offered himself as a ready vehicle for those who wish to send a message and stop Mr. Clinton, whom he described yesterday as "the anointed one." Emblematic of his strategy, the former California Governor urged New Yorkers yesterday to vote for Mr. Tsongas if they could not vote for him. He later explained, "Anybody who's not going to vote for me, please vote for someone who's not going to win." Mr. Clinton also campaigned yesterday in Wisconsin, which was considered fertile ground for Mr. Brown, but politicians and polls reported a competitive race in recent days. Wisconsin has 82 delegates at stake today, while Kansas has 36. Mr. Clinton is far and away the leader in delegates, with 1,118, more than half the 2,145 needed for the nomination. Mr. Brown has 175. The two men spent their final day in New York in a characteristic style for this campaign, beginning it with some tough exchanges on television. On the NBC program "Today," Mr. Brown escalated his attack on Mr. Clinton for golfing at an Arkansas country club that has no black members, asserting it was "a product of the old-boy network." Mr. Clinton -- who at one point told Mr. Brown, "Don't scream, Jerry" -- asserted, "Jerry Brown knows I'm not a racist, he knows that in the South I've fought for equal opportunity." The encounter, typical of recent days, suggested the Zen-like wisdom of Mr. Tsongas's sidelines strategy, which has preserved him from attacks, debates, negative television advertisements and any requirement to make promises and act like a politician. As Mr. Brown said, "If you stand on the sideline, you increasingly look better as the other two candidates get closer to the 15th round." After a more subdued encounter on "Donahue," the two men fanned out on their own final search for votes. Mr. Brown, who spent the entire day in New York, said at a rally in Albany that his campaign had one goal: "To galvanize the moral energy to rededicate America to social and economic justice." He also made a few promises. "I will promise you that before the decade is out I will move people from one end of Manhattan to Long Island in 20 minutes on a clean, American-built transportation system," he said. Mr. Clinton dashed around the country, appearing at an afternoon rally at Syracuse University before flying to the Midwest. He sought to cast himself as the authentic candidate of change, and argued that young voters had the power to "choose a different future than the path we're on." His campaign began broadcasting new commercials that proudly listed the newspaper endorsements the Governor has received, as well as a new radio spot affirming his commitment to abortion rights. For his part, Mr. Brown was broadcasting a 60-second television commercial in which Carroll O'Connor, the actor who played Archie Bunker on the longtime television series "All in the Family," defends Mr. Brown's flat tax proposal. How Close a Race? Mr. Brown was asserting yesterday that the race was close, but Stan Greenberg, the poll taker for the Clinton campaign, seemed to be in the quintessential political state of guardedly optimistic. Although Mr. Greenberg said that Mr. Tsongas was gaining in the campaign's Sunday night polling, particularly among Jewish voters, and would clearly be a factor in the race, he added, "We're showing good margins for us over Brown." But a poll released by the consulting group Sawyer-Miller showed a far closer race. And in separate polling, Lee Miringoff of the Marist Institute said his incomplete survey had detected a jump for Mr. Tsongas and a large undecided contingent, particularly among blacks. Mr. Miringoff predicted that voters' lack of enthusiasm, indecision and reservations about Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown could result in a low turnout today. Buzzing About Tsongas The buzz in political circles yesterday was over the Tsongas factor. Some Democratic party leaders in Nassau and Suffolk counties said they had detected a Tsongas flurry, with Joe Galante, the executive director of the Nassau County Democratic Party, noting that Mr. Tsongas had won a straw poll at a meeting of the Nassau Democratic Committee last Thursday. The editorial page of the Long Island newspaper Newsday has endorsed Mr. Tsongas. But Bruce Nyman, supervisor of the City of Long Beach and a co-chairman of Mr. Clinton's Long Island campaign, said he saw Mr. Clinton solidifying his support. "I think we've grown stronger among Jewish voters and among people who are beginning to focus in on Brown," said Mr. Nyman. "They see he is not the savior of the Democratic Party." In many ways, the primary still revolved around the persona of Bill Clinton. He tried with some success in recent days to return the campaign dialogue to the issues of economics and education, health care and foreign policy, but much of the news coverage still focused on him. In Milwaukee last night, Mr. Clinton complained that voters had been told for years that politicians are hiding "deep, dark secrets." He said he found this "absolute orgy of obsession with the past" to be sad.

737-> Jobless Rate Increases to 7.3% In a Mixed Report
The nation's unemployment rate climbed two-tenths of a point in February to 7.3 percent, the highest since mid-1985, the Labor Department reported today. But other job data, notably a gain of 164,000 payroll jobs, pointed to a slight upturn in the economy. Most private economists said they were encouraged by the sizable payroll jump, as well as by a lengthening of the average workweek and a sharp rebound in total production hours. Some contended that the recession -- by technical rather than popular definition -- probably ended last month if it had not done so previously. But Democrats seized on the higher jobless rate in the report, the first look at overall economic performance last month, as evidence of continued economic weakness and worker hardship, a theme they plan to push forcefully during the campaign year. 'Grim News Indeed' "Very grim news indeed," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, at a hearing on the job figures. Campaigning in Baton Rouge, La., President Bush was asked if joblessness would hurt him. "I don't know," he responded. "We've just got to worry about those who don't have jobs. It's a good argument for passing our program." The President's top economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, emphasized the favorable elements of today's mixed report but was careful not to raise expectations too high. Hard to Interpret "We're deeply concerned about the rise in the unemployment rate," he said in an interview. "While the gains in non-farm payroll jobs, the workweek, overtime and earnings are positive signs, the economy is not yet growing rapidly enough to prevent a rise in unemployment. Speeding, strengthening and insuring that growth is the President's first priority to get Americans back to work." By all accounts, this month's report was unusually hard to interpret, as reflected in bond prices that first tumbled, driving interest rates higher, and then regained the lost ground. The report contained conflicting evidence, including a 74,000 decline in jobs as measured by the survey of households, compared with a gain more than twice that big for company payrolls, as measured in the separate survey of employers. This, combined with revisions and statistical aberrations, compounded the normal analytical task. Generally, however, most economists agreed that the report depicted an economy moving ahead ever so slowly and unlikely either to slip back into recession or to grow fast enough in the foreseeable future to generate inflation pressures. "It's positive," said Kathryn Eickhoff, president of a New York consulting firm carrying her name, adding that the economic "stirrings" cited recently by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had grown stronger. "But it's certainly nothing to get very excited about." Private analysts said they also tended to think that today's report was sufficiently encouraging that it added no pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates yet again as a spur to the economy. Nonetheless, the figures disclosed areas of increased job-market distress, including another substantial rise in the ranks of those out of work for long periods. While those idled for less than five weeks actually declined by 278,000, this was more than offset by a rise of 235,000 in those jobless from 5 to 14 weeks and a rise of 145,000 in those jobless for 15 weeks or more. Jobless Spell Climbs The average jobless spell climbed to 17 weeks, from 16.4 weeks in January and 15.3 weeks in December. Moreover, the number of unemployed Americans expanded by 315,000 last month to 9,244,000, the highest level since December 1983 and 2.8 million above the total when the latest recession started in July 1990. So while it appeared from one set of statistics that the economy was no longer throwing people out of work in recent weeks, neither was it generating enough jobs to absorb an ever-larger pool of people seeking them, including the hard-core unemployed. At the same time, however, the report also showed a rise of 541,000 in "job losers," those forced to leave their jobs, during February. The labor force grew by another 241,000 last month, a major factor in raising the unemployment rate. The jobless rate typically continues to move higher during the early stages of recovery as people who had given up looking for jobs become hopeful enough to start searching again, and are thereby restored to the statistical work force. Yet the figures show that there were 190,000 fewer of these jobless "re-entrants" last month, a total of 2.16 million, compared with 2.35 million in January. The number of unsuccessful new entrants to the labor force -- like college graduates and other first-time job hunters -- rose 33,000, to 823,000. One partial explanation of what was happening was that the long-term jobless who had exhausted their benefits had been induced by the latest extension of benefits to visit their unemployment office to re-establish eligibility. The household survey also showed a sharp increase of 1.7 points, to 20 percent, in the jobless rate for teen-agers, a group that has been hit especially hard over the last two years. Black teen-age men now have a jobless rate of 39 percent, or 42.4 percent without benefit of seasonal adjustment. The jobless rate for Hispanic people rose last month to 11.6 percent from 11.3 percent. Longer Jobless Periods Over all, the number of people out of work six months or more has nearly doubled over the last year and the proportion of such jobless has risen to 1 in 5 from 1 in 10. The department's survey of payrolls produced a far bigger expansion than analysts had predicted, but the 164,000 rise proved less impressive when subjected to close inspection. Of the total, 133,000 of the increase was reported as coming in retail trade, a result that analysts said was not credible in light of a decline of 158,000 before seasonal adjustment. William G. Barron Jr., Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee that "recessionary forces have modified the seasonal patterns" for retailing. Factory jobs rose 12,000 in February after five months of decline that averaged 40,000 each month. But there would have been another loss had it not been for the recall of 30,000 auto workers from layoffs. At the same time, however, the length of the average private-sector workweek expanded a hefty 24 minutes, and factory hours and factory overtime also rose. This was a favorable sign, economists said, because longer hours are a precursor to new hiring, as employers seek to meet higher demand for their goods. "I think they show the recession has finally ended," Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, said of the data released today. "But the prospect is for no meaningful recovery," he added, with the unemployment rate probably rising for many months to come.

738-> A Matisse Show To Set a Record
Q. What long-awaited cultural event will cost more to see than a movie and less than a Broadway show? A. The "Henri Matisse Retrospective" at the Museum of Modern Art in the fall. Tickets to the exhibition, which opens on Sept. 24, will cost $12.50, which appears to be more than any other major art show is charging on either side of the Atlantic. Tickets go on sale Aug. 10 and must be bought in advance in the museum lobby or through Ticketmaster. Asking a special admission for big shows is nothing new for the Modern. But the last time it did so, for the Picasso exhibition in 1980, the price was only $4.50. The Metropolitan Museum of Art also sells tickets in advance for big shows but charges only its regular suggested admission of $6. A special price for blockbuster exhibitions is common among European institutions. At the Tate Gallery in London, for example, the Constable show last summer cost visitors about $9. The same price is being charged for the Rembrandt show now at the National Gallery in London. In Paris, a Toulouse-Lautrec show at the Grand Palais has a $10 entrance charge. The Modern says its charge is a necessity. "The Matisse retrospective will have over 400 works of art and it cost nearly two and a half times more than any recent show," said James Snyder, the deputy director for planning and program support at the Modern. He said that help from Philip Morris and grants would cover only about half the show's cost. The museum expects about 6,600 people a day to visit the exhibition, which will occupy two floors of the museum. The Matisse ticket price will include admission to the rest of the museum. Since admission is rising to $7.50 from $7 on July 1, the Matisse show will actually cost visitors "only an additional $5," Mr. Snyder said.

740-> Arrest in Slaying at Hotel
A 32-year-old parolee from the Bronx was arrested yesterday in the killing last month of a 67-year-old maid who was found with her throat cut in a bathtub in the midtown hotel where she worked, the police said. The parolee, Nelson Rodriguez of 1230 Spofford Avenue, was charged in the killing of the maid, Dazilyn Williams of Brooklyn, on March 21 in a room of the Hotel Lexington at 511 Lexington Avenue, a police spokesman, Lieut. Robert Nardoza, said. "The squad isn't sure of the motive but they think he was burglarizing the place when the maid walked in," Lieutenant Nardoza said.

741-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: WOMEN; Vanderbilt's Fast Start Is Too Much for UConn
Heidi Gillingham's 13 points led a methodical Vanderbilt offense that buried Connecticut, 75-47, today in the second round of the women's National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Eleven Commodore players scored as Vanderbilt (21-9) advanced to the N.C.A.A.'s final 16. Vanderbilt will play the North Carolina-Miami winner in Charlottesville, Va. Connecticut wrapped up its season at 23-11. Vanderbilt kicked off the game with 8 consecutive points before Wendy Davis drove the baseline to score Connecticut's first 2 points with 16 minutes 36 seconds left in the half. A Jade Huntington layup with 4:05 remaining gave Vanderbilt its largest lead of the half, 18 points. The Huskies could get no closer than 14 points, 36-22, when Kathy Ferrier hit the first of two free throws with 33 seconds in the half. Neither team could score for nearly three minutes of the second half. Connecticut tried a full-court press that failed to slow Vanderbilt as the Commodores stretched their lead to 50-31 on a Gillingham jumper with 12:30 left in the game. Vanderbilt's Misty Lamb and Shelley Jarrard each scored 11 points and Huntington added 10. Wendy Davis led Connecticut with 13 points; Kathy Ferrier scored 10. Penn State 77, DePaul 54 STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Susan Robinson scored a game-high 26 points as Penn State came from behind in the second half to beat DePaul in a second-round Midwest Region game. Robinson got help from Kathy Phillips and Jackie Donovan, both of whom scored 11 points. Penn State, ranked ninth by The Associated Press, is 24-6 and will face the winner of the Mississippi-Southern Illinois game Thursday in the third round. DePaul finishes the season 21-10. Sue Welenc scored 17 points for DePaul. Tammy Williams added 11 points and Stella Woodley had 10. DePaul held a 33-32 lead at the half. Texas Tech 64 Santa Clara 58 LUBBOCK, Tex. (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored 28 points and 12th-ranked Texas Tech overcame an 18-point first-half deficit with the help of deafening crowd support to defeat Santa Clara in the second round. Texas Tech (27-4), the fourth seed in the West Regional, won before a sellout crowd of 8,323 and earned its first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in four tries dating back to the 1983-84 season. The 12th-seeded Broncos, who upset seventh-seeded California, 73-71, in the first round, finish the season 21-10. Swoopes, the Southwest Conference player of the year, was the difference in the second half, when she scored 15 points, including nine in a row to put the game out of reach, 60-54, with 1:40 to play. Santa Clara pulled within 60-56 on two free throws by Jenny Baldwin with 1:17 left, but could get no closer. Sheryl Staub led Santa Clara with 13 points, and Laura Hughes added 12. Tech opened the second half with an 11-2 run highlighted by four points from Swoopes which helped give the Lady Raiders their first lead of the game and a 38-34 advantage with 15:54 to play. Santa Clara opened the game 5 of 6 from 3-point range and built a 28-10 lead as the Lady Raiders fumbled through their offensive plays. Tech's 2-3 zone was no match for Santa Clara's outside shooting, led by Staub, who was three of three from 3-point range and finished with 11 points in the first half. But Tech, inspired by the crowd's deafening roars, closed the first half with a 17-2 run. Swoopes scored seven points in the spurt which helped narrow the Broncos' lead at halftime to 30-27.

743-> Baseball; On a Sloppy Night, Yanks Laugh Last
In a game tonight between the Yankees and White Sox that was filled with base-running miscues, missed signs, sloppy fielding, sloppy throwing and enough ugliness to compile a blooper tape, it was fitting that even the deciding run involved a bizarre sequence. Kevin Maas slapped a single off the glove of a diving Frank Thomas near first base to drive in Roberto Kelly in the ninth inning and power the Yankees to a strange 4-3 victory at Comiskey Park. Kelly would have scored on the previous base hit -- Mel Hall's 400-foot shot off the center-field fence -- but he missed second base, had to return to touch it and only made it to third. Hall stayed on first with a single and then Maas, suddenly a force in the lineup, saved Kelly and the Yankees from any further embarrassment with his hit. It was that sort of odd evening at chilly Comiskey. "It's good to win a game like this because you never really feel like you were in a comfortable state in the game," said Yankees Manager Buck Showalter. "It was like a full moon over Chicago." Kelly laughed about his blunder after the game because it did not wind up costing the Yankees the game, but it came close. If Maas did not poke Scott Radinsky's two-strike fastball into right field, Kelly's goof would have been magnified. Besides, he had enough trouble contending with Hall, who was upset about not adding to his robust r.b.i. total. "I wanted to be sure I touched the bag," Kelly said. "I missed it the first time or I definitely would have scored." How bad was it? Both teams made two errors, but that was only the start of the ugliness. The White Sox had four base runners thrown out during the game, including one at home and two at third base, and they also botched a slew of scoring chances. During one stretch in the third and fourth innings, they had eight hits and a walk in 11 at-bats and managed only three runs against Scott Sanderson. The Yankees contributed their brand of ugliness to the sloppy mess as Matt Nokes was thrown out trying to advance from second to third base on a grounder to shortstop, Andy Stankiewicz missed a sign and tried a squeeze bunt when the runner on third knew the idea had been abandoned and the club also left 12 runners on base. "Those guys were doing everything possible not to score runs and we were doing everything possible not to score runs," said Kelly, who had four hits and raised his average to .361. "This was one of those crazy games." The Yankees were able to smile about the messy affair because they won for the fourth time in their last five games and improved their record to an impressive 10-5. After losing 10 of 12 games to Chicago last season, they have already subdued the White Sox in two games this season. 2-0 Lead for White Sox Chicago touched Sanderson for two runs in the third as Stankiewicz made an errant throw to first on a ground ball that scored Craig Grebeck from second base, and Robin Ventura delivered Steve Sax with a single to give Chicago a 2-0 lead. Don Mattingly was not immune to the mess as he made his first error of the season in the inning. "I've probably been in a game that was stranger than this," Mattingly said. "Except I don't remember when." New York answered with two runs in the fourth. Kelly opened the inning with a long triple to right and Maas received a run batted in when Sax, playing deep, let a grounder chew him up and bound into the outfield. Maas advanced to second when Jesse Barfield ended an 0-for-26 slump by stroking a single to left and scored the second run on Charlie Hayes's soft single to right field. The White Sox went ahead 3-2 in the bottom of the fourth but hurt themselves because Dan Pasqua was thrown out at third and Matt Merullo was nailed at home on a Hall to Randy Velarde to Nokes relay. Showalter called it the turning point in the game. It probably had to be. It was one of the few well-executed plays all night. "It was not a textbook game, but it goes in the win column so it is a plus," Showalter said. INSIDE PITCH White Sox shortstop OZZIE GUILLEN underwent three hours of surgery Wednesday to repair two knee ligaments he tore during a collision with left fielder TIM RAINES in the ninth inning of Tuesday's game with New York. They were pursuing Mel Hall's fly ball. Guillen is out for the season. . . . MIKE GALLEGO, who is nursing a bruised right heel, cannot run straight ahead without pain so he will not begin a rehabiltation assignment this week. . . . BRIEN TAYLOR pitched a one-hitter, but lost his first pro game Wednesday night as Fort Lauderdale was defeated by Sarasota, 4-0, in a Class A game. The 20-year old Taylor did not allow an earned run but hurt himself with two errors. . . . White Sox catcher CARLTON FISK had his cast removed by team doctors from his right foot Wednesday. Fisk, suffering from a tendon inflammation since a March 13 spring training game, began walking and exercising in a pool. BO JACKSON, who underwent reconstructive surgery on his left hip April 4, began his rehabilitation exercises at Comiskey Park.

744-> VICTIM'S IRAN LINK IS SEEN AS MOTIVE
Law-enforcement officials said today that they believed that the gunman who shot the wife of a former Iranian official on Thursday knew who his victim was. Bergen County Prosecutor John J. Fahy said the victim, Parivash Rafizadeh, was shot twice from a distance of five or six feet as she was leaving her car in the circular driveway outside her colonial house at about 8:45 P.M. "Whoever shot her knew who she was," Mr. Fahy said. "I don't believe it was a case of mistaken identity." He said he based his statement on the killer's proximity to Mrs. Rafizadeh when she was shot. Mr. Fahy and officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to speculate about motives for the killing or to discuss details of their investigations. The F.B.I. entered the case on Friday evening to explore the possibility that the shooting, which Mr. Fahy described as execution style, was an act of political terrorism. Husband on Trip to California In a brief statement from its office in Newark, the F.B.I. said it was aggressively pursuing the investigation "to determine if this incident is in fact terrorist related." The statement said Mrs. Rafizadeh's husband, Majid, had been an Iranian official before the Shah was toppled in the revolution that brought the Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini to power in 1979. The statement did not identify Mr. Rafizadeh's position. Mr. Rafizadeh was traveling to California when his wife was slain, Mr. Fahy said, adding that he did not know the nature of the trip or Mr. Rafizadeh's occupation. "We have no reason to believe they were not a happily married couple," Mr. Fahy said. The Rafizadehs, parents of three grown daughters, have lived since 1982 in this upper-middle-income neighborhood, which has had only three murders in the last 10 years, a local police officer said. Mrs. Rafizadeh was ambushed returning from her business, a nail salon called Great Nails and More in Ridgewood. In the strip shopping center that houses Great Nails, a sign on the door said, "Due to a death within the shop we will be closed until early next week." Jim Finn, owner of the neigbhoring Movies-to-Go, said Mrs. Rafizadeh was "a classy lady, not a run-of-the-mill woman." "It's shocking, devastating," Mr. Finn said. "If it happened in the Bronx, it would be passing news. But here - it takes your breath away." The authorities said they believed that the gunman was lurking in bushes near the driveway and shot just as Mrs. Rafizadeh was getting out of the car, Mr. Fahy said. He said none of the neighbors had reported seeing anyone suspicious in the neighborhood before the shooting. Trying to Trace Owner of Gun The murder weapon, a .45-caliber automatic handgun, was found by detectives on Friday morning in a patch of woods 200 feet behind the house, Mr. Fahy said. The woods separate the rear yard of the house from the parking lot of a school. Investigators said they believed that the getaway car was parked in the lot and that the gunman dropped his gun as he ran toward it. Mr. Fahy said officials were trying to trace the ownership of the gun through its serial number. "We're hoping to have that by Monday," he said. Mr. Fahy said he did not know whether Mrs. Rafizadeh was related to Mansur Rafizadeh of Franklin Lakes. But a woman answering the door at Mansur Rafizadeh's house yesterday said that Mrs. Rafizadeh was his sister-in-law. Mr. Rafizadeh said in an autobiography in 1987 that he headed the United States branch of the Iranian secret police, Savak, during the Shah's reign. In the book, which was strongly critical of the Shah, Mr. Rafizadeh also said that he was the chief liaison aide for Savak with the F.B.I. and the Central Intelligence Agency in the 70's and that he severed all ties with the C.I.A. in February 1983. But Mansour Farhang, a Bennington College professor who served as revolutionary Iran's first ambassador to the United Nations, said he thought the purpose of Mr. Rafizadeh's book was "largely to exaggerate his own importance." Mr. Farhang said he thought Mr. Rafizadeh was only a member of Savak, not its United States chief. Mr. Farhang also said he found it hard to believe that the Iranian government would kill Mrs. Rafizadeh. "Over the past 13 years, the Iranian government has not really tried to harm members of the family of someone who is persona non grata or on death lists," he said. Supporters of the Shah bore a "great deal of resentment" toward Mr. Rafizadeh after his book was published, Mr. Farhang said. But there is no evidence "they have committed any violent acts," the professor said.

745-> Abortion and the Law: A Day in Court After Years of Skirmishing; Excerpts From Supreme Court Arguments on Pennsylvania Abortion Law
Following are excerpts from the oral argument today before the United States Supreme Court in the case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Robert P. Casey, as provided by Alderson Reporting Company. KATHRYN KOLBERT Counsel for A.C.L.U. MS. KOLBERT: Whether our Constitution endows Government with the power to force a woman to continue or to end a pregnancy against her will is the central question in this case. Since this Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a generation of American women have come of age secure in the knowledge that the Constitution provides the highest level of protection for their child-bearing decisions. This landmark decision, which necessarily and logically flows from a century of this Court's jurisprudence, not only protects rights of bodily integrity and autonomy, but has enabled millions of women to participate fully and equally in society. The genius of Roe and the Constitution is that it fully protects rights of fundamental importance. Government may not chip away at fundamental rights, nor make them selectively available only to the most privileged women. . . . This Court has repeatedly held that the doctrine of stare decisis is of fundamental importance to the rule of law. Fidelity to precedent insures that our law will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion, and that our guiding rules are founded in law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Accordingly, this Court has established that departure from precedent must be supported by some special justification, but no special justification exists here. Only nine years ago in Akron [ Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health ] , this Court invoked the doctrine of stare decisis and expressly reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. Only three years later, in Thornburgh [ Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ] , a case that is virtually identical to that before this Court today, this Court again found especially compelling reasons to reaffirm Roe and to find Pennsylvania law unconstitutional under the standard of strict scrutiny. Nothing has changed since that time. . . . Roe Strongly Defended Never before has this Court bestowed and taken back a fundamental right that has been part of the settled rights and expectations of literally millions of Americans for nearly two decades. To regress now by permitting states suddenly to impose burdensome regulations, or to criminalize conduct, would be incompatible with any notion of principled constitutional decision-making. Roe is both soundly based in the Constitution and sets forth a fair and workable standard of adjudication. From as early as 1891, this Court has recognized that the rights of autonomy, bodily integrity, and equality are central to our notions of ordered liberty. Roe lies at the heart of those interests. While pregnancy may be a blessed act when planned or wanted, forced pregnancy, like any forced bodily invasion, is anathema to American values and traditions. In the same way that it would be unacceptable for Government to force a man or a woman to donate bone marrow, or to compel the contribution of a kidney to another, or to compel women to undergo abortion or forced sterilization, our Constitution protects women against forced pregnancy. If anything, because forced pregnancy will jeopardize a woman's life or health, the constitutional protections ought to be greater. . . . JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR: Ms. Kolbert, you're arguing the case as though all we have before us is whether to apply stare decisis and preserve Roe v. Wade in all its aspects. Nevertheless, we granted certiorari on some specific questions in this case. Do you plan to address any of those in your argument? MS. KOLBERT: Your Honor, I do. However, the central question in the case is, what is the standard that this Court uses to evaluate the restrictions that are at issue, and therefore one cannot -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the standard may affect the outcome or it may not, but at bottom we still have to deal with specific issues, and I wondered if you were going to address them. MS. KOLBERT: Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I would like in particular to address the husband-notification provisions, but the standard that this Court applies will well establish the outcome in this case for a variety of reasons. This Court has already found that under the principles of Roe v. Wade the bulk of the Pennsylvania statute is unconstitutional. There is no question that this Court struck down as unconstitutional under strict scrutiny the bias- counseling provisions and the 24-hour mandatory delay both in Thornburgh and in Akron, the case in 1983, and therefore this Court must examine first the question of what's the appropriate standard before determining the constitutionality of those other provisions. 'Fundamental Freedoms' The Court cannot alter its historic recognition of privacy and deny women fundamental freedoms, as I was speaking, because as the Solicitor argues, there is the presence of the fetus. . . . Particularly here, as this Court noted in Roe, where there is widespread disagreement in both a philosophical and a religious sense about when life begins, this Court cannot sanction one view to the detriment of women's lives and health; nor can the state of the law in 1868 define or determine constitutional rights for all future generations. This Court must look generally to whether a right is reflected in our nation's history and traditions rather than at whether the activity was illegal at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Relying exclusively on what 50 states have legislated in determining the scope of liberty would imperil numerous freedoms such as rights recognized by this Court in Brown, Bolling, Griswold and Loving. This Court has also recognized as -- JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA: Ms. Kolbert, on this last point, I am not sure what you suggest we look to. You say we should not look to what the practice was in 1868. Should we look to what the practice was at the time of Roe or what the practice is today? That is, what the states would do, left to their own devices? MS. KOLBERT: Your Honor, I believe that you have to look very generally at whether the Nation's history and tradition has respected interests of bodily integrity and autonomy and whether there has been a tradition of respect for equality of women. Those are the central and core values -- JUSTICE SCALIA: But not to abortion in particular? MS. KOLBERT: Well, this Court is -- if theCourt was only to look at whether abortion was illegal in 1868, that is at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it would be placed in a very difficult situation because at the time of the founding of the nation, at the time that the Constitution was adopted, abortion was legal. . . . This Court, if we were only to look at whether state legislatures prohibited activity in determining whether or not an activity is fundamental, many of the most precious rights that we now have: rights to travel, rights to vote, rights to be free from racial segregation would not be accorded status because in fact, state legislators have acted to inhibit those rights at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . A Trimester Framework Our position is that Roe, in establishing a trimester framework, in establishing strict scrutiny, and in also establishing that the rights of women and the health interests of women always take precedent over the state's interest in potential life. Those hallmarks of Roe are central to this case, and are central to continuing recognition of the right as fundamental. Should the Court abandon that -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But did the Court hold that, even after viability of the fetus in Roe? MS. KOLBERT: What the Court -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that was a correct characterization of Roe's holding that you just gave, that the woman's interest always takes precedence? Is that true under Roe, in the latter stages of pregnancy? MS. KOLBERT: Your Honor, under Roe, after the point of viability, that is the point when the fetus is capable of survival, the state is free to prohibit abortion but only so long as it is necessary, only so long as the woman's health interests and life interests are not at stake. That is, potential fetal life is a recognized value, is a recognized state interest after the point of viability; but when in conflict, when the woman's health interest is in conflict with those state interests and potential life, those women's interest, the women's interest in health take precedent. Now admittedly, the question of viability and the viability line is not as present in this case as it has been in many of the other cases that this Court has seen before here. That is, all of the restrictions that are issue in Pennsylvania attach in pregnancy at the very beginning of pregnancy, and therefore, the state's interest in protection of fetal life really does not come into play. . . . The Commonwealth attempts to present the restrictions at issue here as reasonable. For the woman who as a result of mandatory husband-notification provisions will be beaten, or will see her children beaten, the restrictions are not reasonable. For the woman who must travel 200 miles on two and three occasions as a result of the act's mandatory delay, the restrictions are not reasonable. For the woman who has become pregnant as a result of marital rape, obtaining information from her doctor that her husband may be liable for child support is both cruel and oppressive. They are not reasonable. . . . Notifying Husbands Let me turn now to -- specifically to the husband-notification provision. There is little doubt that these provisions violate the fundamental right of privacy, marital integrity and equality. Beginning as early as Danforth [ Planned Parenthood v. Danforth ] , this Court recognized that a husband cannot arbitrarily veto the child-bearing decisions of his wife. Like the Missouri law at issue in Danforth, state-mandated communication between husbands and wives violates the autonomy of married women to make personal and private decisions, particularly here where a married woman is often the survivor of marital rape and where the penalty for transgressing her husband is likely to be physical violence against her or her family members. Government has the obligation to respect her private decisions, not to involve her husband. The Solicitor dismisses the import of the state-imposed harm and believes or claims that the Constitution is not intended to remedy them. But this approach seriously ignores that women will be seriously maimed and that harms will be invoked, and it is a callous disregard for their lives and health. . . . Imposed notification is -- gives a benefit only to men, and as such they violate the dictates of the equal protection clause. The legislative scheme that assumes that husbands are capable and authorized to make all independent decisions but wives are not, reflect an outmoded common-law view that women, once married, lost their legal identities to their husbands. In the days before Roe, thousands of women lost their lives and more were subjected to physical and emotional scars from back alley and self-induced abortions. Recognizing that, this Court established Roe and established fundamental protection for women's child-bearing decisions. We urge this Court to reaffirm those principles today, to adopt the rulings of this Court in Akron and Thornburgh that used the Roe strict scrutiny standard, and affirm in part and reverse in part, the judgment of the Court of Appeals. . . . ERNEST D. PREATE JR. Attorney General of Pennsylvania MR. PREATE: This Court granted certiorari on the question of whether five sections of our Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act are constitutional. It is the position of Pennsylvania that each of the five provisions is constitutional under the analysis that was applied by this Court in Webster [ Webster v. Reproductive Health Services ] ; that, further, Roe v. Wade need not be revisited by this Court except to reaffirm that Roe did not establish an absolute right to abortion on demand, but rather a limited right subject to reasonable State regulations designed to serve important and legitimate state -- JUSTICE HARRY A. BLACKMUN: Mr. Attorney General, I'm not so sure that's so important. Roe itself said that -- MR. PREATE: That's correct. JUSTICE BLACKMUN: That this does not provide for abortion on demand. Have you read Roe? MR. PREATE: Yes, I have. JUSTICE BLACKMUN: Thank you. 'The Unborn Child' MR. PREATE: In our view the accommodations of the woman's right and the state's legitimate interest in the unborn child is best served, short of overruling Roe, by employing the undue-burden standard for reviewing State abortion regulations. However, as we argue in part two of our brief, if our statute cannot be upheld under the undue burden standard, Roe, being wrongly decided, should be overruled. I will now address the specific provisions of our statute and start with the requirement of spousal notice, which was the only aspect of our law that the court of appeals found unconstitutional. It's important to remember, and perhaps more important in this context than any other, that the petitioners brought this action as a facial challenge to the statute. In this kind of a challenge it's enough for the petitioners to show -- it's not enough for them to show that the act might be unconstitutional as applied to someone in some hypothetical, worst-case scenario. Rather, the petitioners must show that the statute could not constitutionally be applied to anyone. We asked, have they met that burden, and we submit that they have not met that burden. This is a spousal-notice provision, it is not a spousal consent statute. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, the provision does not require notification to a father who is not the husband, I take it -- MR. PREATE: That's correct, Justice O'Connor. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or notice if the woman is unmarried. MR. PREATE: It only applies to married women. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what's the interest, to try to preserve the marriage? MR. PREATE: There are several interests. The interest, of course, in protecting the life of the unborn child. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, then, why not require notice to all fathers? It's a curious sort of a provision, isn't it? MR. PREATE: It is that, but the Legislature has made the judgment that it wanted its statute to apply in this specific instance because it wanted to further the integrity of marriages. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you say that the state could similarly require a woman to notify anyone with whom she had intercourse that she planned to use some means of birth control after the intercourse that operates, let's say, as an abortifacient? Could the state do that? I mean, it would be the same state interest, I suppose. MR. PREATE: The state interest would be the same, but I think that would be problematic. I'm not -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And why would it be problematic, do you think? MR. PREATE: I think that with regard to applying a statute to all women, that it might create severe obstacle, an absolute obstacle to their obtaining an abortion. Constitution does not seek to order and to ordain. These are interests in which the state can have, and our nature of government -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I don't understand. MR. PREATE: The undue-burden standard, as I understand it, is that whether or not the regulation would impose such an absolute obstacle, not whether it would deter or inhibit some women from obtaining an abortion. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, we're talking about the provision for notification in this case under the statute to the husband, and I'm just asking whether a different type of state regulation would have to be upheld under your standard. MR. PREATE: Well, if the state had posited its interest as protecting the life of the unborn then utilizing the rational-basis standard, then I would submit that it could legitimately require that kind of notification to all people. In this instance, however, we have a different statute. We have a statute that provides exceptions where exceptions are appropriate, and there are five of them: medical emergency, where the husband is not the father of the child, where the husband cannot be found, where the pregnancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or where the woman in her judgment believes it's likely that she will be physically abused. Now, petitioners have produced some testimony and made some argument, essentially through one expert, about battered wives, but the testimony was that some unknown number were rendered so helpless by their battering husbands that they were incapable of checking off a line on the form, the spousal-notice form. We can agree that these women are indeed cruelly burdened, but they're not burdened by the statute, and that's the compelling point. They're not burdened by the statute, but by the circumstance, and the tragic circumstance, of their lives. We're looking at the statute to see if the statute imposes the obstacle. If there is a battering husband that's interposed in there, that's a different story. . . . Pressed by Stevens JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS: May I ask you a question about your understanding of the undue burden test? Do you think it refers to the number of persons burdened by the law on the one hand or the severity of the burden on a particular individual affected by the law on the other hand? Which is the right analysis? MR. PREATE: I think, Justice Stevens, in the initial application, it's a quantitative analysis, whether there is a broad practical impact here. The fact that it might -- JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, it is the number of persons affected is your answer -- MR. PREATE: The number of persons affected -- JUSTICE STEVENS: Regardless of how severe the burden on a particular individual? MR. PREATE: As the test has been posited, the question of whether or not -- JUSTICE STEVENS: I am just asking you to explain to me what your conception of the test that you are asking us to adopt is. MR. PREATE: It may be that some women would be deterred to some degree, but that is not sufficient to create an undue burden. JUSTICE STEVENS: It is the number of women affected? MR. PREATE: Initially, it is the number of women affected, the broad practical impact of it -- . . . Scalia Is Puzzled JUSTICE SCALIA: But in the facial context, I don't understand what you -- so there are two undue burden tests. There is one at the facial level in which we consider the statute in gross and decide whether, all things considered in the generality of applications, the burden is undue. And then we have a second wave of application of the undue-burden test case-by-case, so that even though the law facially may be okay, it may be invalid in its particular application because of -- is that what you are saying? MR. PREATE: In the second instance, as applied it -- JUSTICE SCALIA: I am worried about the first one, not the second one. I thought the -- MR. PREATE: In a facial challenge, Justice Scalia, you are looking at not the worst-scenario hypothesis, but whether this act could be applied constitutionally to anyone, and that is -- JUSTICE SCALIA: Any single case, not in gross, to any single case. Isn't that the normal situation? To challenge a statute facially you have to show that it can never be constitutionally applied, isn't that right? MR. PREATE: That's correct. JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not looking at it in gross. That is asking whether there is any single case where a woman would not be unduly burdened. MR. PREATE: In this particular instance, we find that there is no undue burden in our statute, anywhere in our statute, and if the undue burden test is, as applied or understood by this Court causes our statute to fall, then we ask this Court to adopt rational basis as the appropriate analysis. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that compelling speech requires any kind of First Amendment analysis? MR. PREATE: Compelling -- Pressure on Women JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Speech. The state is compelling a woman to say something to her husband. MR. PREATE: We are asking that she -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does that invoke any First Amendment concerns? MR. PREATE: Not in our view, this statute -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would have thought perhaps compelling speech would get us right into a First Amendment area. MR. PREATE: In this particular instance, this statute, we feel causes notification, but there is a legitimate state interest involved in furthering that interest. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In other words, the doctor is to say certain things to the patient, do you think that is really commercial speech there? MR. PREATE: Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why is that? When the doctor is giving professional advice to the patient, you think that is commercial? MR. PREATE: That is commercial. The petitioners already do that right now. They already tell their patients, the physicians and the counselors, that there are medical risks associated with this procedure. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I wouldn't have thought that was commercial speech. What do you rely on? MR. PREATE: In Zauderer. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that is advertising, that is different. . . . KENNETH W. STARR Solicitor General of the U.S. MR. STARR: In view of what has been discussed, let me address very briefly three points. The first is the standard of review, which has been the subject of considerable discussion. In a number of its cases over the last 20 years in the abortion area, the Court has articulated the governing standard of review in different ways. And as a result, there is confusion in the law as to how legislatures, if they choose, can legislate, and how judges are to judge in this extraordinarily sensitive and divisive area. In our view, the correct articulation of that standard is to be found in the Webster plurality opinion. That standard has deep roots. It finds its roots in a long line of due-process cases that do not involve liberty interests which, by virtue of the nation's history and its legal traditions, rise to the level of fundamental rights to a free people. This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe versus Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold against Connecticut. Second, and relatedly, with all respect, we do not believe that stare decisis considerations weigh against the Court providing that needed clarification as to the standard. This is not an issue -- JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one rather basic question? MR. STARR: Certainly. Person or Fetus? JUSTICE STEVENS: It affects the standard of review and everything else. What is the position of the Department of Justice on the question whether a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment? MR. STARR: We do not have a position on that question, and this Court has not addressed, or at least there is no Justice at this Court -- JUSTICE STEVENS: It's addressed in Roe. MR. STARR: That, that, that is correct. And it does seem to me that ultimately that is an extraordinarily difficult question which this Court need not address, and it need not address it in this case. JUSTICE STEVENS: What is that we need not address it. I'm just interested to know -- MR. STARR: We do not have a position. JUSTICE STEVENS: Does the United States have a position on that question? MR. STARR: We do not, because we think it would be an extraordinarily difficult and sensitive issue by virtue of a number of questions that would flow from that, including equal protections and so forth. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the Court decided that in Roe, did it not? MR. STARR: The Court did, in fact, decide that there is a very keen interest on the part of the state in what the Roe Court called potential life, and that's my -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but said the fetus is not a person under the Fourteenth Amendment. MR. STARR: Well I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe v. Wade. But I think that the key point is that a number of the Justices of this Court have said that regardless of that legal question, that constitutional question, that the state does have a compelling interest in the potential life, in fetal life, and that that interest runs throughout pregnancy. JUSTICE SCALIA: We did not say in Roe that a state could not have a position on whether a fetus is a person, did we? MR. STARR: Certainly the Court -- JUSTICE SCALIA: We said that the Constitution takes no position on whether a fetus is a person, and/or that it does take a position that a fetus is not protected by the Constitution. MR. STARR: The Court seemed to admit of the possibility of state regulation to protect the unborn at all stages. JUSTICE SCALIA: Including state regulation on the basis of the people's determination within that state that a fetus is a person. There's nothing in Roe that says a state may not make that judgment, if it wishes. The Scope of Roe MR. STARR: That it says, that the state may, if it sees fit, that the state does have -- I think Roe goes this far. Roe says that there is a legitimate interest of the state in the potential life in utero throughout pregnancy, and then the nature of that interest changes and becomes stronger over time. But it did, in fact, say that there is a legitimate interest. And there has been an expression by a number of the Justices of this Court to suggest that that interest is, indeed, a compelling interest on the part of the state. JUSTICE DAVID H. SOUTER: Is that also not the position of the Government of the United States, that it is a compelling interest throughout pregnancy? MR. STARR: That is our position, that there is a compelling interest. JUSTICE STEVENS: And what is context? What is the textual basis for that position in the Constitution? Is there any? MR. STARR: Well, I think that, if I may, Justice Stevens, it seems to me that it goes to the recognition that we all do, that there is in fact an organism. As Justice -- JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking, what is the textual basis in the Constitution? You argue very vigorously there's no textual basis supporting your opponent's position. What is the textual basis for your position that there's a compelling interest in something that is not a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment? MR. STARR: The State has -- JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the textual basis for it? MR. STARR: The state has an interest in its potential citizen, it does not have to be granted, have the basis in the Constitution. Justice Stevens, it is my view that the state can look out and say we, as we have historically, regulate and legislate in the interest of those who will come into being, who will be born. It is an interest that every member of this Court has said in potential life. JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not responsive to my question. My question is what is the textual basis in the Constitution. If you're going to say there is none, fine, that's perfectly all right. MR. STARR: I think it's in the nature of our system. And if nothing else, the Tenth Amendment, Justice Stevens, suggests that the state can order its relationships in ways that reflect the morality of the people, within limits. JUSTICE SCALIA: MR. STARR. MR. STARR: There's a determination to -- I'm sorry. The State's Interests JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does there have to be something in the Constitution? There's nothing in the Constitution that requires the state to protect the environment, is there? MR. STARR: Of course not. JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet that can be a compelling state interest, may it not? MR. STARR: Yes. As I have said, the Constitution does not seek to order and to ordain. These are interests in which the state can have, and our nature of government -- JUSTICE SCALIA: All that Roe says is that the Constitution does not protect the fetus under the Fourteenth Amendment. It does not say that a state may not choose to do so. MR. STARR: It doesn't even go so far, it seems to me. . . . JUSTICE BYRON R. WHITE: What is the standard? And you started out to tell us what the standard was? MR. STARR: We believe it was articulated, Justice White, by the Webster plurality. JUSTICE WHITE: Well, what is it? MR. STARR: It is the rational-basis standard. And that is the standard that has been articulated by this Court in a variety of decisions and by a variety of Justices of this Court, in its abortion jurisprudence. JUSTICE WHITE: And under that standard, you would think all of the provisions that are at issue here should be sustained. MR. STARR: Exactly. JUSTICE SOUTER: And so would complete prohibition, wouldn't it? MR. STARR: Complete prohibition that had no exception for the life of the mother, I think could raise very serious questions under -- JUSTICE SOUTER: But subject, subject to that -- MR. STARR: The protection of life. JUSTICE SOUTER: Subject to that exception, it would cover complete pro -- it would justify complete prohibition. MR. STARR: I think it best not to answer these in the abstract. We look to the specific interests of the state as it has articulated those interests. For example -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'll grant you that, but you're asking the Court to adopt a standard and I think we ought to know where the standard would take us. . . . Not a Fair Answer JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not really a fair answer. Rational basis under your analysis: there's an interest in preserving fetal life at all times during pregnancy. It's rational, under your view. Ergo it follows that a total prohibition, protected by criminal penalties, would be rational, it would meet your standard. MR. STARR: I don't think so. The common law, the common -- JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? In what proviso -- what is your rational -basis standard if not the traditional one? MR. STARR: Ours is the traditional one.But under that traditional analysis there must, in fact, be a rational connection with a legitimate State interest, and the state cannot proceed in an arbitrary and capricious fashion, in my view. If I may complete this, I think this is an important part of the answer. It would be arbitrary and capricious. It would, moreover, deprive an individual of her right to life if there were not an emergency exception. And even in Roe v. Wade, the Texas statute at issue there provided for that exception. It would be quite at war with our traditions, as embodied in the common law, not to provide, at a minimum, for that kind of exception. . . . KATHRYN KOLBERT A.C.L.U. Counsel, in Rebuttal MS. KOLBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to address two points very quickly. The first is in response to this last dialogue with General Starr. Recognition of a state's interest in fetal life as compelling throughout pregnancy would denigrate and restrict the ability of women at all stages of pregnancy to have an abortion. And certainly in the only exception that the Mr. Starr and the Solicitor General has laid out for this Court, is in the very rare instance where only the life of the woman would be excluded from a ban. Bans of second-trimester abortions, bans of certain classes of women having abortions, bans that would prevent women who have serious and long lasting health needs to have abortions, would be significantly approved by this Court if the rational basis standard were adopted, precisely because of a formulation that the state's interest is compelling throughout pregnancy and sufficient to override any liberty interests, any interests of the woman to choose or not choose a pregnancy. 'The Hallmark of Roe' And, in fact, that is why this Court must go back to the hallmark of Roe. That is, again reaffirm that the right to choose abortion is fundamental. And only when the Government can show a compelling purpose -- as recognized in Roe that is, a compelling purpose after the point of viability -- should it be able to sustain a statute. The second point I wanted to raise goes to the question of the rights by numbers approach articulated by the Commonwealth. It is our view that the husband notification statute applies to every single married woman in Pennsylvania. That the rights of autonomy, the rights of communication within the family, are infringed because those communications are subject to criminal prosecution, and subject to independent district attorneys subpoenaing women and probing the communications between husband and wife.

748-> COMMENCEMENT; Williams Graduates Are Asked to Help Others
John Hope Franklin, the professor emeritus of history at Duke University, told graduates at the 203d commencement at Williams College to fight racism, urban decay and homelessness by participating in politics. Calling the government "guilty of the most outrageous conduct in defrauding you and me as well as those in need," he said that graduates could remedy inequality by spending an hour or two each week to aid the homeless or teach the illiterate. "You must demand that taxpayers' money be used for constructive purposes," Mr. Franklin said. "Refuse to be beguiled by selfish, scheming politicians whose interest in you is demonstrated only when they are on the campaign trail seeking your votes." A scholar of Southern and black history, Mr. Franklin said that Ronald Reagan and George Bush had triggered the resurfacing of racism in this country. But he offered a glimmer of hope. "What better way for you to take on your role as responsible, maturing citizens that to insist that the American ideal of equality of race, sex, religion and ethnic groups be adhered to because that ideal was bought and paid for by all, regardless of race." The university in Williamstown, Mass., conferred 520 bachelor's degrees, 11 master's degrees in art history and 14 master's degrees in economics. In addition to Mr. Franklin, other honorary degrees were given to Jacqueline K. Barton, professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology; William M. Chace, president of Wesleyan University; John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive of Banc One Corporation, and Sir Brian Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General at the United Nations.

749-> COMPANY NEWS; 10 Million Air Travelers May Share in Settlement
Lawyers estimated yesterday that up to 10 million airline ticket buyers could be eligible to share in a settlement by American, Delta, United and USAir, the carriers that on Monday announced an agreement to pay more than $400 million to settle a suit charging them with conspiring to fix prices. Almost anyone who bought a ticket on the four airlines for domestic travel since Jan. 1, 1988, and who passed through any of the carriers' two dozen hubs is expected to be eligible. But the volume of telephone calls from potential claimants was small yesterday. Both the airlines and travel agents reported receiving only a handful of inquiries -- perhaps because the annnouncement came too late on Monday to be in many newspapers yesterday. "We didn't get any calls," said Mayo Read of Palmetto Travel Service in Charleston, S.C. "But I expect we will be getting some, and we'll be ready for them." Office Is Set Up Airline reservations agents were telling inquirers yesterday: if you think you may be eligible to share in the settlement, send a card or letter to Airline Antitrust Litigation, P.O. Box 209, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107. Then, if the settlement is approved by a Federal court in Atlanta, probably early this fall, the litigation center will give potential claimants additional information about how to proceed. Some settlement money is also earmarked for advertisements aimed at notifying potential claimants. The two-year-old class-action suit contended that the carriers had used a code to signal, through the computerized reservation system of the Airline Tariff Publishing Company of Washington, whether prices were going up or down. Even while agreeing to the settlement, the airlines denied the charges Renee Kastanakis, a partner in the Atlanta law firm of Carr, Tabb & Pope, the law firm for the plaintiffs, said she was not certain what proof of eligibility would be required. "But I wouldn't throw away any proof of purchase," she said. Vouchers Are Expected While the case is one of the biggest class-action cases ever, the awards will not put cash directly into the pockets of eligible passengers. Instead, the airlines will provide vouchers for up to 10 percent off the price of most future tickets and 20 percent off round-trip tickets priced at less than $100. The vouchers will be interchangeable among the four carriers. As big as the settlement was, its scope was blunted by the fact that Pan American and Midway, which were also defendants in the suit, have since gone out of business, while Continental Airlines, another defendant, is in bankruptcy proceedings. Northwest and Trans World Airlines agreed last year to settle -- Northwest for $5 million in cash and $11.5 million in discount vouchers, T.W.A. for $1 million cash and $20 million in vouchers. Their agreements have received preliminary court approval, but final approval is expected to be part of the larger settlement.

752-> British Are Planning to Remove A-Arms From Ships and Aircraft
The British Government said today that it would remove tactical nuclear weapons from all Royal Navy surface ships and attack aircraft as part of a program to dismantle all but "an absolute minimum" of Britain's nuclear stockpile. The announcement, by the British Defense Ministry, is in line with a similar declaration by President Bush, who pledged last fall that United States would remove tactical nuclear weapons from American surface ships and sea-based attack aircraft. The British announcement also came as the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, arrived in Washington for a summit meeting in which he and President Bush are to try to reach agreement on sharp new reductions in their nuclear arsenals. Defense Ministry officials, however, said the decision to announce the reductions today was made independent of the meeting. British military officials emphasized that the cutbacks would not include strategic nuclear missiles deployed aboard their Polaris submarines, as well as Trident submarines on order from the United States. The British will also maintain a stock of free-fall tactical nuclear bombs for use by Royal Air Force Tornadoes. 'A Changed Climate' Since October, Britain has reduced the number of its nuclear weapons by more than 50 percent, a spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry said. "It's significant in that it is a further indication that we live in a changed climate," Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today. "The world is a different place." Combined with its conventional forces, Mr. Rifkind said he was confident that the remaining submarine-based strategic missiles and nuclear bombs would be adequate to serve Britain's security. The announcement today means that naval ships will no longer carry nuclear bombs and nuclear depth charges. In addition, carrier-borne aircraft and helicopters, as well as land-based aircraft assigned to sea battle zones, will no longer deploy nuclear weapons. The British weapons will be destroyed, and the American weapons deployed among British forces will be returned to the United States, Mr. Rifkind said. In Line With NATO Accord Although the decision today was made unilaterally, it is in line not only with the American initiative but also with an agreement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last fall to reduce the overall tactical nuclear stockpile in the hands of member states by more than 80 percent. Last autumn, Britain announced that it was cutting the number of Royal Air Force nuclear attack squadrons to 8, from 11, and reducing by half its stockpile of WE177 free-fall nuclear bombs. Last year the Government also removed all nuclear-tipped Lance ground-to-ground missiles and nuclear artillery shells in the arsenals of British forces stationed in Germany. Former Defense Secretary Tom King declared last fall that the Royal Navy would stop carrying nuclear weapons under normal circumstances, but today's announcement bars their deployment entirely.

753-> Bridge
A women's team match played in Corpus Christi, Tex., a week ago in the Pan-American Championships had a meaning on two levels, one of which escaped the attention of the officials, the press and the players most concerned. In a match that ended at 2 A.M., but was not scored, for technical reasons, until 4 A.M., a team consisting of Gail Greenberg, Dorothy Truscott, Judy Tucker, Lisa Berkowitz, Randi Montin and Pam Wittes eked out a win by 7 imps. This team then went on to win the Pan-American title. The losing team, which had qualified a month earlier to represent the United States in the 1992 world championship to be played in Italy in August, included Jacqui Mitchell, who has been vying with Truscott for many years, in a friendly New York City rivalry between ex-teammates, for the title of world's top-ranked woman player. Mitchell had a small lead in world master points from 1986 to 1987, and it went unnoticed that the players were exactly tied between 1987 and 1990. Mitchell then gained 2 points for placing 65th in a world championship in Geneva, an example of the inflation that affects bridge players as well as consumers around the world. Truscott's victory in Corpus Christi gave her 8 points and a 6-point lead, putting her back in the top spot that she held from 1978 to 1986. But Mitchell is likely to strike back in August, for her team will be among the favorites in Italy. (The World Bridge Federation has recently complicated matters by deciding to multiply all master points by a factor of 10). In the diagramed deal, played a year ago in a major team event, Truscott demonstrated a playing maneuver that is often overlooked. She reached four spades as shown, after West had made a weak jump in clubs, and the club ace was led. A shift to diamonds, allowing the defense to take two quick tricks in that suit, would no doubt have defeated the contract, and did in the replay: South had no reason to know that the heart queen was in the West hand, and took a normal finesse in that suit. Against Truscott, however, West persevered with a second club in the hope that East could ruff. After winning with the king, South drew trumps by leading to the ace and cashed the ace and king of hearts. This was a safe way to guard against the possibility of a doubleton queen in the West hand. As it happened this play provided two overtricks, for both dummy's diamonds were discarded on heart winners. But the contract would have been safe whenever East held the heart queen, for South would have crossed to dummy with a trump and led a heart. West would have had no chance to lead a diamond, and the heart jack would have provided a discard for a diamond loser in the dummy.

754-> Rise in Sales-Tax Revenue Eases Suffolk Deficit and Layoff Plans
A welcome increase in sales-tax revenues has eased Suffolk County's financial crisis and enabled officials to reconsider plans to borrow money, cut wages and lay off county employees. After a year and a half of declining sales-tax revenues, collections in the county this year are up about 3.5 percent from the same period in 1991, with all of the gains coming in the second quarter. "And if the trend holds, we may have enough to wipe out the 1992 deficit," said James Spero, deputy director of the County Legislature's Office of Budget Review. Earlier this year, budget analysts predicted a sales-tax shortfall of $25 million. That estimate has now been reduced to $14 million, about equal to the county's 1992 budget deficit. "We couldn't be more pleased," said Tim Ryan, a spokesman for County Executive Robert J. Gaffney. "This is extremely encouraging." Citing an increase in tourism during the second quarter as a possible factor in the brighter revenue picture, he added, "We hope it's a trend that will hold." Albany Cuts Crisis Aid Only last week Mr. Gaffney announced that the deficit in the county's $1.3 billion budget had been reduced from $91 million to $47 million. Most of that gap -- $36 million -- was left over from 1991; the remaining $11 million was for this year. Mr. Gaffney said the reduction in the deficit resulted from cost-cutting measures, faster payments from the state for social services and lower-than-expected pension costs. Because of Suffolk's improving finances, negotiators in Albany today reduced the county's request for deficit borrowing power from $91 million to $71 million, according to Michael D. O'Donohoe, a Conservative and a member of the county's bipartisan legislative coalition. He said the bailout may still be necessary if the deficit ballooned again. "But if the sales tax revenues continue to come in, we may balance this year's budget and use general-obligation bonds to pay off last year's deficit without asking for any help from Albany," he said. Mr. Spero warned, meanwhile, that the county could be hit later this year by a sharp drop in property-tax revenues. He recalled that last year the county came up $100 million short because of nonpayment of taxes. "This left us with a real cash shortage," he said. "And there are no guarantees there won't be another shortfall this year." All property taxes in Suffolk are collected at the town level, Mr. Spero said, then distributed to school districts, library districts, the towns themselves and finally the county, in that order. "The county is at the end of the line, and if the collections come up short, we end up holding the empty bag," he said. He said the school districts get most of the property taxes collected by the towns, about 70 percent, while the county gets about 20 percent. Property taxes make up only 14 percent of the county's general-fund revenues, Mr. Spero said, while sales-tax receipts, which are collected by the state, contribute nearly 42 percent. State and Federal aid make up 30 percent, with the remaining 14 percent coming from various fees. He said that Suffolk outperformed both the state and Nassau County in the second quarter. Sales-tax receipts for the state were up 1.3 percent, while Nassau's were flat. Six weeks ago, the prospect of a $91 million deficit led Mr. Gaffney to propose an across-the-board 10 percent pay cut for county workers and the layoff of 1,300 employees, including 300 police officers. That threat has subsided, as has the threat of a property-tax increase, thanks to the higher sales-tax revenues. "Things are looking rosier," Mr. O'Donohoe said. Mr. Gaffney and the bipartisan county legislative coalition are now discussing the possibility of dropping the layoff plan, reducing the pay cut to 5 percent and limiting it to 400 nonunion employees.

755-> Czechs Right, Slovaks Left; Nationwide Elections Yield No Natural Alloy
Voters in Czechoslovakia this weekend demonstrated one of the hard new truths reshaping Eastern Europe's political landscape: just as the impulse for democracy once brought people together, the democratic process is now helping to split them apart. Only 30 months after millions joined in the so-called Velvet Revolution in 1989, which gained free elections and an end to Communist rule, people in the two halves of Czechoslovakia handed down completely contradictory mandates in voting that ended Saturday. They produced a new federal Parliament so polarized on the basic questions of economic reform and national integrity that the only assured outcome is political disarray and confrontation. East vs. West, Still In Slovakia, the economically distressed eastern region that had been more closely tied to the disintegrating markets of the old Soviet bloc, the largest share of the vote went to leftist candidates opposed to economic reform. Voters gave the biggest block of seats to allies of Vladimir Meciar, a shrewd populist and former Communist who vowed today to press ahead with plans to create a sovereign Slovak state, threatening to split the 74-year-old federation. In the Czech republic, the western half of the nation, where the economy is sound and unemployment low, voters handed about 30 percent of their ballots to followers of Vaclav Klaus, an autocratic right-wing economist who wants to push ahead with Western-style market reforms. While the outcome mirrors the peculiar economic and cultural divide of the two Czechoslovak republics, the sharp polarization of political ranks that only two years ago were marching confidently in lockstep reflects the trauma that change has forced on Eastern and Central Europe. Euphoria has given way to doubt and disillusion as post-Soviet societies wrestle with the problems and dashed hopes that have been brought to the fore by the push toward economic and democratic reform. Precedents to the East In elections in Poland last year, a Parliament once dominated by former dissidents and veterans of the Solidarity movement shattered into 29 parties, including some who want to put the brakes on economic reform. In Lithuania, a leftist bloc has so frustrated the reform plans of Vytautas Landsbergis, the head of the Parliament, that he asked the people in a referendum last month to give him increased executive power to break the deadlock. The measure failed because not enough people turned out to vote. It is a telling measure of the new mood that the revolution that began so hopefully has now devoured its young. In the balloting here, nearly all the political leaders and parties who emerged from Civic Forum and Public Against Violence, the broad democratic fronts that forced the surrender of Communism, disappeared from the political picture, failing to earn enough votes to get a seat in Parliament. Anti-Havel, Pro-Havel More important, Mr. Meciar, in the flush of victory, declared today he would also work to unseat President Vaclav Havel, the former playwright and poet who has become a symbol of the democratic movements straining to reshape Eastern Europe. For his part, Mr. Klaus said he intended to keep Mr. Havel as President when the Parliament considers the question next month. Mr. Klaus and Mr. Meciar are to meet Monday to begin negotiations toward forming a new Government from among 12 political parties. "It is a well-known thing that those who prepare revolution always seem to pay for it the most," said Jarina Sikolva, a sociologist in Prague. While the new Parliament here is not as fragmented as Poland's, the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly now represents a confused jigsaw. A rule requiring parties to get at least 5 percent of the vote to qualify for a place in Parliament eliminated most of the more than 70 parties seeking seats in the Federal Assembly and in the two republics' Parliaments. Who Won Where In the final tally, Mr. Klaus, the Civic Democratic Party and its right-wing coalition won just over 33 percent of the ballots cast in the Czech republic for the national Parliament and about 30 percent of the vote for the Czech Parliament. In the Slovak republic, Mr. Meciar and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won a nearly identical share of the ballots cast for the national Parliament and about 37 percent of the vote for the Slovak Parliament. While Mr. Klaus and Mr. Meciar dominated their republics' legislatures and the national Parliament, the next largest bloc belongs to leftists and former Communists, who gained about 14 percent of the vote, about the same share they got in the 1990 elections. In Slovakia, the Hungarian People's Party, professing to speak for a restive minority, got 8 percent of the vote and nationalists favoring outright independence got more than 7 percent. In the Czech republic, nationalists from Moravia, a separate region within the republic, also got into Parliament, with nearly 6 percent of the vote. 'Infinite Shades of Gray' "Before, it was all black and white, them against the Communists," said a Western diplomat in Prague. "But as we have gone farther from the revolution, everyone sees it is more complicated and more difficult; there are too many special interests, too many demands. Now it's just infinite shades of gray." Arnsod Lustig, a Czech writer who emigrated to America in the late 1960's but returned to Prague to vote, said he was struck by the uncertainty that seems to have seized the nation. "I have the impression of people who are groping in the dark, like blind men," he said. "They seem to be so unsure of themselves." The nascent democratic institutions need to cope not only with their own ambitions and special interests but also with the enormous problems of legal and economic reforms and with more volatile questions of ethnic minorities and nationalist tensions. Not Quite So Democratic In Slovakia, while Mr. Meciar has vowed to pursue the idea of a sovereign state, it is not clear whether the citizens want outright independence. A poll taken before the election suggested that only one in five Slovaks preferred an independent state. "Eastern Europe's political parties cannot provide the cohesive force required for the operation of a democracy," said Jonathan Eyal, of Britain's Institute for Defense Studies, in a recent essay. "Despite their manifestoes, these parties either espouse narrow economic interest or seek to safeguard regional, religious or ethnic rights." In the case of Mr. Klaus and Mr. Meciar, it appears that the idealism of revolution has given way, perhaps predictably, to a kind of hard-knuckled political pragmatism embodied in visceral, strong-minded politicians who are less interested in consensus and more sharply confrontational in pursuing their agendas. Their high-profile campaigns were part of the reason that turnout was so high: Nearly 86 percent of the 11.3 million voters went to the polls. Such enthusiasm offered little solace to veterans of the old pro-democracy front, many of whom are in a state of near depression, seeing their aspirations for democracy and reform strained by political divisions. "Free elections are a dream that has been fulfilled," said Antonin Pridal, a television commentator from Brno. "But it's a good thing it's just once in four years."

757-> The Password Is . . .
How do the computer intruders known as hackers break into huge multimillion-dollar systems? Even relatively secure computers exchange messages using special programs, which can ask for passwords. So, like lax guards who let a familiar mail carrier into Fort Knox, a computer lets in a hacker if he has the password identifying him as a program that distributes messages. But how do hackers get these initial passwords that allow them to begin their mischief? Skilled computer hackers can break into national computer networks and detect passwords as they are being used. Others rummage through trash bins behind buildings, reading discarded technical manuals. They may then pose on the telephone as computer technicians to cajole yet more information from company employees. Legitimate users, most of them not computer literate, want computer services to be easy to use, but that makes them relatively easy to crack. TRW Information Services, the credit-information agency, does not call back users like banks and mortgage companies to verify their identities. TRW says that with up to a million credit requests a day, taking minutes instead of seconds to fill them would hurt business. And such delays would also hurt the economy, the company contends, by making credit information more difficult to process. What can be done to tighten security? At TRW, new terminals have critical passwords hidden in the machines themselves, so TRW customers have no secrets to divulge to hackers. But smaller subscribers tend to hold onto outmoded terminals. One computer intruder coaxed the password out of an auto dealer's secretary by saying he needed it to repair the computer, according to TRW.

760-> CREDIT MARKETS; 3 Reasons to Put Aside Worries About Inflation
With recent increases in the price of oil and other important commodities and signs that economic recovery will not fade this year the way it did in 1991, some credit market participants are starting to worry that the best news on inflation may be about over. But such market concerns are not shared by a wide range of current and former policy makers. Last week, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, made what seemed an uncharacteristically bold prediction when he said that inflation pressures would remain low for two to three years. Using that forecast as a platform, Mr. Greenspan said in the next breath that the inflation-expectation premium reflected in current bond yields was much too high. Frustration on Long-Term Rates "It is pretty heroic to go out that far with a forecast," said William Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm in New York. "And it seems to us that it is quite an undertaking to say that inflation is not a problem going forward." In part, Mr. Greenspan was voicing frustration over the Fed's inability to get long-term market interest rates below the range of 7.75 percent to 8.25 percent, where they have remained for well over a year, even as short-term rates have plummeted. But despite Mr. Griggs's reservations, a number of private economists said they found no fault with the Fed chairman's outlook. With prices rising at a rate of about 3 percent a year, "we haven't been in an inflation environment this benign in 20 years," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "And yet long-term rates are at least 2 percentage points higher now than they were then." This low-inflation view, economists said, was supported by at least three underlying assumptions: oil prices will remain fairly constant; economic growth for two to three years will be 2 percent to 2.5 percent, and private credit demand will not rebound strongly once recovery is in place. And the analysts said there were sound reasons to embrace all three. Although reports of a change in Saudi production plans have pushed oil prices up recently, analysts said supply-and-demand fundamentals provided little reason to expect a continued increase. "I look at sluggish growth everywhere around the world, and more supply coming on stream from places like Kuwait and other countries," said Paul D. Mastroddi, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. "Over the long run, higher oil prices does not impress me as a story that is fundamentally sound." Similarly, the economy does not seem to have the ability to expand at a sustainable clip of more than 2 to 2.5 percent. And inflation triggers that might be pulled if growth is faster -- including rising wages and price increases induced by factories operating at close to full capacity -- pose no threat for the foreseeable future. "Wage inflation has never, ever gone up when the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent, which is considered to be when the country is at full employment," Mr. Mastroddi said. "And even if the economy grows at a 4 percent rate for three years, it would take all that time to use up the excess capacity we have currently." Rather than reflecting expectations of future inflation, some market participants said fears of a clash between public and private credit demand explained why bond yields remained so high. "I take some comfort from Mr. Greenspan's view that the inflationary prospects are encouraging, and I don't think the market is quarreling with that view, " said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, primary dealers in Government securities. "I think the Federal budget deficit is the reason for the premium. We are conducting our Federal finances like a banana republic." For the last year or more, ballooning budget deficits have been financed fairly easily, in large part because private credit demand has been extremely weak. But many assume that condition will change as the economy improves, and businesses begin to borrow at a healthier clip. Charles Clough Jr., chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, does not share that assumption. "You are not going to see a resurgence in private borrowing," he said. "That will make it hard to get a rise in inflation." Real Estate and Money Supply In large part, Mr. Clough's view is based on the probability that real estate lending, which represented nearly two-thirds of all the credit produced in the 1980's, will not recover. In addition, Mr. Clough puts much stock in movements in M-3, the Fed's broadest monetary aggregate, which measures total bank deposits. "Those deposits are the major engine of credit, and as a consequence M-3 is the best early-warning indicator that borrowing and spending are picking up," he said. "M-3 grew at double-digit rates in the 1970's. Now, for the first time in history, M-3 growth on a year-over-year basis is negative." Going forward, Mr. Clough said, "M-3 won't grow much, private credit demand won't come back and inflation won't become systemic." The bad news, Mr. Clough added, is that it may take an entire business cycle to convince bond investors that the credit cycle, which pushed inflation-adjusted interest rates to their highest levels ever in the 1980's and early 1990's, is finally over.

761-> BASEBALL: NATIONAL LEAGUE; Phillies Stop Pirates And Halt Streak at 5
Phillies 4, Pirates 1 PITTSBURGH, June 15 (AP) -- Terry Mulholland, one of baseball's best starters the last six weeks, stopped Pittsburgh on five hits and the Philadelphia Phillies halted the Pirates' winning streak at five games with a 4-1 victory tonight. The Pirates, who took a season-high five-game lead in the National League East into the game, played without Barry Bonds, who strained a muscle in his right rib cage on Sunday at Shea Stadium. Bonds, the National League's home run leader, was, however, reported to be much improved. He will be re-evaluated Wednesday following two days of therapy and a decision whether to place him on the 15-day disabled list will not be made until at least then. In a rematch of last Wednesday's pitching duel with Zane Smith (5-5) -- both allowed only a run apiece in Pittsburgh's 2-1 victory in Philadelphia -- Mulholland (6-4) won for the sixth time in his last seven decisions. Mulholland has four complete games in nine starts since May 1 and has given up only eight hits and two earned runs in 17 innings in his last two starts, both against the Pirates. Braves 2, Dodgers 0 ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Avery outdueled Orel Hershiser as Atlanta beat Los Angeles' pitching ace for the first time in five seasons. Avery (5-5) scattered five hits, walked one and struck out three as the Braves won their fifth in a row and 14th in 16 games. Avery is 7-1 lifetime against the Dodgers, 2-1 this season. It was Avery's second shutout of the season and second complete game. He won his third straight decision. Los Angeles has lost five in a row. Hershiser (6-4) had won 12 straight decisions in 14 starts against Atlanta dating back to Aug. 8, 1987. Reds 7, Giants 5 CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Reds' Chris Sabo hit a two-run double that highlighted a four-run fifth inning and later was in the middle of a bench-clearing incident. The Reds won their fourth straight and their 16th in 20 games by overcoming a 4-1 deficit in the fifth. Sabo's double off Bud Black tied it, and Dave Martinez produced the go-ahead run with a pinch sacrifice fly off Mike Jackson (2-2). Hal Morris added a two-run double in the seventh off Kelly Downs as the National League West leaders moved a season-high 12 games over .500. Norm Charlton, in relief of Tom Browning (5-4), gave up two hits in two innings for his 15th save. In the eighth, the Giants' Darren Lewis doubled and stole third, sliding hard into Sabo. The play brought both teams onto the field, but no blows were exchanged. Cubs 7, Cardinals 1 CHICAGO (AP) -- Greg Maddux pitched a four-hitter and drove in two runs for Chicago and Hector Villanueva emerged from a slump with a three-run homer and a double. Chicago won its fifth straight game, its longest winning streak since May 22-26, 1991. St. Louis has dropped 13 of 18. Maddux (7-6) improved to 3-0 against the Cardinals this season. He walked one and struck out five in pitching his third complete game. Bob Tewksbury (6-2) who entered the game with the National League's best earned run average, 2.00, was roughed up for five runs, four of them earned, on nine hits and one walk in six innings. Padres 7, Astros 1 HOUSTON (AP) -- Craig Lefferts, bidding for his first-ever complete game, pitched seven shutout innings before tiring in the eighth as San Diego beat Houston. Lefferts (8-4) gave up seven hits, struck out three and walked two. He left after Eric Anthony doubled and Scott Servais singled with two outs in the eighth. Lefferts, who started five games for the Chicago Cubs in 1983, was moved out of the bullpen after the Padres acquired Randy Myers in the winter. Lefferts had made 12 previous starts this year. The Padres battered Butch Henry (1-6) with four runs in the first inning, highlighted by Dan Walters's two-run single.

763-> Topics of The Times; When Readers Really Scream
Over the Fourth of July weekend, Ray March, editor of The Carmel Pine Cone in California, inadvertently left out the crossword puzzle. Looking back, Ray wistfully remembers that some of the resulting phone calls were not really unpleasant, just indignant. Like all good editors he blames the lapse on "some inexplicable transition of type and page formatting." Even so, he moved fast to repair the damage. In a shrewd mea culpa, Ray wiped out most of his front page the following week and filled it with the missing puzzle. And under the headline "We Apologize," he wrote, "May this never happen again." In an editorial, Ray reminded the staff of his 77-year-old paper that they still had a thing or two to learn about their readers. "Caught in our own web," he wrote, "we forget at times that The Carmel Pine Cone is many things to many people: that it's not just the latest 'scoop' or late-breaking story that our readers are looking for. . . . In addition to information -- and hopefully enlightenment -- our readers want entertainment, intellectual challenge, perhaps some simple diversions." Dropping the puzzle, he concluded, "was a sharp reminder that while we are loved, it may be for something other than what we think."

764-> COMPANY NEWS; French Coal Executive To Head Groupe Bull
Bernard Pache, an engineer with no experience in the computer industry, was named today to head the troubled state-owned computer maker Groupe Bull after the dismissal of Francis Lorentz. A statement from Bull, which has piled up losses of almost $2 billion in the last two years and recently allied with I.B.M., did not elaborate on Mr. Pache's surprise appointment, which is to be confirmed formally at a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. For the last six years, Mr. Pache, who is 57 years old, has been the chairman of the state-owned coal group Charbonnages de France. He presided over an extensive restructuring of the coal industry, including the closing of several mines and the elimination of about 28,000 jobs. Fitting a Pattern His appointment to Bull is in line with the French tradition of offering top jobs in state industry to graduates of the country's elite schools who have dedicated their careers to public service. Mr. Pache attended the Polytechnique, France's top engineering school, and later worked for 17 years at the state-owned aluminum company Pechiney, before joining Charbonnages in 1986. Still, the appointment of a man with no experience in the complex and intensely competitive computer market raised some eyebrows. "This reshuffle amounted to a political retaliation against Mr. Lorentz," said Daniel LeBourhis, a French computer industry analyst. "You have to question the wisdom of rocking the boat when Bull is in the midst of a restructuring program." Serge Leclerc, an analyst at the Gartner Group, added that everything would depend on the people Mr. Pache named as his top aides. "Mr. Lorentz had some excellent people in place, and if Mr. Pache keeps them, there should be no problems," he said. Ties to I.B.M. Bull, which established a far-reaching alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation in January, is in the midst of a reorganization that has already involved the closing of 8 of its 13 plants and the loss of 10,000 jobs in the last two years. The products that are the fruit of the I.B.M. alliance, some of them based on a new computing technology known as RISC, or reduced-instruction-set computing, are just being introduced to the market. A spokesman for IBM Europe, Alan Gillings, declined to comment on Mr. Pache's appointment. It was the alliance with I.B.M. and an earlier one with the NEC Corporation of Japan that caused Mr. Lorentz problems with the Government, particularly with former Prime Minister Edith Cresson. Bull executives, who insisted on anonymity, said they did not believe Mr. Pache would radically alter Bull's plans for returning to profitability. Meanwhile, the industry ministry issued a statement saying that "the strategy proposed and pursued by Mr. Lorentz is not being put into question." Specialist in Cutbacks Mr. Pache has the reputation of being a hands-on manager with a talent for pushing through painful cutbacks without provoking industrial unrest. It appears clear that the Government was dissatisfied with Mr. Lorentz's management and that it wanted a return to profitability. Mr. Pache declined to comment. A Bull spokesman said that his task should be eased by the European Community's approval today of a state injection of 6.6 billion francs ($1.3 billion) into the company. Of this money, 4 billion francs is to be spent to recapitalize the company and 2.6 billion francs for research and development.

765-> Holtzman Faults Cost of Medical Jail Cells
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman criticized the New York City Correction Department yesterday for spending $18 million to build 42 medical jail cells for inmates with tuberculosis. Correction Commissioner Catherine M. Abate agreed that the project was costly, but she and other city officials said it would help protect inmates, prison employees and the public from the contagious disease. Ms. Abate also said Ms. Holtzman's office had signed off on the estimated cost of the project. United States District Court Judge Morris E. Lasker ordered the city in January to get emergency clearance to build the new units, which are nearly twice the cost of a normal prison cell. The cells are part of a planned 148-bed project. Ms. Holtzman is running for a Democratic Senate nomination.

767-> Feeling Prisons' Costs, Governors Look at Alternatives
After years of discussing ever-tougher measures to reduce crime rates, the nation's governors are exploring alternatives to prison for nonviolent offenders. Many say that both the criminal and society benefit from such alternatives, like half-way houses, home confinement and supervised probation with regular jobs. And criminal-justice experts say that virtually every state is expanding these programs. About a dozen governors discussed the issue here this week at the annual convention of the National Governors Association during a meeting of its Committee on Justice and Public Safety. The governors said the most compelling reason for more of these programs, originally developed as "humane" alternatives that emphasize rehabilitation over punishment, is that they cost much less than building and operating prisons. "It is absolutely insane the amount of money we spend on corrections," Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia said in an interview, referring to the $25 billion a year spent by all levels of government on operating prisons and jails. But the governors are concerned that efforts to broaden the programs could be slowed by political fears that they might be portrayed as "soft on crime." "What we have been doing is not right," Mr. Wilder said. "But it's very difficult for politicians, and I am one of them, to say we have been wrong and that we've got to revisit, revise and restructure the whole system." Criminal justice experts at the conference said the support among governors for alternatives to prison could reflect a shift in public policy away from prison terms toward a combination of punishment and rehabilitation in a community. "The governors are at a turning point," said Kenneth F. Schoen, who as the Corrections Commissioner in Minnesota in the early 1970's was a pioneer in alternative sentencing programs. Mr. Schoen, who is now with the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a New York philanthropy concerned about change in the correctional system, said: "States will never have enough money for these lower-cost programs until governors and legislators bite the political bullet. They have got to change all those mindless get-tough crime laws and mandatory minimum sentencing statutes that they passed in recent years, because these laws and policies are what's creating the explosion in the prison population." Programs in Most States Nearly all states are experimenting with some kind of alternatives for nonviolent offenders. Judges can have the offenders enrolled in drug treatment and vocational and educational programs. Or they can assign them to work for state or nonprofit agencies or at regular jobs. The offenders' earnings are used to support their families and to compensate crime victims. Corrections experts say the main benefit of these programs is that they are 25 to 50 percent less expensive than incarceration. Research indicates that the programs are better for the individual and thus for society. But many experts remain unconvinced that the programs can reduce the rate of recidivism. These programs have grown steadily over the last five years, but relatively few inmates are in them. Last year only 41,500 of the 802,000 offenders in Federal, state and local corrections systems were in alternative programs, according to the Criminal Justice Institute in New York, a private research organization. Studies have found that more than one-third of prison inmates and three-fourths of those in jails are there for nonviolent crimes and might be eligible for alternative sentences. At the same time, state spending on corrections, which is also driven by court orders to reduce overcrowding, quadrupled in the 1980's, reaching 5 percent of state budgets. Punishment programs have remained the second-fastest-growing part of the budgets, behind health costs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the fiscal year 1992, which ended June 30, states spent more than $15 billion operating prison systems and more than $2 billion building prisons. The growth in operating costs is expected to increase, on average, by about 5 percent in the current fiscal year, but spending on construction is expected to double, to about $4 billion, as 112 new prisons are opened to house 75,000 more inmates. An example of the kind of laws that should be rescinded if alternative programs are to be successful is an Alabama statute enacted in the mid-1980's, said Mr. Schoen, of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. The statute requires a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison for anyone with three convictions for stealing property valued at more than $25. "If you steal a few cartons of cigarettes in one night, you could be considered an habitual offender and sentenced to up to 40 years in prison," Mr. Schoen said. Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, a Republican, listed a number of reasons why he believed that alternative programs would work well in his state. He said that half the people entering Alabama's prisons are nonviolent offenders, that almost 70 percent are first-time offenders and that drug or alcohol addiction had a role in crimes committed by 80 percent of the new admissions. Mr. Hunt said the state had made plans for community-based corrections programs, but he added, "The problem, here, too, is funding." Other governors, however, worry that advocating alternative programs will cost them votes. One Governor, Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island, a Democrat, said: "These programs are clearly the right thing to do, no question. But I want to know what it will take to sell these programs because they might leave you open to political pot shots from people who would say you're soft on crime. I'm up for re-election this year, and Willie Horton is as well known in Rhode Island as is Michael Dukakis." Governor Sundlun has reason to be concerned about public reaction to the programs, but perhaps he has reason to be optimistic as well. In a Delaware study in February 1991, for example, most people said they believed that judges were "too soft" on convicted criminals, that most prison sentences should be longer and that the state should make greater use of capital punishment. The study was sponsored by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation and was conducted by the Public Agenda Foundation in New York. Tough Hypothetical Sentences In the study, when instructed to assume the role of judges, the 432 participants gave prison sentences to 17 of 23 hypothetical offenders who had been convicted of crimes ranging from shoplifting to rape. Six offenders got probation, the only alternative offered. The participants were randomly selected to reflect a cross-section of the state's population. But the participants changed their minds about many of the stiff sentences after a three-hour session in which films were shown and a philosophy professor described the pluses and minuses of several alternative programs. The programs included home incarceration, supervised probation combined with community service, probation combined with work to reimburse the victim and military-style boot camp. After the session, the participants sentenced only 5 of the 23 offenders to prison and sent all nonviolent offenders to alternative programs. The study also found that only 32 percent of participants would be willing to pay more taxes to build prisons, and that only 2 percent would accept reductions in education or health-care programs to pay for them. But 67 percent of the participants said they were willing to pay higher taxes to make sure there is enough room for all offenders in the state's drug treatment centers. "The question is not should we invent new alternatives in the community, but should we increase the amount of supervision of people in existing programs," said James Q. Wilson, a public policy analyst and professor of government at the University of California in Los Angeles. "Three-quarters of the people convicted of crimes at any one given time are being supervised on the street -- parole and probation are the dominant forms of punishment and have been for decades." Weld Backs Tough Measures Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, was the only Governor of more than a dozen interviewed at the conference who said he was not impressed by most of the alternative programs. "I'm not Mr. 'alternative sentencing,' " said Mr. Weld, a former United States Attorney in Boston who was elected in 1990 after a campaign that included a pledge to increase the severity of prison sentences. He has proposed spending $450 million on new prisons and $8 million on alternative programs, primarily boot camps for non-violent juvenile offenders. Carole Carpenter, chairwoman of the Justice and Public Safety Committee of the National Association of Counties, called on members of the governors' public safety committee to participate with her organization and the American Bar Association in a "national summit" conference to promote new laws for community corrections programs and new sentencing guidelines. The association released a report this week supporting alternative sentencing programs and the repeal of all mandatory minimum sentences. Reminding governors that jail and prison populations doubled in the last eight years, Ms. Carpenter said half-seriously, "If you make a simple arithmetic calculation, by the year 2053 there will be more Americans in jails and prisons than out."

768-> Fingerprints Introduced in Trial of Ex-C.I.A. Man
Prosecutors in the trial of Clair E. George presented a fingerprint expert today to buttress their contention that the former Central Intelligence Agency official deleted passages from his planned testimony to Congress to mislead lawmakers about the agency's role in the Iran-contra affair. The Government fingerpint analyst testified that Mr. George's prints were found on the pages of a draft of a statement to Congress that was revised to eliminate several details about Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's arms supply pipeline to the contra rebels fighting the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua in the 1980's. Colonel North, a former Marine Corps officer, was a National Security Council staff member in charge of clandestine assistance for the contras. Mr. George is charged with ordering subordinates to delete from the statement important details about the C.I.A.'s knowledge of the arms network. But Mr. George has denied ordering the revisions. Later today two of Mr. George's former colleagues testified as prosecution witnesses. Both Charles Allen, a top intelligence analyst, and Thomas Twetten, who holds Mr. George's former job as director of clandestine operations, the third highest job at the agency, seemed uncomfortable testifying against their former associate. Link to Senate Testimony The fingerprint evidence related to Mr. George's testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, given as the panel was trying to determine whether the C.I.A. was involved in any of the cargo flights into Nicaragua. Last week, Alan D. Fiers Jr., who as one of Mr. George's chief aides headed covert operations in Central America, testified that Mr. George directed him to remove from the draft statement a description of how a program that supplied food, clothing and medical supplies to the contras evolved into Colonel North's secret arms operation. Today, prosecutors introduced two copies of the draft statement that were retrieved from Mr. George's office safe at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va. The drafts described how the Ilopango air base in El Salvador was used as a transit point for supplies to the contras. On one of the documents that had Mr. George's fingerprints, a sentence was crossed out. Edgar E. Corley, a fingerprint expert for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified that he had identified Mr. George's fingerprints on the documents. But he acknowledged under cross-examination by Richard Hibey, Mr. George's defense lawyer, that he could not say when Mr. George touched the documents. Under questioning by the prosecution, Mr. Twetten said Mr. George ordered him to help Colonel North with the secret arms sale to Iran after President Ronald Reagan signed an order on Jan. 17, 1986, authorizing the sale in an effort to free American hostages held in Lebanon. At the time, Mr. Twetten was working for Mr. George as a mid-level official responsible for covert operations in the Middle East. Discussions About SAecord Mr. Twetten recalled discussions with Mr. George about Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general who played a central role in helping Colonel North set up the contra supply network and the arms sale. The extent of Mr. George's knowledge of General Secord is important in the case because Mr. George is charged with perjury for telling the Senate Intelligence Committee in December 1986 that he did not know what role the general played in the arms-for-hostages transactions. Mr. Twetten said he and Mr. George attended a White House meeting on Jan. 20, 1986, when the Iran initiative was spelled out, including Mr. Twetten's role as the coordinator in buying weapons from the Army for transport through General Secord to Iran. "Who charged you with those responsibilities?" asked the prosecutor, Michael Vhay. "Clair George," Mr. Twetten replied. But at several points Mr. Twetten said he could not remember specific discussions with Mr. George about General Secord. And Mr. Twetten said he could not remember if Mr. George has used the cover name of "Copp," but admitted that he had told a grand jury last year that Mr. George did know General Secord's alias.

769-> ON TELEVISION -- ON STAGE; The Ups and Downs of Going Over the Top
Vote for Bill Clinton. But not too early, please. And not too often. Of all the scripted events at a party convention in which the nomination is clinched, the most carefully managed is the formal nomination vote. Last night, in grand old tradition, legions of eager young political aides scrambled around Madison Square Garden bearing messages and counting heads, while campaign higher-ups bargained, wheedled, pleaded and occasionally threatened various delegations. The object: to make certain that the vote went in a way that conveyed the right symbolism. Normally, the nominee's "delegate whips" arrange for some states to pass their voting turn to others so the "right" state casts the votes that give the nominee a majority. This time, the plan was to have the state be Arkansas, Mr. Clinton's home state. But Arkansas comes second in the alphabet and has only 48 votes. That made the margin of error slim. The Brown delegates were giving the Clinton camp a hard time. Their group from Colorado, for example, had threatened to ruin Mr. Clinton's night by voting for him and throwing off the count. So another way was found. Alabama, first in the alphabet, passed its turn to vote to Arkansas -- after much long-winded speechifying by its leaders that prompted shouts of "Vote, vote, vote" from other delegations. Then Mr. Clinton's mother, Virginia Kelley, cast Arkansas's votes, the first 48 for her son. It was Ohio, in the end, that put Mr. Clinton over the top. Movie Director Holds Forth What was the question again? Debates at the Democratic National Convention on platform planks and party rules can get pretty arcane, very political and sometimes downright obscure. Take, for example, when Oliver Stone, director of the movie "J.F.K.," mounted the podium last night, ostensibly to offer support for a minority proposal backed by the delegates pledged to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. that would have called for a mid-term party gathering in 1994. But Mr. Stone, like many of the other boisterous Brown partisans, had a lot to say and did not think his team was being given enough time to say it. So he used his time on the podium to talk about some of his favorite subjects. "We're tired of the C.I.A. and the lying," Mr. Stone shouted. "We're tired of being treated like kindergarten students who cannot be trusted with their own true history. Open the file. All the files. J.F.K., R.F.K., M.L.K., the cold war." The Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Stone said, "must be broken and its history must be revealed, like the Nazi Party in Germany." Gore Takes the Lead On Spelling Issue Well, now we know he can say it, but can he spell it? During his speech to the convention last night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson made a joking reference to Senator Al Gore's forthcoming contest with Vice President Dan Quayle and to Mr. Quayle's famous "potato with an 'e' " gaffe. Mr. Gore, he declared confidently, could spell a long word that Mr. Jackson had made up for the occasion. Today, the Tennessee Senator decided to prove Mr. Jackson right when he appeared in the convention hall in Madison Square Garden at 4:29 P.M. to be shown where to stand when he accepts his nomination on Thursday night. Stepping to the microphone, Mr. Gore, not exactly known for being a stand-up comic, paused, grinned at the several dozen spectators in the hall at that early hour before the convention resumed, and rattled off Mr. Jackson's word: "Chloro-fluoro-antidisestablishmentarianism." Robert Kennedy Remembered With Tears While most Americans can turn the convention on and off at will by switching channels on their television sets, the proceedings are a test of patience for the 5,000 delegates and alternates. Yesterday, they blew whistles, fidgeted with their signs and talked to friends while speakers droned on. But there were times when they were riveted. And for two women in the Massachusetts delegation, like most of the others, one of those moments came during the presentation of a filmed tribute to Robert F. Kennedy. "Yes, yes," Lisa McBirney, 28 years old, of Quincy, Mass., said over and over, her eyes brimming with tears. One row and one generation ahead of her, Sheryl Marshall, 42, of Newton, Mass., said, "That was my youth. He would have been the first person I voted for. Twenty-four years ago, I was full of hope. I thought we were going to change the world. I feel that way now for the first time since then."

772-> Disappointed Astronauts Prepare Return
After the disappointing failure of their experiment in tethered space flight, the astronauts of the space shuttle Atlantis settled down to routine science and engineering tests yesterday before preparing to return to Earth tomorrow. The shuttle is scheduled to end its eight-day mission with a landing at 7:39 A.M. at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said they had not determined the cause of the jammed deployment machinery and snarled lines that forced the astronauts on Wednesday to abandon their futile efforts to reel out a half-ton satellite on the end of a 12-mile cable. This was the first time the concept of tethered flight had been tested on an ambitious scale, the result of a 20-year-old idea and a program on which the United States and Italy had spent $376 million. Electric Motors Suspected Charles Shaw, the mission's chief flight director, said engineers would not know the cause of the malfunctions until they could inspect the equipment on the ground. He did absolve the satellite, developed by the Italian Space Agency, of any responsibility in the failure of the tether to unwind any more than 850 feet. Preliminary analysis during the deployment attempt, officials said, seemed to point to trouble in the design or operation of the electric motors, reel and pulleys that fed the line out from the shuttle cargo bay and should have enabled the satellite to drift miles above Atlantis. NASA developed the deployment system, and it was built by the Martin Marietta Corporation in Denver. There was one bright note in the mission's day. The European science satellite, deployed on Sunday and held up in a low orbit because of suspected navigation problems, was finally boosted yesterday toward its planned operational orbit 315 miles above Earth. The European Retrievable Carrier, or Eureca, is supposed to remain in orbit for 10 months studying the effects of microgravity on biological and material processes. After Eureca was deployed, its thruster jets were fired to send the craft away from the shuttle and into a higher orbit. But the firing was halted after five minutes when flight controllers received signals that the craft was tilted off its proper orientation. This could have sent Eureca speeding off in the wrong direction. By halting the maneuver, Eureca was left in an orbit only a few miles above the shuttle's. Eureca's Thrusters Were Fired Engineers at the European Space Agency's control center in Darmstadt, Germany, traced the problem to a calibration error in a Sun sensor, which allows the craft to align itself properly for flight, said Daria Robinson, a spokeswoman for the European agency. She said the error caused the sensor to respond prematurely to the slightest variations in the craft's orientation, thus triggering the shutdown of the thruster jets. New instructions for the craft's computers corrected the problem. Early yesterday, Eureca's thrusters were fired to raise the satellite from a 275-mile-high orbit to one that ranged in altitude from 287 miles to 315 miles. European flight controllers planned another thruster firing today to circularize the orbit at 315 miles. Some of the craft's science instruments have already been switched on and are performing normally, Ms. Robinson said. Those with experiments especially sensitive to microgravity conditions would not be turned on until after the satellite's final ascent maneuver, when there should be no further vibrations. The $213 million Eureca is supposed to be recovered by another shuttle crew, probably next April or May. For their remaining time in orbit, the Atlantis astronauts tried to complete a variety of experiments involving instruments examining the effects of the environment outside the shuttle on electronic and industrial materials and on the reliability of scientific sensors. The pilots steered Atlantis to a lower orbit of 138 miles, down from 184 miles, to begin the tests. One set of instruments in the open cargo bay was used to evaluate the effects of atomic oxygen, a major constituent of the extremely tenuous atmosphere in low Earth orbit, on metals, plastics and composite materials that might be part of future space vehicles. Scientists want to see how much damage could be expected from interactions with the atomic oxygen and also with solar ultraviolet radiation. The astronauts on board Atlantis are Col. Loren J. Shriver of the Air Force, Maj. Andrew M. Allen of the Marine Corps; Marsha S. Ivins; Dr. Jeffrey A. Hoffman, Dr. Franklin R. Chang-Diaz; Dr. Claude Nicollier, the first astronaut from Switzerland, and Dr. Franco Malerba, the first Italian to fly in space.

773-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Off in Quiet Trading; Jobless Report Is Awaited
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday in quiet trading as currency dealers awaited the data on July unemployment. Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349 an ounce, down 20 cents from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $349.50 an ounce, off $3.50. Currency dealers said the market shrugged off the weekly jobless-claims report. It said claims for unemployment benefits soared by 69,000 in late July -- the biggest one-week jump in more than a decade -- but analysts said this reflected a two-week shutdown by General Motors. Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said most dealers were awaiting the July unemployment report due out today. The currency markets keep a close watch on unemployment figures because they provide a good reading on the health of the economy. If unemployment worsens, the Federal Reserve is more likely to lower interest rates to help jump-start the economic recovery, a move that could hurt the value of the United States dollar. In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at 127.53 Japanese yen, up from 127.30 yen on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 127.70 yen in London, and at 127.65 yen in New York, up from 127.55 yen Wednesday. The dollar turned mixed against the British pound. Sterling fetched $1.9080 in London, down from $1.9135 on Wednesday, and $1.9150 in New York, up from $1.9075. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4775 German marks, down from 1.4815 German marks; 1.3265 Swiss francs, down from 1.3300; 4.9915 French francs, down from 5.0050; 1,117.25 Italian lire, down from 1,120.00, and 1.8505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18375. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday, were: 1.4815 German marks, up from 1.4775; 1.3305 Swiss francs, up from 1.3240; 5.0060 French francs, up from 4.9889; 1.6705 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6655; 1,120.25 Italian lire, up from 1,116.75.

774-> Punjab Violence Eases as Police Claim Successes
Heavily armed policemen stormed a comfortable villa in this crowded city in early August and captured India's most wanted Sikh militant. A few hours later, the police announced that the arrested man, Sukhdev Singh Babbar, who had posed successfully as an affluent builder here for four years, was dead. The circumstances of his death are still unclear. At first, the police said he was killed in a gun battle outside the city. Now the police say that he was unarmed and that he killed himself by biting on a cyanide capsule. A third report said that Mr. Babbar was shot by the police after his capture. In the last 10 years, thousands of people have died in the rebellion by militant Sikhs in the Punjab, where dissidents and security forces have engaged in increasingly brutal actions, often trapping ordinary citizens in the violence. The followers of Mr. Babbar killed about 50 men, women and children, all relatives of policemen, to avenge his death, police officials said. These retaliatory killings have since stopped. Mr. Babbar was the president of the Babbar Khalsa International, the best armed, most feared and most powerful of dozens of the militant groups in Punjab State that are fighting for an independent state for Sikhs, known as Khalistan. "There is a realization that the movement for Khalistan has done more damage than good to Sikh interests," said Kanwaljit Singh, the secretary of one faction of the Akali Dal, the mainstream Sikh party. Punjab's police chief, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, said security forces had seized the initiative in the confrontation with the militants after the slaying of Mr. Babbar and several other militant leaders. But in the past the militants have been able to regroup in the face of such police successes. "It does not mean that terrorism is ending but we have succeeded in bringing about substantial containment," Mr. Gill said in an interview at his heavily guarded home in Chandigarh, the state capital, about 70 miles south of here. Mr. Gill, a veteran of anti-insurgency campaigns in India's northeast, said that security successes had left many young militants leaderless. Kuldip Singh Sibia, who was a key figure in the Babbar Khalsa International and organized financial support for the group out of Britain, acknowledged that the militants were feeling the pressure. Mr. Sibia, a British citizen who surrendered to the state authorities this month, told a reporter that major militant leaders wanted to negotiate a settlement of their demands. Chief Minister Beant Singh, the state's top elected official, said he was prepared to talk to the militants if they would surrender their weapons and agree to a settlement within the Constitution. No group has yet responded positively to his demands, although Mr. Sibia said that the militants were under pressure from followers to negotiate. Mr. Sibia said that he slipped into India from Nepal after traveling first from Bangkok to Pakistan and then to Katmandu. He said he had been authorized by Babbar Khalsa International leaders and Pakistani intelligence officials to organize new routes for smuggling arms to the Sikh groups. Pakistan has denied Indian allegations of armed assistance to Punjabi and Kashmiri militants. The election of a Congress Party Government in the state last June ended nearly five years of rule from New Delhi. The party, which also governs in New Delhi under Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, won the state elections despite a boycott called by the militants. Most of the Akali Dal groups and Sikh voters stayed away, making the Congress victory easier. "The level of terrorism has dropped to 50 percent of what existed before we came to power," said Chief Minister Singh. Mr. Singh, a white-bearded Sikh who wears sunglasses even indoors, said that "the political process has been restored." Fear, too, is easing in some parts of the state like the Patila ragion where, for the first time in years, cars and trucks travel the the highways at night.

776-> Senate Nears an Accord On a Coal-Benefits Issue
Breaking a logjam that had been holding up an ambitious energy bill, Senate Republicans and Democrats negotiated the broad outlines of a compromise on an amendment forcing coal companies to provide medical benefits to 100,000 retired coal workers. The coal-company provision has attracted strong opposition from the Administration and has threatened to lead to a crippling filibuster. But by this evening, senior aides of senators on both sides of the issue said that except for a few details, negotiators had reached agreement, essentially guaranteeing a demand by Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, that retired miners and their families not be stripped of benefits they had been promised. In return, Mr. Rockefeller dropped a provision in his amendment calling for a tax on coal companies. A Potpourri of Issues Both the Senate and House have passed similar versions of the energy bill by overwhelming margins, but final enactment has been delayed the last two months by legislative maneuvering involving a number of tax provisions. Because the bill deals with a potpourri of complex and economically sensitive areas, from deregulation of electric utilities to possible storage of spent nuclear materials in Nevada, final passage of the most important energy legislation in more than a decade could still be weeks or months away. The latest in a seemingly endless series of controversies occurred when Mr. Rockefeller persuaded the Finance Committee last month to attach to the energy bill a measure to bail out an insolvent health care fund that President Truman and the United Mine Workers set up in 1946 with a tax on coal companies. Mr. Rockefeller's measure drew heated criticism from the Administration and Senate Republicans, who contended that nonunionized coal companies should not be held liable for health costs they did not agree to meet in negotiations. Republican leaders promised that President Bush would veto the energy bill if Mr. Rockefeller's amendment was not scratched or at least modified. Threats and Compromise Such threats led to several weeks of negotiations between Senator Rockefeller and Senators Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, and Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, which several aides thought would culminate in a compromise within hours. An eventual compromise should insure a successful cloture vote to close off debate on the energy legislation on Thursday, all but guaranteeing that the bill would proceed to a House-Senate conference committee for final compromises on a separate array of issues. Having achieved the objectives in the energy bill of streamlining licensing procedures for new nuclear power plants and deregulating the natural gas and utility industries, the Administration did not want to forfeit them over the Rockefeller measure. In recent days, Labor Department negotiators told Rockefeller aides they were willing to accept a substitute for the Senator's coal tax provision that was based on a measure proposed a few years ago by the West Virginia Democrat. That proposal imposed health care responsibility for retired miners and their families on companies that had bought out or taken over the properties of the defunct firms that had once employed the workers. Administration officials said such a solution would reduce the bureaucratic waste that would accompany a tax. The Administration offer formed the basis for the emerging compromise. 'A Huge Victory' "We consider this a huge victory," said a senior Rockefeller aide. The aide added that Mr. Rockefeller still wants to insure that the guarantees of health benefits are permanent, and that will require "an additional small amount of funds" beyond what the Republicans have agreed to. A Republican aide agreed that the two sides were narrowing their differences, adding, "We'll be working most of the night" to reach a final settlement. Another hurdle was overcome earlier today when Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the Democratic chairman of the Energy Committee, dropped his support for a controversial nuclear-waste-disposal provision. To smooth final passage, he said he would insure that a House measure to allow the Energy Department to override Nevada laws to determine if the Yucca Mountain storage site in Nevada is suitable for the disposal of high-grade nuclear waste would not survive a House-Senate conference committee. Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, had threatened to block final passage of the energy legislation with a filibuster if the House provision was included in the final draft of the bill.

779-> Review/Film; Choosing A Surrogate For Revenge
Antoine (Fabrice Luchini), the narrator and protagonist of "La Discrete," is a far less appealing character than either he or Christian Vincent, the film's director and co-author, might imagine. Skinny and nervous, with blazing, buggy eyes and a penchant for rattling on excitedly about historical trivia, Antoine is presented as a sophisticated ladies' man who can usually have his pick of women. The film takes its title from a piece of that trivia. Upper-class women of the 17th century, he says, adorned themselves with artificial beauty marks to attract male attention. The marks had names that were based on where they were placed. On the chin, it was called La Discrete. When Antoine meets Catherine (Judith Henry), who has a mole on her chin, it becomes his nickname for her. Cocky as he is, Antoine doesn't always win at the game of love. In the first scene of the film, which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, he prepares to break up with his current lover, Solange (Marie Bunel), but she beats him to it by returning to Paris with a new boyfriend after an out-of-town trip and coldly dumping Antoine when he surprises her at the railroad station. His pride stung, Antoine confides his desire for revenge to his friend Jean (Maurice Garrel), a wizened publisher and rare-book collector. Jean proposes an experiment that could conceivably help Antoine make the leap from parliamentary speechwriter to more serious literary pursuits. Together they concoct a scheme in which he will advertise for a female typist under 25, make her fall in love with him, then break up with her after their first sexual encounter. Antoine is to keep a detailed diary of his campaign, which Jean will publish as their joint revenge against the opposite sex. Catherine, Antoine's unwitting prey, turns out to be a self-possessed young woman with brown saucer eyes and a Mona Lisa smile. Even though Antoine says he finds her revolting, the plan goes forward, with Antoine letting Jean dictate his every move. Although resistant at first, Catherine begins to melt. The film closely follows their dates at a cafe, at the movies and at a swank bar where Catherine becomes sweetly tipsy. Eventually, the story takes a nasty twist, with the bitter old book collector brutally pulling the strings. As a film maker, Mr. Vincent has been compared with Eric Rohmer, for good reason. "La Discrete," like the typical Rohmer film, gazes fixedly on the nuances of supposedly civilized behavior to uncover a less-than-civilized moral universe. With its crisp musical soundtrack that uses piano pieces by Schubert and Scarlatti and its brownish-hued vision of contemporary Paris, the film feels like a formal, slightly musty chamber piece. The interior world that it meticulously uncovers is a meanly duplicitous one. If Antoine, with his glib tongue and seductive ways, is presented as a sort of urban Parisian everyman, he is a pretty poor excuse of a man, for he is weak, self-deluded, vindictive and blindly sexist. Catherine is something else. A woman without airs, she is emotionally direct to the point of curtness, but never cruel. In Miss Henry's enchanting portrayal, she emerges as an accidental, uncalculating femme fatale whose waifish charm recalls the young Glynis Johns or Giulietta Masina, but without their childlike vulnerability. In a conversation with Antoine, Catherine casually regales him with stories of her sexual adventures while working in England as an au pair. The most revealing tale recalls a brief foray into prostitution, during which Catherine discovered that all the customers had to be treated like babies. With his huge but fragile ego and his fantasy of himself as a brainy, swashbuckling soldier in the war between the sexes, Antoine is a sophisticated baby. If Catherine is far too good for him, she is also too good-hearted to know it.

781-> Bush Staff Lawyer's Call On Iraq Case Is Reported
A lawyer on President Bush's legal staff discussed the criminal investigation of an Atlanta bank's loans to Iraq with the Federal prosecutor supervising the case at least once in late 1989 and perhaps on a number of occasions, the senior Assistant United States Attorney in Atlanta said today. The suggestion that the White House may have interfered in the bank case is likely to figure in a meeting Thursday of Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee to discuss whether to request an independent counsel to investigate allegations of criminality by the Bush Administration in its handling of its policy toward Iraq. The Democrats are expected to get the 11 signatures needed to draft a letter requesting that the Attonery General approve the naming of an independent counsel this week. The most recent allegations came from the chairman of the House banking committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, who asserted on Tuesday that the call or calls from a representative of the White House constituted improper intervention in the investigation. The identity and position of the caller were not disclosed until today. Few Calls 'at the Most' The senior Assistant United States Attorney in Atlanta, Gerrilyn Brill, said the caller was Jay S. Bybee, who worked in the office of C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel. At the time, Mr. Bybee was a staff lawyer in the Justice Department's civil division, detailed temporarily to work at the White House. He left the Government in 1991 and is currently an assistant professor of law at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He did not returns calls today. Ms. Brill, who has denied that the White House intervened improperly in the investigation of the Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, said that Gail McKenzie, the Assistant United States Attorney directly responsible for the politically charged case, "cannot recall whether she received only one or additional calls" from Mr. Bybee. "If there were additional calls from Bybee, there were a few at the most," she said in a telephone interview. The revelation that a White House official had directly called a federal prosecutor about a current criminal investigation instead of going through Justice Department channels was revealed in a statement from the floor of the House by Mr. Gonzalez, who has relentlessly attacked the Bush Administration's policy toward Iraq before the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Ms. Brill said that her office is "not investigating a possible obstruction of justice," but declined to say whether the possibility of improper White House involvement in the case was the subject of a separate investigation. "We're discussing among ourselves what happened here," she said. She also declined to discuss the content of the call or calls, but said that Ms. McKenzie was looking for her telephone logs to determine when she spoke with Mr. Bybee. Justice Department officials in Washington have known about the call since early 1990, when Ms. McKenzie told Peter Clark, a senior litigating lawyer in the criminal division, about inquiries she had received about the case from officials at the Federal Reserve and the White House, a senior Justice Department official said today. The official said that Mr. Clark did not refer the call to his superiors because, "It was not the kind of thing meriting concern, and there was no statement that she was being subject to any kind of improper influence." But Mr. Clark told Ms. McKenzie to refer any such inquiries in the future to her superiors at Justice Department headquarters. There have been no other referrals. The official said that it was highly unusual for a White House official to call a career prosecutor seeking information about a specific investigation. That is because such inquiries raise exactly the kind of questions swirling around the issue now, including whether there was an attempt to improperly influence a criminal inquiry. But Laurence A. Urgensen, the criminal division lawyer responsible for the investigation of the bank, said, "I am aware of no instance in which the investigation was improperly delayed, obstructed or interfered with by anyone in the Department of Justice or any other department or agency." Acording to the senior Justice Department official, the Atlanta prosecutor provided Mr. Bybee with a broad overview of the case that did not violate criminal laws that prohibit law-enforcement officials from disclosing information obtained in grand jury investigations, the official said. Mr. Gray did not return phone calls, and White House press spokesmen declined to identify Mr. Bybee, his title and his responsibilities.

782-> Abroad at Home; The Rot of Corruption
At the end of this political campaign we are seeing what an overweening love of power can do to a President and to the institutions of government. We are seeing the rot of corruption. That is the meaning of the almost daily disclosure of abuses by agencies of the Bush Administration: the C.I.A., the Justice Department, the F.B.I., the State Department, the Treasury. The institutions have been corrupted in the attempt to keep George Bush in office. The Justice Department tried to smother a prosecution that would show how President Bush covertly helped Saddam Hussein before the Persian Gulf war. The C.I.A. and the F.B.I. were drawn into that sinkhole. High State Department officials broke the rules to search for Bill Clinton's passport records in the hope of finding something wrong. But the most devastating episode of recent days -- devastating because of what it showed about personal character -- involved the President himself. Mr. Bush walked into the Blue Room of the White House, where Katie Couric of the NBC program "Today" was interviewing Mrs. Bush. Ms. Couric asked him about a subject that few journalists have had the courage to press with Mr. Bush: the Iran-contra affair. "Did you have any knowledge of the Iran-contra arms for hostages deal while you were Vice President?" Ms. Couric asked. The President replied: "I've testified 450 times under oath, some of them, and our staff 3,500 that yes. . . ." Again a moment later Ms. Couric asked: "You knew about the arms for hostages?" Mr. Bush answered: "Yes, and I've said so all along, given speeches on it." Those answers were astonishing. They conflicted with Mr. Bush's insistence over many years that he had no role in Iran-contra. And they conflicted with the facts. Mr. Bush has not testified under oath on Iran-contra 450 times, or "some of them," whatever that means. He did so once, on Jan. 11, 1988, in a meeting with the staff of the independent counsel on Iran-contra, Lawrence E. Walsh. From the moment the scandal broke, in November 1986, Mr. Bush said that he had not known arms were being sent to Iran in a trade for American hostages. He first learned that that had happened, he said, when he was briefed in December 1986 by Senator David Durenberger. On March 13, 1987, Mr. Bush said: "I wish it with clairvoyant hindsight that I had known that we were trading arms for hostages, as the [ Tower commission ] report concluded, and then I would have weighed in very heavily with the President." After the Couric interview Mr. Bush's counsel, C. Boyden Gray, said the President had not intended to say that he knew about arms for hostages. "I think he misinterpreted the question," Mr. Gray said. But it was a simple, direct question, and Ms. Couric came back to it. How could it be "misinterpreted"? What happened in that interview is clear. George Bush wanted to wriggle out of the unbelievable position he has taken on Iran-contra. He tried to obfuscate. He falsified his past words. He hoped nobody would remember, or care. It all could have been different at the beginning of Iran-contra. Mr. Bush could have told the truth. In a 1988 interview with Dan Rather of CBS, Mr. Bush said he was moved by the torture and death of one American hostage in Lebanon, William Buckley, a C.I.A. agent. He could have said that at the start: admitted that he was involved in trading arms for hostages, said it was done for humane reasons but turned out to be a mistake. Instead he went down the path of lies. He has had to change the story again and again, as new documents have surfaced. One C.I.A. expert called Mr. Bush's performance "the rolling stonewall." The Iran-contra story is a metaphor for George Bush's Presidency: sacrificing integrity to political ambition. It is Willie Horton, it is Mr. Bush's switch on abortion, it is the attempt to make something sinister of Bill Clinton's opposition to the Vietnam War. In the end the process exacts its price. Like murder, corruption will out.

784-> A Washington District That's a World Apart
Like the wrong side of the tracks, the east side of the Anacostia River is viewed by many Washingtonians as a forbidding, fearsome place, a source of the drugs and crime that plague this city, the ghetto largely responsible for making Washington the murder capital of America. A freeway bridge from downtown spans the river to the eastern bank where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, a street whose gutted storefronts, trash-strewn lots and groups of men and women clustered aimlessly on corners seem to confirm an outsider's worst fears. Those signs of hopelessness, the economic blight behind it all, and the violence and crime distress many of the people who live amid it, too. But the river divides the city psychologically as well as physically, often forming a barrier to understanding between those living across from each other. Barry Vote Mystified Many The fact that residents in this area voted overwhelmingly in the Sept. 15 primary for former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., the convicted drug abuser and a pariah to many Washingtonians, to represent them on the City Council, a choice that mystified many people elsewhere in the capital and around the country. On paper, the hilly, wedge-shaped neighborhood that voted for him, an area designated Ward 8 and consisting of the Anacostia and Congress Heights neighborhoods, is strikingly similar to Harlem, the Crenshaw area of South-Central Los Angeles or any one of several other big-city ghettos. Like them, Ward 8 is more than 80 percent black and the median family income is $16,692. Nationally, the Census Bureau reported that in 1989 the median household income for blacks was $19,758 and for whites it was $31,435. In Ward 8, over a third of the population is under 18 years old and only 30 percent of the area's students graduate from high school. Only about 13 percent of the houses are owned by the people living in them. The scarcity of jobs, affordable housing and social services are painfully apparent. Beauty Beyond Destruction People from the other parts of town often make it a rule never to go east of the Anacostia River. So few residents outside Ward 8 realize that beyond its bleak thoroughfares, the crack houses and abandoned public housing projects are many leafy avenues, neat brick and stucco houses, flowering gardens and porch swings. Residents of Ward 8 know that their beautiful riverfront park is almost private, and that a bluff above the water is the best spot in town for watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. In scores of interviews after the election, people here said frustration, anger and a feeling that the rest of Washington was ignoring and neglecting their economic and social problems drove them to seek radical change. Many of those said they believed their best hope for that was in the flamboyant and forceful leadership style of Mr. Barry, who was released from prison four months ago after being convicted of cocaine possession when he was in his 12th year as Mayor. "Politicians don't want to come to this part of town, to see what's going on here," said Roy Easterling, a 26-year-old sidewalk T-shirt vendor, explaining his vote for Mr. Barry. Mr. Easterling, who was born in Ward 8, went to the area's only high school, and still lives with his mother in his childhood home. He said he was trying to save money to open his own neighborhood store. It did not bother him that Mr. Barry moved to Ward 8 only last summer, in order to run for the City Council seat. "Marion Barry lives here," he said. "I've seen him four or five times this summer. I voted for him because he's a good leader, he just got caught up with the wrong people. But I know he's rehabilitated, and he's going to do better for us." Like everyone here, Mr. Easterling knows the neighborhood's primary need: "Jobs. We got to have jobs." One of the largest employers of the area's residents is the Federal Government. Businesses are so scarce that the area does not have any restaurants, only fast-food outlets. There are no department stores and only one major supermarket for 72,000 people. The area does not even have a Little League baseball team. Southeast Washington, once a relatively prosperous, racially mixed blue-collar neighborhood, began its decline after the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Paradoxically, the riots were briefer and less destructive in Ward 8 than in black neighborhoods west of the river. Poorer Families Remained Still, "the riots scared a lot of white people out, and a lot of the young black professionals, too," said Dorn McGrath, professor of urban planning at George Washington University. Many businesses followed, taking jobs with them. "One of the largest furniture warehouses and retail outlets in the city had to close down because their customers were afraid to come there anymore." The poorer black families who remained did not have the economic or political clout to benefit from the redevelopment in other parts of the city that came as a result of the riots. Rioters burned many buildings to the ground in areas closer to the Capitol. The city invested heavily there, even building government offices to encourage recovery. But development experts say little was done for Anacostia and Congress Heights. In fact, by "the mid-1970's, Anacostia had to sue the city for parity in the provision of municipal services, like garbage, sewer, water, and tree maintenance," Mr. McGrath said. The city did not do any better by the neighborhood in the 12 years that Mr. Barry was the Mayor. When Mr. Barry was asked about this in the campaign, he spoke instead about programs he had put into effect on youth employment and for the elderly. Standing on a bluff in the ward with a commanding view of the river and the rest of Washington, Lottie Hudson waved her arm back towards the area and spoke with scorn in her voice as she mocked the city's political establishment. "Now it's like, 'They're on that side, just leave them there,' " said Ms. Hudson, who lived in various Washington neighborhoods before settling in Ward 8 nearly 20 years ago. "Just do the minimum. But people are frustrated they can't get a job. "I saw Marion Barry did a lot for youth jobs as Mayor, but I also saw him mess up," said Ms. Hudson, who describes herself as a recovered alcoholic working as a substance abuse counselor. She said she did not vote for Mr. Barry. "I forgave him as soon as he decided to do something about his problem, but I didn't forget. 'Barry Inspired Me' Enough people apparently felt more than forgiveness. Not only did Mr. Barry win a 3-to-1 victory over the 16-year incumbent, Wilhelmina Rolark, but he did it with unprecedented voter turnout in his Ward. He faces a Republican opponent in the November general election, but there are so few Republican voters in Ward 8 that Mr. Barry is virtually certain to win. Geraldine McCarthur, 28 and unemployed, said: "Barry inspired me. He showed that you can pick yourself up." In fact, that notion was Mr. Barry's central strategy, and his supporters say it had significant impact in a community where many people have experience with drugs and jails. "A report recently showed 42 percent of Washington's African-American males between 18 and 35 were involved in the criminal justice system," said the Rev. Willie Wilson, a staunch Mr. Barry supporter. "There's a bad label put on Southeast, and a lot of people are amazed at what they find when they come to this side of the river," Mr. Wilson said. "But this false label has also been a basis for insurance companies to have higher rates, for lenders to be unwilling to make capital investments here." So investment comes from organizations like Action to Rehabilitate Community Housing, a nonprofit group that sells renovated houses to low-income families.

785-> Rudolf C. Ising, 80, a Cartoonist And Creator of 'Looney Tunes'
Rudolf C. Ising, an early aide to Walt Disney who left to create the "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" cartoons and was the first independent cartoon producer to win an Academy Award, died on Saturday at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 80 years old. He died of cancer, his family said. Mr. Ising was working at a photograph-finishing laboratory when he was hired by Mr. Disney, who advertised in a local newspaper for a cartoonist when he was starting out in the early 1920's in Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Ising helped to ink the drawings in the first animated Disney films, the "Newton Laugh-o-Grams." The operation moved to California, and Mr. Ising followed. But soon he and another Disney employee, Hugh Harman, broke away to create their own cartoons. Synchronizing Dialogue and Action Their initial production, "Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid," in 1929, was a breakthrough as the first talkie cartoon, synchronizing dialogue on the soundtrack with the action on screen. Disney's earlier "Steamboat Willie" had music and sound effects but no dialogue. The Bosko cartoon was also notable for its sign off, "That's all, folks," which became Porky Pig's stammered trademark. In 1930, the two men were hired by Warner Brothers, for which they devised the "Looney Tunes" label, a takeoff on Disney's "Silly Symphonies" series. In 1934, they joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where they created Barney Bear, the ancestor of Yogi Bear. The inspiration for the lethargic Barney came from Mr. Ising's habit of dozing off in staff meetings. While Mr. Harman specialized in "Looney Tunes," Mr. Ising developed "Merrie Melodies," which emphasized the musical element. His strength was in writing and producing rather than illustrating. Both cartoon series became staples of the nation's movie-theater programs. Winning an Academy Award In 1940, Mr. Ising's "Milky Way," a cartoon about three kittens, won an Academy Award, the first non-Disney cartoon to capture an Oscar. Mr. Ising was also honored in 1976 by the International Animation Society. In World War II, he worked on training films as the head of the animation division for the Army Air Forces movie unit. After the war, he worked on commercials and television projects and retired in the 1970's. He is survived by his wife, the former Cynthia Westlake, and a son, Rudolf Jr., of Laguna Beach, Calif.

786-> Child's Own Management Consultant
JEREMY MULLMAN'S room looked good. His bed was made. There were no dirty socks or plates of moldy food around. At least none could be seen. In fact, the room was downright meticulous for a 14-year-old who has more important things, like football, on his mind. But imperfections were spotted by Donna Goldberg, who runs the Organized Student, a personal consulting service that goes into children's rooms and works with them to make order out of semichaos. "It's all about organization," said Mrs. Goldberg, a librarian at the Dalton School in Manhattan. "We don't teach it in school. I'm hoping I'm teaching the children the process of organizing, sticking with one task." Jeremy, a 9th grader at Riverdale Country School who lives in Manhattan, lets things pile up. "I try to keep going by myself, but I can't do it perfectly," he said. Mrs. Goldberg started the business three years ago, when her son, Noah, now 17, was "spacing out in class," she said, and needed "structuring." She said that most parents -- herself included -- can't organize their children and their homework without tempers escalating. She is a member of the National Association of Professional Organizers, whose 450 members have declared Oct. 11 through 17 National Get Organized Week. Parents call Mrs. Goldberg when children are floundering in school, when the bedroom door won't open because of the junk inside. "On the first visit, I'll scope out the situation, maybe straighten out the desk," Mrs. Goldberg said. It usually takes a school year or more, an average of 6 to 10 hours in total, for Mrs. Goldberg to organize a student fully. Amanda Goldstein, 14 years old and a 9th grader at Scarsdale High School, also had stacks -- school papers, letters, stuffed dolls, magazines, music books -- around her lilac-colored bedroom in Scarsdale. Amanda and Mrs. Goldberg spent an hour on the floor going through a pile of cassettes. Amanda flipped her hair back and forth, looking for her Nirvana tape. Her room wasn't that bad. Amanda looked around her bedroom. "I hate doing this, but it's good for me," she said. Mrs. Goldberg, who charges from $85 to $125 an hour, admits her service is nonessential. She said her clients are mostly affluent families and noted that her rates were competitive with those of tutors. Information about National Get Organized Week and names of other organizers (some will even straighten out a 6-year-old's room) are available from (914) 666-6414. Mrs. Goldberg can be reached at (212) 769-0026.

787-> CREDIT MARKETS; Bond Prices Fall; Jobs Data Awaited
The bond market fell yesterday as traders spent a day warily preparing for the release of the July unemployment figures today. "The market is a little off because it is worried about the jobs number," said Donald Fine, chief market economist at Chase Securities Inc. "No one wants to go into a number that is so unknown or that can influence the market so much either very long or short," he said. This means that few traders want to bet one way or the other on the report by either buying a lot of notes or bonds or by selling them in advance. In trading in the secondary market, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bond of 2021 was offered at 106 14/32 , down 13/32 , to yield 7.45 percent, compared with 7.42 percent on Wednesday. In the pre-auction or when-issued market, where the new 30-year bond is already being traded in anticipation of its auction next Thursday, the yield was 7.41 percent, up from 7.37 percent yesterday. In other trading, the 10-year 7.5 percent note was offered in late trading at 106 4/32 , down 8/32 , to yield 6.63 percent. In the pre-auction market, the new 10-year note to be awarded next Wednesday was offered at a yield of 6.65 percent, compared with 6.62 percent the day before. Three-Year Note Offering The 5.5 percent three-year note was offered at 103 1/32 , unchanged for the day, to yield 4.69 percent. In the pre-auction market, the new three-year note to be awarded Tuesday was offered at a yield of 4.84 percent, compared with 4.83 percent on Wednesday. The two-year note ended at 99 31/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 4.26 percent, compared with 4.25 percent on Wednesday. Three-month and six-month bills were down only slightly and the one-year bill was unchanged. Today and next week could be rough for the market. The unemployment data could change the tone of a market that rallied strongly in July. But the number could also restart the rally. And whatever tone is set, investors next week must digest $36 billion of 3-year and 10-year notes and a new 30-year bond. Some analysts are worried about indigestion, which means the market would fall some from its recent highs. Today traders will have to do a little analysis before they can figure out whether to buy or sell and whether the upward trend is back on, off or on hold. One key number they will look at is the increase, or decrease, in nonfarm payroll jobs. The consensus forecast is that this number will increase by 100,000 to 150,000 after a decrease of 117,000 in June. But the new July numbers are likely to be distorted and pushed higher by the hiring of workers under an emergency Federal jobs program that began last month. These jobs could add as many as 150,000 workers to the nonfarm payroll total. In addition, analysts will be looking at whether the 117,000 decline of last month is revised significantly. If it is and the revision decreases the reported decline a lot, the impact of the new July figure may be lessened because, as one government securities trader said, the new number will have no credibility. "Everyone just wants to get through tomorrow," he added, reflecting the concern of many that instead of coming in as expected, the jobs figure will be a big surprise, as it was when the June report came out at the beginning of July, One factor that appeared to pull down the prices of Treasuries with longer maturities was that investors abandoned one recently popular way to play the market: betting that short-term interest rates would rise while longer-term rates declined or, at least, did not rise as fast. To make this play, the investor sells short-term notes, like the 2-year, and buys longer-term maturities, like the 5-year, 10-year note or the 30-year bond. To get out of this position, because it might be too risky going into the unemployment report, the investor buys 2-year notes and sells the longer maturities. In a possible reflection of these kinds of trades yesterday, the 2-year note outperformed the 10-year note and the 30-year bond. The yield on the two-year note rose a basis point or one one-hundredth of a percentage point while the yields on the 30-year bond and the 10-year note were up 3 basis points each.

788-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut Visit; Clinton Tours Plant to Talk About the Issue: Jobs
Gov. Bill Clinton campaigned in Connecticut today, focusing on the need to make American manufacturing more competitive. Whether or not people agreed with his proposals, he was talking about what many wanted to hear: jobs and the economy. Addressing workers at an employee-owned factory in Portland, and speaking outside a restaurant here where he met with Democratic leaders, Mr. Clinton added details to his own economic plan, while accusing the Bush Administration of lacking one. "Unlike our competitors, America has no national economic strategy," he told employees of Standard Knapp, a manufacturer of packaging machinery in Portland. "Instead we have a series of unconnected, piecemeal efforts, and trickle-down economics. Under trickle-down economics, our manufacturing strength has trickled away." The Arkansas Governor proposed using money saved from military cuts to establish 170 manufacturing extension centers, modeled on the agricultural extension centers that have long aided American farmers, to help small and medium-sized companies. Emphasis on Retraining Twenty-five of the centers, he said, should be in areas hit hard by military cuts and devoted to retraining both production workers and scientists from military contractors. He also proposed rewriting Federal tax laws to provide incentives for investing in new manufacturing equipment, and encouraging more spending on research and development for small and medium-sized companies and on promoting their exports. "A lot of the problems we face today don't fall very neatly within categories of left and right, or liberal and conservative, or Republican and Democrat," Mr. Clinton said. "We're living on the post-cold war world," he said, "where we have to fight and compete for every job we get, where nobody can promise you to make it the way it used to be, where no one can repeal the laws of change." Mr. Clinton at first received a restrained reception this morning at Standard-Knapp, where both machinists' union members and white-collar workers took part in an employee buyout of the company in 1984. Standing on a podium on the shop floor, he spoke for several minutes before applause interrupted him. But his recounting of the decline of American manufacturing hit home in the factory, whose 200 employees survived some tough years after the buyout. Many have friends and relatives who are either out of work or worried about losing their jobs. "Family values and all that -- everyone likes to talk about it, but the economy is what everyone's worried about," Cliff Scovill, a machinist, said while waiting for the Governor. Even a Republican and supporter of President Bush, Jeremy Segal of Bristol, said Mr. Clinton was right in saying that "something's got to be done," and conceded, "I don't know what Bush is doing, really." But speaking of Mr. Clinton, he went on: "I want to know where he's getting the money. If he takes it from defense cuts, that's going to cost jobs. If he takes it from taxes, that's going to hurt." Mr. Clinton's emphasis on economic themes should find receptive listeners in Connecticut. Recent polls by the University of Connecticut for The Hartford Courant and by Quinnipiac College in Hamden suggested that the economy was by far the most important issue in Connecticut and the metropolitan region, hard hit by the recession, military cuts and the loss of manufacturing jobs. -------------------- Misstatement on Missile PORTLAND, Conn., Sept. 8 (AP) -- Gov. Bill Clinton misstated the role of the Patriot misile system in the Persian Gulf war in a campaign appearance here today. Encouraging the manufacturing of successful American products, Mr. Clinton said huge sums are spent to develop new military weapons. "We do all this basic research and people come up with great ideas, and then they turn them into things like the Patriot missiles which will go through doors or down chimneys." Patriot missiles are used to shoot down other missiles. The Bush campaign issued a brief statement ridiculing Clinton, saying he had "shown his complete ignorance about even the most fundamental defense system." Mr. Clinton was apparently thinking of warplane camera images from the Persian Gulf war that showed pinpoint hits by laser-guided bombs.

789-> COMPANY NEWS; CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE SETS OCT. 23 TO TEST NEW SYSTEM
The Chicago Board of Trade yesterday set Oct. 23 as the date it will begin an electronic trading system for new products. The system, Project A, will start with zero-coupon bond futures, zero-coupon note futures, barge-freight rate index futures, and options on Treasury bond futures not currently listed in the trading pits. These new products and others are not expected to generate enough volume initially for member firms to invest in floor trading. Project A is meant to provide an inexpensive way of introducing the products and testing the market, according to Mark Prout, a spokesman for the Chicago Board of Trade. So far, 10 member firms will install Project A terminals in their offices and the exchange plans to place another six terminals on the trading floor.

Air pollution reached danger levels in Athens today as the temperature soared to 100 degrees, sending scores of people to hospitals with heart and respiratory problems. The Government's environment agency said the amount of ozone surpassed the emergency level. Nitrogen dioxide also reached dangerous levels, it said. The National First Aid Center said that by noon its ambulances had responded to calls by 156 people with heart and respiratory complaints.

791-> COMPANY NEWS; BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB SEEKS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TAXOL
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said it was working with an Italian company to develop a semisynthetic alternative for a new anti-cancer drug now found only in the rare Pacific Northwest yew tree. A company statement said the drug, taxol, could be approved by early next year by the Food and Drug Administration for use against ovarian cancer. The Pacific Northwest yew is the only source of the drug approved for use in the United States, and treatment for one patient requires the harvest of six 100-year-old trees. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hear testimony today on a bill that would restrict the harvest of Pacific yew bark. Bristol-Myers said a vice president, Zola Horovitz, would detail its venture with the Italian company, Inverni della Beffa, in testimony before the committee.

793-> Books of The Times; The N.F.L.'s Annual Brawn Infusion
The Meat Market The Inside Story of the N.F.L. Draft By Richard Whittingham Illustrated. 214 pages. Macmillan. $20. To be afflicted with a rooting interest in a professional football team inevitably leads to an even more bizarre obsession with the process by which your team acquires its players. That is why every April many grown-up Americans sit in front of their telephones and television sets for two consecutive days while 336 names are announced at intervals from the stage of some Manhattan ballroom. This is the annual draft of college football players, a ritual that must be as fascinating to outsiders as watching liquid being drawn up through a straw. Yet for serious pro football fans, happiness is at stake. "The Meat Market: The Inside Story of the N.F.L. Draft," by Richard Whittingham, is the first book I know of that describes the football draft from a team's point of view. In 1991, the Chicago Bears gave Mr. Whittingham, a veteran sportswriter, the rare opportunity to spend the week leading up to the draft with the team's front office staff. This was the year that nearly the entire first round hinged on whether the New England Patriots would draft the Notre Dame star Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, and that Mr. Ismail threw everyone's plans askew by signing for some $20 million with the Toronto Argonauts, of the Canadian Football League. What Mr. Whittingham reveals about the process is not entirely cosmic. He discreetly withholds the more colorful gossip that must surely have flown about. He describes an arduous process of winnowing that selects from more than 4,500 college players the 336 who will be chosen in the draft. Even with all the grinding work -- the traveling, observing, measuring, interviewing, analyzing, comparing and report writing -- the process of judging is inexact. Of the 336 chosen, only 130 or so survived the teams' final cuts the following September, and of these only some 30 started. Who the best of these turned out to be often had little to do with the order in which they were chosen. So Mr. Whittingham's most diverting stories involve the surprises that have developed over the years. For instance in 1957 the Cleveland Browns, disappointed not to have had a crack at any of three quarterbacks they coveted, were forced to settle for "this kid from Syracuse, Jim Brown," who turned out to be one of the greatest running backs in pro football history. Of course, there was more opportunity for surprise in the early days of the draft. Wellington Mara, an owner of the New York Giants, used to flip through publications like Street & Smith's Yearbook, a distant cry from the body-fat quantification and motivation research that obtains these days. He was successful at it too, at least for a time. And while the owners and coaches mulled over their choices, Jimmy Conzelman, the coach of the Chicago Cardinals, would go over to the piano in the hotel conference room and entertain the gathering by tickling the keys. One shortcoming of "The Meat Market" is that its focus is a little narrow. Starting his narrative so close to the actual draft, the author leaves himself no space to go back and watch the players from the class of 1991 develop over the years and assume the individuality that might allow us to take some interest in their personal stories. He calls them meat and he treats them as meat. At the other end of the process, he surveys the results of the draft too soon. History suggests that it takes at least five years to judge the vintage of a given harvest. First-round players who fell flat their rookie years, like Jarrod Bunch of the Giants, may yet turn out to be fine wine, or so one fervently prays. Ricky Watters of the San Francisco 49ers, a third-round pick who hardly played his rookie year, is now beginning to look like at least a second growth. Despite the muckraking sound of its title, "The Meat Market" never questions the financial or ethical propriety of the draft. You wouldn't know from the book that the process is now under legal challenge for restricting the freedom of players to sell their services where they wish. There is even a chapter on the N.F.L.'s Plan B, a modified free-agent system that was all but declared illegal in a recent court decision. The only criticism of Plan B that Mr. Whittingham mentions is that of a Chicago Bear executive who doesn't like it because "it breeds soldiers of fortune, or mercenaries" and fails to promote "loyalty." The book does offer some perspective on the draft by tracing the history of player acquisition from the beginning of professional football. In the early years, some teams did consistently well while others persisted in losing. So the draft was introduced in 1936 and from then on greater parity prevailed, although the cleverer teams continued to win more than their share of championships. Would parity fade if the draft were killed? Baseball, with its partial system of free agency, has shown that mixing the right players means more than buying the biggest stars. And the chemistry of football, with its closely coordinated movements, is even more delicate than that of baseball. So some system of drafting talent will probably be worked out between the players and the owners, even when free agency is allowed. Besides, it would be a shame to deprive fans of the draft. Following it is one of the great indoor sports, so obsessing to people of a certain sedentary temperament as to make even a lackluster book like "The Meat Market" seem necessary, even compulsory, reading.

796-> Abrams Apologizes for Calling Rival 'Fascist'
Hours after Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and State Attorney General Robert Abrams sparred sharply over ethics and tactics in the first debate of their Senate campaign, Mr. Abrams formally apologized last night for calling the Senator a "fascist" at a campaign rally last weekend. Mr. Abrams, who had earlier expressed regret for any offense the remark had caused the public but had repeatedly refused to apologize directly to the Senator, said he had now done so because the squabbling had obscured discussion of the candidates' differences on major issues. Senator D'Amato dismissed the apology as "not sincere" and "politically motivated." In a contentious hourlong ramble on the "Imus in the Morning" radio program on WFAN-AM -- one of three broadcast encounters planned -- the candidates spluttered in overlapping exchanges so fast that their host, Don Imus, broke in at one point shouting, "Hold it! Shut up!" and at another silenced them by playing a recording of an exploding bomb. [ Excerpts, page B5. ] Despite the unlikely setting of morning "shock talk" radio, the candidates, prodded deftly by Mr. Imus, settled down to discussions of topics from abortion to Israel to whether a national health insurance plan backed by Mr. Abrams would mean tax increases. It was the most substantive review so far in a race that has been dominated by harsh television commercials and mutual recriminations on the stump. Senator D'Amato has greatly outspent his Democratic rival in paid advertising, and the importance for Mr. Abrams's campaign of public face-offs like debates was underscored by new financial reports yesterday, showing that Mr. Abrams is far behind, with just $197,000 in cash on hand at the end of September, compared with $3.2 million for Mr. D'Amato. [ Page B5. ] Abrams aides said last night that they had received positive reactions from their supporters but were dismayed that radio and television news coverage of the debate had focused on the dispute over the 'fascist" remark. With a televised debate scheduled for tomorrow night, to be broadcast on C-Span, they said they wanted to remove that thorn. In a letter to Mr. D'Amato last night, Mr. Abrams said he now realized that the word "fascist" -- which he used after D'Amato supporters heckled him in an appearance upstate -- had "connotations to some people which I never intended or imagined." Mr. D'Amato has accused Mr. Abrams of an ethnic smear. Mr. Abrams also called on Mr. D'Amato to apologize for his attacks on Mr. Abrams, and on Geraldine A. Ferraro, one of his opponents in the Democratic primary. Mr. D'Amato has accused Mr. Abrams of anti-Italian attacks on Ms. Ferraro's integrity, but it was Mr. D'Amato who first suggested, in a press release in August, that Ms. Ferraro had ties to criminals, including a convicted labor racketeer who was a fund-raiser for her early Congressional campaigns. In his letter of response to Mr. Abrams, Mr. D'Amato said "that only when the political damage became too great did you offer an apology," and added: "I neither forgive nor excuse your behavior." In the debate, some of the candidates' most pointed disagreements came over Mr. Abrams's call for national health insurance. Mr. D'Amato said that could not be financed without hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal spending and higher personal taxes. But Mr. Abrams, in a long, discursive answer, maintained that he did not favor personal tax increases. He said his plan could be financed by higher payroll taxes, higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco and corporations, and reallocations from cuts in military spending. Yet Mr. Abrams acknowledged that even the Democratic Presidential nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton, believes higher taxes will be needed on the wealthiest Americans. Though Mr. D'Amato supports President Bush, both candidates went out of their way to align themselves with Mr. Clinton, who is running well ahead of the President in the state, according to the polls. Mr. Abrams stresseding the need for an end to 12 years of Republican policies while Mr. D'Amatonoted that he, like Mr. Clinton, favors the death penalty and changes in welfare. Abortion Rights The two contenders differed markedly on several issues. Mr. Abrams stressed his longtime support for abortion rights, while Mr. D'Amato, a longtime abortion foe , emphasized that he favored parental consent requirements, though he also took pains to say that, unlike the Republican Party platform and some of his own past stands, he now favored allowing abortions in case of rape or incest. On the air, Mr. Abrams reeled off bitsof his standard speeches in his hooting, mellifluous voice, while Mr. D'Amato sounded less rehearsed, peppering Mr. Abrams in his Long Island accent with questions like, "Did you call me Goebbels?" -- a reference to Mr. Abrams's comparison of Mr. D'Amato's ads to the "big lie" tactics of the Nazi propagandist. Afterward, they weakly shook hands, with Mr. D'Amato allowing, "I shook hands, but I'm not happy about it." Mr. D'Amato had accepted an invitation from Mr. Imus before Mr. Abrams, who had pressed for more statewide televised debates than Mr. D'Amato would accept. Last week, after Mr. Abrams declined to appear, the Imus staff postponed the meeting until yesterday, and said Mr. D'Amato would either face an empty chair or an actor imitating Mr. Abrams if Mr. Abramsfailed to appear. According to copyrighted data compiled by the Arbitron Company, Mr. Imus's program has drawn an overall audience of 182,000 listeners in the 7 to 8 A.M. time slot of the debate, defined as those who listened for at least five minutes during any continuous 15-minute period in the hour.

797-> U.S. Oil Production Down 5% in September
Domestic oil production was 5 percent lower in September than in the corresponding month a year earlier, at just under seven million barrels a day, the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. This continued a string of reports that show increasing United States reliance on oil produced overseas. The petroleum institute, the industry's main trade association, attributed part of the drop to Hurricane Andrew, which disrupted operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana, but noted that production for the first nine months was down 3.6 percent from the previous year. Imports made up the difference, rising 7 percent, to 8.378 million barrels a day for the month. For the first three quarters of the year, imports were up 7.765 million barrels a day, up 1.1 percent over the period a year earlier, according to the Institute's monthly report. Taking account of inventory changes, imports are now supplying 45 to 46 percent of domestic demand, the institute said, or 7.7 million to 7.8 million barrels a day. The number of barrels imported is rising by about 6 percent annually. Consistent with the recession, oil demand has been spotty, falling nine-tenth of 1 percent in September but rising 1.1 percent in the first three quarters of the year. The institute noted that deliveries had been increasing in recent quarters despite the recession, but for the third quarter had dropped seven-tenths of a percent, which the institute called disappointing. It said oil product deliveries for the third quarter had been under 16.9 million barrels a day. Gasoline consumption may have been lower this summer because of the recession, the institute said, with vacations and recreational activities "curbed more than other types of travel by the sluggish economy." Air travel boomed in the summer, but jet fuel deliveries were no higher than those of the previous year, because airlines filled seats that would otherwise have been empty rather than add flights, the report said. Heavy fuel oil, used in electric generation, was down 21.4 percent in the third quarter, the report said, a sign of sluggish demand for electricity.

798-> 41 Arrests Made by Narcotics Task Force
A narcotics task force aimed at Washington Heights drug dealers in Manhattan and their New Jersey customers has resulted in 41 arrests in its first two days, the Port Authority said yesterday. The operation, which is called Operation Border Crossing, began on Wednesday. About 100 law-enforcement officers from the Port Authority, the New York City Police Department and police from Bergen County, N.J., and the Bergen County Prosecutor's office conducted surveillance of suspected buyers as they bought drugs in Washington Heights and then arrested those who returned to New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge. The New York City Tactical Narcotics Team served warrants yesterday at places in Washington Heights where the purchases were made, a spokesman for the Port Authority said. Bridge Is Target "We know that the George Washington Bridge gives many of these drug abusers a quick and easy way to get their fixes and then return to the anonymity of the suburbs," Charles Knox, the director of public safety for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said. "Beginning today, these people are going to have to think twice about using Manhattan as their drug supermarket because we're going to be out here periodically." The operation has so far led to the seizure of 5 packets of heroin, 4 large cocaine vials, 18 tinfoil packets of cocaine, 4 bags of marijuana and various smaller quantities of drugs, law-enforcement officials said.

799-> THE PLAYOFFS; Oh, Canada! First Pennant For Toronto
The Toronto Blue Jays won bragging rights for all of Canada today by beating the Oakland Athletics and capturing the team's first American League pennant. Toronto thus became the first non-American-based franchise to reach the World Series. It did so in stunning fashion, crushing the Oakland Athletics, 9-2. With the victory, in the sixth game of the four-of-seven-game American League Championship Series, Toronto accomplished what the Montreal Expos, baseball's only other Canadian franchise, could not in their 24-year history, and what no previous Blue Jays team could since the club joined the league in 1977. "It's the younger of the teams, but it's important for the whole country," said Tim Sullivan, a 17-year-old high school student from Mississauga, a suburb of Toronto. No Canadians on Jays It also burst several bubbles, among them the belief that Canada can excel in only one major professional sport, hockey. Also dead is the sometimes humorous Canadian fear that the fates, or worse, the Yankees -- and not just the baseball team -- would somehow conspire to keep America's pastime exclusively that. And it did not matter to Sullivan or any of the other 51,335 fans roaring approval or waving Canadian flags in the Skydome, the jam-packed home of the Blue Jays, that the team they cheered is made up exclusively of Americans and players from the Dominican Republic. There is only one other plateau left to reach for Toronto: a World Series championship. The Blue Jays begin that quest Saturday night when the four-of-seven game Series opens in the National League city. The Atlanta Braves and the Pittsburgh Pirates played the decisive game of their pennant playoff tonight. For a day, everyone from the Toronto designated hitter, Dave Winfield, to the day's winning pitcher, Juan Guzman, a Dominican, was an honorary Canadian. And that included Cito Gaston, who became the first black manager to win a pennant. They helped put a city, a province and a nation on the baseball map, one from which they can never be removed, a notion many an emotional fan acknowledged. "This is going to help Canada in baseball, big-time, especially on TV," said Jimmy Iannaci of Mississauga. "American teams have gotten all of the attention before. This shows them that Canada has the best!" Sullivan, who along with two friends "were on a visit to the dentist" rather than in school, undoubtedly played hooky just so they could be a part of Toronto's big party in the ultramodern stadium. Attendance Marks Broken The fans have supported Toronto in world championship style, setting major league attendance records the last two seasons with more than four million turning out each year at the ball park with the convertible roof. None of the 24 non-Canadian franchises -- soon to be 26 with the addition of the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies next seaon -- have ever reached that plateau. Toronto fans wasted little time wondering whether the Pirates or the Braves would stand in the way of the ultimate goal of a world championship, because this was their moment. "This gives us recognition," Sullivan said as he and his friends started the celebration early in a game the Blue Jays led by six runs after just three innings. "This is great, just so great for us here," said Brian McKeigue of Toronto. McKeigue was happy to see history made, but all the more happy to have his 8-year-old nephew, Sean, along, too. "It's good for the kids to see this today," he said. "Toronto's been so close for so long. Now we've finally made it.' " Sean, slurping down a soda, merely stamped the game with a short-but-succinct declaration that "this is real good." But he did smile when his uncle mentioned his participation in the momentous occasion. "His class is watching on TV," McKeigue said. "But he's the only one who got to come to the game today." It Began in the Snow The recognition of Blue Jays excellence has been a long time in building. On April 7, 1977, the day major league baseball made its debut in this city in Exhibition Stadium, the first home of the Blue Jays, the field was covered with snow. Once the field was cleared, the Blue Jays managed to win against the 76-year-old Chicago White Sox. It was one of only 54 victories the team would capture that season. Undaunted, Canadians not only survived the cold that often accompanied Blue Jays baseball in the windy outdoor stadium, but the expansion blues that also confront franchises forced to start from scratch, with a roster stocked with other team's leftovers. Slowly but surely, players like Dave Lemanczyk and Barry Bonnell began to give way to the likes of Dave Stieb, George Bell, Jesse Barfield and Ernie Whitt, players who helped Toronto move away from the cellar and toward respectability. The club reached its first milestone in 1985 when it won its first Eastern Division title. But the Blue Jays were frustrated in their attempt to make history when Kansas City came back from a deficit of 3 games to 1 to win the American League pennant. Two more times, in 1989 and last season, Toronto won its division but failed to reach the World Series. Now, with veterans like Winfield, David Cone, Jack Morris, Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter, the last bridge has been crossed into baseball immortality. A Unifying Force "We've waited a long time for this and so have the fans," said Peter N. T. Widdrington, the team's chairman. "They come out, over four million a year, but this is not only about the ones in the stands. What people don't realize is that we have millions and millions of fans all across Canada." That is important, Widdrington intimated, in light of important decisions about national unity now facing the electorate here. "This team is one of the things that brings Canada closer together at a time when we need to be brought closer together," he said.

800-> Al Brackman, 80; A Music Publisher
Al Brackman, a music publisher and board member of the National Music Publishers' Association, died Oct. 9 at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. He was 80 years old and lived in Plandome, L.I., and San Diego. He died of heart failure, a spokeswoman for the music publishers' association said. Mr. Brackman was general manager of the Richmond Organization, a music publishing and promotion firm he co-founded in 1941. The firm published songs from individual artists like Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Kurt Weill and Anthony Newley, and rock groups like The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd. Mr. Brackman did promotion work for Milton Berle, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington, and co-produced more than 400 jazz recordings. He also wrote regularly for Down Beat and Melody Maker magazines. Mr. Brackman, who was born in Brooklyn, attended the City College of New York. He began his career in 1933 when he helped form the American Academy of Music. Mr. Brackman is survived by his daughter, Alicia Munves of Manhattan, and a grandson.

805-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Incumbent; Bush Sounds Patriotic Theme in Maryland
President Bush drove seven miles to a financially comfortable suburb of Washington today to open his Maryland re-election campaign, declaring that "the fight for the future has just begun and it will continue for four more years." To a crowd of 2,500 people in a high school gymnasium, Mr. Bush offered what is becoming a stock campaign address. It is an upbeat melange of allusions to last year's military victory over Iraq, attacks on Democrats in Congress, calls for passage of his legislation to boost the economy and scornful comments on "professional pessimists" who fear America's claim on world leadership is ebbing. Drawing on a vein of tub-thumping patriotism that spurs applause even from tepid crowds, the President urged his audience at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School "to send a message to those doomsayers and those pessimists": that "we are the United States of America, and we can compete with anybody." Attacks Isolationists Tonight, the line appeared to be directed at Mr. Bush's Republican rival, the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, who was reared in the Chevy Chase section of Northwest Washington, a stone's throw from where Mr. Bush spoke. Mr. Buchanan favors erecting trade barriers to shield American companies from foreign competition and has opposed Mr. Bush's more activist foreign policy. Without naming Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Bush attacked those who would "lock the doors and pull down the blinds and hope the world goes away." "America is not that kind of country," the President said. "Never before in this nation's history have we turned our back on a challenge and we are not going to start now by becoming an isolationist nation. "Think back a year ago this very day," the first anniversary of the allied ground attack in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush said. "What did we hear of those professional pessimists? They spoke of defeat and humiliation. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong now."

807-> Scientists Find Gene That Causes Rare Form of High Blood Pressure
Scientists have discovered the gene behind a rare and severe form of high blood pressure that strikes early in life, often during childhood. Although doctors have long observed that high blood pressure can run in families, the research is the first to identify a gene that causes hypertension, a potentially lethal condition that afflicts more than 60 million Americans. The finding offers researchers their first molecular grasp on a baffling disorder that is thought to result from a tangle of genetic flaws complicated by diet, obesity, lack of exercise and certain environmental factors. And though the gene detected is responsible for only a few thousand hypertension cases nationwide, researchers hope it will lead them to other genes that play a role in high blood pressure and allow them to better focus its treatments. "People have spent the last 50 years studying the physiology of high blood pressure, but only in a minute fraction of cases is the primary cause known," said Dr. Richard P. Lifton of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the lead author on the new report. "Coming at it from a genetic approach will allow us to identify specific causes in specific individuals, so we can tailor the therapy to the patient." Dr. Lifton and his colleagues from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in the Bronx announced their results today in the journal Nature. 'It's a Milestone' "I think this is a very exciting report," said Dr. Suzanne Oparil, head of the Vascular Biology and Hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "It's a milestone in a sense that it's the first example I know of a single gene abnormality being related to hypertension in humans." Researchers said the results would soon lead to a simple blood test for the particular type of hypertension, called glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, which now can be diagnosed only by a handful of experts able to perform complex enzyme measurements. Patients found to harbor the gene could be placed on medication as early as possible, before their blood vessels had become irreparably damaged. "For individuals with this disorder, it's important to make the diagnosis," said Dr. Lifton. "There is a specific treatment that can effectively eliminate the problem, and we'd like to see people treated before the age of 20." He said those at risk for the disorder are people with hypertension in childhood and those with many relatives who have very high blood pressure. Scientists believe the disorder may be more common than estimated, and an easy genetic test would allow them to detect cases of the disease that would otherwise be diagnosed as a garden-variety type of hypertension. The study opens "a new era of research in the genetics of high blood pressure," said Dr. Theodore W. Kurtz, who studies high blood pressure at the University of California at San Francisco. The researchers were surprised by the nature of the mutation they found, an unusual chromosomal mixup that resulted in what Dr. Lifton described as a molecular "minotaur," after the hybrid creature of Greek mythology. "It has the head of one gene and the body of another," he said, with the result that the wrong hormones are at work in the wrong part of the body, resulting in high blood pressure. Hypertension is thought to be dangerous because it forces the heart to labor too hard to pump blood through the body, a condition that can lead to hardening of the arteries, stroke, heart attack and kidney failure. Older people, blacks, obese people and pregnant women are just some of the groups that have a greater than average incidence of hypertension. Diet and sedentary habits are also linked to the disorder, although the role of factors like salt remains fiercely debated. Hormone Mixup In the new study, the scientists examined the genetic material of people in a large family known to suffer from the rare type of hypertension. The afflicted family members were found to possess a telling genetic abnormality. A reshuffling of genes had occurred on chromosome 8, out of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that all humans possess. The switch that normally controls the production of a stress hormone called cortisol had become attached to the body of the gene that manufactures another hormone, aldosterone. With such a minotaur gene at work in the body, the adrenal gland ends up producing an excess of aldosterone. This excess causes abnormal salt retention and a drop in potassium levels, which in turn cause high blood pressure. Drugs that interfere with aldosterone, like spironolactone, are reasonably effective against the disorder if patients receive it early enough. In more common forms of hypertension, scientists estimate that four or five genes may come into play, with differing combinations of inborn flaws resulting in a greater or lesser risk of severe disorder. Recent experiments with rodents have implicated the gene that controls renin, a hormone produced in the kidney.

809-> ARTS/ARTIFACTS; For Those Who Believe You Can Tell a Book by Its Cover
American book collectors focus more attention on the contents than the covers of the volumes they own, rarely exhibiting the jackets. For this reason, the craft of bookbinding is largely unknown to the public in this country. "It's the Anglo-American way," said T. Peter Kraus, the New York dealer-owner of Ursus Books, 981 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street. "Here and in Britain, the tradition is to collect literature, and the bindings on these books are more utilitarian than decorative." As a specialist in art books, Mr. Kraus takes a view that is closer to the French. "I love bindings," he said. "To me, the ultimate is to have a great book in a great binding." And he now shares his passion with the public in "Treasures of Bookbinding -- 1498-1990," an exhibition at Ursus through April 10. Organized with the help of Pierre Beres, a Paris dealer, the show of 100 books includes bindings in every possible material. The focus is on two of the most significant periods of the craft: the Renaissance and the Art Deco era. Among the earliest examples is a hefty German compendium of medieval knowledge, "Speculum Doctrinale," with a 15th-century pigskin binding embellished with pierced brass corners. Far more imaginative is a 16th-century Italian book, "Historia di Ravenna," covered with pen-and-ink drawings on vellum that depict the city's architecture. It is the work of Cesare Vecellio, a nephew of Titian. Two Renaissance bindings, ruled in gold and awash with gilded floral sprays, arabesques and leaves, are in a style named after Jean Grolier, the Paris bibliophile who commissioned them. The style is copied to this day. Religious books are represented by a French 17th-century Bible with a carved wood cover and an 18th-century German study of Christ, bound with silver panels that depict the Resurrection on the front and the Crucifixion on the back. Miniature books have the most unusual wrappers, including one of mother-of-pearl framed in silver and several of beaded embroidery. Bookbinding was transformed in many ways in the early 20th century -- influenced mainly by art movements. The arresting black, red and white typography, played against blocks and bars on a 1925 Russian Constructivist binding, was designed by El Lissitsky. In Paris, Pierre Legrain borrowed freely from Cubism for his inlaid Art Deco leather covers, which incorporate bold geometric images and spare typography in either subtly contrasting hues or primary colors. One Legrain leather binding from 1917 is a study of green and black chevrons and bars enhanced by silver lines. And an orange morocco cover from 1924, also by Legrain, is ablaze with overlapping sunbursts. The show's most flamboyant books are 6 (from a set of 21) that were bound during the 1920's and 30's in animal hides. Each binding was chosen to match the book's subject. A zebra's skin covers a 1923 book on African wildlife; the spine sports its mane. A lion skin was used for the 1929 "African Adventures With the King of the Beasts." These exotic bindings, the work of a French dealer, were sold by his widow 25 years ago to Seymour Hacker, a Manhattan dealer. "She told me her husband had hunted the specimens and tanned the hides," Mr. Hacker said. "I had my doubts." In 1982, he sold them to a New York architect, who sent them last year to Mr. Kraus. The price for the set of 21 books is $25,000. Prices for other books range from $1,250 for a work of poetry, imaginatively bound in 1989 in rubber and embossed with geometric motifs, to $150,000 for a 1913 copy of Sonia Delaunay's "Prose du Transiberien." Illustrated inside and out by the Russian-born abstract artist, the book consists of a folded sheet of paper 75 inches long in a parchment binding. It is a rare example of a binding by an artist. Another is Marcel Duchamp's cover for "Le Surrealisme en 1947," an exhibition catalogue. A depiction of a woman's breast in foam rubber on black velvet, it is labeled on the back "Priere de Toucher" ("Please Touch"). Bookbinding, although largely unpublicized, is flourishing as a craft. "You have binders all over America -- scores of them," Mr. Kraus said. The variety of styles available can be seen at the show in a display of miniature books representing the work of 20 binders. But, Mr. Kraus said, some contemporary craftsmen go too far for his taste. As a case in point, he cited the work of Philip Smith, a British craftsman whose work is not in the show. Mr. Smith designs walls of books that he binds in patterned leather, creating an abstract image. The spines are hidden, with only the fronts visible, framed like a painting. The books are secured behind transparent plastic and a metal grid. "I like to handle a book without using a screwdriver to reach it," Mr. Kraus said. "He's made these books into untouchable objects -- and that sort of defeats the purpose."

811-> Siege Tactic: Cut Off Water and Light
When dusk falls in Sarajevo, thousands of families are cast back into a 19th-century world of candles and oil lamps. Bathing, even brushing teeth, involves measuring out precious water from plastic canisters and bottles. For most, telephones are a receding memory. Since Monday, when the last power line serving this city of 400,000 people was put out of action by shellfire, the only buildings with electricity have been those with emergency generators. And these buildings, including some hospitals and clinics, are running so low on fuel that they operate the generators, and the equipment powered by them, only intermittently. The Water Supply Dries Up Since it was founded in its modern form over five centuries ago, Sarajevo has had abundant water from springs and from the runoff of the snow-capped mountains around the city. But under the siege, water has become desperately scarce. With the cutoff of all electricity this week, the two main pumping stations in the city were idled. This meant that water dried up in many of the places, including mosques, where people have been fetching their supplies. A pumping station in the western suburb of Ilidza that supplied 80 percent of the city's water has been pumping at barely half its volume because pumps failed for lack of repairs, and engineers say 30 percent to 40 percent of the water pumped is lost through pipes fractured by mortar, tank and artillery blasts. The only people able to communicate by telephone with the world outside Sarajevo are those in the Government and armed forces, and some reporters with satellite telephones. The relay station on Trebevic Mountain overlooking the city that carried calls beyond Sarajevo was switched off by Serbian forces three months ago, once they had set up other phone links for their bases around the city. Promises, Promises Three months ago, Serbian nationalist leaders leading the siege of Sarajevo promised United Nations officials that they would not use their control of Sarajevo's utilities as a weapon. The pledges have been repeatedly renewed, but electrical power, running water and working telephones remain among the city's most pressing scarcities. This week, Maj. Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, who is to head an expanded 8,000-member United Nations military force here, traveled to the Serbian headquarters at Pale, 10 miles east of the city, and asked Biljana Plavsic, a Sarajevo University biologist who is one of a trio of Serbian nationalist leaders, to honor previous undertakings that utilities would not be used as weapons. Officials present said Mrs. Plavsic quickly agreed. Such pledges have been made and broken for months. But United Nations officials are undecided whether the Serbian leaders are making promises they have no intention of keeping, or whether subordinates are defying orders, as Serbian leaders have implied. In either case, Sarajevo has been increasingly paralyzed, and the lack of electricity and water has become a major anxiety as winter approaches. Who, if Anyone, Is in Charge? "What the Serbian leaders say in Pale, Belgrade or London has nothing to do with what is going on here," said Nedim Jaganac, a 35-year-old pediatrician who is working on the water problems at the United Nations headquarters here. "Maybe it's a matter of local Serbian commanders making their own decisions, or perhaps they are instructed in a way that is different from the promises made by their leaders. I can't say which." In at least some cases, parties of engineers and workers from the city power company who have left Sarajevo on repair missions with guarantees of safe passage from the Serbian forces have been repeatedly fired on by Serbian units, even when the crews have been accompanied by United Nations escorts. Several workers have been killed, some while ascending transmission towers. Most families have learned to live without electricity, however awkwardly. Some have fashioned home-made candles out of shoe-laces threaded through milk-bottle tops that float in shallow cans of cooking oil; others have powered dim light bulbs by running power from their telephones into home-made batteries. Still others use home-made lamps fueled with scanty reserves of gasoline and diesel fuel. For cooking, many burn chopped-up furniture and doors. The Evils of Bacteria Local Serbian commanders have repeatedly refused to permit crews from the water company into Serbian-held areas to repair pumps, clean filters or replenish chlorine supplies. Without chlorine, engineers have been unable to fight the growing threat of water-borne epidemics. Earlier this month, doctors here announced that they were treating several cases of typhus, but they said these did not appear to be linked to bacteria in the water. However, laboratory tests are said to have confirmed that more than 1,700 cases of diarrhea and dozens of cases of dysentery in recent weeks were caused by contaminated water. With commerce in the city at a standstill -- almost every shop in the city has been destroyed or looted, or both -- there are no water-purification tablets, and without electrical power or fuel, families have been unable to boil water. But with nothing else to drink, people have routinely ignored official warnings not to drink untreated water. Indeed, sanitation and sterilization have become a huge problem. The three main city hospitals have a backlog of more than 20 tons of laundry, and doctors and nurses take their smocks home to be washed by hand.

812-> Review/Film; Vampire With Red Eyes And a Sense of Humor
When a foreign actress makes the kind of impression Anne Parillaud made in "La Femme Nikita," she is likely to find herself fielding American movie offers. So there is always the danger that she will wind up in something like John Landis's "Innocent Blood." Mr. Landis's latest overlong, overproduced spectacle finds this elegant beauty playing a blood-soaked, red-eyed vampire. Her voice is sometimes electronically altered a la "The Exorcist," just to add an extra element of fun. In much the same spirit, there's the scene in which Miss Parillaud handcuffs her arms behind her back as the prelude to a sexual encounter. No less tasteful is the initial nude shot of the actress as she makes vampire jokes by candlelight, referring to her potential victims as "food." Meanwhile, on a comparably droll note, Robert Loggia's Mafia kingpin is seen beating a colleague to death with a toaster oven during the film's first 10 minutes. This scene, like most of the movie, is played as if it were amusing. In France, where Miss Parillaud is best remembered for her Cesar-winning performance as a chic hit-woman in an evening dress, rest assured that no one will be laughing. "Innocent Blood," which could easily have been titled "A French Vampire in Pittsburgh" in homage to one of Mr. Landis's earlier triumphs, is even more dependent on gruesome special effects than "An American Werewolf in London" was, and is a lot less imaginative. Miss Parillaud's status as a vampire is never explained. Mr. Loggia, as the gangster who becomes her principal nemesis through a series of dark and pointless encounters, does little besides curse and scream. He does this even after he is murdered horribly and returns from the dead coated with liver-spotted mud. After he and many of the minor players become vampires themselves, they sport the same gleaming special-effects eyes and do odd things like sleep in meat lockers. Don Rickles, in a small and extremely thankless role, goes this one better by disintegrating into hideous, smoking cinders while Mr. Landis has the temerity to play "Strangers on a Train" on a television screen. It isn't smart to offer the viewer glimpses of a great film during this one. Michael Wolk's screenplay runs to dialogue like "I'm gonna eat your face like a chicken" and "I'm gonna grind you down to blood and screams." Though neither of these threats is made good on, the film does include one innovative action scene in which the same man is struck by both a car and a bus. Also memorable is the autopsy room in which Mr. Landis, never one to risk understatement, provides four or five fully visible, partly dissected corpses when none would have sufficed. Miss Parillaud, who is also given a nice-guy love interest in the form of Anthony LaPaglia (hence the affectionate use of handcuffs), gets through the film looking beautiful but rather dazed. Her attitude is all too easy to understand. "Innocent Blood" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity; extreme, sickening violence, and endless obscenities. Innocent Blood Directed by John Landis; written by Michael Wolk; director of photography, Mac Ahlberg; edited by Dale Beldin; music by Ira Newborn; production designer, Richard Sawyer; produced by Lee Rich and Leslie Belzberg; released by Warner Brothers.

814-> THE WORLD; It's 1992, and No One Is Leading Europe's March to Unity
After nearly three years of epochal change and grand visions of the future, the European Community, much like the United States, is bogged down in the mundane realities of recession and parochial politics. What Europe seems to lack is a leader articulating a clear vision of where the community is going and what its ultimate purpose is, now that the certainties of the cold war have been replaced by uncertainty and economic chaos in the countries that used to make up the Soviet Union. European unity is more easily said than done, something the 12 heads of state and government who negotiated the Treaty on European Union in Maastricht, the Netherlands, a little over three months ago would all probably agree on now. At Maastricht, they decided in principle to create "an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe" by introducing a common currency as early as 1997, making more foreign policy decisions together, and eliminating most internal border controls in the barrier-free market that they plan to complete by the end of this year. But instead of coming into its own as the world's largest and most prosperous market, eclipsing the United States and surging ahead with elan toward ever greater economic and political union, Europe is in a slump. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany might have been the man to lead the way out of the crisis, but he and his country have been too preoccupied with the political and economic difficulties of German unification to know how to do that. One way or another, however, Germany seems fated to define Europe's destiny, which would be much diminished if the Germans decided to go it alone. Mr. Kohl saw European union as the best way to anchor the new, united Germany in the changed strategic environment. At Maastricht, he was one of the principal proponents of monetary union, cooperation in foreign policy and harmonization of social and labor relations among the member states, a principle agreed to in the "social chapter" of the treaty by all of them except Britain. Jitters in Germany But since then, many Germans have become increasingly worried not only about how to pay for unification, but also about who will be asked to pay to keep Russia, Ukraine and the rest from utter collapse. They fear that it will be them, and that they can't afford it. Unification proved far more expensive than Mr. Kohl had led his voters to expect in 1990, and government borrowing set off an inflationary spiral that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, has moved to control. Now Germany, no longer in a boom, faces recession. The Social Democrats, who control the upper house of the German legislature, the Bundesrat, complained that Mr. Kohl had sold out the mark for a nebulous new "European Currency Unit" to be controlled by a European central bank, without insisting in return on new democratic powers for the European Parliament to watch over the financiers. Until this month, they were threatening to block ratification of the treaty. This threat has eased, but the states now want input of their own into community decisions. Both Germany and Mr. Kohl seem to be in an irritable mood, resentful of all efforts to circumscribe their freedom, as shown by Mr. Kohl's insistence Friday on having lunch with the ostracized President of Austria, Kurt Waldheim. From the start, the axis of the European Community has been French-German cooperation, but France's President, Francois Mitterrand, has been thrown seriously off stride. He and his Socialist Party are deeply unpopular after a decade in office. His strategic vision for Europe, if there is one, is apparently to seek German cooperation in a new European military capability that would shoulder the United States, politically and militarily, out of its strategic position in Europe. Campaigning in Britain Britain has always resisted this strongly, and under Prime Minister John Major and his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, it also put a brake on any attempt by the other Europeans to move toward a more federal union. Questions about Europe have had no impact in the British general election campaign, which is preoccupied with arguments about the income tax and proposals to change the National Health Service. But if the opposition Labor Party wins on April 9, its leader, Neil Kinnock, promises to sign onto the "social chapter" on principles of labor relations and fair compensation agreed to by the 11 other states at Maastricht, and to go ahead with monetary union if Britain qualifies and Parliament approves. Still, leading a party that campaigned against British membership in the European Community less than a decade ago, it is doubtful that Mr. Kinnock could emerge as a visionary European leader, any more than the pragmatic and low-key Mr. Major. At last count, more than 80 percent of the measures necessary to implement a single European market without trade barriers this year had been adopted, leaving mostly petty disputes to be resolved: Spain currently permits bananas to be imported only from the Madeiras, for instance. But in some countries the Maastricht treaty itself has become unexpectedly ensnared in domestic politics. Ireland negotiated a protocol to the treaty that safeguards the anti-abortion provisions added to its constitution in 1983. But after last month's political crisis over a teen-aged rape victim who was briefly barred from traveling to England for an abortion, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds wants to redraft the protocol to include an affirmation of the general right to freedom of movement between Ireland and other community countries, and the right to "lawful information" on abortion, before submitting the treaty to a referendum. Rejection by Irish voters would kill the treaty altogether. Spain and Portugal have been disappointed by the failure to make much progress on a fund agreed on at Maastricht that would transfer money from rich northern European countries to their poorer southern cousins. Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's executive commission, proposed setting up such a $3 billion "cohesion fund" by 1997. But even the Germans were taken aback by another proposal from Mr. Delors -- a plan to raise the community budget over the next five years from $81.9 billion to $107.6 billion, plus inflation. Now, with talk that Mr. Mitterrand may need Mr. Delors to replace Edith Cresson as Prime Minister, the futures of the the expansionary budget and the cohesion fund are in doubt. This leaves the Spaniards, in particular, feeling done in. Differences Over Farms In many other important ways, too, momentum has dissipated. A dispute between the United States and the European Community over agricultural policies has snagged negotiations on a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which President Bush hoped to conclude by April 15. But no European leader seems willing or able to push through the necessary compromises, making a mockery of two years' worth of pious promises by the leaders of the world's biggest industrial democracies to get a GATT accord. In addition, Germany showed last winter that a common European foreign policy is a sometime thing at best. The Germans steamrollered over their European partners and recognized Croatia and Slovenia unilaterally as independent republics, hoping to press the Serbs into ending the Yugoslav civil war. It worked, but the other Europeans, who followed suit two weeks later, seemed bruised and battered by the experience. By the end of this decade, the community will be politically even more amorphous, with at least 15 members. Austria and Sweden have applied to join, and Finland is about to. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the other European Free Trade Association countries, will be non-voting members, in effect, when a free trade zone agreement with the community goes into effect at the end of the year. After that, the question is what to do with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which have association agreements and want to become full members. Ukraine, Russia and the other eastern Europeans all want in as well. But what does "Europe" want, except to prosper? For the moment, nobody seems to know.

815-> Study Points to Increase In Tolerance of Ethnicity
Tolerance of ethnicity seems to be rising and anti-Semitism dropping, according to a study of polls conducted over several years by seven national polling organizations in which people were asked to describe or rank different ethnic groups. The study was made public yesterday. The new analysis of existing polling data, sponsored by the American Jewish Committee, provides intriguing glimpses of the images, social standing and conflicts that different ethnic groups are generally perceived to have. One section of the report is based on a poll in which respondents were asked to rank the social standing of 58 ethnic groups. European groups generally monopolized the top of the ladder, and within the European groups their perceived status mostly followed the order of immigration, with those groups that arrived in this country first, like the British and Protestants, assigned the highest standing. Non-Europeans at Bottom The Germans, Irish and Scandinavians, who immigrated in the mid-19th century, came next, followed by Italians, Greeks, Poles, Russians and Jews, who came to America later. Most people assigned the bottom rungs of the ladder to non-Europeans, including a fictitious ethnic group, "Wisians." "We were trying to see if people were being too compliant with us, and the good news is that 61 percent didn't rank the Wisians," said Tom W. Smith, author of the American Jewish Committee report and director of the General Social Survey, the largest and longest-term project supported by the National Science Foundation's Sociology program. "My explanation for the low ranking is that people probably thought that if they were foreign-sounding, and they'd never heard of them, they couldn't be doing too well." The ratings of almost every group drifted up slightly from 1964 to 1989, the American Jewish Committee analysis found, but the groups whose social standings were perceived to have improved most significantly were the Japanese, Chinese and blacks. Despite the improvement, blacks, who were identified as Negroes in the 1989 poll so the wording would be comparable to that of the 1964 survey, were still perceived as having low social standing, akin to American Indians and Mexicans. In 1989, the Japanese were thought to rank about the same as French Canadians and Jews, while the Chinese stood between Spanish Americans and Hungarians. The study found that anti-Jewish attitudes were at historic lows, by most indicators. In the 1990 General Social Survey, a poll of 1,372 representative adults in direct interviews nationwide, Jews were even perceived as leading whites in general, Southern whites, Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and blacks in terms of who was regarded as harder working, richer, less prone to violence, more self-supporting and more intelligent. The only characteristic on which Jews were not top-rated was patriotism, on which whites and Southern whites were perceived more favorably, followed by Jews and blacks, and then Asian- and Hispanic-Americans. The study also analyzed data from several polls about which groups were thought to have too much power in the United States. In the 1990 General Social Survey, 25 percent of the respondents said whites had too much power, as against 21 percent who said Jews had too much power. Among the other groups, 14 percent thought blacks had too much power, 6 percent said Asian-Americans did and 5 percent said Hispanic-Americans did. Conversely, when asked which groups should have more power, 47 percent said blacks, 46 percent said Hispanic-Americans, 37 percent said Asian-Americans, 15 percent said Southern whites, 13 percent said Jews and 6 percent said whites. Possible Source of Concern One source of possible concern about anti-Semitism, the study found, was that those who thought Jews were richer than whites in general were almost twice as likely to say that Jews had too much influence as those who thought the two groups were equally wealthy. And while the images of Jews as rich, smart and hard-working were generally positive, Mr. Smith said those very images might someday lead to renewed anti-Semitism. "While these evaluations are positive on their face, they identify Jews as a possible target of envy and resentment," the study said. Still, the American Jewish Committee said the report should come as a relief to American Jews who fear a possible increase in anti-Semitism. "With the recent events involving David Duke, Crown Heights and Leonard Jeffries, the anxiety level of American Jews has risen," said David Singer, director of information at the American Jewish Committee. "This study is an important grounding in reality." Perceptions of tension between different ethnic groups were measured in a May 1990 telephone poll of 3,004 representative adults, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates. "The major conflict that was perceived was the black-white conflict," Mr. Smith said. "Others, like tensions between blacks and Jews, or Hispanics or Asians, just didn't come anywhere near that level." Indeed, 56 percent of those polled said blacks disliked whites, and 53 percent said whites did not like blacks. Only 10 percent said blacks were disliked by Asians-Americans and 11 percent said blacks were disliked by Jews.

A picture caption on Feb. 9 with an article about Istanbul's mosques misidentified one. It was the Fatih Mosque, not the Shehzade Mosque by the architect Mimar Sinan. In addition, the accompanying map of Istanbul misidentified one mosque and rendered the name of another incorrectly. The mosque on the northern side of the Golden Horn is Sokollu Mehmet Pasha, not Sokollu Mehmet. The mosque to its east is Kilic Ali Pasha. The date of the Suleymaniye Mosque was also misstated. It is 1550 to 1557, not 1667. This correction was delayed improperly by an editing oversight.

818-> ART; A Cross Section of Styles by 23 Contemporary Black Artists
THE Reader's Digest is not overly modest: no company housed in a 1930's Georgian mansion that is only slightly smaller than Blenheim could be called that. Still, it does not batter the public with its image. Other publications come and go, changing policies and formats, but this 70-year-old magazine keeps prospering, like The National Geographic, and last year expanded its domain to include Russia. Not the least of The Digest's assets is the art collection, which Lila Acheson Wallace and her husband, DeWitt, started in the 1940's for the edification of their employees and which now numbers 7,000 works. Degas, Monet, Manet, Van Gogh and Bonnard are among the names represented. And we are not talking about studio scrapings: the Monets include a "Water Lilies," and "Anemones and Mirror," circa 1920, is one of the loveliest still lifes that Matisse ever painted. The company is not slow to lend its treasures -- witness the "Manet to Picasso" show, which just completed a world tour, and the Bloomsbury extravaganza that graced the Katonah Gallery in 1987. Nor does it hesitate to sponsor exhibitions of art from other collections, like the Burns holdings of 19th-century photographs of black Americans that were recently bestowed on the Bronx Museum of the Arts and are currently on view at the Hudson River Museum. That was for Black History Month last year; the celebration this year is "Words and Images," a joint production by the magazine and the Council for the Arts in Westchester, which is on view through March 31 at the company's headquarters here. It was organized by Marian Straw, director of the AC-BAW Center for the Arts in Mount Vernon, and Catti James, an assemblagist who works under the name Catti. Together they have chosen 23 black contemporaries. A cross section of styles would include Malcolm Mooney's explosive abstractions in mostly yellow, red and black; the mournful fairground scenes by Ann Tanksley, who seems influenced by Jacob Lawrence, and the black and white photographs of Pamela Owens that focus on street life in Newark. There are abstract reliefs modeled in white paper pulp by Helen Ramsaran, photographic images of boys with pigeons, painted by Michael Singletary on canvases of different sizes laid one on top of another, and the image of Frederick Douglass with white hair silk-screened 25 times and sometimes combined with photographic collage, the work of Michael Bramwell. There are also some welded reliefs by David Davis, one of which is an African mask excerpted, it seems, from the body of an orange automobile. Of diversity and promise there is plenty; of solid accomplishment, a little less. Noteworthy in that division, however, are Michael Cummings, B. J. Hord, Sana Mususama and Todd Williams. Mr. Cummings gives the impression of having chosen quilting as a medium because he can cover more ground faster with a sewing machine and patterned fabrics than with brush and paint. In these three 9-by-6-foot images titled "African Jazz," the figures are treated like African sculptures even though the piano player in them smokes a cigarette. The artist handles his fabrics skillfully, enlivening geometric and floral patterns in black, white, gray and muted colors with stabs of, say, brilliant fuchsia and blue and adding highlights of buttons. He also inserts passages that are quite realistic, like the jungle with bird at the top of No. 3. These are exact and very clever analogies for New Orleans-style improvisation. B. J. Hord's contribution is an aerial view of marble-playing boys who are modeled in colored papier-mache and arranged on a painted ground. It is a small and very-well-made scene set in a conventional picture frame. Sana Mususama is a ceramist who, like Robert Arneson, does not dwell on the joys of craftsmanship but rather uses the medium as a means of expression. None of her shapes is identifiable, yet all allude to reality, the best of them to organic growths like fungus and coral. Surfaces are alternately glazed and rough, and the colors are stunning. That leaves the relief constructions of Todd Williams -- handsome things made of objects that could either have been shaped for the occasion or else found. The best is a plaque shaded from black to crimson on which are 144 wood chips in rows of 12. Each chip is covered with paper that is either painted or cut from colored photographs, so that the entire formation coheres into a geometrical abstraction ranging from reds, yellows and browns at the center to cool hues at the edges. Also handsome is the cluster of mallet-like shapes with heads sliced obliquely and handles pointed downward. The principal decoration here is glossy red paper imprinted with a dark floral design. Though erratic, the selection contains enough outstanding work to make it worth a visit. There is no information about the artists beyond the fact that only six are Westchester residents. One wonders if the jurors chose to look for talent outside the county or felt obliged to. Visitors to the show must call 241-5125 beforehand.

823-> Theater in Review
Five Very Live The Atlantic Theater 336 West 20th Street Manhattan Through Jan. 18 Five one act plays by contemporary American playwrights: David Ives, Patrick Breen, Howard Korder, David Van Matre and Peter Hedges; scenery by James Wolk; lighting by Howard Werner; production stage manager, Matthew Silver. Presented by the Atlantic Theater Company. WITH: Robert Bella, Ron Butler, Sarah Eckhardt, Steven Goldstein, Kristen Johnson, Mary McCann, Neil Pepe, David Pittu, Robin Spielberg and Damian Young. In "Five Very Live," an anthology of unequal one-act comedies dealing with sociocultural matters, a troupe of eager young actors from the Atlantic Theater Company has ample elbow room to display its comic resourcefulness. Mary McCann and Robert Bella are the entire cast of David Ives's "Sure Thing," the first and by far the funniest of the comedies, a sharp-sighted take on contemporary mating habits. In this curtain-raiser, which was previously produced at the Manhattan Punch Line, a man approaches a cafe table and begins a round robin of small talk with a woman who is reading "The Sound and the Fury." His first maneuver fizzles, and, after the sound of a buzzer, he tries again. The buzzer keeps sounding and interrupting and the dialogue keeps changing, until the play becomes a virtuosic series of variations on a single theme. Moving from Faulkner to Woody Allen, Mr. Ives shifts degrees of aggressiveness and self-defensiveness, in 10 nimble minutes offering a thesaurus of the modes and mannerisms of the pick-up. Under Scott Zigler's direction, Ms. McCann and Mr. Bella are the deftest of reactors and counter-reactors. Later, Ms. McCann appears with Kristen Johnston, a hopeful hostess in Howard Korder's "Wonderful Party," another repeat from the Manhattan Punch Line. This is a raucous, one-note cartoon about hangers-on and gate-crashers, which finds some fun in the specifics of party giving (Ms. Johnston offers tropical drinks "with or without an umbrella"). The sketch reaches a climax when 20 uninvited guests crowd the apartment with a Babel of forced bonhomie. Mr. Bella's showiest role is in the play that gives the anthology its title, David Van Matre's sophomoric sendup of tabloid television journalism. The actor plays a baseball star hounded from the game on unproven moral charges. Mr. Bella is amusing as the abashed athlete and Ms. McCann and Ron Butler radiate smugness as the anchors in charge of allegations and rumors. David Pittu holds the stage alone in Patrick Breen's whimsical "Call of the Wily." He plays Wily, the mischief-making coyote in cartoons. As interpreted by Mr. Pittu and as disguised in a seedy coyote costume by Kia Heath, Wily is a highly cultured sort. Standing at a bar, he soliloquizes like a Dudley Moore film character. The unanswered question of the moment is why does the coyote never capture the Road Runner? "The Age of Pie" by Peter Hedges closes the evening with farce turning into slapstick. This is a flat-handed attempt to write a play to end all plays about encounter groups. In this case, the therapy session leads to squabbles and, in the absence of a resolution, culminates with custard pies. Despite the slippery demands of the play, the actors perform with panache. Once again, humor derives less from the words of a playwright than from the exuberance of a community of actors.

825-> Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Agree to Hear Appeal of Impeached Judge
Accepting an appeal from an impeached and convicted Federal judge, the Supreme Court agreed today to examine the shortcut the Senate has used three times in the past five years to remove Federal judges from office. The Court's action was unexpected because all challenges to the procedure have been rejected in the lower courts. Both the Senate and the Bush Administration opposed the latest appeal, filed by Walter L. Nixon Jr., formerly the chief judge of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mr. Nixon was convicted in 1986 of lying to a Federal grand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with a district attorney, and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate in 1989. The Constitution gives the Senate the exclusive duty to "try all impeachments." At one time, the full Senate did just that, with all senators serving in effect as jurors while an impeachment case was tried on the floor of the Senate. Under a rule adopted in 1935, but not used until 1986, the Senate gave itself the option of having a committee of 12 senators, rather than the full Senate, conduct the hearing and compile the evidence. The committee then presents its report to the Senate, which then votes on whether to convict or acquit on each article of impeachment. Constitutionality Challenged The three Federal judges who were convicted by this process, Harry E. Claiborne, Alcee L. Hastings and Mr. Nixon, all brought unsuccessful challenges to its constitutionality in the lower Federal courts. They argued that the Constitution commands the Senate as a whole, and not a committee of the Senate, to try impeachments. In his Supreme Court appeal, Mr. Nixon is arguing that "to 'try' a case, according to the ordinary meaning of the word, necessarily means that the trier hear and see the evidence." He argues that because his case turned on the credibility of witnesses, his defense was particularly wounded by the exclusion of 88 of the 100 senators from the fact-finding portion of his trial, at which witnesses testified and were cross-examined. The purpose of the 12-member committee is to avoid tying up the full Senate in a hearing that can take days or weeks. Mr. Nixon's trial took only four days, but Mr. Hastings's trial in 1989 took 18 days. Some senators have expressed doubt about the constitutionality of the process and some have called for a constitutional amendment that would take the responsibility of impeaching and removing Federal judges out of the hands of Congress and give it to a special commission. Despite accepting Mr. Nixon's appeal, Nixon v. United States, No. 91-740, the Supreme Court might well not reach the constitutional merits of the issue. The Court must first decide whether the case is one that a Federal court can or should entertain, or whether even hearing such a case would be an undue interference by the judiciary into a matter that the Constitution leaves entirely in the Senate's hands. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed Mr. Nixon's appeal last year without deciding the merits. Two of the three judges found that the courts should not rule on the validity of the Senate's procedures. The third judge did address the merits, finding that the committee process is constitutionally permissible. If the Supreme Court concludes that it should reach the merits, it will most likely send the case back to the appeals court for further consideration. These were among the other developments today as the Justices returned from a four-week recess: Racketeering Law The Court agreed to resolve the meaning of a disputed portion of the Federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, usually known as RICO. The law, a powerful legal weapon against white-collar crime as well as the mob activity at which it was originally aimed, makes it illegal to "participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of an enterprise" that is engaged in a "pattern of racketeering activity." The lower Federal courts are in dispute over the level of participation necessary to incur liability under the law. For example, if an accountant or a lawyer advises an organization's management, but is not officially part of the management, is that person taking part in the organization's affairs in a way that can violate the RICO statute? The case the Court accepted, Reves v. Ernst & Young, No. 91-886, is an appeal from a lower court decision that took a particularly narrow view of this question. The case began as a RICO suit brought by investors in securities offered by an Arkansas farmers' cooperative that went bankrupt. The investors sued the cooperative's accountant, saying that the financial statements had been fraudulent. But the Federal District Court in Arkansas, in a ruling affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, dismissed the suit on the ground that the accounting firm had not taken enough part in the cooperative's affairs to be held liable. Under broader tests used by other Federal circuits, it would have been theoretically possible to find liability. Questioning of Motorists Without comment, the Justices turned down a Justice Department appeal that sought to expand the circumstances under which police officers can interrogate motorists stopped for routine traffic violations. The case, United States v. Walker, No. 91-943, was an appeal from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. That court dismissed the narcotics indictment of a motorist who was stopped for speeding on an interstate highway. The police officer determined that the driver's license and registration were in order, but did not return the license. The officer then asked questions about drugs and cash and eventually searched the car's trunk, finding 200 pounds of cocaine. The appeals court found that the further interrogation violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures because the officer's questions were not reasonably related to the speeding violation, and because the driver was not free to leave without getting his license back. In its appeal, the Justice Department argued that the appeals court "incorrectly struck the Fourth Amendment balance between the critical public interest in detecting drugs and other contraband on the public highways" and the "truly minimal intrusion" of the police officer's questions.

827-> SPORTS PEOPLE: FIGURE SKATING; Obession Over Witt
He is a 47-year-old man who lives with his mother. She thinks he's mentally ill, as did a psychiatrist who once examined him and decided he was a paranoid schizophrenic. Indeed, HARRY VELTMAN seems to have developed a full-blown obsession with the former Olympic champion KATARINA WITT, so much so that he was arrested in California last month and charged with sending her obscene and threatening letters. Federal agents said they made the arrest at the time because they were afraid Weltman would harm Witt at an ice show the next day. Since then Veltman has confided to a court-appointed psychiatrist that he is convinced that Witt has a crush on him and that he and she should run for President and Vice President together. The psychiatrist, WILLIAM VICARY, weighed all that and ruled that Weltman was not only sane enough to stand trial but that he was also competent to serve as his own attorney. A preliminary hearing has been set for Jan. 17. (AP)

828-> The Cold War: Get Over It
Despite all the public preoccupation with the economy, George Bush and Bill Clinton have had plenty to say about foreign policy. The problem is that most of it looks backward. By failing to talk about America's future role in the world, whoever wins on Nov. 3 is missing the chance to claim popular support for needed change. Mr. Bush is trying to take credit for being in the right place at the right time when the cold war ended. And he is reaching even further back, to reopen the wounds of Vietnam. But he has said little about the world of the future. Mr. Clinton, to his credit, has talked about promoting democratic values in the world, not just playing geopolitical chess. But he's been too cautious about cutting wasteful weapons, and too eager to promote arms sales. Together they are addressing foreign policy of the 20th century instead of summoning support for realities of the 21st. The President, not wrongly, is still tidying up the old agenda: negotiating deep cuts in nuclear arms and a chemical weapons ban. But he's been slow to head off new troubles. These include helping ex-Communist states through a perilous transition . . . stanching the bloodletting in Bosnia . . . and preventing the proliferation of all weapons, not just those of mass destruction. And he's had difficulty defining what America now stands for abroad. Mr. Clinton's first ventures into foreign policy made him look like a man walking into a minefield, looking for familiar ground. He criticized past Bush blunders, like aiding and arming Iraq and toasting the tyrants of Tiananmen, but shied from offering departures of his own. Recently, in a splendid initiative, he called for "a pro-democracy foreign policy," de-emphasizing military in favor of political and economic means. That's best pursued in concert with others -- "a global alliance for democracy," he calls it -- and through the United Nations. It's a sound start, but Mr. Clinton needs to curtail consumption and wasteful weapons if he's going to reverse America's stagnating economic performance. He urges "the courage to change" but without yet calling for the necessary sacrifices or changes in public attitude. For instance, there is no necessary conflict between guarding against external dangers and meeting domestic needs. The bloated Bush defense budget is a senseless extravagance that would bleed domestic plans. Yet Mr. Clinton would cut it by a mere $60 billion over five years. He takes issue with Democrats "who see defense cuts as largely a piggybank to fund domestic wish lists." Yet he rightly proposes that "Every dollar we save by downsizing our armed forces and defense industries will be reinvested during our transition to a post-cold-war economy." His party wisely wants to "press for strong international limits" on conventional arms sales to troubled regions. Yet Mr. Clinton sold out that platform pledge in his haste to endorse the sale of F-15's to Saudi Arabia and F-16's to Taiwan. The cold war will haunt the campaign, and the country, until Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton turn their vision and voices forward.

830-> Patents; Faster Operation For Imaging Gear
A researcher at the Essex Corporation, a small company in Columbia, Md., that provides systems engineering services to the Federal Government, has invented what company officials say is a light-based computing technology that allows medical imaging equipment and advanced radar to construct images far more rapidly and cheaply than is now possible. At the moment, for example, computer-aided tomography systems create detailed images of the inside of a person's body by beaming millions of X-rays through the patient and then measuring the intensity of X-rays as they reach detectors on the other side of the body. These signals are then converted to digital data using a high-speed special-purpose computer and the data is plotted at high speed to reconstruct an image. The new technology makes it possible to translate the X-ray signals into an image much more directly, said Jeffrey Lapides, vice president of commercial products at Essex. Instead of coding the signals into digital information, the system measures the X-ray signal and uses that information to move laser beams in such a way that they create a scaled-down copy of the original image on what amounts to an ordinary video camera. In effect, Dr. Lapides said, this approach cuts out a vast amount of computation, speeding up the job of constructing an image by about a hundredfold and in some cases making it possible to use smaller equipment than today's systems. Terry Turpin, chief scientist at Essex, received patent 5,079,555.

831-> Cambodia Mission Chief Sees Team as a Catalyst
His job is unparalleled in the annals of the United Nations. When Yasushi Akashi leaves New York this weekend for Cambodia as a special representative of Secretary General Boutros Ghali, his assignment is to bring new economic and political life to the killing fields. As head of the newly created United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Mr. Akashi will lead a team of thousands of professionals and volunteers who will oversee every aspect of Cambodian life from the police to banking, while setting the stage for elections in 1993. "This is the most dramatic instance of what the international community can do in the post-cold-war age," Mr. Akashi said in an interview this week after meeting Congressional skeptics and critics of the mission. "If we can overcome this challenge, the U.N. will come out a much stronger body." Setting up a transitional international administration in Cambodia is the most ambitious and expensive project of its kind undertaken by the United Nations, with a budget likely to run into billions. The team will work with the Supreme National Council drawn from the four warring Cambodian factions that signed a peace treaty in October. The appointment of Mr. Akashi, a 61-year-old career United Nations official and author, also illustrates the growing visibility of Japan and a new breed of Japanese internationalists in United Nations operations. As he arranges the return of at least 360,000 Cambodian exiles, Mr. Akashi will work with Sadako Ogata, a fellow citizen who is now the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They speak to each other frequently, in Japanese, though both are also fluent in English and French. Cambodia as Japanese Outlet "Japanese interest in Cambodia is extensive and genuine," Mr. Akashi said. "We want to show our sense of international responsibility." He plans to stop in Tokyo on his way to Phnom Penh to make a few motivating speeches. "Cambodia is a good outlet for Japanese with humanitarian concerns," he said. "This appointment clearly signals the arrival of Japan on the international stage as a major player in the resolution of regional conflicts," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz of New York, chairman of the House subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific. "If this is coupled with Japan's willingness to contribute more to the peacekeeping operation, that would be a great accomplishment," said the Brooklyn Democrat, who is a strong supporter of a full appropriation for the Cambodia effort. "What is at stake here is the fate of a nation that has suffered more than any other in the 20th century," Mr. Solarz said after meeting Mr. Akashi. In the Senate, Frank R. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said the United Nations had found the right person for a historic task. Mr. Akashi speaks with a sense of urgency. "The rainy season is coming in May, and this will hamper movement," he said. "And we have to bring in everything from outside, from vehicles to office equipment to prefabricated buildings." In a country saturated by war, the United Nations team will have to disarm 200,000 troops and an equal number of militia members. It will have to find and destroy arms caches and root out mines. All of this will have to be achieved in an atmosphere where lawlessness is increasing, Mr. Akashi said. A health care system, schools, a press, broadcasting and banks -- all targets of the Khmer Rouge and to some extent the Vietnamese-backed Communists who followed -- will have to be rebuilt from scratch. An electoral system and government institutions have to be created. More than 12,000 United Nations staff members have volunteered to go to Cambodia with Mr. Akashi, who has been Under Secretary General for disarmanent affairs and Under Secretary for public information. He called their willingness to take posts of extreme hardship "touching and moving." In most cases, families will not accompany them. Mr. Akashi sees his job as an opportunity for the United Nations to learn on the job how to deal with local conflicts. Conscious of the need to preserve what fragile sense of national sovereignty has survived in that battered nation of seven million people, he insists that his team will limit itself to acting as a catalyst for Cambodians, who will have to do much of the work of rehabilitating their country. Many experts fear that so large an international presence will foster a sense of dependency. "We cannot replace Cambodians," he said. "We have the opportunity to create a democracy that we and they devise for them. But they have to know that we cannot be there for good."

832-> WESTCHESTER GUIDE
MORRIS AND CIRCLE "Designing Utopia: The Art of William Morris and His Circle," an exhibition opening today at the Katonah Museum, is believed to be the first American survey of the English designer's work and the work of the contemporaries he influenced -- Sir Edward Burne-Jones, D. G. Rossetti, W. A. S. Benson and others. Morris's designs for wallpaper, textiles, stained glass, furniture and the style of his book illustrations for his own Kelmscott Press and other publishers are still widely copied 96 years after his death. But the originals, as seen in this collection, are reminders that imitators rarely duplicate the quality of his work. His style found wide acceptance in this country. While the Morris chair is probably his best-known creation, it is a small measure of his output. His wallpapers, paintings, illustrations and textile designs recall medieval tapestries and manuscripts. They are dense and complex and based on natural forms of plants and animals, meticulously drawn and colored in flat, subtle hues. His depictions of men and women with idyllic countenances and long, graceful bodies evoke the mythic members of King Arthur's Court. Yet he was an avid socialist-humanist, an advocate of beauty and quality in household objects as the birthright of all levels of society. His decorating firm, Morris & Company, founded in 1861, produced everything by hand, to insure quality and to rebel against the demeaning of crafts by the Industrial Revolution and mass production. Through his Socialist League, founded in the 1880's, he disseminated his views in illustrations and text. The exhibition will remain through April 12. It was curated by Dr. Stephen F. Eisenman, specialist on late 19th-century art and professor of art history at Occidental College in Los Angeles. A symposium is scheduled for March 28 with Mark Samuels Lasner, president of the American chapter of the William Morris Society; Peter Cormack of the William Morris Gallery in London and others. A reception will be held today from 2 to 6 P.M. Regular museum hours are Tuesdays through Fridays and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is free. For more information and details about additional events for adults and children, call 232-9555. CANADA AND BUSINESS Herschel E.

Tickets are $3.50 at the door, or $3 in advance, available only at the library. SLIDE SHOW ON PARK Connetquot River State Park in Oakdale, L.I., contains a trout hatchery, a herd of deer and flocks of wild turkeys and swans. It is also the site of one of three spring creeks on Long Island and has been visited by such renowned fly-fishermen as Teddy Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter. The park will be the subject of a slide talk by Gil Bergen, its curator, at the Tuesday meeting of Trout Unlimited. Mr. Bergen will trace the early days of the park, when it was a private estate, and how it has developed as a public property. The program is open to all free of charge, beginning at 7:30 P.M. in the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco. For more information, call 666-5727. WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY They will be celebrating George Washington's birthday at Washington's Headquarters Museum in North White Plains today from noon to 4 P.M. and on Saturday from 1 to 3 P.M. Carl Halgren, a member of Morgan's Rifle Corps, will portray Washington in full military uniform and with other members of the corps will participate in outdoor drills and patrols of the grounds to watch for the British. The corps, made up of men from various towns in New Jersey, is a re-creation of an authentic 18th-century military unit, performing re-enactments of historical events in the area. In the kitchen, costumed women representing the Miller family, the 18th-century owners of the house, will prepare dinner for Washington and his troops and busy themselves spinning, quilting, basketweaving and engaging in other Colonial household tasks. The Miller farm was comandeered by Washington while he planned the Battle of White Plains in 1776. Admission is free. Saturday's program is for children. Ginger cookies, which Washington loved, will be baked; games will be played, and Colonial toys, which may be taken home, will be made. A fee of $5 covers materials.

833-> ALBERTVILLE; Duchesnays in 2d Place
Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, representing France, finished second in the original dance tonight behind Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko of the Unified Team. The Duchesnays, third in compulsories, also moved up to second over all heading into Monday night's free dance. But they must beat Klimova and Ponomarenko, the 1989 and 1990 world champions, by two places in the free dance to win the Olympic title. That is a feat the defending world champions have never managed. The sellout crowd was subdued until the Duchesnays skated. The fans saluted their adopted compatriots -- both Isabelle and Paul grew up in Canada, although he was born in France -- with warm applause, stamping feet and high-flying flags. When they completed their spunky, playful program to "The Lonely Goatherd" from "The Sound of Music," dozens of flowers were thrown onto the ice. But the crowds' cheers turned to boos when the marks came up. The Duchesnays' collection of 5.7's (four), 5.8's (10) and 5.9's (four) placed them second in the original dance and second over all. They were first with the British, Finnish, Hungarian and French judges, third with the judge from the Unified Team. Klimova and Ponomarenko, winners of the 1984 Olympic bronze medal and a silver in 1988, did the polka to music by Shostakovich. Although the music sounded like a waltz, the steps clearly were the polka. The marks ranged from a lone 5.6 for artistry from Hungary to eight 5.9's, including two from the Unified Team judge. The French judge placed them third. Maya Usova and Aleksandr Zhulin of the Unified Team drew high marks, including 5.9 for artistry from the Unified Team judge. They skated to music by Strauss and the maneuvers were waltz-like. The United States champions, April Sargent-Thomas and Russ Witherby, and another American team, Rachel Mayer and Peter Breen, both skated lighthearted routines. Sargent-Thomas and Witherby stood 10th, while the Mayer-Breen team was 14th.

835-> Assembly of Serbs in Croatia Votes to Oust Peace Plan Foe
An assembly in Croatia's main enclave of ethnic Serbs voted today to oust its hard-line leader because of his opposition to a United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, the national news agency Tanyug reported. But the leader, Milan Babic, vowed to remain president of the Krajina enclave. He said he would hold a local referendum next weekend to decide whether United Nations peacekeeping troops should be accepted in the region, which runs south and east of Zagreb, the Croatian capital. "I have no intention of stepping down," Mr. Babic said in a telephone interview from Knin, the main town in Krajina. "The decision is illegal and means nothing," Other Parties Accept Plan Leaders of the breakaway republic of Croatia, as well as Serbia, the Yugoslav Army and other parties in the civil war, have basically accepted the United Nations peace plan. The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, is expected to order the deployment of a 13,000-member peacekeeping force this week with or without Mr. Babic's agreement. Thousands of people have been killed and left homeless as Serbs backed by Yugoslav Government troops have fought to gain control of Croatian territory. The fighting broke out after Croatia and the neighboring republic of Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia last June. Members of the Krajina assembly voted today in the town of Glina, 30 miles south of Zagreb, to oust Mr. Babic and his local administration, Tanyug said. Mr. Babic has been facing a revolt among local lawmakers since he was singled out as the only leader defying the United Nations peace plan. The initiative calls for local Serbs to disarm and the Yugoslav Army to withdraw from the region as Krajina becomes a zone protected by the United Nations. It was unclear whether the assembly's vote would effectively remove Mr. Babic from power. The hard-line leader is said to have a wide following. Cease-Fire Deteriorates A cease-fire that took effect in Croatia six weeks ago has begun to deteriorate, and Mr. Ghali is said to be anxious to dispatch peacekeeping troops as soon as possible. Tanyug said one federal soldier was killed and two were wounded today when a Croatian unit attacked an army convoy near Okucani, 80 miles east of Zagreb. Croatian news reports said that two people were killed late Saturday in an artillery and mortar attack on Osijek in eastern Croatia. The reports, which could not be confirmed, would push the death toll for the last week to at least 13, making it the worst week of fighting in Croatia since the truce began on Jan. 3. Croatia and Slovenia won wide recognition as independent states last month. The Yugoslav republic of Macedonia has also declared independence, and European Community foreign ministers are expected to debate the issue of recognition on Monday at a meeting in Lisbon.

836-> Census Bureau to Dismiss Analyst Who Estimated Iraqi Casualties
The Census Bureau said today that it intended to dismiss an analyst who had estimated that 13,000 Iraqi civilians were killed by American-led forces in the Persian Gulf war, an estimate more than twice the bureau's subsequent official calculation. A census spokeswoman, Karen Wheeless, said the possible dissmissal stemmed not from the estimate itself but from the analyst's decision to make the information public without submitting it to proper "peer review." But the analyst, Beth Osborne Daponte, said today that she had obtained the proper reviews. "The projections that I had prepared were approved by three levels of bureaucracy," including up to the assistant division chief of the bureau's Center for International Research, where Ms. Daponte works, she said. "The projections had the same scrutiny as any other figures that are prepared by the Census Bureau." Ms. Daponte said she made her estimates public because the Census Bureau had no intention of releasing the information. Sensitive Issue Estimates of the number of Iraqi casualties caused by the war and its aftermath have been a sensitive issue for the Bush Administration, which went to great lengths during the war to emphasize its focus on purely military targets. Ever since Iraq capitulated, the Pentagon has contended that it is impossible to produce accurate estimates on the number of civilian deaths. The new dispute, first reported today in The Washington Post, stems from an estimate that Ms. Daponte did on the post-war population of Iraq. The center prepares an annual handbook on world population, which draws on information from a wide range of sources. Estimates on the number of war-related deaths were prepared to update the population estimate on Iraq. After drawing on published information and on literature about estimating military casualties, Ms. Daponte calculated that 40,000 Iraqi soldiers and 13,000 civilians died in direct military conflict. In addition, she estimated that 30,000 people had died during the Shiite and Kurdish rebellions after the war and that 70,000 people died from health problems caused by the destruction of water and power plants. Ms. Daponte supplied her estimates to a reporter for The Associated Press in January. Over the next several weeks, two of Ms. Daponte's superiors and the Deputy Director of the Census Bureau, Kincannon C. Louis, called one of the experts she had cited as a source, Col. Trevor N. Dupuy, a retired military historian. Colonel Dupuy supplied them with his own estimates on the number of war casualties, which were lower than those of Ms. Daponte. Since then, the Census Bureau has released its own estimates that lower the estimate on immediate civilian deaths from 13,000 to 5,000. Reasons for Dismissal Ms. Wheeless said the bureau intended to dismiss Ms. Daponte because she violated the procedures for preparing data. "None of the Government's charges or concerns were about number of war dead," she said. "They're related instead to following rigorous peer review process that the bureau has in regard to any report that we put out. When the Census Bureau says these are the numbers, that's our Good Housekeeping seal of approval. We just can't have people saying that they know best and releasing things without defending their work in front of the peers." In January, the Census Bureau discarded Ms. Daponte's draft report and replaced it with one prepared by her superior, Frank Hobbs, chief of the population studies branch. That report matches Ms. Daponte's estimates on the number of direct military deaths during the war and the number of deaths caused by post-war violence. The chief difference is that it sharply reduces her estimate for the number of civilian deaths. The Census Bureau said it had given Ms. Daponte 10 days in which she could present information on why she should not be dismissed.

837-> Senate Approves Tax Plan
In an unexpectedly close vote, the Senate passed election-year tax legislation this evening that President Bush is sure to veto. The vote was 50 to 47, with four Democrats crossing party lines and three Democrats not voting. All 43 Republicans opposed the measure. During the three days of debate, Democrats and Republicans traded accusations about who bore responsibility for the Federal budget deficit and who was more willing to provide tax breaks for special interests. Two Points of View Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee and managed the bill on the Senate floor today, said the measure would make the tax code fairer, promote economic growth and avoid enlarging the deficit. But Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, took the Senate floor late in the afternoon to announce that he opposed the Democratic bill because it would not reduce the deficit and included "billions of dollars stuffed in the pockets" of real estate, oil and gas interests. "The truth is that it is too little, too late to jump-start the economy," he said. "It will open up new loopholes that primarily are used by wealthy Americans and corporations." Democratic Opponents The Democrats who voted against the bill were Howell Heflin of Alabama, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. Senator Bradley did not vote, explaining that he had an agreement with Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, a supporter of the bill, who could not be present for the vote. And Tom Harkin of Iowa was absent. Mr. Bradley was one of the main architects of the tax legislation in 1986 that eliminated or reduced many of tax breaks geared to specific industries, some of which would be reinstated in the new bill. Among its provisions, the Senate bill would increase the income tax rate to 36 percent from 31 percent for single people earning more than $150,000 and couples earning more than $175,000. The tax rate on income exceeding $1 million would be 39.6 percent. The extra revenues would be used to provide a $300 tax credit for children, restore the deductibility of contributions to individual retirement accounts for all taxpayers and provide $7 billion in tax breaks for home buyers and the real estate industry. Republican and Democratic senators had introduced several amendments to spend more on reducing the deficit or expanding public works projects, all of which quickly failed. On Thursday, several Democrats nearly succeeded in tearing out the centerpiece of the Democratic bill, the tax credit for children, and replacing it with a reduction in the deficit and more public works. The attention paid to the deficit, said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, came partly as a response to rumblings among some Democrats that tax increases for the affluent would be used to provide tax cuts for the middle class instead of reducing the deficit. But, he said, "it's a rumble instead of a revolt." Indeed, with few exceptions, Democrats maintained that their plan would make the tax code fairer. 'Tax Fairness Is a Mirage' Republicans, meanwhile, argued that higher taxes for some groups would worsen the budget deficit by encouraging more Federal spending. "Tax fairness is a mirage that disguises tax increases," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Passage of the bill clears the way for a conference of House and Senate leaders, perhaps beginning on Wednesday, to eliminate the many differences between the measures. The leaders of both chambers then hope to gain passage of the conference's bill by next Friday, the deadline set by President Bush in his State of the Union address. Mr. Bush has threatened to veto any legislation that includes tax increases, which appear in both bills. Today, in a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, President Bush again promoted his own package, especially cuts in the capital gains tax rate, and acceleration of depreciation allowances. "I will veto job-destroying tax increases and fight for job-creating incentives," Mr. Bush said, calling the Congressional tax measure "a $90 billion tax increase." Although the President's March 20 deadline has no legal force, Democratic leaders in the Congress have raced to meet it to avoid accusations of inaction. Along the way, the Senate took up a long series of amendments, passing several and voting down the rest. New York's two Senators, Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, sparred repeatedly, with Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, introducing two amendments on welfare policies that passed on voice votes. One amendment would withhold some Federal money, now spent on poor families with children, from states that do not require work of adult welfare recipients without dependents. The other amendment would allow states to limit welfare benefits for people who have just moved from other states. Mr. Moynihan, a Democrat, said that requiring welfare recipients to work was impractical unless the Federal Government also provided $5 billion over five years to create jobs for them. Also passed on a voice vote was an amendment by Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, to allow people who have been unemployed for 12 or more weeks to withdraw money from I.R.A.'s without tax penalties. Bentsen's Late Amendment Senator Bentsen rushed one amendment into the bill during the final minutes of debate, without providing any public indication of its content or allowing any discussion. The amendment authorizes $10 million to establish a center in Texas to "promote better trade and economic relations among the nations of Western Hemisphere." A proposal by Mr. McCain to require a 60-vote majority to raise taxes but only a 51-vote majority to lower them prompted an especially lengthy and vigorous debate. Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee, suggested that it was "demagogic" to favor a reversal of the current rules, which require a 60-vote majority to lower taxes but only a 51-vote majority to raise them. "If low taxes are good, then no taxes are best of all, according to the logic of the distinguished gentleman from Arizona," he said. Mr. McCain's amendment was put aside after only 35 Republicans and 2 Democrats voted to set aside a rule barring consideration of such a change. Sixty votes were needed. The Senate also defeated several Republican amendments this evening that would have replaced the Democrats' tax increases with spending cuts or freezes, or would have helped Midwestern farmers. Each of the bills fell on procedural grounds. Prominent differences between the House and Senate bills include the House's decision to give a tax credit on Social Security and Medicare while the Senate would give a tax credit for children. President Bush had proposed that a middle-class tax cut take the form of an increase in the personal exemption for children. The Senate bill also calls for linking to income levels the capital gains tax due on profits from the sale of houses and other assets that have appreciated in value since their purchase. Middle-class taxpayers would pay a capital gains tax rate as low as 5 percent under the bill while wealthy taxpayers would continue to pay the current top rate of 28 percent. The House bill called for taxing only gains after inflation, while Mr. Bush advocated a reduction in the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent.

838-> To the Dustbin of History
THE COMMUNISTS The Story of Power and Lost Illusions: 1948-1991. By Adam B. Ulam. 528 pp. New York: A Robert Stewart Book/Charles Scribner's Sons. $27.50. THE Age of Communism has ended for the time being with a whimper; the bang, alas, may still come. While the new era has produced few truly sensational revelations so far, it is certain to result in a new literature -- of which "The Communists" by Adam B. Ulam is a notable and very welcome precursor. The subtitle of the book, "The Story of Power and Lost Illusions: 1948-1991," and its first sentence say it all: "Never had the threat or promise of Communism loomed larger than it did three years after the conclusion of World War II." Stalin was at the height of his power, the Soviet Union had expanded in many directions, the Red Army had exported Communism to Eastern Europe, Mao Zedong had seized control in China, major Communist parties in France, Italy and other European countries seemed poised for a takeover. The global victory of Communism appeared only a question of time. True, even in 1948 there were some clouds on the Communist horizon; a heretic named Tito stood up to Stalin and got away with it. Furthermore, some experts maintained that the victory of Communism in China was by no means an unmixed blessing for the Soviets; sooner or later, they argued, the interests of the two Communist giants were bound to collide. But these views were by no means widely shared at the time, and it did indeed take more than a decade for the conflict to come out in the open. The relative unimportance of a common ideology, as Mr. Ulam notes, was not realized in the West for a considerable time. Mr. Ulam, who is the director of the Russian Research Center and the Gurney Professor of History and Political Science at Harvard University, reviews succinctly and with his customary elegance the subsequent developments inside the major Communist countries and the complicated relations among them, as revealed in the recurrent crises in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It quickly became clear, he says, that the aim of the Communist movement to establish a supranational order, a worldwide commonwealth of Communist states, was not likely to materialize. The spiritual fathers of Marxism-Leninism, like most of their contemporaries, had greatly underrated the enduring strength of nationalism. Nevertheless, something like a Soviet bloc continued to exist, militarily powerful, politically influential and economically viable, though not exactly an outstanding success. What, then, caused the eventual breakdown? Mr. Ulam believes that it came as the result of the widening discrepancy between the Communist ideology and what the system had in fact become. This, it seems to me, is correct, but it leaves open a number of essential questions. Despite the setbacks and difficulties, the mood in the Communist world in the early 1960's was still one of relative optimism. True, the general economic situation and the standard of living were quite bad, but modest improvements were being made almost every year, the West was in disarray (going through one of its recurrent economic downturns and periods of political self-doubt) and, above all, citizens of the Communist countries had no way of comparing their own lot with that of the rest of the world. There was also hope in Moscow that the third world would gradually become part of the Soviet sphere, turning into "countries of socialist orientation." Whether all these things had to do with the power of the Communist doctrine, as Mr. Ulam seems to imply, is questionable. Even before Stalin's death in 1953, Communism had gradually turned into something akin to National Socialism, with a strong bureaucracy, immense military power and an omnipresent secret police as the pillars of the regime. Can a political system of this kind exist without a creed for any length of time? Not indefinitely, surely, but for many years, especially if there is a broad stratum of people who have a vested interest in the perpetuation of the status quo. The situation was less stable in Eastern Europe than in the Soviet Union, but through a mixture of concessions (up to a point) and the threat of military intervention, discipline of sorts could be maintained. Indeed, these countries would probably still be under Communist rule but for the breakdown in Moscow. When exactly did the change in mood from optimism to pessimism occur in Moscow? Mr. Ulam and most other students of Soviet affairs seem to agree that, to a large extent, it occurred when a growing number of Russians, not only the elite, realized that their country, far from overtaking the West, was falling behind virtually every other industrial nation. That is, it had to do with the constantly deteriorating quality of life, the general stagnation, the absence of any new ideas and initiatives among the aged leadership. And so the mood of the country underwent radical change, and this in turn led to the earthquake that occurred under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But it is also true that the same malaise affected China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba without the same political consequences: Communist rule in these countries has not disintegrated yet, and Communist power in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could have been maintained for another decade, perhaps even longer. In other words, personal factors played a role of some importance, and Mr. Ulam observes that personalities have been of considerable, sometimes decisive, importance in a system that, on a theoretical level at least, denied the significance of individuals. A further question remains to be explored. How are we to explain the considerable number of experts on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (Mr. Ulam was a notable exception) who overrated the achievements of the Communist systems long after their failure should have been obvious? It is now difficult to find any serious person in the former Soviet bloc who will refer to the Communist experience as other than an unqualified disaster. Yet Western observers who yesterday were saying only half as much were derided by many Soviet specialists as reactionaries and incurable cold warriors, hopelessly lacking in objectivity. (Many China scholars have been similarly reluctant to face facts.) It is not clear why this should have been so, and Mr. Ulam provides no explanation. When Mr. Ulam finished writing his book last summer, the full extent of the Soviet catastrophe was not yet manifest -- the Soviet Union still existed and some central political authority still held sway, however weak and uncertain. Since then a total collapse has occurred, and with this the dangers to the world have grown immensely. For more than 30 years Mr. Ulam provided an invaluable service by offering a running commentary on developments in the Soviet Union; the most recent events, the period of transition, will undoubtedly be the subject of his next book. He is not to be envied, because historians will now have to deal with more than a dozen different countries, and what applies to one may not necessarily be true of another. Many of the problems generated by 70 years of Communist rule are proving intractable. At least in the short run, the economic situation continues to deteriorate, the prospects for the emergence and survival of free institutions are not good, and nationalist separatism is running wild. Little remains today of the Western euphoria of 1989-90, when so many people expected a global victory for democracy and a safer world, one in which, like Candide, we would all be free to cultivate our gardens without giving constant attention to others. Instead, it is now apparent that our fate is intertwined with the perilous plights of our neighbors.

839-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; B. & W. Tobacco Cuts an Agency
The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation has unexpectedly dismissed one of its three advertising agencies, Geer, DuBois Inc., which had an estimated $30 million in billings. The dismissal, effective immediately, involves creative work on the company's Capri, Raleigh and Raleigh Extra brands, as well as the media-buying services that the agency had provided in the United States for all B. & W. brands, which include Kool, Viceroy and Bel Air. Joe Helewicz, a spokesman for B. & W. in Louisville, Ky., said the dismissal followed a decision that "there was a lesser role for Geer, DuBois in view of the way our future media buys are going." He added that B. & W. had been reducing media spending in favor of promotional efforts, especially at stores, as are other American cigarette marketers. John Hayes, president and chief executive of Geer, DuBois in New York, said that another factor in the dismissal might have been problems stemming from a computer billing error involving B. & W.'s accounts, dating to 1989. Reassigning the accounts, and the media buying, is under review, Mr. Helewicz said. B. &W.'s other two agencies are Campbell-Mithun-Esty in New York and Tatham/RSCG in Chicago.

841-> METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY CHINESE OFFICIALS ACCUSED OF FRAUD Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Chinese Government officials with conspiring with two American companies to defraud the United States of more than $100,000 in duties on imported textiles and clothing. Prosecutors said the indictment stemmed from an investigation into efforts to bypass import quotas by shipping textiles made in China through other countries. A1. MAKING IT EASIER TO CHANGE A LIGHT BULB It took six years of complaining, but from now on exhibitors at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center will be able to screw in a light bulb without having to pay an electrician. Fabian G. Palomino, the head of the center, said that agreements had been reached with four unions that would modify work rules and significantly reduce labor costs. B3. HOSPITAL CHIEF'S VISION Dr. Billy E. Jones envisions a city hospital system in which every poor person receives thorough, personal care, every clinic doctor is paid $100,000 a year and the infighting between public hospitals and private medical centers is only a memory. But Dr. Jones, who is taking over as head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, is the first to warn that he may not be able to achieve his goals. B4. LANDLORD OF HAPPY LAND PLEADS GUILTY Jay Weiss, who holds the primary lease on the Bronx building that housed the Happy Land social club, pleaded guilty to not having an adequate sprinkler system on the site where 87 people died in a fire. In a plea bargain, he agreed to perform 50 hours of community service and to pay $60,000 to help build a community center for Hondurans in the Bronx. B3. REGION THRUWAY UNIT'S NEW ROLE In 1950, the New York State Thruway Authority was created to build and maintain the state Thruway system, the largest continuous toll-road system in the world. But under a proposal by Governor Cuomo, the authority's power would be expanded, giving it control over the state's canal system, as well as over an array of construction and economic development projects along the Thruway's borders. B7. HUNTINGTON SCHOOLS ACCUSED OF BIAS An inquiry conducted by the State Department of Education at the urging of frustrated parents and advocates for minorities portrays Huntington schools as tending to steer minority and foreign-born children into special-education classes, often without the proper screening to assure that the students are in fact disabled. B6. PLEA BARGAIN FOR COP TURNED ROBBER A former Howell Township, N.J., police detective has worked out a plea bargain in a string of bank robberies that he says he committed because he was mentally ill. That gives the authorities 15 to 18 years -- the amount of time that the detective, Allen R. Schott, could spend behind bars -- to find $360,000 that he stole. B8. A REVERSAL ON SHOREHAM The Long Island school district that became one of the wealthiest in the nation on the strength of property-tax revenues from the ill-fated Shoreham nuclear power plant dropped its longstanding public opposition to the final demolition of the plant. It did so only after it was publicly excoriated for greed by the chairman of a state authority set up to close the plant. B7. Leonia Journal B7 Chronicle B13

843-> In Connecticut, Other Issues Help Foes of Gun Control
As in New Jersey, the National Rifle Association maintains a political presence in the state capitals of New York and Connecticut. In New York, through its legislative fund, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund, the association contributed more than $100,000 to legislators and party campaign committees between Jan. 12, 1989 and Nov. 28, 1991, according to State Board of Elections records. From 1986 to 1991, more than 120 members of the State Legislature received N.R.A. contributions. Using a sophisticated computer network and effective money-raising methods, the association has helped to stave off most gun-control legislation in New York in the last few years. The most obvious example of the N.R.A.'s success has been the Legislature's refusal, year after year, to enact a ban on assault weapons, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would like. In Connecticut, the N.R.A. has been bolstered by other political factors, including many lawmakers' dislike for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a gun-control proponent, in its efforts to block stricter gun laws. In June, when Governor Weicker called a special session of the General Assembly to consider new gun laws, the association sent a member of its Washington staff to bolster efforts of local sportsmen's groups. The session ultimately passed several measures, including broadening the two-week waiting period for handgun purchases to cover many purchases of rifles and shotguns as well, but it failed to pass many of Mr. Weicker's proposals. Lawmakers, however, were quick to say it was some members' annoyance at the tight scheduling of the session, their failure to rally behind one proposal and their reluctance to back Mr. Weicker -- not just lobbying by the N.R.A. -- that drove many to vote no. Constituent service has also been a factor in lawmakers' opposition to gun-control bills. In the Senate, one of the chamber's most powerful members, William A. DiBella, represents the part of Hartford that is home to Colt's Manufacturing Company. Mr. DiBella, a Democrat, is chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance Revenue and Bonding, and thus controls the flow of money bills. He has defended Colt's tenaciously, even while voicing general support for some gun-control bills.

844-> U.S. HOPE DASHED ON GLOBAL TRADE
The Bush Administration's lingering hopes for a pre-election breakthrough in world trade talks collapsed today as negotiations in Brussels broke down, leaving American and European officials much farther apart than before on trimming farm subsidies. The failure of the meetings will certainly prolong and could conceivably doom six-year-old negotiations to lower trade barriers around the world. European officials have expressed growing reluctance to make a deal with a President who may soon be forced from office. The American law that bars Congress from amending trade agreements struck by Presidents applies only to deals reached before next March 2, and Democratic and Republican trade experts alike say it is unlikely that Gov. Bill Clinton would be able to come to terms with the Europeans so quickly if he is elected. Many economists say that a global trade agreement will expand world economic output by $100 billion a year or more because it would encourage each country to produce whatever it makes most efficiently and import the rest. Without the agreement, they say, the world economy will grow more slowly. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has said that it would be "virtually impossible" for the Bush Administration to win the re-authorization of the 18-year-old fast-track legislation, under which the recently initialed North American Free Trade Agreement will also be considered. It is not clear whether a Clinton Administration working with a Democratic Congress would be more successful. The collapse of the meetings in Brussels today will at least postpone the date when an agreement can go into force. Some experts also say that the lack of an agreement may foster trade wars, restricting international commerce and world economic growth. But labor-intensive industries in industrialized nations, including American textile and steel producers, dispute the benefits of an agreement. They worry that a deal would drown them in a flood of imports from more efficient and sometimes subsidized foreign producers. Labor unions and a few economists contend that the United States will receive few gains from a global trade pact. Despite speeches by French officials this week against any European concessions, some Administration officials were still optimistic this morning that a deal might be possible. "If agriculture breaks this week, we could finish the round by Christmas," an American official said. But by this afternoon, senior Administration officials were gloomy about the prospects for any pact in the near future and quickly blamed the European Community. No 'Breakthrough' "Whereas last week in the meetings," a senior official said, "it appeared that both sides had come closer to proposals that would have allowed a political breakthrough on agriculture, which would have allowed us to wrap up the other issues, it now appears that the community has substantial difficulties even with some of the proposals they were willing to explore last week. It doesn't appear we have the basis for breakthrough in the near future." A European Community official said the community was prepared to continue talking. But a senior Administration trade official said no further meetings were planned. This week's negotiations in Brussels turned out to be vital not because of who was attending but because of the positions the sides took. The Agriculture Department staff and European Community farm experts now in Brussels are far less senior than the agriculture and trade ministers who met 10 days ago in Brussels or the ever-optimistic trade ministers who met last weekend in Toronto. But this meeting dealt in great detail with the highly technical disputes that are actually blocking a global trade pact. The outcome was a complete impasse. C. Joseph O'Mara, the United States Agriculture Department's chief trade negotiator, flew home today while leaving several aides behind to work on minor issues. Details of Disputes A person involved in the negotiations gave a detailed list today of the disagreements on condition of anonymity. The disputes center on how deeply the community should cut its crop subsidies and how extensively the United States will be able to challenge the farmer income support programs that the community is beginning to introduce. The United States has been seeking a 24 percent reduction in the community's tonnage of subsidized exports, while the community has been calling for no more than an 18 percent reduction. Last week, European officials expressed a willingness to split the difference between the two figures. But they said today that any increase from 18 percent would have to be coupled with new European taxes on imports of American corn gluten and the cancellation of the so-called Andriessen Understanding, under which the European Community has pledged not to subsidize meat exports to Japan and other East Asian markets now dominated by Australia and the United States. Higher taxes on American corn gluten would limit United States exports and protect European farmers from competition. Repeal of the Andriessen Understanding -- which is named for Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner and chief trade negotiator -- would allow the Community to unload some of its huge meat surplus in east Asia at the expense of American ranchers. Another shift in the European Community's position this week involved its introduction of direct payments to farmers, replacing crop subsidies, which encourage inefficient overproduction that has flooded world markets. The European Community now wants the United States to guarantee that most of these payments will not be challenged as illegal subsidies. The European Community also refused to accept any change in its subsidies for the production of oil from seeds. The United States has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on $1 billion worth of fine French wines and other European exports but has delayed any action pending the current world trade talks. The senior Administration trade official said that no decision had been made on whether to proceed with the tariffs now, which would upset the community even more. The latest impasse over farm trade is particularly frustrating to negotiators because of recent progress in other areas of the world trade talks to expand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is actually a series of pacts laying out free trade rules for global commerce. American and European trade officials agreed in Brussels 10 days ago to broaden the GATT to include banking, insurance and other financial services, but small differences remain on free-trade rules for telephone service and shipping.

845-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Amoskeag Fills Post Of President and Chief
The Amoskeag Company yesterday named W. Randle Mitchell Jr. president and chief executive. The largest holding of the diversified Boston-based company is Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., a manufacturer of towels, bedding and carpeting. Mr. Mitchell succeeds James M. Fitzgibbons, who had the dual role of running Amoskeag as well as Fieldcrest Cannon, which accounted for the vast majority of Amoskeag's 1991 revenues of $1.2 billion. Mr. Fitzgibbons will now focus solely on running Fieldcrest Cannon, based in Greensboro, N.C. For Mr. Mitchell, who is 57 years old, the new post represents a drastic change in career plans. He had previously indicated that he would retire this summer, but balked out of fear that he would be bored outside the corporate world. "I have a lot of energy and really couldn't see myself retiring," he said in an interview. Initially, Mr. Mitchell said he would concentrate on Amoskeag's holdings outside of Fieldcrest, which include real estate and the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad in Maine, whose main customers are paper companies. Mr. Mitchell said he planned to develop a strategy for those interests in coming weeks. For roughly half of Mr. Mitchell's 13 years with Amoskeag (pronounced AM-us-keg), he held the dual role of chief financial officer for both Amoskeag and Fieldcrest Cannon, posts that he gave up in 1990. He oversaw Fieldcrest's rapid expansion and acquisitions in the mid-1980's. The company invested to modernize its plants, building up debt that weighed heavily on it when sales declined in the late 1990's. Fieldcrest Cannon's fortunes generally parallel construction of new housing and the economy in general. Before joining Amoskeag, Mr. Mitchell worked for the Wellington Management Company, a Boston-based money-management company, for 20 years. He joined the company as director of budgeting and planning and was named senior vice president and chief financial officer in 1974. He holds an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and an economics degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Mitchell lives in Lincoln, Mass. He is married and has two sons.

846-> Books of The Times; More Than Just a Tale of the Sea
Outerbridge Reach By Robert Stone 409 pages. Ticknor & Fields. $21.95. "To the destructive element submit yourself," the character Stein advises Jim in Joseph Conrad's "Lord Jim." And that is what Owen Browne does in Robert Stone's powerfully Conradian new novel, "Outerbridge Reach." Owen is a man adrift, a Vietnam veteran who, having graduated from Annapolis in 1968, had been one of "the last good children" of his time. Now he works for a yacht brokerage that is part of the financial empire of an entrepreneur named Matthew Hylan. But though Owen makes a good living and lives comfortably on Connecticut's Gold Coast with his wife, Anne, and their 15-year-old daughter, Maggie, he feels beset by "old rages and regrets" and "in rebellion against things." So when sudden financial problems force Matthew Hylan to withdraw from a solo round-the-world race, Owen volunteers to take his place. Though Anne protests, he is determined. As he tells her: "I think most of us spend our lives without ever having to find out what we're made of. . . . The sea is the bottom line. Out there you have the elementals. You have day and night. You have ocean and the sky. Your boat and yourself. It's a situation of ultimate self-reliance." It's also a situation that makes the reader vaguely uneasy at the prospect of plunging into so much prose alone at sea with Owen. But in his four previous novels, "A Hall of Mirrors," "Dog Soldiers," "A Flag for Sunrise" and "Children of Light," which have won him a wide audience and a considerable literary reputation, Mr. Stone has never written more enthrallingly than he does in the too brief chapters describing Owen in the race. Eventually the destructive element gets the best of him. He loses interest in the race, decides to falsify his positions to make himself look as if he is winning and puts in at an uncharted island near the Antarctic Circle, where hallucinatory visions draw him into a world of terror and beauty. Ashore, he finds an abandoned shack. "He opened the door to see an empty window open to the sea. Framed in it was the half-disk of the same setting sun that he was certain he had watched on the horizon hours before. It was impossible, he thought, as though the sun hung out of time. Browne grew frightened. He drew his breath carefully." Still, it is not Owen's harrowing struggle to maintain his sanity that absorbs one most in "Outerbridge Reach." Early in the novel, as a counterweight to Owen, we are introduced to Ron Strickland, a film maker who has made prize-winning documentaries about the Vietnam War and New York lowlife. Ron has been hired by Matthew Hylan's people to make a film about the sailing race. He clearly means to expose Owen's heroic pretensions. He also intends to seduce Anne Browne. Unlike Owen, Ron is a familiar character in Mr. Stone's work, an echo of Rheinhardt in "The Hall of Mirrors" and John Converse in "Dog Soldiers." Ron is a cynic and anti-ideologue, a man of the left who sees through everyone's political motives, a hipster to Owen's square, an artist to his Babbitt, a Shem the Penman to his Shaun the Postman. It is the implicit contest between Ron and Owen that is the dramatic backbone of "Outerbridge Reach." Anne Browne is the prize, though far from a passive one. As things turn out, she is as strong a force in the novel as anyone. Speaking personally, I prefer Owen to Ron, as interesting as the latter is, yet I felt certain that I was going to be on the losing side and that Ron's values were going to prevail. But it soon becomes apparent that where Mr. Stone stands is not so obvious as it might at first seem. He is as fascinated by the old heroic side of American life as he is by the countercultural reaction. In a scene of striking irony, Owen tries to draw out the carpenter who is doing the cabinet work on the boat he will be racing and finds him to be more quixotic in his opposition to the Vietnam War than those who were for it and thought they could win. When Owen accuses him of not understanding what went on in Vietnam, the carpenter tears out the work he has done, refunds Owen's money and disappears. Though the true appeal of reading "Outerbridge Reach" lies in the texture of its prose and the harsh realism of its characters, the outcome of the contest of values will not be revealed here. Let it only be said that by deciding to fake his race, Owen has moved into Ron's realm, and in trying to win Anne, Ron invades Owen's. How each will survive in the other's world remains to be seen. As always in his fiction, Mr. Stone tells an intensely dramatic story yet counts on the reader to be sensitive to his book's ineffable literary values. Take the title, for instance: "Outerbridge Reach." It sounds like an invocation of the limits to which Owen aspires. Yet it also refers to a section of the Arthur Kill, the channel that divides Staten Island from New Jersey. Owen visits Outerbridge Reach one night early in the novel and thinks about it as a dog barks in the dark nearby. "He remembered scraps of the place's history. Thousands of immigrants had died there, in shanties, of cholera, in winter far from home. It had been a place of loneliness, violence and terrible labor. It seemed to Browne that there was something about the channel he recognized but could not call to mind. On the dark shore, the junkyard hound kept barking as though it would go on forever." This passage is strong enough in the context of the book's dramatic development. But it is also faintly obscure and precious. It has an almost academic quality about it. One can imagine that someday soon students will be writing term papers about the book in a course on sea literature. If this is a slight put-down of "Outerbridge Reach," it is also high praise.

848-> COMPANY NEWS; Ryder Increasing Capital Spending
Ryder System Inc., the equipment and truck leasing company, will sharply increase its capital spending this year to $890 million. More than half the money will go to replace its fleet of 30,000 bright yellow trucks and vans used mostly by homeowners on the move. The jump in spending from $651 million in 1991 signifies Ryder's aggressive plans to take market share away from U-Haul, Budget and Penske, said Gerald Riordan, Ryder executive vice president for consumer rentals. For the last three years, Ryder has lost ground to U-Haul, the top competitor in the field, he said. Mr. Riordan said the company was committed to turning around its consumer truck rental business. The company might increase capital spending again next year to more than $1 billion, he said. Ryder's Shares fell $1 today, to $23.625, in trading on the Big Board.

849-> IN SHORT: NONFICTION; Body Language
The French sculptor Auguste Rodin was destined to battle public opinion. Assailed for the erotic candor of his work (especially his renderings of women fully aware of their sexuality), discredited for his unorthodox treatment of traditional subjects and accused of being everything from a homosexual to the exploiter of his model, muse and mistress Camille Claudel -- nonetheless Rodin (1840-1917) managed to redefine the nature and purposes of sculpture. RODIN: Eros and Creativity (Prestel/Te Neues, 15 East 76th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021, $69.95) is an intriguing study of the artist's discourse on the erotic. The editors -- Rainer Crone, who teaches art history at Columbia University, and Siegfried Salzmann, director of the Kunsthalle in Bremen, Germany -- have assembled photographs of more than 50 sculptures depicting erotic themes, as well as 32 superb drawings in pencil and watercolor wash. Each sculptural piece has been exquisitely photographed in black and white from multiple angles, to highlight selective details. In an exceptionally lucid essay, the journalist and critic Ginger Danto discusses the emotional ramifications of Rodin's carnal depictions. In another, the art historian Ursula Heiderich examines the creative symbiosis between Rodin and Claudel, including its destructive aspects. Less ambitious in scope and more generic in design, RODIN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES: The Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Collection (Cross River/Abbeville, $45) presents photographs by David Finn of 25 sculptures owned by the art collectors Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, as well as works by Rodin's contemporaries, including a selection of late 19th- and early 20th-century paintings. Each series of glossy color plates is introduced by a brief but helpful foreword, as well as biographical information about its maker, written by Marie Busco, one of the authors of "Painting and Sculpture at Lincoln Center."

850-> Trying to Turn Around the Clark Bar
Nine months ago, the Clark candy bar, a rich concoction of peanut butter, taffy and milk chocolate, seemed doomed. A favorite in the Midwest and parts of the East, the Clark bar never had a national presence and its owner wanted to close its factory here. That's when Michael P. Carlow, a 40-year-old Pittsburgh businessman who has made money in steel, glass, cement and the turnaround of Iron City beer, bought the D. L. Clark Company from Leaf Inc., the Chicago candy conglomerate. Now, not only is the Clark bar still being produced and packaged in its eye-catching red-and-blue wrapper, there are some early signs that Mr. Carlow may succeed where a candy giant stumbled. "All the Clark bar needs is special attention, and it will do fine, Mr. Carlow said in an interview here recently. "There is, after all, a certain magic about candy." Mr. Carlow has already won rent concessions from the State of Pennsylvania, which owns Clark's modern candy factory here; he is trying to get the crucial support of D. L. Clark's candy brokers, who have the power to decide whether Clark bars appear in stores and vending machines, and he has begun exploring how the company's fixed costs can be trimmed to make it easier to turn a profit. One possibility: have Clark employees share more of the costs of their health benefits. Although Mr. Carlow will not disclose the terms of his purchase, or the financial performance of his private company, he predicts that he can make money if he can sell 50 million Clark bars a year. Under a big company with big costs like Leaf, D. L. Clark needed to exceed that level to break into the black, which under Leaf it never managed to do regularly. In its last year with Leaf, Clark made 35 million bars, only a third of its production capacity. But candy experts say Mr. Carlow's Clark bar rescue could fail. While a few smaller candy brands have prospered in recent years, like Goldenberg's Peanut Chews, which are made in Philadelphia, and the Annabelle Candy Company's Big Hunk and Look bars, which are made in Hayward, Calif., many small confectioners have vanished, victims of the hard economics of the candy business. "It's not easy being the little guy in a world dominated by giants," said John M. McMillin, the candy industry analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "To survive, Carlow will have to be twice as good as Mars and Nestle." The chocolate candy bar business in America is a classic oligopoly. Three players -- Hershey, M&M/ Mars and Nestle -- control 90 percent of the industry's $5.2 billion in annual sales. Leaf, whose brands include Whoppers, Milk Duds and Jolly Rancher candies, probably has another 5 percent. And while there continue to be a healthy number of regional chocolates, the bar business belongs to the big national brands like Mars's Snickers and Milky Way; Nestle's Baby Ruth, and Hershey's milk chocolate bar and its Reese's peanut butter cups. Gaining Shelf Space This huge concentration and huge volumes -- there are roughly 15 regular-sized Snicker bars sold for every Clark bar -- enable big candy makers to gobble up crucial shelf space at checkout stands in groceries, drugstores, convenience stores and the other places where most candy is sold. Big companies can also afford large sales forces that help move candy to retailers. "The big guys are in the stores every week," noted Janette Kitt, a leading industry consultant based in Sparta, N.J. "They are constantly able to not only obtain distribution but to maintain it." Big-selling national brands also can afford fat promotional budgets that often amount to tens of millions of dollars. They can offer discount coupons to consumers, and provide retailers with special promotions and services, like the "midget" sizes of candy for Halloween. They can also afford to give away candy to fatten retailers' profits. That makes Clark a midget among giants, with distinct disadvantages. Clark cannot afford to spend millions of dollars on anything; its sales last year were estimated at $13 million. It has to rely on independent distributors and wholesalers to sell its candy to retailers who usually do not want to bother with a low-volume brand. Although per-capita candy consumption, at 20 pounds a year, is nearly at a record in the United States, the dollar volume of candy sold in this country has shrunk in recent years after adjusting for inflation. "It's very simple," said Leonard G. Teitelbaum, the candy industry analyst at Merrill Lynch. "If you've got a leading market share and you can show the supermarket guy that your product sells, the buyer will put your product out there." Some Positive Factors But Mr. Carlow does not face impossible odds. His first job, industry experts say, will be to convince the brokers who distribute the Clark bar that the bar has the potential to succeed over the long term. Partly, they say, this will be an exercise in persuasion, but Mr. Carlow could end up having to pay his brokers more than the standard 5 percent commission. "Remember, these are the same brokers who didn't do much with the Clark bar under Leaf," said Stuart Scherr, the president of L&S Sales, a big candy broker based in San Francisco. At one time, Leaf poured money into Clark by trying to make it a national brand. But "we just could not break into the menu of consumers outside the Midwest," said James Hanlon, president of Leaf. Mr. Carlow has met wth most of Clark's wholesalers but he concedes that he still has to whip up excitement for the 106-year-old bar. Over the years, Clark bars reached a peak of 180 million bars annually, but the company was bought and sold so many times that it fell into neglect as sales waned. Now, Mr. Carlow says, "it is still being viewed as a stepchild." One of Mr. Carlow's intentions is to heighten Clark's visibility. He plans to spend 5 percent of sales on marketing and advertising, up from 1.5 percent. One early effort will be in Pittsburgh, where Clark bars have been a hit in the past and Mr. Carlow hopes some promotional efforts will pay off quickly. Clark will sponsor sports events here like hockey games and tennis matches, and do promotional activities aimed at young people in nearby regions of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Miniature Clark bars were recently given away to 15,000 hockey fans attending a Pittsburgh Penguins game. Mr. Carlow plans a string of new products to help cover his fixed costs; Clark already makes Slow Poke and Black Cow, two caramel suckers sold regionally. The Clark bar has 9 grams of fat and 250 calories; Mr. Carlow said he was working on a Clark Light bar that would have half the fat and 165 calories. He also hopes to offer a Clark Classic, which would have a milk-based caramel core, as the original bar did, instead of the current bar's taffy center. Rivals Are Moving Too Whether all this will make the Clark bar a financial success is far from certain. For one thing, the competition has also been developing new products. Mars, for instance, has recently come out with mint- and peanut-butter-flavored M&M's to complement its M&M plain and peanut brands. Nor is the competition likely to sit still if Mr. Carlow beefs up marketing of the Clark bar. Hershey has already stepped up advertising of its competing bar, the Fifth Avenue. The risk is that Mr. Carlow might whip up so much fresh excitement for the Clark bar that an industry Goliath decides to trample him. Mr. Teitelbaum of Merrill Lynch said: "Hershey & Mars will not ignore him. The only question is whether the Clark bar remains something they can live with."

853-> Bush Seeks Rules to Lift Sales of Gas
President Bush announced his support yesterday for four regulatory changes that he said would raise demand for natural gas and help an industry that has been badly hurt by low prices. The gas industry applauded the announcement, which came shortly before the primary election in Texas, a leading gas-producing state. But environmentalists and consumer advocates said it was not clear whether the changes, all of them under discussion in Washington for months or years, would mean that more gas would be sold, at least in the near future. They also said that one proposed change could cut gas sales and increase pollution. The changes are intended to lower costs or remove regulatory barriers. They could result in greater use of natural gas in cars and power plants. 2 Problems Not Addressed Edwin Rothschild, an energy expert at Citizen Action, a consumer organization, said some of the proposed changes were desirable because they would promote use of natural-gas vehicles, lowering pollution and reliance on imported oil. But the natural-gas industry's real problems, he said, are two phenomena beyond White House control: warm weather and recession. "I don't see this as stimulating a lot of demand quickly," he said. But the president of the American Gas Association, Michael Baly 3d, said his industry was "deeply grateful." Possibly the least controversial proposal was the President's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency would soon issue an emissions standard for natural-gas vehicles that would help them compete. Federal standards for gasoline vehicles set a limit on hydrocarbon emissions as a way to control smog, but proponents of natural-gas vehicles complain that natural gas itself, while a hydrocarbon, is not an ingredient of smog. So the E.P.A. will issue a standard for emissions of hydrocarbons other than natural gas. There are now no standards for the vehicles. Mr. Baly of the gas association said yesterday, "If you want to start mass-producing these, major equipment manufacturers want a standard." A Greenhouse Gas But even if emissions of unburned natural gas do not contribute to smog, they are still a pollutant, environmentalists say, because natural gas is a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. David G. Hawkins, an air-pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that allowing natural-gas emissions because they did not cause smog was "an example of tunnel vision," adding, "You could say the same thing about CFC's," which destroy the earth's protective layer of ozone. The White House also said that the environmental agency would change the rules on when changes to a power plant become so extensive that the plant is considered new, and therefore subject to stricter pollution standards. Named after a case involving the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, the "Wepco fix" -- as it is known on Capitol Hill -- would allow utilities to make major changes to dirty old plants without becoming subject to the strict regulations governing new ones. But the fix was rejected by Congress in the debate over the Clean Air Act. If utilities were not subject to rules on new sources of pollution, according to the gas industry, they might take inexpensive steps that would significantly reduce pollution, like "co-firing" coal with natural gas. In co-firing -- when the two fuels are burned together in the boiler -- chemical reactions reduce the total pollution, although the plant is still dirtier than a new one. The Opposite Case But environmentalists say the Wepco fix might not help gas sales at all. Without it, they say, many utilities would be forced to scrap dirty coal-fired plants and build new ones that run entirely on gas; with the fix, they can continue to rely heavily on coal. A third change would give gas-pipeline companies the option to be regulated under an incentive system, rather than the cost-based system that now prevails, but the details have not been established. A fourth would remove a regulatory wrinkle that some people have said could hurt natural-gas vehicles: the issue of interstate regulation. In theory, according to some natural-gas executives, if a car were fueled with natural gas in one state and driven to another, the sale would be interstate and thus subject to Federal regulation, although in practice the issue has not arisen, experts said. The proposed change would make it clear that sales of natural gas for vehicles were not subject to Federal regulation.

854-> Sounds Around Town
Escovedo at Tramps Alejandro Escovedo, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. Alejandro Escovedo writes as if he can see all of America from his own tiny spot on the highway: the rock-folk songs on his recent album "Gravity" (Watermelon) are as broad as the horizon, yet each carries a grain of personal conviction, of experiences lived, not dreamed. In "Bury Me," a man runs from the shadows of his past, and the opening riff comes straight from Elvis's "Mystery Train." Elements of country, blues, even jazz have been processed through his psyche; the arrangements allow for cello, mandolin, piano and pedal steel, but guitar is always there at the core. Sometimes it's his proof, sometimes his apology; sometimes he just lets it drown out his voice. Shows are tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30 P.M., with headliner Tracy Nelson. Tickets are $12.50. Post-Feminist Punk The Breeders, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-4052. The Breeders, featuring Kim Deal from the Pixies, Tanya Donelly from Throwing Muses and Josephine Wiggs from the Perfect Disaster, are a post-feminist, punk-rooted version of the all-star jam. What makes them peculiarly feminine is the extreme physicality of the sound: the bass pulses like a naked heart, the guitars make their point with a minimum of theatrics and the story lines follow women to the edge. The Breeders peel away alternative rock's skin: their recent EP, "Safari" (4AD/Elektra), is blood and instinct, rather than poses and ideas. show time is tonight around 12:30 A.M.; doors open at 9:30 P.M. Tickets are $10. Hillbilly Spin Bad Livers, the Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Murray Hill, (212) 683-6500. Like good, faithful traditionalists, the Bad Livers preserve the spirit as well as the technique of old- timey folk music: the string band lineup includes mandolin, banjo, slap bass and accordion, and the tunes get a corn-whisky barn-dance spin. The Bad Livers cover all the classic hillbilly and bluegrass topics: love, death and cheating. When the members really begin to cook, they push against ancient boundaries into a more modern breed of cow-punk. Sets begin tonight at 10:30. There is no cover charge, but there is a two-drink minimum at the tables.

855-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Wells Rich Enters Direct Marketing
Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York said yesterday that it had formed its first direct-marketing agency, Bastoni Barnes. The agency is named, naturally enough, for the two women heading the shop, who were named managing partners. Christine Bastoni had been senior vice president and creative director at FCB Direct West in San Francisco, where clients included Pacific Bell and Citibank. Winifred Barnes had been a senior vice president and management supervisor at McCaffrey & McCall in New York, with accounts like Mercedes-Benz of North America and Ciba Vision. Bastoni Barnes opens with one account: direct marketing in the United States for Salvatore Ferragamo International in New York, the American unit of the Milan shoe and apparel maker. Billings were not disclosed.

856-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN; Democrats: Courting the Younger Generation
The Democratic National Committee on Tuesday began a $1 million advertising campaign aimed at younger voters. The 30-second spots, one feature a young man and the other a young woman, are appearing on the networks, geared to shows with younger audiences like "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Roseanne." ON THE SCREEN White letters on black background: "A reality check. Jonathan." Various images of young man named Jonathan, talking to camera, in the kitchen, looking through the newspaper classifieds, of his mother in the kitchen as he talks about living at home, snapshots of Jonathan with friends at graduation. These words appear on screen: "The Democratic Plan: create new jobs, invest in people, develop new technologies." Ends with these words on screen: "The Democratic Party. A plan that works for a change." PRODUCER Frank Greer/Mandy Grunwald TELEVISION SCRIPT Jonathan: "Since I graduated I've done telemarketing, I was a bicycle messenger . . . "I hope in the future to get a job in my field and from there start my own life, but there are no jobs. I feel trapped, having to live at home. The Republicans really do not know what the average American is going through. "The Democratic plan is the plan that makes the most sense. I really believe that the Democrats would bring a lot of hope and enthusiasm to this country." ACCURACY Nothing inherently inaccurate. SCORECARD This so-called "generic" ad is paid for by the Democratic Party so it cannot directly mention Mr. Clinton or Mr. Bush. But it clearly repeated Mr. Clinton's central message: that he is the candidate of change. It seeks to lend authenticity to the message by using a young man who says he has been a direct casualty of the nation's economic woes. This is all part of a Democratic effort to win first-time voters and get them to the polls.

858-> Review/Dance; Unmasking Repression
Like Picasso, Nuria Olive-Belles, a choreographer and film maker, comes from Barcelona. And while she is not a Picasso, the fact that she sees the world through issues of sexuality recalls an aspect of the painter's work, particularly his explicit sketches of Barcelona's brothels. A hypocritical society that seeks release is not peculiar to Catalonia. Yet in her imaginative mixed-media piece, "The Bulls at the Ball," Miss Olive-Belles places this theme in a specifically Spanish, even Catalan, context. Using live dancers, her own films and a not-so-irrelevant clip of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster, she pastes together a passionate tale of love and repression. The piece, which had its premiere on Thursday night, continues through Sunday (at 9 P.M.) at Performance Space 122 (150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street). Miss Olive-Belles appears, at this point, to be more original in her film making than in her choreography. There is an impressive emotional urgency to her rushed blur of film images, set to Spanish recordings and music by Eleanor Sandresky. Bullrings, Barcelona street scenes and closeups of Miss Olive-Belle flash by. Dressed initially with all the right bourgeois accessories, including a choker of pearls, earrings and very high heels, she becomes a knock-kneed and contemporary barefoot fury in her live solos. Her red stockings are tied around her knees like bloody tourniquets. The central trauma is acted out when the protagonist, in flashback, becomes an adolescent whose sexual awakening ends in an amorous embrace with another young girl. Society -- two pairs of fox-trotting couples -- separates the girls. The duet between Miss Olive-Belles and Tasha Taylor suffers from its jumps from the literal to the stylized. Yet it is very much a duet of repeated discovery, ending with a startling surrealistic kiss as each woman seems to cover the other's mouth. By contrast, the duet between the two women, portrayed as mature in a later encounter, has less spontaneity. These images of lesbian love are woven into film clips of a lynch mob pursuing Mr. Karloff. The mob is identified with the disapproving parents, whose dysfunctional embraces are symbolized by the men's boxing gloves. Ramon Baeza partners Rachel Thorne Germond, and Fred Sullivan partners Tine Byrsted. Mr. Baeza's character is seduced by a Spanish dancer in Amador's sensational flamenco dress with a train of paper ruffles. The dancer is portrayed as a transvestite in a snarling tour de force by Juan Gragera. The theme of Hispanic men's homosexual longings, suppressed under a macho veneer, is familiar from Argentine dance-theater groups. When Mr. Baeza pummels Mr. Gragera in a rage, the ending is not a surprise: it is a prolonged kiss. Nonetheless, Miss Olive-Belles has powerfully amplified her indictment of repressive convention through this second narrative. Her ability to layer images is never in doubt. They are theatrical and rich.

859-> Sam Walton Is Dead At 74; the Founder Of Wal-Mart Stores
Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the most successful merchant of his time, died yesterday at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Hospital in Little Rock. He was 74 years old. A spokeswoman at the hospital, where Mr. Walton was admitted a week ago, said that the cause of death was being withheld at the request of the family. Mr. Walton had long struggled against two types of cancer, hairy-cell leukemia, which weakens the immune system by attacking white blood cells, and a bone-marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. Mr. Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962 in Rogers, Ark., a small city in the Ozarks. By 1991 the chain passed Sears, Roebuck & Company to become the nation's largest retailer. On April 1, it had 1,735 stores in 42 states, as well as 2 in Mexico. Mr. Walton assembled a management team that will carry on, and the company said yesterday that it foresaw no changes in corporate policy or control. Mr. Walton created Wal-Mart with the idea, once mocked by retailers, that large discount stores could thrive in small towns and rural areas. A gifted, homespun orator, he entranced legions of low-paid loyal workers with a simple refrain -- help customers, cut costs and share profits. Wal-Mart's headquarters, in contrast to the 110-story Sears Tower on the edge of Chicago's Loop, remain a box-like warehouse and general office in Bentonville, Ark. Wal-Mart began to sell its stock to the public in 1970. As Wall Street discovered the company's unbroken pattern of high profits and fast growth, the price of Wal-Mart's stock began to soar in the late 1970's, and the Walton family's wealth with it. The family fortune includes $23 billion in Wal-Mart stock alone, which provides more than $90 million in annual dividends. The Waltons also own seven banks in Arkansas and Oklahoma and five newspapers in Arkansas. While the Walton name is hardly as well known as Rockefeller or Getty, the family is believed to be the nation's wealthiest. Investors in Wal-Mart stock also enjoyed a bounty. From 1981 to 1991, the company's shares produced an astounding average yearly return of 46.8 percent, including dividends and increases in the share price. A $3,000 investment in Wal-Mart stock in January 1981 was worth $105,600 in January 1991, the company calculated. By last week, it would have been worth $170,000. High Volume, Low Prices Wal-Mart's rapid growth, built on high sales volume and low prices, brought financial ruin to hundreds of small-town merchants on Main Streets across the South and Midwest. And as Wal-Mart's reputation grew, Mr. Walton often faced bitter resistance in communities where he planned to open stores. Yet, his promises to attract shoppers, assist charities and provide jobs almost always prevailed. Mr. Walton always worked hard at shaping his work force, using cheers, rap songs and payment policies to urge employees to be frugal in their jobs and friendly toward customers. Bonuses were paid to all employees in stores where stealing and other inventory losses were kept below 2 percent of sales. Scholarships were established at colleges in names of employees who crafted better ways to handle merchandise. Mr. Walton set the tone, often beginning his mornings at 4:30 and working long days from a cramped, spartan office in Bentonville, in northwestern Arkansas. "This is a man who was at work at 4:30 in the morning, had warmth and charm throughout the day, an interest in his customers, and who treated his associates well as persons, not just as clerks and salespeople," said Walter F. Loeb, a retailing consultant who first met Mr. Walton in 1976. Mr. Walton always referred to Wal-Mart employees as his associates. Born in Oklahoma, Raised in Missouri Samuel Moore Walton was born in Kingfisher, Okla., on March 29, 1918, the first child of a rural banker, Thomas Walton, and Nancy Lee Walton. An Eagle Scout, quarterback of the state champion football team and student council president, Mr. Walton was voted "most versatile boy" by his graduating classmates at Hickman High School in Columbia, Mo., in 1936. Working his way through the University of Missouri at Columbia, he delivered newspapers, waited on tables and clerked at a five-and-dime store while taking classes in the Army's Reserve Officer Training Corps and serving as president of the senior class and the honor society. After graduating in 1940 with a degree in economics, he worked briefly as a management trainee in Des Moines with the J. C. Penney Company, then a small-town retailer with 1,500 stores. During World War II, Mr. Walton served as an Army captain, working in intelligence. In 1945, he acquired his first store, a Ben Franklin franchise in Newport, Ark., with a $25,000 loan from his father-in-law, Leland Stanford Robson, a small-town Oklahoma banker. By the early 1960's, Mr. Walton and his brother, James L. (Bud) Walton, owned 15 Ben Franklin franchises. Striking Out on His Own In 1962, when Ben Franklin executives in Chicago turned down his plan to open bigger stores in rural areas, with discount prices and smaller profit margins, he began to form what eventually became Wal-Mart Stores. In a 1989 interview with Financial World magazine, Mr. Walton said of his disagreement with Ben Franklin, "They didn't want to give on their end to the degree that it took for the prices to be as low as I felt they should be." Operating costs at Ben Franklin were as much as 25 percent of sales, but Mr. Walton thought they could be much lower. He said: "If they had been able to sell to me on a 12 percent range, I probably would not have put together the organization that we did. Aren't I glad they didn't accept the idea, because I was forced to build our own team and program?" One Temporary Retirement Mr. Walton remained the chairman of Wal-Mart until his death. He relinquished the titles of president and chief executive in 1988. He retired briefly from the chief executive's post in 1974 but reclaimed it two years later. Last month, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, and hailed as "an American original" who "embodies the entrepreneurial spirit and epitomizes the American dream." Rejecting occasional advice to sell part of his family's shares and spread his investments, Mr. Walton kept 39 percent of Wal-Mart's common stock under family control in five trusts he established in 1954. Since it became a public company, Wal-Mart has issued more than 1.1 billion shares of common stock. The five Walton trusts hold Wal-Mart stock collectively valued at $23 billion, about $4.6 billion apiece, at current market value. Annual dividends on the family stock amount to $93.5 million. Hated Distinction As Wealthiest In 1985, Forbes magazine declared Mr. Walton the wealthiest person in America, a distinction Mr. Walton often said he hated. "All that hullabaloo about somebody's net worth is just stupid, and it's made my life a lot more complex and difficult," he told Fortune magazine. Although he disliked doing it, he autographed dollar bills for customers and employees and smiled for their cameras. Mr. Walton displayed scant interest in the social whirl of the fashionably rich. And on business trips that often included visits to six Wal-Mart stores in a day, he rented subcompact cars and spent nights at budget motels, or in the homes of store managers. He was notoriously absent-minded. Driving once, he was distracted by counting cars in a competing store's parking lot and rammed into the rear of a Wal-Mart tractor trailer. No one was hurt. And Mr. Walton had his business failures. Wal-Mart's ventures into selling discount drugs, do-it-yourself building supplies and arts-and-craft supplies were all abandoned after mixed results. His huge Hypermart stores, which have sold groceries along with Wal-Mart's traditional fare since 1988 under a roof that could cover five football fields, have apparently proved too large to manage. The company is trying a similar formula in scaled-down stores called Supercenters. On occasion, Mr. Walton sparred with labor unions that tried unsuccessfully to organize clerks in his stores or drivers in his vast trucking fleet. But he mostly avoided labor clashes by placing stores and distribution centers away from cities where unions were powerful. He also installed profit-sharing plans that enabled hundreds of workers with low wages to retire with comfortable, and occasionally lucrative, pensions because of the rising price of Wal-Mart stock. A cashier who retired in 1989 with $262,000 in retirement benefits, Shirley Cox, earned $7.10 an hour on her last day of work after 24 years with the company, said Vance H. Trimble, author of an unauthorized biography of Mr. Walton published by Dutton in 1990. Mr. Walton was an avid hunter, particularly of quail, and a frequent patron of local restaurants in Bentonville. He was an active worshiper at the First Presbyterian Church, where he once taught Sunday school. In recent years he drove a red 1985 Ford pickup. Bentonville, which now has a population of 10,825, named the local junior high school after him in 1983 and the local day-care center for his wife, Helen Robson Walton. Mrs. Walton, 72, controls the trust she shared with Mr. Walton. The other four trusts are controlled by the Waltons' four children: S. Robson, 47, one of three Wal-Mart vice chairmen; John T., 45, owner of a boat-making business in San Diego; James C., 43, president of Walton Enterprises, which includes family-controlled newspapers, banks and other businesses and charitable activities, and Alice, 42, who heads a private investment firm, the Llama Company, in Fayetteville, Ark. Mr. Walton's brother, James, 70, owns more than 20 million shares and is a senior vice president and director of Wal-Mart. Mr. Walton is also survived by 10 grandchildren. Ideas That Built The No. 1 Retailer One of Wal-Mart's biggest strengths was the streamlined, sophisticated logistics it created for replenishing products as its universe of stores expanded, management advisers at the Boston Consulting Group said. In the early years, Mr. Walton insisted on building stores no more than a day's drive from distribution centers. Now, Wal-Mart fills merchandise orders within two days, compared with an average of two weeks among its rivals. The company has 19 cavernous distribution centers, with an average of six miles of rack space in each; nearly 2,000 trucks; a satellite video system for relaying sales trends to executives, buyers, store managers and clerks, and a fleet of aircraft -- purchased secondhand -- to ferry managers across the Wal-Mart system. Eighty-five percent of the merchandise Wal-Mart sells is shipped from its distribution centers, compared with 50 percent at its biggest competitor in discounting, Kmart, which relies on suppliers to ship the rest of its merchandise. Upsetting Conventional Wisdom In the March-April 1992 issue of The Harvard Business Review, three officers at Boston Consulting -- George Stalk, Philip Evans and Lawrence E. Shulman -- said Mr. Walton had turned on its ear the conventional retailing approach of having senior executives make purchasing and stocking decisions. "Instead of the retailer pushing products into the system, customers 'pull' products when and where they need them," they wrote. "The job of senior management at Wal-Mart, then, is not to tell individual store managers what to do but to create an environment where they can learn from the market -- and from each other." Some executives at the company and consultants said Mr. Walton was a fair-minded leader, but hard-driving and demanding. "He was a man who extracted and expected a great deal from others because he himself always gave 100 percent," said Kurt Barnard, an industry consultant. Unauthorized Biography Mr. Trimble wrote that Ron Loveless, former head of the company's wholesale-club division, retired in 1986 at age 42 partly because of job stress. "If you don't produce, you'll be gone," Mr. Loveless, who did not talk to Mr. Trimble, told The Arkansas Gazette in 1986. David D. Glass, who succeeded Mr. Walton as chief executive in 1988, suffered a heart attack a year after being promoted to president in 1984. With the economy in recession during 1991, Wal-Mart continued to flex its muscle. Although Mr. Walton was slowed by cancer treatments, he continued piloting himself, often alone, in a twin-engine Cessna to visit dozens of stores each week as he pursued plans to push Wal-Mart's yearly sales beyond $100 billion by the turn of the century. The company opened more than 150 new and mostly bigger stores, expanded into Northeastern states and accelerated openings of its wholesale subsidiary, known as Sam's Clubs, which in 1991 increased sales by 43 percent, to more than $9 billion. Over all, Wal-Mart's sales rose 35 percent last year, to $43.9 billion, and profits jumped by 24.8 percent, to $1.6 billion. Delighted Crowds As a Showman Mr. Walton's enthusiasm knew few bounds. In 1983, after Wal-Mart's profits exceeded expectations, he kept a promise to employees and donned a grass skirt to dance a hula on Wall Street. At the Wal-Mart annual stockholders' meeting each spring, the charismatic Mr. Walton played barker, preacher, cheerleader and company visionary to ever-larger crowds. On June 7, 1991, more than 10,000 people filled the basketball arena at the University of Arkansas, 30 miles south of Bentonville, for what was Mr. Walton's last performance in a role that began that day at 7 A.M. and continued until noon. "A lot of believers are here today," he shouted to an approving roar from the crowd of stockholders, executives of Wal-Mart suppliers, and more than 2,000 employees who had traveled to Fayetteville at company expense from stores across the country. Later that day, Sam and Helen Walton held their annual barbecue for the employees on the lawn of the 5,500-square-foot house they built in Bentonville and lived in since 1959. The Spirit of Prosperity Mr. Walton orchestrated the annual meeting to underscore his managerial doctrine that the close links among suppliers, shareholders and employees determined Wal-Mart's prosperity. During the meeting, Mr. Walton urged each of these three constituent groups to stand separately as applause filled the arena. Then he called on employees who served in the military during the Persian Gulf conflict to stand. "Good God, let's get the lights on them," he commanded. Among Wal-Mart's 380,000 employees at the time, 582 reservists and members of the National Guard were activated for the fighting. A Wal-Mart executive announced that 80,000 jobs had been created in the United States by Wal-Mart merchandise orders since Mr. Walton's "Buy America" campaign began in 1985. The reigning Miss U.S.A., Kelli McCarty, the daughter of a Wal-Mart manager, smiled, posed and exchanged a "high five" with Mr. Walton. Paul Harvey, the radio commentator whose sponsors included Wal-Mart, proclaimed on stage that the Wal-Mart way was "something better than capitalism: enlightened consumerism." Then the entertainer Lee Greenwood sang "God Bless the U.S.A." 'High Expectations Are the Key' "There is nothing like it in the annals of retailing," Mr. Walton shouted as the spectacle unfolded. "High expectations are the key to everything." When Mr. Glass announced that the value of all Wal-Mart shares had increased to $45 billion from $150 million in 1976, Mr. Walton interrupted him. "And it's only just begun," he declared. "Do you believe it? Let me hear you say it!" And a chant immediately filled the hot auditorium: "And it's only just begun." Industry analysts say Mr. Walton gained the edge in sales over other retailers by taking risks, adopting approaches that worked for competitors and getting the most from his employees. In 1988, for instance, Wal-Mart averaged $103,000 in sales for each employee, while Kmart averaged $82,000. In the 1989 interview with Financial World, which named him chief executive of the decade, Mr. Walton said: "I probably have traveled and walked into more variety stores than anybody in America. I am just trying to get ideas, any kind of ideas that will help our company. Most of us don't invent ideas. We take the best ideas from someone else." The family has planned a private funeral in Bentonville.

861-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: TELEVISION; Prime Time's Growing Hit? That's News
JUST how much news can television use? As the network news divisions add programs from early morning through the entire night and continue to seek the financial advantages of using news programs instead of increasingly costly entertainment shows, the limit to the air time available to these programs appears to be nowhere in sight. All three big networks now have all-night newscasts. In the fall, NBC will break the Saturday morning tradition of children's cartoon shows to add a Saturday version of "Today," a move that most industry analysts expect will be highly successful in attracting adult viewers. News is already available 24 hours a day on the Cable News Network. And then there is the Fox Network, which last month said it would create a network news division. Nowhere is the increasing access to network news more noticeable than in prime time. This television season, news magazine programs have become the most successful genre in television. "Dateline," the new NBC news magazine program, last week produced the most promising results that network has seen in its two-decade search for a news presence in prime time. NBC's instant success had executives at both CBS and ABC gnashing their teeth for not having moved first to place an hourlong news program on Tuesday night at 10, the last available weeknight slot at that time, where news has thrived. During the current television season, news programs in prime time have averaged just under a 15 rating, well above the average rating for all network prime-time programs, a 12.5. (Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.) Indeed, every network news magazine program improved its ratings this season: CBS's "60 Minutes" vaulted back to the No. 1 position and ABC's "20/20" gained almost 10 percent. CBS's "48 Hours" and ABC's "Prime Time Live," once considered on the brink of extinction, emerged this season as the two most improved programs in television. CBS also added "Street Stories," and picked up more than three rating points from the entertainment shows that had been running Thursday nights at 9. David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of research for CBS, said the results proved that a news or information program could thrive in every single hour of prime time as long as it competed only against entertainment. "There is an information-driven audience that will go to the news and information programs over the traditional drama or comedy show," he said, "and this audience is large enough to make programming these shows financially attractive." The financial considerations are clearly a factor in making news the growth area of television. News programs are cheaper to produce per episode than entertainment shows (about $700,000 an hour versus $1 million or more for an entertainment hour). In addition, many news programs apparently never wear out their welcome as entertainment shows inevitably do ("60 Minutes" improved in its 23d year, "20/20" in its 13th). And news programs are not subject to onerous financial renegotiations with producers and Hollywood studios after four years on the air. The news programs also make use of resources already in network news budgets. "It creates a certain synergy to be able to produce programs in our own core news facility, using on-site camera crews and our own library for research," said Joe Peyronnin, CBS News vice president. The only negative financial factor, Mr. Poltrack said, is that news magazine programs are undervalued by advertisers. The programs still attract a somewhat older audience than many youth-oriented sponsors prefer; they can touch upon sensitive topics that some advertisers want to avoid, and they are usually presented in three segments, a setup that some advertisers dislike because they feel it encourages viewers to change channels between segments. Still, Mr. Poltrack argues that news programs have begun to prove so reliable that programmers will continue to turn to them -- and advertisers will begin paying prices closer to what they are worth. One danger for a news program, he said, would be in trying to move it into a time period already filled by either another news program or even a "reality" series like "Unsolved Mysteries" on NBC. "The audience isn't exactly the same," Mr. Poltrack said, "but the appetite for information is." ABC will try to defy those odds next fall when it introduces its third weekly news magazine -- and takes on "60 Minutes" where it lives, Sunday nights at 7. And further news expansion is planned. NBC News has a second program that is likely to be on the network's fall schedule, "I Witness Video," and CBS would like to develop a fourth news entry as a vehicle for Connie Chung. As for Fox, the first target project of that incipient network news organization is, predictably, a prime-time magazine show.

"The deepest cave found to date is in France, the Reseau Jean Bernard," said John Scheltens, president of the National Speleological Society, which has its headquarters in Huntsville, Ala. "Its total depth, not just the length of its shaft, is 5,256 feet, almost a mile straight down." The longest system of passageways in the world is the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky, he said. The numbers change with new exploration, but as of June 1991, the sum of all known passages was 340 miles, he said. The deepest cave in the United States is a new discovery, Lechuguilla Cave, in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, N.M., he said. Its depth is 1,565 feet. "A large part of the United Sates is underlain by cavernous limestone aquifers," said Mr. Scheltens. The Mammoth Cave National Park system was basically formed by the solution of limestone, he explained. As water falls on the surface of the earth, it mixes with organic matter and forms a weak solution of carbonic acid, "like weak Coca-Cola," he said. "Given sufficient times, perhaps millions of years, the solution feeds into the cavities of the limestone and gradually creates a cave," he said. "It's sort of like tooth decay." Amateur exploration of caves is an important source of knowledge about them, he said, and can be safe if undertaken by properly trained and supervised people. From the standpoint of structural stability, caves are relatively much safer than mines, said Mr. Scheltens, who is also a civil engineer. He moved to South Dakota to be near Wind Cave National Park and Jewel Cave National Monument, the second- and third-largest cave systems in the United States.

863-> Review/Rock; Cowboy Junkies, Under Influences
The most important prop in Cowboy Junkies' concert at the Beacon Theater on Thursday night was the lead singer Margo Timmins's shawl. A delicate, lacy black number that looked like something Stevie Nicks might drape over a lamp, the shawl seemed to function as a security blanket. When Ms. Timmins sang lines that were supposed to convey vulnerability, she wrapped it tightly around her shoulders and hugged her arms; during moments of abandon, as in the song " 'Cause Cheap Is How I Feel," from the Junkies' third album, "The Caution Horses," she let the shawl dangle seductively. Doused in lavender lights, her head bowed, Ms. Timmins looked something like a docile prairie wife waiting for her husband's return; her shawl was her talisman, flagging her as a female anachronism. Since the Junkies' commercial breakthrough in 1988 with the album "The Trinity Session," a good deal of the band's appeal has depended on Ms. Timmins's sexuality. As the band rummaged through folk, blues and country influences, slowing down songs like Lou Reed's "Sweet Jane" to a death-knell tempo, Ms. Timmins sang in a voice that rarely rose above a whisper; she sounds hushed, doomed and breathless, like a woman-child or a soiled innocent. On subsequent releases, the Junkies have tried to flesh out their approach: the band's latest release, "Black-Eyed Man" (RCA), includes full-out rockers and brazen, electric psychedelia. At the Beacon Theater, the six-piece touring lineup (bass, drums, keyboards, vocals and two guitars) had occasional bursts of energy; an encore rendition of "Sweet Jane" was delivered at Mr. Reed's original pace. But the Junkies, and Ms. Timmins, remain essentially one-note performers. Ms. Timmins threw out images of sullied Americana -- run-down trailer parks, jail cells, greasy eggs and bacon -- without ever getting at the meaning that underlies them. She relies on signifiers and props, rather than emotion. The Junkies glibly appropriate influences, but they haven't yet learned how to assimilate them. The singer and songwriter John Prine, the show's other star, knows how to communicate without pretense. He, too, can be a languid performer -- at times he slow-stepped through songs from his latest album, "The Missing Years" (Oh Boy), as if he were sitting around his living room with a few friends. But his melodies and lyrics are so potent, they need no extra dressing. When he sang lines like "Mind all your manners; be quiet as a mouse/Someday you'll own a home that's as big as a house" from "It's a Big Old Goofy World," the audience laughed and applauded approvingly, as if they, too, were just old friends enjoying the moment.

865-> Prime Is Cut By Chemical; Others Hold
The Chemical Banking Corporation cut its prime lending rate to 6 1/4 percent yesterday from 6 1/2 percent. The cut, which put the rate at its lowest point since May 1976, followed last Thursday's move by the Federal Reserve to push down short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point. No other large banks followed Chemical's lead, and bankers, who said they were continuously assessing their prime rates, declined to speculate whether other banks would cut their prime rates for competitive reasons. Analysts noted that Chemical was by far the leading bank for small- and medium-sized businesses in the New York area. Since its merger with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation late last year, Chemical has developed the financial muscle to be more aggressive in setting lower prices to gain greater market share. Many Small Borrowers Chemical is the leading bank in the New York area for more than 30,000 medium-sized businesses, which are too small to borrow money in the securities markets and rely heavily on banks for financing. "The 6.25 percent prime reflects the lower interest rates that are in the market and our desire to pass on those lower rates to our customers," said John Meyers, a Chemical spokesman. Besides helping many business borrowers, a lower prime rate will eventually benefit many of Chemical's consumers with credit-card, home-equity and other installment loans that are tied to the prime rate. Robert B. McKinley, director of research at RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., concern that monitors the credit-card industry, noted that about one in five credit cards had an interest rate tied to the prime. Chemical will adjust the rates on its variable-rate credit cards on May 15, the regular quarterly adjustment date. The cut in the prime rate does not have much impact on home mortgage rates, most of which fluctuate according to yields on Treasury securities. The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which had been moving between 9 percent and 9.125 percent in recent weeks, averaged 8.89 percent in the week of April 10, according to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., publishing company that monitors the mortgage markets. Interest rates on adjustable mortgages, which are generally tied to Treasury bill rates, not the prime rate, now average 6.13 percent. Lagging Behind Fed Over the last three years, as the prime rate has declined from 11 1/2 percent in early 1989, banks have generally cut their lending rates more slowly than the Federal Reserve has cut other interest rates. The Fed's quarter-point cut last week in the Federal funds rate brought the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans down to 3.75 percent. The central banks' strategy has been to help improve bank profits and provide capital to compensate for heavy bank losses on commercial real estate loans. Analysts at Oppenheimer & Company calculated that the average interest margin for 30 large banks -- the difference between the interest rate banks receive for loans and other investments and what they pay on for deposits and other funds -- averaged 4.06 percent in 1991, up from 3.82 percent in 1990. Recent earnings reports show that the interest rate spreads remain healthy and are increasing at some banks. The First Chicago Corporation, for example, said that its margin was 3.07 percent in the first quarter of this year, up from 2.99 percent a year earlier and 2.89 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991. The Wachovia Corporation, a large bank based in Winston Salem, N.C., said yesterday that a wider interest rate spread had helped lift its profits in the first quarter.

866-> Summer Pop Circuit Sees No End to Recession
Some of the biggest names in rock took their acts on the road this summer and pumped a bit of vitality back into the ailing pop concert scene. But even their spark fell far short of a full revival. Genesis, for instance, was unable to fill large sections of some stadiums, and tickets for megastar acts like U2, Bruce Springsteen and the joint tour by Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica and Faith No More were selling more slowly than expected in some cities. "The recession hit everybody at every level," said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar, a magazine that covers the concert industry. "There are bright spots," he said. "In 1992, we were blessed with a higher caliber of artists. But the impact of the recession, coupled with the traditional seasonal summer overload of concerts, resulted in a lot of shows' doing less-than-anticipated business. Artists considering doing two or three dates at an arena may have done only one. They sold out and looked great, but in better times they might have done more shows." Hard Lessons This summer's uneven season follows the worst summer in memory for live pop performances, one that put a number of promoters out of business and left others in a state of near-desperation. Last summer, stadium tours were almost nonexistent as bigger acts postponed record releases and tours. Fans, who had less discretionary income because of the recession, stayed away. There were cancellations and bankruptcies. Compounding the situation were higher costs of producing shows, resulting in large part from promoters' fierce competition for the talent that was available, which drove up artists' fees and ticket prices. It was anticipated that this summer's lineup would spell relief. Not only were such proven concert performers as Genesis, U2, Guns 'n' Roses and the joint concerts of Eric Clapton and Elton John mounting stadium tours, but Bruce Springsteen was also back, playing arenas, and last year's most successful package, the Lollapalooza tour, returned with a lineup that included the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ice Cube, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and the Jesus and Mary Chain. Concert promoters, meanwhile, had learned a hard lesson. Competition for artists remained intense, but many promoters were more prudent in negotiating and securing artists' contracts. Ticket prices remained fairly stable, averaging about $25. The country superstar Garth Brooks charged only $18.50 for his show last weekend at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Pollstar reported that the top 20 tours took in $238.7 million in the first six months of this year, a 15 percent increase over the $208.6 million generated during the same period last year. For some promoters, the stadium tours this summer made the difference. Jim Koplik, the president of Metropolitan Entertainment, a large concert-promoting concern in Montclair, N.J., said it was "a great summer" because his company had a total of 11 stadium shows, at Giants Stadium and in upstate New York, with acts including U2, the Grateful Dead, Genesis, and the tour of Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica and Faith No More. However, Mr. Koplik said that business at arenas and amphitheaters, which he called the core of the concert business, was just "mediocre to good." Stadiums have a seating capacity of 60,000 or more, compared with 10,000 to 20,000 seats in amphitheaters, the warm-weather stages whose whole year depends on the success of summer shows. Genesis appeared in stadiums from Texas to Massachusetts and was the top act for the period from May 1 through July 31, according to Amusement Business, a trade magazine for the entertainment and amusement industry. The English group's gross of $23.9 million for 23 shows reflects the impact that stadium tours can have on the bottom line. The No. 1 group for the same period last year was Guns 'n' Roses, which did 29 shows in smaller venues and grossed $13.2 million. Yet even Genesis wasn't always a sure bet. After a sold-out concert at Foxboro Stadium near Boston in late May, the group's keyboardist, Tony Banks, said in a telephone interview: "The recession here in many ways is more apparent than in parts of Europe in the way it affects a concert tour. In pockets of the country, we don't sell as many tickets as we thought we would. In other places, we sell more. We're doing better in Europe this time than in America. I reckon the American tour will be subsidized by the European tour." Following Genesis in Amusement Business's top 10 for May through July were the Grateful Dead, the Cure, Jimmy Buffett, Guns 'n' Roses with Metallica, Eric Clapton solo, Garth Brooks, Harry Connick Jr., Rush and Neil Diamond. The tour of Guns 'n' Roses and Metallica, which was highly anticipated by both fans and promoters, later missed several scheduled appearances after Metallica's singer and guitarist, James Hetfield, was seriously burned by the band's onstage fireworks and after W. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns 'n' Roses, was reportedly suffering from throat problems. The Dead, which have toured consistently and been a top money-maker on the road, canceled some dates recently because Jerry Garcia, the band's leader, was ill. Veterans and 'Baby Acts' There were some positive signs. Established performers like Bonnie Raitt and James Taylor, who have strong followings, did well at amphitheaters. And country artists like Reba McEntire, Billy Ray Cyrus and Wynonna Judd were playing to increasingly wider audiences, said Ben Liss, executive director of the North American Concert Promoters Association, which comprises the country's leading promoters. Mr. Liss also said "baby acts," newer performers with strong potential drawing power, had emerged, including the Black Crowes, Pearl Jam and Faith No More. He and others said that developing artists who can attract future audiences was one of the biggest challenges in the concert business. "The headline mega-megastars, there are fewer and fewer of them," said Louis Messina, president of Pace Music Group and Pace Concerts in Houston. "The B-level acts are the backbone of our business." Mr. Koplik said that the industry suffered from a cyclical scarcity of strong acts as artists take off four or five years between tours, compared to one year in the 1970's. Genesis's tour was its first in five years, and Mr. Springsteen's shows were his first with a band since 1988. "And radio stations are not breaking as many artists as they used to," Mr. Koplik said, adding that there would be fewer shows this fall than in past years. "The concert business primarily depends on album rock radio. Out of every three artists played on album rock radio, one artist is already dead, one band is no longer together or touring, and only the third artist is putting out a current product and going on the road." Many rock radio stations have a "classic rock" format, and much of the music is 20 to 25 years old. "We need to help build long-term careers for artists who are emerging," Mr. Liss said. "That is the most critical question we as an industry have to deal with. Record companies, talent buyers, agents, managers and record shops must work together. We all have the same consumer, and we're all working for the same artists."

867-> COMPANY NEWS; Shearson Discusses the Sale of Its Boston Company Unit
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. announced yesterday that it was negotiating the sale of the Boston Company, its large money-management subsidiary, with several financial institutions. In a statement, Shearson described the talks about the sale as preliminary and said the firm had not yet decided to sell the unit. Citing confidentiality of the conversations, the firm declined to identify the bidders or say how many might be interested in buying the diviison. But Wall Street executives yesterday named three giant banking institutions as potential bidders. They include one New York bank, Chase Manhattan, as well as two banking companies based in Pittsburgh, the Mellon Bank Corporation and the PNC Financial Corporation. Spokesmen for the three banks could not be reached last night at their offices. The potential sale of the Boston Company has been rumored for years, but Shearson has often said that it had no plans to sell the unit. In recent months, however, the values of such businesses have skyrocketed as increasing numbers of financial institutions have sought out the attractive, stable earnings that such businesses bring. Flurry of Acquisitions Indeed, in recent months Wall Street has seen a flurry of acquisitions of such businesses, capped by the purchase last week of John Templeton's money-management empire, Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger. The business was sold to Franklin Resources Inc., a California fund company, for $913 million. "If the Templeton funds can go for $900 million plus, money managers today can be a relatively attractive deal," one investment banker outside Shearson said. "That can attract a lot of buyers and sellers." The Boston Company provides a range of administration, custodial and trust services for mutual funds and pension funds, as well as foundations and charitable organizations. The company is also involved in the mortgage-lending business through its Boston Safe Deposit and Trust subsidiary. Investment bankers outside Shearson said yesterday that both its money-management business and mortgage business made the company attractive. With the rapid drop in interest rates, the Boston Company is one of several institutions that stands to profit from the rush of consumers seeking to refinance mortgages. The company is in strong financial shape, with about $34 billion of assets under management as of June 30. The company also provides administrative and custodial services for more than $300 billion worth of assets. Such a sale, if it proceeds, would help Shearson, as well as its parent, the American Express Company, both of which are recovering from years of financial turmoil brought on by growing credit problems and poor investments in the 1980's. While Shearson did not disclose the prices that are being negotiated for the money-management unit, some investment bankers outside the firm said the Boston Company would probably sell for more than $1 billion.

869-> British Insurers Post Huge Loss
The Association of British Insurers said today that the country's insurers lost a record $:3.3 billion, or $6.2 billion, in 1991, compared with a $:1.5 billion loss a year earlier. The association said in a statement that the insurers lost $:1.3 in 1991 for every $:1 collected in premiums. Auto insurance underwriting losses rose to $:1.2 billion, from $:928.8 million in 1990. Fire and accident losses rose to $:3.3 billion from $:1.9 billion, while mortgage indemnity losses totaled $:1.2 billion. The association did not release figures for mortgage indemnity losses in 1990. The association's chairman, Ian Rushton, said the average British family must pay about $:10 more a month this year for home and motor insurance. The association said all forms of crime in Britain "jumped dramatically" in 1991. Auto theft claims rose 36 percent and domestic crime claims rose 75 percent.

He said: "The Republican Party is off kilter on economic issues and social issues. The Democratic Party is correct on social issues and just needs to move on economic issues and so that's one consideration."

872-> 60-Minute Gourmet
WHEN I am on an extremely tight schedule to produce a meal at home for four or more, I often reach for boneless chicken breasts. Not only do they cook quickly -- whether grilled, poached, sauteed or broiled -- but they also adapt to an endless variety of accompaniments. On one such rushed occasion I bought some shiitake mushrooms in the market and built a fast meal around them. Believed to be among the oldest cultivated mushrooms, dating back 2,000 years or more, shiitakes have become a favorite ingredient of contemporary restaurant chefs. Not so long ago they were available only in dry form. But the proliferation of shiitake farms in California and Canada has made fresh ones available year-round. Shiitake caps are somewhat spongy in texture, decidedly less dense and chewy than many American mushrooms. They have a faint smoky flavor that enhances poultry beautifully. These fairly assertive mushrooms do not shrink when combined with strong herbs and spices. The dish here is made with rosemary, parsley and shallots. The sauce is made in the pan used to cook the chicken. A pleasing summer side dish is zucchini flavored with garlic, onions, basil and Parmesan, then gratineed before serving. This dish can be assembled ahead of time and popped under the broiler before serving. Chicken Breasts With Shiitake Mushrooms 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, about 5 ounces each Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil 1/4 pound shiitake or small white mushrooms, washed and dried 8 small white onions, peeled 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, or 1 tablespoon dried 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 1/4 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup fresh or canned chicken broth 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley. 1. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. 2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add the chicken breasts, the mushrooms and the onions. Cook about 5 minutes over medium heat or until lightly browned. Turn the pieces and cook 5 minutes more, shaking the pan and turning the mushrooms and onions so they brown evenly. Remove chicken breasts, and keep them warm. Pour off fat from the pan. 3. Add the rosemary and shallots and cook briefly, until wilted. Add the wine and cook, stirring and scraping to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the skillet. 4. When the wine is almost reduced by half, blend in the chicken broth. Continue cooking and when the sauce is reduced by half, stir in the butter. Remove pan from stove immediately. Pour sauce over chicken, sprinkle with the parsley and serve. Yield: 4 servings. Nutrition analysis per serving: 295 calories, 15 grams fat, 98 milligrams cholesterol, 566 milligrams sodium, 35 grams protein, 5 grams carbohydrate. Zucchini With Parmesan Cheese 4 medium-size zucchini, trimmed, about 1 1/4 pounds 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup sliced white onions Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic 4 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or Gruyere. 1. Preheat broiler. 2. Cut the zucchini into even slices about 1/8 inch thick. 3. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the zucchini, onions, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes or until wilted. 4. Add the garlic and the basil. Blend well and cook for a few minutes, but do not brown the garlic. 5. Transfer to an ovenproof dish. Smooth the top and sprinkle evenly with the cheese. Place under broiler until brown. Serve with the chicken. Yield: 4 servings.

876-> Review/Art; Far Better to Display Than Merely to Receive
There is probably no simple way for the Whitney Museum of American Art to introduce the eclectic group of more than 200 objects that entered its collection in the last year, short of lining the pieces up side by side and letting them fight for attention. As it turns out, the three-part exhibition "Gifts and Acquisitions in Context," which places the new arrivals among related works already owned by the museum, is a nice solution. Even if the first installment, on view through July 5, generates no major surprises, it effectively suggests the depth of the museum's holdings and offers some fine individual works. A few artists are given star treatment. Nine pieces by Jasper Johns amount to a kind of micro-retrospective, with the focus on the newly acquired "Studio II." It's one of those maddening Johns paintings from the mid-1960's that seem to do everything possible to thwart viewer interest. The colors are wan grays and pinks with jabs of hard orange, and there is no composition to speak of, except a few highly brushed white rectangles set across a horizontal expanse. The Whitney's "Studio" (1964) and "Racing Thoughts" (1983) are hung beside and across from it as indicators of where "Studio II" is coming from and where it is going, although it is the well-known "Three Flags" hung nearby that stresses just how concentrated an artist Mr. Johns can be. Robert Rauschenberg's "Satellite" (1955), the first of his "combine" paintings to enter the Whitney collection, is given a similar context of supporting work, though it doesn't need it. With its thick buildup of paint, yellowed newspapers, washcloths and old socks, "Satellite" may be a conservator's nightmare, but it displays all the self-generated, hands-on energy in the best work of an artist whose career continues to pursue a fascinating peaks-and-valleys course. After the Johns and Rauschenberg sections, the show proceeds chronologically, and the next room, with the work of artists whose careers flourished primarily between the world wars, is the best. Included are two delightful abstract paintings by Charles Shaw. In one, solid geometric forms interlock; in the other, done four years later, they interweave gently, their edges drifting off into space. The real treat, though, is the row of five works by Alice Trumbull Mason, with the brilliant, fresh-looking little "Paradox No. 5" (1969), painted just two years before her death, at their center. Mason was an artist who kept exploring right up to the end, as the variety in these paintings reveals. The next generation is represented by a couple of Joseph Cornell's characteristically wry and exquisite boxes, but more unusual is a charcoal-and-gouache drawing by Adolph Gottlieb from the early 1940's. Its single shape like an inverted flower, dotted with what seem to be eyes with black lashes, suggest a strong link to the eroticized organic forms of Arshile Gorky, hung nearby. That link continues in certain sculpture from the 1960's and 70's. The group presented here is a mixed bag. Lynda Benglis's two works, one in wax resembling a spinal column, the other in copper suggesting a huge cloth knot, look good, and Richard Tuttle's serene octagonal piece of white paper pasted almost invisibly to the wall makes most of the art around it look stagy and self-important, words that best describe Robert Morris's three sculptural contributions, which represent this artist at his least persuasive. The shifts in theme and style from the art of the 1970's to the 80's is the most dramatic in the show. Suddenly, the work grows physically ponderous and complicated. And figures in narratives, particularly those suggesting childhood, are omnipresent. Jon Kessler's computerized sculpture suggests a science-fiction adventure story; Michael Byron's nocturnal painting "Gothic Plaid" features a threatening-looking puppet and a toy-size sculpture on a separate stand. In Robin Winters's 1977 "Death Draws," a skull-headed painted figure sprawls amid childlike drawings. The exhibition concludes with recent works, including a text painting by Glen Ligon (with the stenciled sentence "I do not always feel colored" repeated from top to bottom in black and white letters that often blend into gray), a photograph triptych by Mona Simpson that addresses black identity and, finally, Robert Gober's sculpture of a pale, trousered wax leg emerging from the wall and bearing a candle on its knee, an emblematic wrap-up that brings contemporary concerns with the body and politics to the fore. "Recent Gifts and Acquisitions in Context" offers a little bit, then, of a lot of 20th-century art. It also celebrates the Whitney itself, 60 years old last year. The museum's institutional history punctuates the show in interesting ways. On several of the wall cards accompanying gifts appear the words "in honor of Tom Armstrong," indicating donor support for the Whitney director dismissed two years ago. And among a handful of early works in the lower gallery, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, the museum's founder, who was an artist herself, is represented by a bronze sculpture she created in 1913 and in a charcoal portrait by John Singer Sargent. Sargent depicts Mrs. Whitney in a fabulous ballet costume by Bakst -- all bristling flowers and diving curves -- dancing with arms outstretched and looking soulfully down at her viewers. It is an image at once elegant and zany, with a combination of flair and discipline that any museum would do well to emulate. Part I of "Gifts and Acquisitions in Context" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, Manhattan, through July 5. Part II runs from July 10 through Aug. 23, Part III from Aug. 28 through Sept. 20.

877-> Officer Tells Of Shooting That Ignited Disturbances
Michael O'Keefe, the police officer whose fatal shooting of a Dominican man ignited angry protests in Washington Heights last week, told the Manhattan District Attorney's office yesterday that he fired in self-defense after the man pulled a gun on him, a law-enforcement official and a lawyer connected to the case said. Officer O'Keefe told investigators that he had followed the man, Jose Garcia, after suspecting that Mr. Garcia was concealing a gun, and that after questioning him, Mr. Garcia first tried to flee, then punched the officer several times and drew a gun on him, the officials said. The account matches descriptions offered by the Police Department soon after the incident but differs sharply with contentions made by a lawyer for Mr. Garcia's family, who said that Officer O'Keefe beat Mr. Garcia and shot him without provocation. Five days of violent demonstrations in Upper Manhattan followed the confrontation between Officer O'Keefe and Mr. Garcia on July 3. One man was killed and dozens were injured. Last night, a group of about 50 protesters marched in the neighborhood. Officer's Partners Questioned Mayor David N. Dinkins has pledged a full inquiry into Mr. Garcia's death. To that end, investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney's office interviewed Officer O'Keefe's two partners from the 34th Precinct, Thomas McPartland and Matteo Brattesani, on Tuesday before meeting with Officer O'Keefe yesterday as well as with two women who say they witnessed the scuffle that preceded the shooting. What Mr. O'Keefe's partners told the district attorney's office has not been disclosed; they did not witness the killing. But another lawyer connected to the case said yesterday that one of the women had told the office that she had watched the deadly encounter unfold from the landing of a stairwell and that she had seen Officer O'Keefe hit Mr. Garcia with his walkie-talkie and pull the trigger as Mr. Garcia "lay semiconscious on the ground." Police Recover a Gun For two and a half hours yesterday, Officer O'Keefe answered the questions in the district attorney's office, telling what he saw on the night of July 3 as he patrolled West 162d Street with two partners. According to the law-enforcement officials and the lawyer who relayed the officer's account, Officer O'Keefe said he approached Mr. Garcia after seeing a bulge at Mr. Garcia's waistline, which he took to be a hidden gun. The officer said that his partners went around the block to surround Mr. Garcia. Officer O'Keefe said that he identified himself, and that Mr. Garcia ran into the apartment building at 505 West 162d Street. The officer said he chased Mr. Garcia into the building's vestibule and that after Mr. Garcia turned and punched him in the head, he hit Mr. Garcia with his walkie-talkie. Officer O'Keefe said that he reached for his gun only after Mr. Garcia took out a .38-caliber revolver. Officer O'Keefe said that he shot Mr. Garcia in the stomach and then fired a second time because Mr. Garcia aimed his gun at him. He said he struck Mr. Garcia in the back as Mr. Garcia spun around to shoot. The police recovered a gun at the scene. Michael Baden, a former medical examiner who has been hired by the Garcia family to conduct a second autopsy, said that it would be difficult to determine which shot came first -- the shot to Mr. Garcia's stomach or the shot to his back. Santo Alessi, the lawyer for the Garcia family, said that he had been denied access to the autopsy report made by the city's medical examiner.

878-> Critic's Notebook; Spanish Dance Festival in France
If the Lyons Dance Biennial here has become one of the world's foremost dance festivals, it is thanks largely to its spectacular overview of French dance in 1988 and of American dance in 1990. What, then, could be easier than a similar three-week celebration of Spanish dance in 1992? Yet "Pasion de Espana," as this year's event (the fifth since 1984) is aptly called, has erupted into colorful and passionate complexity even within its first few days. The only thing that the visiting Spanish dancers, choreographers, writers and officials seem to agree upon is that there are literally more curves than straight lines in their dance traditions. Other than that, the sources and definition of Spanish dance, especially as it is manifest in both diversity and new experimental forms, seem pretty much in the air. Vivid images and controversy dominate this festival, which opened on Saturday night and will present 27 companies through Oct. 4. At one of the festival's daily press conferences, Ola (Lola Puentes) and Tse (Montserrat Colome), a witty female duo, turned serious when they were asked somewhat innocently by a reporter if they were from Catalonia (Tse is). Their reply was rife with subtext when they explained that they didn't want "politics to supersede art," meaning that they considered themselves artists first. This morning, however, Valenti Sallas i Campmany, a Catalan cultural official, stressed that the Olympics in Barcelona "made known our cultural identity" and clearly identified the seven avant-garde groups from Barcelona here as "representing our culture." In fact, the Catalan cultural authority's support of companies at the Biennial was contingent on the establishment of a performance space that would be identified as the Catalan Space, distinct from a Spanish umbrella title. Catalonian flags even fly above the street at this location. Other contradictions abound. The distant picture of stately pavanes in Velazquez's time is dashed when a dance historian declares that anyone dancing the 17th-century sarabande in Spain got five years in the galleys because the dance was considered lascivious until it was sanitized by the French court across the border. The source here was Ana Yepes, a Spanish choreographer who is a member of Ris et Danceries, the brilliant French Baroque dance company that performed in the opera "Atys" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year. At the secretive Spanish court, Miss Yepes said, Baroque dance did not develop into the splendor that Louis XIV promoted in France. Dancing evolved in the theater, as Ris et Danceries, directed by Francine Lancelot, showed in the premiere of "Zarandanzas" on Tuesday night. The choreography was reductive, a mix of reconstructions and original work, somewhat schematic but beautifully executed. From theatrical dances, Miss Yepes said, grew the Bolera school, the style of distinctly Spanish dancing that took Europe by storm in the 1830's and 1840's. Not so, said Angel Pericet, whose family has handed down the Bolera dances since Mr. Pericet's great-great-grandfather, a Napoleonic soldier, married a dancer in Seville. Mr. Pericet said these kinds of dances grew out of folk sources. The style was represented by Angel, his brother, Eloy, and two of their sisters, Carmelita and Maria del Amparo. To see them on Sunday in five "authentic" Bolera dances as well as in their own choreography was to see a 19th-century Romantic ballet print come alive. Their steps are often identical to those of classical ballet but with their castinets, curved arms and mobile torsos creating spiraling shapes, the Pericets recall both Fanny Elssler, the famous 19th-century ballerina, in her Bolera solo "La Cachucha," and the Spanish divertissements of the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. The Bolera school, however, appears to have been unable to rival a dominant form like flamenco. The proof came again at 2 A.M. on Wednesday, when Farruquito, a 9-year-old prodigy, brought down a packed house with his flamenco heel work. At the end he glared at the audience and threw his jacket at the front row. Tradition was evident too in that the boy, Juan Fernandes Montoyo, was surrounded by his mother and aunts and then embraced his uncle and teacher, El Farruco, the patriarch of the gypsy clan that appeared on Broadway in "Flamenco Puro" in 1986. Not all Spanish traditions are looked upon benevolently. As the daughter of Spanish anarchist refugees, the French-born choreographer Maguy Marin had her anti-clerical say about the Spain of the Inquisition at the festival's opening-night gala on Saturday. In "Ay Dios," Kader Belarbi and Wilfried Romoli of the Paris Opera Ballet were each costumed like Christ on the Cross. The cross, however, was a rubber raft that each dancer inflated at the start with a pump. On the surface, the dancers' gestures were innocuous because each pose was taken from a sculpture or painting. But by speeding them up and making her figures mobile, Ms. Marin succeeded in her deliberate and mocking provocation. Choreographically, she came out with more of a sketch than a statement. Despite some scattered boos and a few protests made personally to him, Guy Darmet, the festival's adventurous artistic director, said he had refused to censor Ms. Marin and would never censor any artist he had invited. The real scandal of the gala was the sloppy dancing in excerpts from ballets on Spanish themes by visiting ballet stars, including Julio Bocca and his Argentine partner, Eleonora Cassano, and esecially an overweight Patrick Dupond of the Paris Opera Ballet. If the gala was a bust, the sheer range of this Biennial, budgeted at nearly $4 million, promises to be more than rich. Spaniards like to dance, as the Pericets recalled through the motto that hung in their kitchen when they were children: "He who does not dance, does not eat."

880-> Port Authority Asserts It Overpaid for Security
The Port Authority may have overpaid as much as half a million dollars over the last two years to a company that provides security services for the World Trade Center because the authority failed to properly monitor its contracts with the company, authority officials said yesterday. The overpayments to the security company, City Wide Security Services Inc. of Brooklyn, were disclosed the day after the authority said a cleaning company at the Trade Center was able to overcharge dozens of tenants because of a similar lack of scrutiny. The authority, which owns the Trade Center, said it had discovered the security overcharges through an internal review of overtime expenses, further underscoring management difficulties and oversight problems at the twin towers, one of the premier corporate addresses in Manhattan. Most of the overcharges resulted from the security company's billing the authority at a higher rate than was stipulated in its contract, the authority said. The problems at the Trade Center follow reports that the Port Authority had wasted millions of dollars in recent years on a major project at Kennedy International airport that was later scrapped. Top Officials Reassigned On Tuesday, the authority said dozens of tenants had been overcharged by a total of as much as $1 million over the last year for cleaning services provided by the Ogden Allied Services Corporation. Two top officials at the Trade Center have been reassigned, in large part because of the lax monitoring of the security and cleaning contracts. A woman who answered the telephone at City Wide Security's Brooklyn office yesterday afternoon said no one was available to discuss the matter. Repeated phone calls to the company's office in the Trade Center were not answered. David Hahn, a spokesman for Ogden Allied, which has cleaned the Trade Center since the mid-1980's, said the company had no comment on the authority's findings. There appear to be further management problems at the Trade Center that authority officials refused to discuss yesterday. In January, the Trade Center construction manager, John Urinyi, was reassigned as a result of an internal audit into construction services at the Trade Center, which are provided by another private concern. Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have declined to release or discuss the contents of that audit. With the Trade Center fighting to maintain its edge in a competitive real-estate market, the Port Authority moved yesterday to assure tenants that it would do a better job of supervising its cleaning services. In a memorandum sent to tenants, the authority said it would meet with them individually to examine their cleaning bills and listen to their concerns. "After discussions with the cleaning contractors, we are currently unable to determine, with any certainty, the actual amounts tenants may have been charged," the director of the Trade Center, Charles J. Maikish, wrote in the memo. "However, we are continuing our review of these charges." The Port Authority said it was still reviewing bills and logs to determine the extent of the overcharges. The authority signed a two-year, $5 million annual contract with City Wide Security in January 1989 to patrol the twin towers' doorways, stairwells, lobbies and offices. The contract, which was renewed last year for another year, is due to expire in December. Although an internal inquiry is continuing, Mr. Maikish estimated yesterday that over the last two years City Wide overcharged the Port Authority by $200,000 to $500,000. Mr. Maikish said the overcharges came largely through overtime. Although the contract specifies that City Wide charge the Port Authority its regular hourly rate if overtime is booked more than 24 hours in advance, City Wide frequently charged the authority time and a half, something the authority's oversight monitors should have, but did not, pick up, Mr. Maikish said. In most but not all cases, City Wide Security was believed to have paid its employees the same amount it charged the Port Authority. The authority said it intends to recoup all the lost money. "There was no windfall that we know of to City Wide," Mr. Maikish said. "I don't think it was anything vile." Several tenants at the Trade Center reacted with surprise yesterday to the authority's disclosure of the cleaning overcharges. Alex Smith, the administrative manager of facilities at the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, which occupies seven floors of the Trade Center, said he had not yet determined how much, if any, Ogden Allied had overcharged his firm. "At this point, we're trying to figure out what is going on," said Mr. Smith, whose company had contracted with Ogden Allied to provide cleaning services that were more frequent and more thorough than those offered through its lease with the Trade Center. Although Mr. Smith said he had never been told of the Port Authority's responsibility to monitor that contract, he said he was still satisfied with the authority's management of the Trade Center. "You have to sit back and say, in the overall scheme of the world, these buildings are huge in size," Mr. Smith said. "Given that, they are efficiently operated." Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority, stressed yesterday that the authority was moving quickly to improve its contract monitoring. He said the authority was drawing up new contract formats, imposing tighter controls on those contracts and reviewing contract terms more frequently. He also said the authority has withheld, in each of the last two months, 15 percent of its monthly payment to Ogden Allied in an effort to build a war chest that could reimburse tenants if the company refuses to do so. The authority also plans to bring in an outside consulting concern to overhaul the Trade Center's cost accounting system.

881-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Samba Ngo S.O.B.'s Most musicians who arrive here from Zaire via Paris play an enjoyable but limited style of soukous, the buoyant Congolese pop that joins rumba rhythms to airy, interlaced guitar lines. Samba Ngo, a guitarist and band leader who was born in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire), has hybridized soukous with more aggressive rhythms from Africa, the Caribbean and the United States. Mr. Ngo, who led an eight-member band at S.O.B.'s on Tuesday night, has come up with a world-beat hybrid that doesn't just tickle; it kicks. Mr. Ngo worked his way up through soukous bands and then, in Paris, with an African and Caribbean band called M'Bamina. He moved to California in 1986, and his current group sets the guitar traceries of soukous atop rhythms with the intricacy of African music and the kick of funk. In his early set, he announced his priorities with an extended introduction that was all rhythm, from percussive vocal sounds to level upon level of cross-rhythms with African hand drum, congas, maracas and trap drums, topped by Mr. Ngo himself, tooting a beer bottle. For the next song, Mr. Ngo switched to guitar, striking poses like Western rockers -- crouching to face the audience, his face working as he played -- while he picked out rounded but percussive lines with his thumb. The Afro-Cuban undercurrents of soukous remain in Mr. Ngo's songs, made more overt as one band member clicks out syncopations on claves; a second guitarist often plays arpeggiated soukous lines. But Mr. Ngo's songs are denser and more changeable than soukous; in the first set, each one used a different underlying beat or beats. One shifted between a rumba-based rhythm and a lunging reggae syncopation; one combined the scrubbing rhythm-guitar chords of disco, a popping funk bass line, the three-plus-two Latin clave rhythm, soukous guitar lines and a chorus of "alleluia." Some songs seemed to draw on bustling Nigerian juju or rolling South African township jive; one used a burst of punky guitar noise. And Mr. Ngo would share call-and-response vocals with band members or tease a guitar solo through the mesh of rhythms with a supple, leisurely sense of melody. Around the world, musicians are busily cross-breeding styles. But very few both honor their roots and transcend their sources to sound as vital and natural as Mr. Ngo's repertory does. Mr. Ngo released one album, "Introspection," on the Santa Cruz-based Elingo Productions label in 1990, but at S.O.B.'s his music was even stronger than his recordings suggest.

882-> Farr's Advice to Yankees: Get Cone and a Backup for Tartabull
Steve Farr sits in one corner of the Yankee clubhouse and is usually quiet and inconspicuous. The only time the reliable reliever finds himself in the forefront is when the Yankees need him to save a game in the ninth inning. But their 9-6 loss to the White Sox at Yankee Stadium last night was still hours away when Farr candidly expounded on the state of the Yankees. The 35-year-old veteran said he would like to see the club pursue David Cone, who will be a free agent, and seek a power-hitting outfielder because Danny Tartabull is too injury-prone and the team suffers when he is unable to play. "If this team can't afford it, what team can afford it?" said Farr. "I think this team is close to turning it around and this is the winter to do it. If not now, then it might not happen." When Farr speaks about Cone or Tartabull, he speaks from experience because he was a teammate of both when he played for Kansas City. Though it is probable the Yankees will pursue Cone, who is now a Blue Jay, it is doubtful they will pursue a slugger to back up Tartabull because they signed him to a five-year, $25.5 million contract in January to be the main force in their lineup. Still, Farr insisted a hitter was a priority because Tartabull has a record of getting injured. "You can't expect a guy who has been hurt four times out of five years not to get hurt when you sign him for five years," said Farr, who leads the Yanks with 26 saves and a 1.70 e.r.a. "You got to have a backup for him. When he's hurt, in that period we need someone." Often on the Disabled List Tartabull has actually landed on the disabled list five times in the past four years, including two stints this season. Despite missing 38 games, Tartabull leads the Yankees with 22 homers and 78 runs batted in and said last week in Baltimore that he expected to be looked over closely when he is injured. "I think it's fair if someone wants to call me injury-prone because it has happened before," said Tartabull. "Does it bother me? No. Because I have to do what Danny Tartabull can do for this ballclub." Farr, who played four seasons with Tartabull in Kansas City, has had lower-back trouble and claimed that he sympathized with Tartabull's back pain. But he wondered whether his teammate fully prepares his body for the rigors of a 162-game season. "I'm sure there are ways to get prepared better," Farr said. "He's one of those stiff players. I don't know if he does enough stretching or whatever to get ready." When Farr was asked whether he told Tartabull how he felt about preparing himself, he said it was not his "job" and doubted his teammate would listen anyway. Exercise Program in Sight Though Tartabull has said he begins working out in October to ready himself for spring training, Manager Buck Showalter revealed that the Yanks plan to put him on an exercise program for his aching lower-back this winter. Farr was skeptical. "The guy is going to do what he wants to do," Farr said. "He has done what he wants for the last five years. I'm the same way. They send me a weight program schedule and I file it." Unless he is traded or chosen by one of the National League expansion clubs in the November draft, Farr will be in the final year of a three-year Yankee contract in 1993. He wants to play for a winner and that is why he is candid about what he perceives as the team's weaknesses. "I think we could use some more pop in the lineup," Farr said. "It's hard to count on Tartabull for the full year because he gets hurt. You've seen what our lineup can do with and without Tartabull. We need another guy like him to do that when he is out." Has Talked to Cone Farr would also not mind saving games for Cone next season. He said he has spoken with Cone about playing for the Yanks, but slyly added it was merely a conversation between friends. "We've talked about things, but I can't tell Buck that or it would be tampering," Farr said. "Wouldn't it?" Joseph Molloy, the Yankees' managing partner, has conceded the Yankees would likely chase Cone and there is a possibility they will offer him a five-year deal. Cone could demand at least $5.5 million a season. "You have to be careful who you give your money to," Farr said. "Some people can't deal with getting booed or being in New York. I think he thrives on the New York stress. He likes the city. He digs it."

883-> Ulan Bator Journal; Mongols, Off Your Horses and Call Your Brokers!
There's something very suspicious about the telephones in the Mongolian Stock Exchange. They work. "Yeah, I had to pay a lot under the table to get phone lines to the provinces that work," admitted Naidansurengiin Zolzhargal, the 27-year-old chairman of the exchange. He grinned impishly when he was asked if he might get in trouble for paying bribes. "Fortunately, I'm a very good accountant," he said in fluent English. "The Ministry of Finance has checked my books three times, and they didn't find anything. I'm a better accountant than the Ministry of Finance." That kind of brashness raises eyebrows and tempers, but it also helps explain why everyone in a poor and remote country like Mongolia is suddenly talking about stock prices. As a result of a remarkable economic transformation under way here, a nation of herdsmen is becoming a nation of stockholders. Dividends for the Nomads When it abandoned Communist ideology in 1990, Mongolia decided to privatize about 80 percent of its factories and other businesses. That meant turning more than 500 state-owned companies into stock corporations, in a country in which "stock" normally refers to the cattle, sheep and other animals that outnumber the 2.1 million human beings 12 to 1. "We don't really know what a share is," Tumurtseren, a 53-year-old shepherd, said as he stood barefoot outside the white felt tent, or ger, in which he lives on the steppes of central Mongolia. Mr. Tumurtseren, who has never been to the capital, Ulan Bator, 250 miles to the northeast, has no electricity, no mailbox, and not much else except for 13 sheep, 2 horses and 4 cows. But these days Mr. Tumurtsuren is an investor. He, his wife and their seven children each bought shares in a nearby state farm, and he said they were hoping for a good dividend this year. Mr. Tumurtsuren, who like most Mongolians uses only one name, bought the stock with vouchers that have been given to every Mongolian man, woman and child. The privatization program is riddled with difficulties: how, for example, do you send dividend checks to the nearly half the population that is nomadic? Cupboards Are Bare Mongolia, a sparsely populated country between China and Russia, opened a stock exchange only in February. The economy is in a desperate crisis, with production plummeting and shop counters mostly empty, but officials hope that the new shares will give people a sense that they are benefiting from the birth of a market economy. The ruling party, formerly the Communist Party, introduced the privatization and says it will continue to carry it out after its overwhelming re-election late last month. Mr. Zolzhargal, the exchange chairman, chain-smokes Marlboros and drinks coffee from a N.Y.S.E. mug obtained on one of his three visits to the New York Stock Exchange. A thin, energetic man brimming with ideas, Mr. Zolzhargal occupies a beautiful third-floor office, with a gleaming new desk and bookcase, a complicated phone, a computer and an anteroom for his secretary, whose duties include washing his N.Y.S.E. mug. The office is among the nicest in Ulan Bator, but there is a bit of a mystery about how it got that way. The stock exchange is housed in a former cinema, just off Lenin Street, and an Austrian company did the refurbishing at a price of $4.5 million. But so far, the money has apparently not been paid, and there is some confusion about who if anyone intends to pay the bill. Part of the uncertainty arises because Mongolia's entire official foreign exchange reserves of $82.4 million were apparently wiped out after the central bank governor, Mr. Zolzhargal's brother, experimented in currency trading on the international markets. War With the Finance Minister Mr. Zolzhargal is scathing in his comments about the Finance Minister, Bazarkhuu -- "we're enemies, and it's a war going on between us" -- and says the Government would dismiss him if it did not desperately need him to create a capital market. He always seems close to resigning or being dismissed, but he refuses to modify his harsh opinions about the national leadership. "I'm earning 4,000 tugriks a month -- that's $15 -- and I'm working 18 hours a day," he said. "For $15 a month, I have to change my mind? Never!" The fundamental disagreement is about the pace of change. Mr. Zolzhargal argues that a rapid overhaul of the economy is essential, and he argues for more privatization and for allowing foreigners to invest in Mongolian stocks. The Government is more cautious. So far, about 20 percent of the vouchers have been turned in for stock, and the process is expected to be completed by next year. Bracing for Bankruptcies Partly because of the deepening economic crisis, many stockholders may find that their investments are not as profitable as they hope. Mr. Zolzhargal concedes that perhaps a third of the companies will go bankrupt, but he says it is essential to forge ahead with the restructuring to prevent the problems from getting worse. Mr. Zolzhargal has recruited a staff of 35 and is training 700 independent stockbrokers. While he frets that he is unable to spend time with his baby daughter, Mr. Zolzhargal brims with ideas -- for commodity trading, for currency dealing, for other financial instruments -- and he is exhilarated by the challenge of remaking an economy. "I'm only spending 30 minutes with my kid each day," he said. "That's not enough. But I have so many ideas! For example, I want to change the tax system."

885-> WATERGATE, THEN AND NOW; Lawsuit Over a Watergate Book Could Put Scandal Back in Court
They were a study in contrasts back in 1973. G. Gordon Liddy, the flamboyant former F.B.I. agent who led the Watergate break-in, stonewalled at naming co-conspirators in the scandal. John W. Dean 3d, the cool, button-downed counsel to Richard M. Nixon, gave damning testimony that linked the President to the cover-up. Because of a dispute between two crucial players in the Watergate scandal, the whole messy, darkly riveting drama of Watergate may be played again. In January, Mr. Dean and his wife, Maureen, filed a $150 million libel suit against Mr. Liddy and the authors and publishers of a 1991 book, "Silent Coup: The Removal of a President." The book, written by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, asserts that it was Mr. Dean who thought up the Watergate burglary and the cover-up and that Mrs. Dean had connections to a call-girl ring. David Kaye, general counsel for St. Martin's Press, which published the book, said that if the lawsuit comes to trial, "It would require a re-trial of everything that's happened in Watergate in a courtroom in California with all the participants under oath and able to be cross-examined." Mr. Liddy, the former Nixon campaign finance counselor who spent 52 months in prison after his burglary conviction, was gleeful about that prospect. In a telephone interview, Mr. Liddy contended that in his Watergate testimony Mr. Dean "lied and sent innocent people to jail." Mr. Dean himself went to jail for four months for obstruction of justice; he was released in 1975. Mr. Kaye said that after reading "Silent Coup," Mr. Liddy became convinced that its conclusions were correct. Mr. Liddy wrote an afterword to his 11-year-old best-selling memoir, "Will," also published by St. Martin's, praising the book, and repeated his praise on his radio talk show in Fairfax, Va. Neil Papiano, the Deans' lawyer, could not be reached for comment.

886-> FOOTBALL; One Sure Thing About Giants: There Is Definitely Room to Move Up
When the Giants play the Bears on Monday night in Chicago, they may take along something from Sunday's odd 34-28 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The question is whether it will be the sloppiness that enabled the Cowboys to build a 34-0 lead, or the aggressiveness and efficiency that allowed the Giants to score four second-half touchdowns in 17 minutes. "It was one of those games," said William Roberts, the Giants' offensive guard. "But you try to block it out and take a positive outlook. Hopefully, we can build on that second half. We know we can play when we settle down and play. Players here have won Super Bowls, so they know what it takes to win. "We're almost like a target. Teams have said if they beat the Giants, they're having a good season. We haven't had a lot of fun here lately. That's what we need to do, have fun. It will make everyone's life here easier." The Giants have lost their first two games of the season, to the San Francisco 49ers and the Cowboys, and they are 5-point underdogs against the Bears. "Basically, we brought this on ourselves," Roberts said. "If we let it get to us, we won't win. We're a very good team on paper. We haven't shown it yet. We're still 0-2, but some good things have come from that. We have pride. We're just in a rut now. We're trying to get out of it." To get out of it, the Giants must believe in themselves. "I think we believe," Roberts said, "but I don't know how much." Everson Walls, the Giants' safety-cornerback, spoke of an emotional carry-over. "But you don't need emotion to know this game is important for us," he said. "On Sunday, we put together a string of stops against a very good offensive team. Now we need to win. It doesn't matter who we're playing." 'Why Not Be Aggressive' Steve DeOssie, an inside linebacker, said he thought there would be positive carry-over. "Why not?" he said. "We got a little more aggressive in our calls. When you're that far behind, why not be aggressive? And it's about time we won a game." Coach Ray Handley agreed. "That's what we're aiming for," he said. "We're giving the players a plan that allows them to be aggressive on both sides of the ball." In a conference call from Chicago, Mike Ditka of the Bears, like all good coaches, spoke glowingly about his next opponent. "I think the Giants have lost to the two best teams in the conference," Ditka said. "They got behind early and had to change the way they do things. I think the way they played in the second half against Dallas will give them confidence." Walls agreed. "For once," he said, "there is optimism around the city, not just in the locker room. But it isn't worth anything unless you get positive results." EXTRA POINTS WILLIAM (BUD) FASSEL of Anaheim, Calif., the father of JIM FASSEL, the Giants' offensive coordinator, was killed Tuesday when the car he was driving spun off the road and overturned near Palm Springs, Calif. He was 73 years old. The elder Fassel was driving home from Las Vegas, Nev., where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of an Army friend. DONNY JONES, a public-affairs officer for the California Highway Patrol, said Fassel had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel. He said Fassel was thrown through the side window and was pronounced dead at the scene. Coach Fassel left the Giants on Tuesday night to be with his family. Coach RAY HANDLEY said he did not know when he would return, except that he would be in Chicago for Monday night's game against the Bears. In Fassel's absence, Handley is working with the offense and GEORGE SEFCIK, the wide receivers' coach, is taking on additional duties. A day after arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, defensive end LEONARD MARSHALL was back at Giants Stadium on Wednesday using a cane. Handley said Marshall would not play this week, but might be back for the game two weeks later against the Los Angeles Raiders. Despite damage in ERIK HOWARD's left knee, the nose tackle said he hoped to play against the Bears, but Handley listed him as doubtful. MARK COLLINS (sprained right knee) and MARK INGRAM (bruised left hip) took part in Wednesday's practice and ran afterward. CARL BANKS, fighting the flu, left practice early. COREY MILLER was excused for personal reasons. . . . The Cincinnati Bengals signed GARY REASONS, the inside linebacker waived by the Giants two weeks ago, to replace RAY BENTLEY, who is lost for the season with an injured knee.

887-> Young Mothers Try to Avoid a Lifetime on Welfare
"Being on welfare is kind of like thinking you can't do anything," she was saying. "You see women who've been on it for years. It makes them lazy. All they do is stay home watching the soaps." The harsh judgment came not from a conservative politician but from a 16-year-old unmarried mother of a 2-year-old girl, a school dropout, welfare recipient and prime candidate for years if not decades on the dole. The desire of the young woman, Brunilda Pantoja, to avoid a life on welfare is shared by the 50 teen-age mothers who attend classes at the Lutheran Settlement House in North Philadelphia. On the front lines of the new national drive to break welfare dependence, these teen-agers are in a new kind of program that aims, above all, to prepare them for jobs and self-sufficiency. They face some long odds. A Decade on Welfare Never-married women under 25 years old who have a child and go on welfare stay on it for an average of 10 years, studies show. And so, with reducing chronic dependence a prime goal of recent Federal and state laws, teen-age mothers are receiving a new burst of attention. In the past, efforts to help them emphasized parenting skills and basic education, in the assumption that most would spend many years at home tending their children. Now, dozens of new programs around the country, including this small one that is supported by a mix of public and private money, also offer training for the world of work in the hope, still unproved, that many more teen-age mothers can make decent livings on their own. But the tumultuous life stories of the teen-agers here cast a sobering shadow over glib proposals to replace welfare with work, and to fight poverty with restored family values. "These young people have so many interruptions," said Robin Ingram, coordinator of the Lutheran center's teen-age parent program. "Motherhood thrusts them into a world they aren't prepared for. And then they have more pregnancies, and so many family problems." Most of the girls and their children still live with their mothers, who are often single and on welfare themselves. Some have lost parents, or the fathers of their babies, to drug addiction, jail or gunfire. Simply by attending classes at the Lutheran center, which eases at least one problem by providing free day care, these young mothers show they may be more determined than most. Some were referred by social workers, others heard about the program from friends and some were referred by probation officers. Their first hurdle is the high school equivalency certificate, a prerequisite of most job-training programs. Passing the test means only a few months' study for some. But it poses an insurmountable obstacle for others who may get discouraged and quit, or enter a training program that does not require the diploma for work at places like restaurants or hotels. Most who get the diploma go on for vocational training or community college. But even that hardly insures the ultimate goal: work offering good enough wages and health benefits to justify giving up the security of welfare. "You can do all you can to get the young women ready for the labor market, but on the other side, there may not be employers sitting back awaiting teen mothers," said Milton J. Little Jr., a vice president of the Manpower Development Research Corporation, a not-for-profit institute based in New York. The institute is coordinating a training experiment for teen-age mothers, called New Chance, at 16 sites around the country, including the Lutheran center in Philadelphia. For many of the teen-agers, a caring and consistent environment is a welcome novelty. "It's not fun, but you like being here," said Frances Hutchins, 17, whose son is 10 months old. "If I weren't in this school, I'd be in the streets, getting into trouble." She said she enjoyed fixing hair and hoped to study cosmetology, training for work in a beauty shop. Unlike Expectations Many of the teen-agers had welcomed a baby as something that would be all their own. They got that, and more. "I was just thinking that everything was going to be fine, that everybody would help," said Lauren Higgins, 16, who has an 8-month-old girl. "It's not like that." Lisa Scott, 15, whose daughter is 16 months old, said, "When I had my baby, it was like my life just stopped." She said that she wanted to study to be a nurse's aide, or maybe a beautician. Ms. Scott, who lives with her mother, said she hoped to move into an apartment of her own in the next year or two. "I guess I'll be on welfare a year or so, while I get my life together and get a job," she said. "I want my daughter to go to a Catholic or a private school." Around the country, studies show, the main way that women get off welfare is marriage. These girls call that a laughable option. "Marriage?" Ms. Scott said. "I think never." "Guys think they own you," she said, adding that she had seen and received her share of physical abuse. "I don't want that for my daughter." Ms. Pantoja, who hopes to attend a community college and then to do paralegal work, said: "I won't marry, not the kind of guys that live around my way. All they do is stand around on the corner. If you have a child, do you think they care?" A second or third baby can derail the most determined student. "The men, or boys, just won't use birth control," said Carol Goertzel, director of women's projects at the Lutheran center. Many of the girls fear the pill and, uncomfortable with their own bodies despite their early sexual activity, find diaphragms repugnant, Ms. Goertzel said. Many of the fathers, she added, tell the girls not to get abortions. Parenting lessons are popular. So is a class in arts and crafts. On a recent day, several girls were engrossed in decorating T-shirts with glitter. 'Kids on the Inside' Asked what this had to do with job preparation, Ms. Ingram, the project coordinator, said: "Don't forget, they are really kids on the inside, but they don't have time to play. They need to do something for themselves and have fun." While it is too soon to evaluate the success rate of the program, now in its third year, Ms. Goertzel pointed to the case of a girl who had shown up homeless, and had a crack-addicted mother, but over two and a half years fought her way through a course in computerized accounting to a job. Ms. Goertzel said she worried that government agencies would give up on troubled teen-agers too quickly. "You can't expect people to turn their lives around in six months," she said. "You wouldn't expect your own child of 18 to achieve success in six months."

888-> Toyota Model Made in U.S. Is Offered for Sale in Japan
The Toyota Motor Corporation today introduced the Scepter station wagon, the company's first totally American-made import for sale in Japan. The car, which is known as the Camry wagon in the United States, is built by Toyota Manufacturing U.S.A. in Georgetown, Ky. Toyota describes the wagon, which has a price in Japan of about $24,000, as having all-American features like roominess and roof rails. The company has set a sales target of 700 units a month. The Scepter will face stiff competition from domestically produced models. But what Toyota fails to achieve in terms of the bottom line, it hopes to make up through improvements in its corporate image. Trying to Ease Trade Friction At a reception introducing the Scepter, Toyota made no secret of its hopes to emerge as a champion of American workers. An official read a congratulatory statement from Gov. Brereton Jones of Kentucky that hailed Toyota as an "exemplary corporate citizen." The company's president, Tatsuro Toyoda, said the Scepter should "increase imports from the United States, contribute to local industry there and promote greater partnership, considering the importance of U.S.-Japan relations." Importing the Scepter is part of Toyota's overall "international cooperation program" to ease trade friction. Under that program, Toyota plans to import a total of $1.4 billion in auto parts from the United States and to raise local production to $3.8 billion by 1994. The company is following the example of the Honda Motor Company, Japan's No. 3 auto maker after Toyota and Nissan. Honda now sells about 1,400 American-made cars a month in Japan. Countering the Stereotypes Japan has been under pressure to buy more American cars and auto parts, as automobiles account for about three-quarters of Japan's $43.4 billion trade surplus with the United States. Both Toyota and United States officials are emphasizing the quality of the Scepter and other American-made cars in an effort to reverse the image in Japan of American cars as overpriced, oversized gas guzzlers that quickly fall apart. But the officials were less eager to acknowledge the shaky prospects for expanding Japanese car sales, which have been shrinking in an economic slowdown. Car sales fell 3.9 percent last year, to 5.74 million vehicles. It was the first decline in 10 years. Since station wagons of Scepter's size are a relative novelty in Japan, the Scepter is being marketed as a recreational vehicle for the weekend driver who avoids making long commutes on busy roads.

889-> Authorities Are Pressing Search for More Suspects in Kidnapping of an Exxon Official
Law-enforcement officials are examining the past associations of the couple accused as kidnappers of Sidney J. Reso in the hope of finding someone who may have cooperated in the abduction and who may still be holding the 57-year-old president of Exxon International. Unless they find another suspect, the officials say, the prospects of finding Mr. Reso alive are remote. "With the suspects in custody, we now have 200 agents working on finding Mr. Reso," said Gary L. Penrith, special agent in charge of the Newark office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Our main hope is that there is a third party out there caring for him," he said. "But there's no doubt that as days go by, the hope that he is still alive grows dimmer, dimmer and dimmer. "But one thing is certain, we will never stop looking until we know exactly what happened to Mr. Reso," he said. Since their arrest, the two defendants have maintained their silence, heightening concerns about Mr. Reso's safety. Investigators, trying to follow the planning that went into the kidnapping, said today for the first time that ransom money was never delivered to the couple accused as kidnappers, Arthur D. Seale and his wife, Irene J. Seale, of Lebanon Township. On Thursday, investigators said, the Seales, who are both 45, choreographed a planned ransom drop using a series of telephoned instructions that moved agents posing as an Exxon executive and as Patricia Reso, the victim's wife, around parts of Morris, Somerset and Warren Counties for hours before the suspects were captured at a car-rental agency in Hackettstown after Mr. Seale dropped off one of the cars the couple rented over the last seven weeks. Avoided Roadblock During that evening both Mr. and Mrs. Seale had been spotted by agents who were among the 100 "telephone teams" waiting near pay phones over a 15-mile area around Morristown, Mr. Penrith of the F.B.I. said. Mr. Seale apparently became "spooked and bolted" when he approached a police roadblock shortly before midnight, he said. The roadblock was set up because of a fire, but Mr. Seale did a U-turn and drove off, the authorities said. He also broke off communications and issued no more instructions about where the ransom was to be dropped, Mr. Penrith said. The carefully timed series of contacts between the kidnappers and F.B.I. agents on Thursday was not the first time that agents responded to directives from the kidnappers. On Sunday, May 3, five days after the kidnapping, agents drove to a restaurant about a 30-minute drive from the Resos' home in Morris Township in response to telephoned instructions from the kidnappers. They were told to await a telephone call for further instructions, but no call came. Mr. Penrith said it might have been a rehearsal to time part of the route of the ransom delivery demanded last Thursday. Officials have said the ransom demanded for Mr. Reso's return was $18.5 million, a figure that puzzled them until they came up with a theory to link it to the case. A month before the kidnapping, the Rockwell International Corporation had pleaded guilty to mishandling poisonous wastes at the Rocky Flats nuclear bomb plant near Denver and agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million.Newspaper articles said the fine was the second largest ever in an environmental case, after the $25 million fine Exxon agreed to pay in the Alaskan oil-spill case. The initial ransom demand note was signed by the Rainbow Warriors, a reference to the name of a ship owned by Greenpeace, the environmental organization. Investigators said the Seales wrote the note, apparently thinking the demand would be readily accepted by Exxon in light of the Rockwell case. At a bail hearing on Monday for Mr. and Mrs. Seale, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, Michael Chertoff, said newspaper articles, journals and a manual that dealt with kidnappings of corporate executives were found in Mr. Seale's bedroom along with a book on money laundering and a list of overseas banks in Switzerland and Pakistan.

890-> The Rabbi at Sing Sing Tends an Isolated Flock
The iron gates of the prison swung open and a stern-looking correction officer broke into a smile. "Shalom, Rabbi," he said, and waved Irving Koslowe, the rabbi of Sing Sing, inside. It was bagels and lox at "the Big House," as the maximum-security prison overlooking the Hudson River here is often called. On a recent gray Sunday morning, Rabbi Koslowe, a 72-year-old Orthodox rabbi, had brought visitors to eat brunch with what some might consider the most cloistered Jewish community in the country. Out of 2,200 inmates at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, about 30 are Jewish. For the last 42 years, Rabbi Koslowe has been visiting this congregation, which includes murderers, rapists and embezzlers, at least once a week. It is one of the few in the world, he has often said, "that does not mind losing members." Rabbi Koslowe's mission has been to keep the inmates in touch with Jewish people outside of Sing Sing, whom social workers say often find it shameful and difficult to believe that there are Jews in prison. In turn, he also tries to help the inmates strengthen their own ties to the Jewish faith. Seniority at Sing Sing "People ask me what I'm doing, bringing matzoh ball soup to a bunch of killers," Rabbi Koslowe said. "But maybe we can make some change. Maybe we can bring some good in their life. Some of the guards would say I'm crazy, but I do what I can do. "If I can have an inmate come into the chapel, put on a yarmulke and worship, I think that shows there's a positive change in behavior, a real step forward." Rabbi Koslowe has been carrying out his duties longer than anyone else at the prison, inmate or employee. "He is an institution here, no question about that," said Brant Kehn, the deputy superintendent. "He really cares about his flock. He speaks up for them and he really goes all out." The percentage of Jews in the New York State correctional systems is estimated at less than 2 percent. It appears to be a substantial drop from five decades ago, when Jewish involvement in organized crime, like the Brooklyn group Murder Inc., was reaching its final days. When Rabbi Koslowe began, he expected to stay only a few years. He took the job because he had a wife and two children to support. In 1950, the rabbi tended to about 170 Jewish inmates. Over the next 13 years, until New York State declared a moratorium on the death penalty, he walked 17 inmates to the electric chair, including Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of conspiring to give United States military information to the Soviet Union. More Room for Religion Rabbi Koslowe, who lives in Mamaroneck and is retired from a congregation there, would not answer questions about whether the Rosenbergs or others were guilty or deserved the death penalty. "My job," he said, "was to be there for them, and none of them ever asked me to leave. Anything they said to me was in confidence." In the ensuing decades, the rabbi has witnessed something of a revolution in attitudes toward the practice of religion in prisons. In the 1950's, Jewish inmates did not have their own chapel; the ark holding the Torah was rolled onto a stage in the auditorium; the inmates did not have seders the first two nights of Passover. In the 1960's and 1970's, sparked by protests and lawsuits, the correctional system provided greater freedom to inmates to practice their religions. Now, for Jewish inmates, the state prison system offers a kosher kitchen at one prison, Green Haven Correctional Facility. And there were Passover seders in prisons throughout the state. A week ago Sunday at Sing Sing, the Muslim inmates had just finished their celebrations of Ramadan. The Christian inmates were walking around with stalks of palm in celebration of Palm Sunday. As Rabbi Koslowe led a somewhat anxious group of visitors, members of his Mamaroneck congregation, through the prison, he warned them to stay close together and to walk near the wall so that they would not be jumped. Inmates, whom they passed, nodded at him, occasionally shaking his hand. Guards called out cheerfully, "Hey Rab!" "It's the rabbi!" and "You planning to stay for good this time?" In the prison synagogue, known as the Peace and Hope Chapel, the inmates had draped well-worn prayer shawls over their prison greens and donned yarmulkes. When Rabbi Koslowe delivered his pre-Passover sermon, one that he had given many times over the years, the inmates listened intently. "Certainly, if any people are to understand freedom, it is you who are here," the Rabbi told them. "But this isn't just a holiday of freedom; it also speaks of the burden of obligation." Passover, he said, is not only the story of the Jews escaping slavery in ancient Egypt, but of them receiving a "yoke of responsibility," the Ten Commandments. "Only if you feel that responsibility, have you celebrated," he said. In the years to come, he added, he hoped that they could once again celebrate the holiday with family. At that, one voice called out loudly, "Amen." After the service, the Jewish inmates and visitors mingled around a buffet table. Several of the inmates said that, thanks to Rabbi Koslowe, they had rediscovered their Judaism. "This is a refuge from the madness," said one inmate, who spoke on condition of anonymity and would only say that his crime had something to do with cocaine. While he had a bar mitzvah and had celebrated the High Holy Days as a child, he said that he had strayed from Judaism. "Now I observe the Sabbath," he said. "I had never done that before. I'm learning about Judaism and my identity. And I get a bagel every now and then." Passover, he said, was a time of tremendous loneliness and homesickness, for which Rabbi Koslowe and the visitors offered a brief respite. "This helps to see them here," he added. "A lot of Jews are surprised to learn we're here. I think they're ashamed of us -- they think we should have done better."

891-> Noisy Night Life
To The Home Section: Your reporter James Servin obviously bought the whole public relations package for his piece on Industria [ "Studio! Life Style! Empire?" April 16 ] . What he fails to mention about this operation that is photo studio by day and occasional disco by night is that those Studio 54-style parties with thousands of guests carrying on until 4 A.M. have residents of this otherwise quiet neighborhood up in arms. Rock and rap groups blast at top decibels within this vast hangarlike space totally devoid of soundproofing, with bass lines rattling windows for blocks while stretc limos and taxis create horn-blowing traffic jams along Washington and 12th Streets. Industria may be a haven for Isabella Rossellini and her child by day. But on party nights, those who live within sight and sound of this former auto-repair shop can prepare ourselves for a night without sleep. HELMUT KOENIG New York

892-> On China: Beyond All or Nothing
Very soon, President Bush is expected to renew China's favorable trade status for one more year despite Beijing's horrendous abuses of human rights. Before he does, he should consider a clever new proposal for using selective trade sanctions to advance human rights. This fine-tuned approach was proposed by Holly Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch in a Times Op-Ed article this week. It would smartly sidestep the all-or-nothing trap that doomed past Congressional efforts to pressure China by putting conditions on all trade. If adopted by the President and Congress, it could rebuild consensus on China policy and restore Washington's squandered bargaining power with Beijing. Despite Americans' horror over Beijing's 1989 massacre of democracy demonstrators, its continuing political persecutions and fierce repression of minorities, Congressional efforts to attach human rights conditions to China's trading status have repeatedly fallen short. A key reason was legislative overreach. Human rights advocates have tried to restrict trade severely unless unrealistic conditions were met, like the release of all political prisoners. Sobered by successive setbacks, some rights advocates now favor a more narrowly calibrated approach. And the Bush Administration, at least in reacting to commercial abuses, has shown itself willing to threaten selective penalties. Put selective sanctions and human rights together, and America can constructively assert its influence on behalf of liberty. Ms. Burkhalter proposes threatening China with tariff increases against selected products unless it agrees to release a significant number of political prisoners, respect basic religious freedoms and open its prisons and labor camps to international inspection. The longer Beijing resists, the higher tariff penalties could go. There's reason to hope threats alone might produce results. When Washington threatened selective tariff reprisals for patent and copyright violations last year, Beijing responded with reforms. China has also made limited human rights gestures to influence the trade debate. If it did become necessary to apply penalties, Ms. Burkhalter notes, these could be aimed at exports like silk, cashmere or petroleum-related products that are mainly produced by state companies, thus preserving steps toward entrepreneurial reform in China. The selective sanctions approach would restore honor to American policy by supporting human rights in China. It follows tactics the Bush Administration has already used on the patent and copyright issue. And it offers considerable likelihood of success while maintaining strong ties with China. The White House and Congress would do well to embrace and refine Ms. Burkhalter's proposal.

893-> Watergate, Then and Now
Twenty years ago this week, on June 17, 1972, burglars broke into the office of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel and set off the political shock waves that finally brought down President Richard M. Nixon two years later. Today the names of the Watergate figures still evoke powerful memories of that turbulent time. Haldeman. Sirica. Dean. Liddy. Almost all are still living and most are still living and most are still active, some in new careers to replace the one broken by scandal. Many questions about the scandal are still alive, too. What were the burglars seeking? Who was "Deep Throat," the source for the explosive disclosures published in The Washington Post? Did Mr. Nixon know a burglary was being planned? And what caused the 18 1/2-minute gap in teh tape of a conversation between Mr. Nixon and H.R. Haldeman three days after the break-in? Students of the scandal, including some participants and investigators, now tend to agree on some likely answers. Articles, pages A14 and A15.

894-> Tutu Urging Olympics Ban on Pretoria
As President F. W. de Klerk cut short a foreign visit to deal with one of the worst political crises of his tenure, a leading human rights advocate questioned today whether South Africa should be allowed to compete in the Olympic Games after the Boipatong massacre last week. Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said his country's invitation to the Olympics -- the first after 32 years of banishment over the policy of apartheid -- should be revoked unless the Government moves quickly to catch and prosecute the Boipatong killers or accepts new controls on the police. The proposal by Archbishop Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in Southern Africa, is sure to spread real alarm among sports-crazy, rank-and-file South Africans, who have looked to the Barcelona Games next month as their country's real re-entry into the embrace of the civilized world. "Those who choose to insulate themselves from the suffering and grief caused by this horrific slaughter must realize they cannot have both a Boipatong and a Barcelona," the Archbishop said at a memorial service in Cape Town for the estimated 40 residents who were shot and hacked to death in the Southern Transvaal township last Wednesday night. De Klerk Is in Spain The Government announced today that Mr. de Klerk, who is in Spain to meet with government leaders and business executives, would return home on Wednesday, a day ahead of schedule, to contend with accusations of indifference or outright complicity by his Government. Mr. de Klerk's wife, Marike, is to stay on in Spain to open a South African exhibit at the Expo 92 exhibition in Seville on Wednesday. President de Klerk was hounded out of Boipatong by an angry crowd on Saturday, and later hinted that his Government was considering imposing a state of emergency to contain township violence. The African National Congress is to meet on Tuesday to consider withdrawing from negotiations aimed at creating a nonracial democracy. The talks have been deadlocked since mid-May over how much power should be left to the white minority, and last week Nelson Mandela, the president of the African National Congress, began an open-ended pressure campaign of rallies, marches and strikes to press its demand for majority rule. Mr. Mandela said Sunday that the massacre had demolished the slight remaining trust between the Government and its negotiating partners. "I can no longer explain to our people why we continue to talk to a government which is murdering our people," Mr. Mandela said at a rally in Evaton, a township near the massacre site. A congress official said tonight that while his organization was still committed to ending white rule through negotiations rather than violence, "it's beginning to seem that these talks are not the way." One option, the official said, would be to pull out of the current multilateral talks and demand that all the remaining issues of South Africa's future be thrown to an elected constituent assembly. The South African police announced tonight that they had arrested five men in connection with their investigation of the massacre, though no specific charges have been filed. The men were residents of the Kwamadala Hostel, a dormitory compound owned by the former state steel monopoly and now a stronghold of the conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Boipatong residents assert that the hostel was the staging area for the killings. Arrests Will Aid de Klerk The police have been stung by allegations that they colluded in the massacre, and the arrests will provide Mr. de Klerk some basis to argue that his Government is pursuing the case. Nothing is quite so certain to drive the issue home to ordinary South Africans, however, as the threat of being once again ostracized from the world sporting community. In addition to Archbishop Tutu's challenge to the country's Olympic euphoria, South African professional athletic organizations are expected to meet sometime this week to consider other responses to the Boipatong killings. Some athletes were reported to favor voluntarily withdrawing from international competitions, or banning the participation of athletes affiliated with army and police sporting clubs.

895-> We're Solvent, Citicorp Says
The chairman of Citicorp, John S. Reed, today strongly denied the recent contention by Ross Perot that the banking group was insolvent. "We are demonstrably not insolvent," Mr. Reed told a news conference in Hong Kong. He characterized the undeclared Presidential candidate's remarks as an "uncareful choice of words." "We're going to have a good year," Mr. Reed said, citing the bank's $183 million in net earnings for the first quarter of 1992 after last year's $750 million restructuring charges. He declined to estimate second-quarter earnings but said that by the end of the fourth quarter Citicorp expected to be back to normal earnings. Mr. Reed said that by the end of the year the bank's capital-to-assets ratio would be about 9 percent, up from 6.6 percent in 1990 and comfortably above the minimum capital reserve requirement of 8 percent set by the international banking regulator, the Bank for International Settlements. But he said he expected loan losses to be high in the second half of the year, though less than in the first half, as real estate losses had reached a plateau. Mr. Reed said Citicorp had acted more quickly than would normally be expected in writing off problem assets. "But there's nothing normal about banking in the United States today," he added. "You simply have to be seen as aggressively addressing problems."

897-> TOWARD THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT; From Deep in the Soviet Files, Facts, Footnotes, Even (Maybe) Real History
Like other post-totalitarian societies before it, Russia has fallen heir to a vast trove of secrets from a fallen dictatorship, a legacy as intriguing and instructive as it is deeply troubling. Almost daily the dark secrets trickle out: a plea from the censors that they need new equipment to monitor the modems and faxes of foreign correspondents, an order from the Central Committee to arm Palestinian terrorists or to send money to the Polish Communist Party as recently as October 1990. But with the sensationalism come painful questions that go to the heart of a newly liberated society's relationship to its past. Might the information prove more damaging than enlightening? Can a society only just emerging from bondage cope with the full weight of its past, in particular with the identification of its tormentors? Finally, is there anything really new that people who have lived in this world can learn from the archives? Presenting Secrets to the Public "We think that when we open these documents, we'll learn things we never knew," said Rudolf G. Pikhoya, a history professor who as head of Russia's Committee on Archival Affairs has responsibility over all the files of the old Soviet state. "But when we look we find we know it all, and lots that we don't want to know." Even as the debate goes on, however, the secrets come out. This week, an exhibit of 300 documents from all periods of the Soviet state opens at the Library of Congress in Washington. They range from a desperate plea for life from the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin, soon to be shot in the Great Purge, to a report by the Novosti press agency on its efforts to counter the award of the Nobel Prize to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, to a report from the K.G.B. outlining serious construction flaws in the Chernobyl nuclear power station, seven years before one reactor there erupted. Picture Is Still Far From Complete James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, said in an interview that this exhibit was meant to amplify aspects of Soviet history, but he acknowledged that specialists were unlikely to find anything startling. Mr. Billington, a scholar of Russian history, said he believed that in earlier years Soviet leaders like Molotov destroyed important documents and that others like Stalin were not in the habit of putting their more controversial actions in writing. In addition, the K.G.B. so far has been reticent about fully opening its archives; the full Foreign Ministry archives also have not been made available. In Moscow, a Constitutional Court hearing against the Communist Party has opened cracks in the most current and secret of archives, the Special File (Osobaya Papka) of the Central Committee. The pickings will not be unrestricted: Mr. Pikhoya and the Minister of Press and Mass Information, Mikhail N. Poltoranin, told a news conference last week that documents of the past 30 years will be screened for state secrets or violations of privacy. But several documents on exhibit at the Center for the Preservation of Contemporary Documents, at the old Central Committee Archive, give provocative glimpses. The Omnipresent Communist Party In one document dated July 7, 1986, two months after the Chernobyl accident, the Central Committee advises against sending representatives to a conference convened by the industrialist Armand Hammer in order not to reveal certain Soviet materials. Another, from August 1990, suggests that party workers should start paying something for the food supplied by the K.G.B. There are about 4.5 million such papers in the Special File, the officials said, and what becomes abundantly clear from them is confirmation that the Communist Party, almost from the outset, tried to control every last corner of life in the Soviet Union. A letter from Lenin to Stalin in July 1922 orders the immediate deportation of a whole list of perceived enemies: "Let's purge Russia for a long while!" writes the Bolshevik chief. In 1976, Yuri V. Andropov reports on the rise of "antisocial elements" under the guise of dissidents, and in 1989, with glasnost in full bloom, the Politburo is still railing against Komsomolskaya Pravda for its "anti-Soviet" stance. What May Never Be Known It is arguable, however, that such facts only give texture to a broad truth about Communist rule that has long been known. Many of the true mysteries of the 70 years of Communist rule may never become known. For one thing, the K.G.B., scaled down and renamed the Russian Ministry of Security, has divulged only a few select files and shows no intention of giving out "operational" information or naming any informers. For example, nothing the K.G.B. has disbursed puts to final rest questions about the fate of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who disappeared in Soviet captivity. Nothing reveals whether Stalin himself ordered the death of Sergei Kirov, the Leningrad party chief whose assassination gave the starting signal for the Great Purge. Kirov's personnel file simply ends: "Perished by the hand of an enemy of the working class." Rem A. Usikov, director of the Center for the Preservation of Contemporary Documents, said Mr. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, had specifically requested evidence that Stalin had ordered Kirov killed. 100 Million Files Mr. Pikhoya, the history professor, further noted that K.G.B. files were periodically purged, and he acknowledged that some were probably destroyed or stolen in the nine months since the failed August coup. Some, he said, had turned up in the press abroad. A greater obstacle is the sheer volume. Like other totalitarian regimes, the Communist state believed it would live for a thousand years, so it smugly accumulated mountains of paper for its anointed to study, never suspecting that the "ideological foe" would get there so soon. By conservative estimates the Central Committee archives embrace more than 100 million files, said Mr. Usikov, a veteran of three decades in the archives. "Everything was decided here, so there's a file on everything," he said. Another problem is that Russia still has no law on state secrets. Shortly after the Soviet state was dissolved, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree on the protection of state secrets. But, read literally, the decree would leave all former seals intact. That has left it largely up to the archivists to decide what to reveal and what not to. Many Ask: What Is the Point? There is also no law on freedom of information, similar to those in Czechoslovakia or Germany giving citizens the right to see information on themselves. The most difficult question, however, is neither technical nor legal. As the Russians discovered when Stalin died, or the Germans after Hitler fell, a society reacts in complex ways to its past. Many simply want to forget and get on with life. The painful fact is that the Soviet state and its political police worked incessantly to co-opt society into its repressive apparatus, and not many Russians or institutions can say they were untouched by the evil. For people reared in this society, moreover, many of the "secret" documents are only painful echoes of a world they knew too well -- the oppressive directives, the double-speak of Pravda, the marathon lies at Communist congresses, the bloated flattery of corrupt dictators. The Market Value of Secrets Beguiling, troubling, the files are also potentially dangerous. So long as the files remain largely closed, the temptation to leak information for money or for political reasons remains great. One notable example has been the leak of reports that three senior Russian Orthodox bishops had code-names and were listed as agents by the K.G.B. Critics of the church used these documents to demand that the Church purge its ranks and publicly repent. Defenders of the clerics argue that the documents by themselves show only what everyone knew, that the Church and the K.G.B., through its Council for Religious Affairs, were locked in a permanent struggle. So, to disclose or not to disclose? "After the coup, in August, in September, I firmly believed it was better not to release documents" that named people, said Mr. Pikhoya, the professor. "It was simply too dangerous politically. Now I fear that to open or close the files are elements of political struggle, so we need either to totally close or totally open the files. "There's no ideal solution."

898-> California Legislature Passes Budget With Big Cuts
The two-month-long fiscal crisis in California has moved closer to conclusion with the passage of an austere recession-era budget package that cuts deeply into health and welfare services and state support for colleges, cities and counties. The State Assembly passed the main $57 billion budget bill on Saturday evening after an impassioned speech by Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. urging colleagues to pass the bill even though it closely resembled the no-new-taxes budget favored by his main political rival, Gov. Pete Wilson. The State Senate had passed the measure by a wide margin early Saturday after its Democratic leaders reached an accord with the Republican Governor. The vote in the Democratic-controlled Assembly was much closer: with a two-thirds vote necessary for passage, the budget passed, 54 to 23. Though the Assembly has not yet acted on the crucial bills that would carry out spending cuts necessitated by the budget, the votes appeared to signal the end of the budget impasse that has all but paralyzed the state government and threatened the poor and disabled with loss of health care and other services. The Assembly planned to take up the bills late today. Cutting Aid to Cities Unable to bridge a $10.7 billion budget gap, the state has been paying its bills with i.o.u.'s since July 1, and many health programs for the poor and old are on the verge of closing. The new budget would cut $1.3 billion from the $2.9 billion that the state would have normally given to cities, counties and special fire-fighting and other districts; reduce money for regional centers for the retarded; cut support for the University of California and the California State University systems by $402 million; double fees at community colleges, and delay the opening of two new prisons. It would maintain support for public schools, but only with complex bookkeeping acrobatics devised by Governor Wilson that "recapture" $1.1 billion in excess money paid to schools last year and then "lend" them money from future years for this year. The schools would be expected to repay the money in better times. This measure is bitterly opposed by teachers' unions and school administrators. Isolated by the agreement between the Senate leadership and Governor Wilson, the 80-member Assembly yielded out of frustration and weariness.

904-> U.S. Solar Sensor Is Launched by Chinese Rocket
A big Chinese rocket roared into orbit yesterday, carrying an advanced American-built sensor that is expected to help electric power producers around the world avert blackouts caused by storms on the Sun. The $1.2 million instrument, built at the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, was given a free ride into space on a Swedish satellite named Freja, which also carried instruments from Sweden, Canada, France and Germany. Sweden offered Johns Hopkins space on its satellite in return for access to data the instrument collects. The satellite was launched by a Long March 2-C rocket from Jiuquan in the Gobi Desert. Dr. Lawrence J. Zanetti, leader of the Johns Hopkins group that built the Magnetic Field Experiment, said in an earlier interview the instrument would trigger a warning the instant a major disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere begins. Timely warning will permit power companies to take steps to prevent blackouts like the one that knocked out electricity throughout Quebec on March 13, 1989, an incident that also caused $8 million in damage to the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jersey and damaged other plants across North America. Magnetic storms begin when the Sun blasts electrically charged nuclear particles into space toward the Earth. A few of the speediest particles reach the Earth in about eight minutes, but most of the lower-energy particles, traveling at speeds up to 590 miles per second, take 2 to 12 days. When they reach the Earth, they not only produce spectacular auroral displays but also deform the Earth's magnetic field. "It's as if a huge metal mallet were striking the Earth's magnetosphere," said Dr. Thomas Potemra, a lead designer of the project. The shifting of the magnetic field caused by this particle shower induces electrical current in the Earth's crust, and when this current interacts with electricity passing through power lines, it causes surges. Such disruptions can make entire power distribution grids crash if operators do not respond quickly, and this can cause widespread blackouts and damage to equipment. Among the many possible consequences is the disabling of control systems at nuclear power plants. Magnetic storms also disrupt global radio and telephone communications. The Swedish satellite was carried into orbit along with a much larger Chinese military reconnaissance satellite. After both satellites reached an orbit extending to 197 miles above the Earth, Freja's rockets were fired to boost the Swedish satellite to an elliptical orbit over the Earth's poles, ranging in altitude from 375 to 970 miles. The satellite is being tracked by an arctic station near Kiruna, Sweden. The Chinese satellite is designed to return to Earth in about two weeks, but Johns Hopkins scientists expect the Freja satellite to operate for about two years, during which the Magnetic Field Experiment, similar in principle to the magnetometers used at airports to detect concealed weapons, will collect information about the effects of solar storms on the Earth's magnetic field. Although the experiment will offer only a few minutes' warning, it can help power operators make emergency decisions. Ordinarily, automatic safety locks close down individual power plants when they detect surges, but when whole power networks are affected by solar storms, operators must override safety devices to keep power.

909-> 1858 Debates: No Makeup, No Moderator
When the most famous of all great election debates took place in 1858, they had a kindlier name: joint discussions. There was no panel of journalists nor even a single moderator. And they were for United States Senator, not President. The abrasive issues surrounding Abraham Lincoln and and his opponent, Senator Stephen Douglas -- popular sovereignty, local self-government, obedience to the Supreme Court's ruling on slavery in the Dred Scott case, Union versus a House Divided over the extension of slavery into new territories -- clearly demanded discussion in the press and in person. So Lincoln and Norman B. Judd, chairman of the Illinois Republicans' central committee, proposed a series of joint discussions. As the underdog, Lincoln asked Douglas "to divide time, and address the same audiences during the present canvass." Fearing that the Republicans would term a rejection cowardice, Douglas promptly accepted and named seven of the nine Congressional districts -- Ottawa, Freeport, Jonesboro, Charleston, Galesburg, Quincy and Alton -- for the meetings. Both had previously spoken in Chicago and Springfield, the two other districts in the state. This was the agreed-upon format: seven debates over a three-month period, opening speeches one hour, replies an hour and a half, rebuttal by the first speaker a half hour. Lincoln the lawyer could not refrain from writing Douglas, "Although, by the terms, as you propose, you take four openings and closes to my three , I accede, and thus close the arrangement." Pageantry and Politics There was no hiding behind studio lecterns, no "Larry King Live," no World Series conflicts; it was one on one, rain or shine, without makeup or microphones. The average audience was 10,000 or more, no tickets, first come, first closer to the platform. Some people came for the pageantry, yet the big turnouts spoke well for citizens willing to stand and listen to three hours of political talk. At the first joint discussion in Ottawa, 12,000 people stood in a scorching August sun to hear the candidates. Their words were recorded by "phonographic," or shorthand, reporters, the beginning of this method of newspaper coverage. The discussions, including heckling, were also hot. The pro-Lincoln Chicago Tribune said that the debate "gave greater satisfaction to our side." The headline in the pro-Douglas Chicago Times went: "Lincoln's Heart Fails Him! Lincoln's Legs Fail Him! Lincoln's Tongue Fails Him! Lincoln's Arms Fail Him! LINCOLN FAILS ALL OVER!" At the same time that the candidates discussed the issues, there were personal recriminations, mainly among supporters but also between the debaters. Douglas told a crowd that Lincoln was once a storekeeper who sold whiskey; Lincoln, who did not drink or smoke, scored a hit by saying that he had left his side of the bar long ago but that Douglas still imbibed. People who could not attend could instead read the texts of the debates. "Lincoln is a Perpendicular Pronoun," said an Iowa paper, noting that Lincoln had used "I" more times than Douglas. The candidates also inspired poets in the press: Hurrah! Hurrah! from the hill and valley, Hurrah! from the prairie wide and free, 'Round our glorious leader rally, for Lincoln and for liberty! The debaters went deep into the wellsprings of liberty in the language of the Constitution. Why was slavery not mentioned openly by the Founding Fathers? Where were the words "slavery" or "Negro"? Douglas saw this as justification for his views, but Lincoln took a longer look: "It was hoped when it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men, after the institution of slavery had passed from among us, there should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as Negro slavery had ever existed among us." In the final debate, in Alton on Oct. 15, 1858, Lincoln summed up the months of talking in these prescient words: "I have said and I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced and ought not to be with us. "Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union save and except this very institution of slavery? That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles -- right and wrong -- throughout the world." On Election Day, Nov. 2, 1858, Lincoln's total vote was 125,430 to Douglas's 121,609. Yet Lincoln did not gain the seat because the legislature, not the voter, determined who went to the Senate, a situation that prevailed until the Constitution was amended in 1913. And when the Illinois legislature balloted the first week in January, Douglas received the 54 Democratic votes and Lincoln the 46 Republican. Still, the widely followed debates had a tremendous impact. Even in defeat, Lincoln emerged as the Republican from the West, a man of national stature and a possible Presidential candidate. Strangely, not one photograph is known to exist of the Lincoln-Douglas joint discussions in the seven towns. But their campaign expenses are known: Douglas spent $50,000; Lincoln, about $1,000. In other words, not enough to buy a moment or two of prime time.

910-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Religion in Politics; Southern Baptist Team of Democrats Represents a New Strain of the Church
At first it seemed a mere curiosity: in Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the Democratic Party was fielding the first Presidential ticket in history with two Southern Baptists. Then the Republicans declared their party the guardian of traditional values and sought to rebuild an alliance with the religious right, and the Democrats' religion took on new significance. Any plan to portray the Democratic candidates as alien to churchgoing America has met at least a medium-sized snag in their undeniable church ties. But just how the religious factor will eventually play out in the campaign, or what clues it provides to the challengers' characters or politics, is far from clear because Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are a new and different strain of Southern Baptist. In Different Baptist Mold Unlike the last Southern Baptist Presidential candidate, Jimmy Carter, whose forthright piety made many Americans uneasy, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore do not speak of being born again and having their hearts cleansed by Jesus. And in many of their social views they are closer to the liberal Protestant churches than to the 15-million-member Southern Baptist Convention, controlled for more than a decade by leaders determined to uphold the literal reading of the Bible. But for all their differences with the Southern Baptist Convention and other religious conservatives on issues like abortion, homosexual rights and public financing of the arts, the two Democrats are not shy about invoking their religious roots. Their speeches at the Democratic National Convention in July were marbled with Biblical references. Their emotional personal narratives -- Mr. Clinton's about his troubled childhood, Mr. Gore's about the automobile accident that nearly killed his 6-year-old son -- echoed Baptists' testimonials about how they found salvation. The Clinton campaign turned down requests for an interview on the candidate's religion, though Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, spoke recently about her own commitment to the Methodist Church. "Daily prayer and reflection -- I'm not totally faithful to it but I try -- has been tremendously important to me in some pretty tough times," she said. Mr. Clinton has said that as a child, he felt a strong need to attend church, although his parents did not go. After high school he became an "erratic churchgoer," he told U.S. News & World Report this summer. But in November 1980, shortly after his defeat for a second term as governor, he became a member of Immanuel Baptist Church, the most prominent congregation in Little Rock, and began singing in the choir. When he is in Little Rock he attends services there nearly every Sunday; on the road campaigning, he goes to other churches, sometimes non-Baptist ones. Mr. Clinton spoke at length about his faith in a television interview this summer ago on VISN, an interdenominational religious cable network, putting it this way: "My faith tells me that all of us are sinners, and each of us has gone in our own way and fallen short of the glory of God. Religious faith has permitted me to believe in my continuing possibility of becoming a better person every day. If I didn't believe in God, if I weren't, in my view, weren't a Christian, if I didn't believe ultimately in the perfection of life after death, my life would have been that much more difficult." Gore's Book 'Oozes Faith' Mr. Gore, who went to an Episcopal school during his Washington childhood, spent a year studying in the graduate Department of Religion at Vanderbilt University, originally a Methodist institution, while also working as a newspaper reporter. In "Earth in the Balance," his book on environmental issues, the Tennessee Senator traces "the roots of the global crisis" to "an inner crisis that is, for lack of a better word, spiritual." His book "just oozes religious faith," said the Rev. James M. Dunn, a friend who is executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. Besides religious reflections at beginning and end, the book contains a chapter, "Environmentalism of the Spirit," devoted to philosophical and Biblical teachings about the use of nature. "The duty to care for the earth is rooted in the fundamental relationship between God, creation and humankind," Mr. Gore writes. Both the candidate and his wife, Tipper, are members of Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Arlington, Va., where she has been a deaconess. Both candidates appear at ease with the religious faith of their fellow citizens, unlike Michael S. Dukakis, whom the political historian Garry Wills called "the first truly secular candidate we had ever had for the Presidency." Despite Mr. Clinton's opposition to prayers in public school classrooms, for example, he seemed more nostalgic than indignant when he recalled in that cable interview that in junior high school, "I had to get other people to read the Scripture every day or do it myself." While not abashed about acknowledging their religious sentiments, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore express them in broad terms. They speak, for example, of failure, self-improvement, search, struggle, obligation and hopefulness, that a nonbeliever could easily invest with nonreligious meaning. Sam Hill, a professor at the University of Florida who has written on Southern religion, said he considered the two candidates "men of substantial faith" but he contrasted them with Mr. Carter: "My father, who was a Southern Baptist minister, would have said, 'They don't speak the language of Zion.' " What they speak, Professor Hill continued, "is the language of Georgetown, Vanderbilt, Harvard, Oxford and Yale," where they pursued their undergraduate and graduate studies. Mr. Clinton has recalled that when he was an undergraduate at Georgetown University, a Jesuit philosophy professor read some of his papers, assumed that he must be a Catholic and urged him to consider the priesthood. The professor could hardly believe it when Mr. Clinton said he was a Southern Baptist. Georgetown introduced the Arkansas native to more than Catholicism. Mr. Clinton credits a freshman course in comparative religion with teaching him "the innate religious nature of all human beings." Despite this cosmopolitanism, the Democratic candidates' Southern Baptist link "will make it a bit more difficult for Republicans to portray them as dangerous liberals, as alien to Southern culture and churchgoing values or simply 'not our kind of folks.' " Professor Hill said. He called the candidates symbols "for the dramatic changes that have occurred in the South in the last 50 years." There have been dramatic changes in the Southern Baptist Convention as well. The nation's largest Protestant denomination, it was formed before the Civil War, splitting with Northern Baptists over slavery. The dominant religious conservatism of the South actually preserved the denomination from many of the fierce doctrinal fights that divided other Protestant groups in the first half of the century. Not until the late 1970's did strict advocates of a literal approach to Scripture feel the need to mobilize and, in a protracted struggle with church moderates, enforce their views throughout Southern Baptist institutions. Baptists -- a group that includes Baptists from the North and black Baptists, as well as members of the Southern Baptist Convention -- have historically been the most Democratic Protestant group. But in recent Presidential elections, white Baptists, like whites generally, have voted in greater and greater numbers for Republicans. In another television interview in the summer, this one with Bill Moyers on PBS, Mr. Clinton said that he was "pretty much on the side of the moderates" in the Southern Baptist dispute. But he lamented the divisiveness of the controversy and said that he understood the "impulses" of fundamentalists who fear a breakdown of standards. The Rev. Brian L. Harbour, who was Mr. Clinton's pastor at Immanuel Baptist from 1985 to 1990, said that the Governor was "very faithful in his attendance" and "sang in the choir almost every week." "He grew up knowing about the faith," said Dr. Harbour, who now is pastor of First Baptist Church in Richardson, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. About Mr. Clinton's joining the church after his 1981 defeat at the polls, Dr. Harbour said: "The skeptics would say, 'Yeah, he did that just to get votes.' The way I looked at it was that he did some soul-searching after he lost that election, and he realized that he had moved away from some of his roots. "I'd lean to the skeptical interpretation if he had won re-election and then quit going." Baptists With Different Views As executive director of the Southern Baptist Convention's Christian Life Commission, Richard D. Land represents positions sharply opposed to those of the Democratic ticket. He doubted whether regional or denominational loyalty would overcome opposition to the Democratic teams' liberal views on social and moral issues. But Dr. Land acknowledged: "Southern Baptists recognize these guys. These are their kind of folk in the way they talk, how they sound -- they don't sound like the Governor of Massachusetts." Dr. Leonard, of Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., is another scholar who thinks that the Southern Baptist influence on the candidates is obvious. "Everybody can hear it in the way they speak," he said, including "the fact that Bill Clinton speaks a long time." "The cadence, the way he pauses, the inflection, particularly when he really get into a speech, these are elements that one hears in Southern Baptist preaching," he added, and in African-American preaching as well. "You compel people to lean forward and listen, then you go up to a peak, then you bring your voice back down again." Belief in 'Soul Liberty' In terms of the substance rather than the style of his politics, Mr. Clinton and his supporters repeatedly cited the Southern Baptist belief in "soul liberty," the capacity of each individual to reach valid religious judgments. They all mentioned the historic Baptist emphasis on individual conscience and the separation of church and state, a tradition that can also be invoked to justify liberal Democrats' aversion to letting government establish norms of personal and sexual conduct. Asked on the VISN program if he could pinpoint any way in which as a Baptist he would be different than an Episcopalian, Jewish or Catholic president, Mr. Clinton said, "No." "That I have a deep faith in God and a sense of mission to try to do the right thing every day, should be reassuring to the American people," he said. "But I don't expect to get any marching orders from the fact that I was raised in the Baptist church."

913-> AT WORK WITH MARK YOUNG; For the Record, Guinness Editor Knows the Most About the Best
MARK YOUNG, editor of the United States edition of the Guinness Book of Records, is on the phone again in his Park Avenue office, this time with a caller who claims she can floss her teeth in 20 seconds. Certainly a noteworthy record, she asserts. Mr. Young is not so sure. "Being a gentleman, I won't ask you if you have a full complement of teeth," he says. Although she insists she indeed has all her teeth, the speed flosser is about to be let down. After all, her skill is too difficult to measure, and perhaps even a bit hazardous. "Although it sounds like a lot of fun," Mr. Young tells her, "it's not one we do." Each day, Mr. Young handles roughly 65 queries from people who want their names in that small, quirky section of the book of records called Human Achievements. He stands at a kind of crossroads where The National Enquirer meets the Encyclopedia Britannica, handling the straightforward records -- tallest building, longest ship and most magnetic substance -- as well as the more unusual record attempts by people seeking immortality. Their ranks include the man from India who sent an X-ray film of his stomach. He had attempted to make his stomach look like a lion's head by starving himself for four days. (This did not even qualify as a potential record, Mr. Young ruled.) Then there was the caller who said he could do more consecutive belly-flops than anyone else -- he had done about 50 -- and who didn't want to hear that the activity required no skill and was not a good example to set for the book's mostly teen-age readers. If it seems all this eccentricity might grow a bit tiresome after a while, it does. "You do develop a band of numbness around you," Mr. Young said. But somebody has to shepherd the world's best-selling copyrighted book through its substantial annual revisions. Mr. Young, 32 years old, seems to have the right temperament for the role of ambassador to the world of superlatives: a smooth British diplomacy, a breezy unflappable manner and a healthy respect for efforts that could easily be dismissed as wacky stunts. "The fact is, these people are not nuts," he said. "They're quite serious, and if you can't understand that, this job will drive you crazy." Part of his job is to play coach, referee and cheerleader to the supplicants who appear, at first blush, to meet Guinness's criteria. The records must be comparable, measurable and verified by two witnesses (a referee and a notary for a basketball free-throw record attempt, for example). The record attempt must also be for something that people participate in on a regular basis. The owner of 500 Oakland A's baseball caps, for example, would not be a candidate. "Isn't one enough?" Mr. Young added. He is sometimes also called upon to make public appearances to vouch for records. In June, he appeared on "Yo! MTV Raps" to vouch for Tung Twista, who set a record by rapping 597 syllables in 60 seconds (a speech pathologist slowed down Tung Twista's recording and counted only clearly pronounced syllables). "He really was amazing," Mr. Young said. The job, he concedes, almost sent him leaping out his office window when he started, almost three years ago. Back then, he handled all the mail and calls himself. "I never knew who was going to be on the other end of the line," he said. After a year, however, Facts on File, the publisher of the book, gave him two assistants, who have freed up much of his time to customize and freshen up the book for American readers, who prefer more color and graphics, he said. He also edits the Guinness Book of Sports Records, which he updates with the help of his brother, Andrew, in England, a former British sports trivia champion. After the 1993 edition of the book of records was sent to the printers in mid-August, he focused on a new book, "Inventions and Discoveries," a compendium of technological landmarks that is to be published annually in the United States, beginning next spring. As in the record book, the more sober entries will be leavened with a section on the offbeat, like a prototype robot in Australia that can shear a sheep in less than two minutes, a minute less than the time required by a human shearer. "It's fantastic: a complete meeting of the Old World and the future," he said. This shopkeeper's son from West Bromwich, England, which is near Birmingham, had more than his share of jobs before taking this one. A summer exchange program brought him to the United States for the first time in 1979 to work as a camp counselor in Connecticut. There, when he was 18, he met the woman he would marry three years later. In the 10 years he has lived in this country, he has worked as a landscaper, bank teller, package sorter in a United Parcel Service warehouse, and part-time archivist for the New York Philharmonic while studying history at New York University. Mr. Young gave up his studies because he found himself "talking more and more about less and less," and he decided to pursue a career in publishing. Facts on File hired him to help index its news digest. After the company bought the rights from Guinness to publish the records book in 1989, it advertised for an editor. He got the job. The Guinness Book of Records is much more of an institution in England, where it was started, than in the United States. The idea for the book was hatched in 1954, when Sir Hugh Beaver, an executive of the Guinness brewery, got caught up in an argument over whether the grouse was a faster game bird than the golden plover. No reference book was handy to settle the debate, so he commissioned a fact and figure agency in London to compile records. In its first year, the book reached the top of the British best-seller list, and it has remained there every year, except for two years when it was not published in the 1950's. The book is now published in 182 editions in 36 languages and has sold more than 60 million copies. In theory, Mr. Young said, anyone can set a Guinness record. "You don't have to be Einstein or Michael Jordan to get in the book," he said. One record setter new to the 1993 edition is Susan R. Jeske, who sang the national anthem at 17 events this past Fourth of July, with the help of an elaborate plan to shuttle her by limousine, helicopter and boat from baseball game to county fair to her last stop at the Rose Bowl. Another is Brian McCauliff, who ran a "vertical mile" -- consecutive runs up the stairs of the Westin Hotel in Detroit to equal a mile, with elevator trips down -- in one hour, 38 minutes and 5 seconds. That seems like a long time to run a mile, in any direction. "Try it sometime," Mr. Young said. Mr. Young is not out to set any records himself. He's a husband to Karen, a writer of children's stories, and the father of two daughters, ages 8 and 3, and a 4-year-old son. He displays his children's art work on the walls of his standard-issue office and reads his way through a long train ride every day from his home in Connecticut. Since becoming editor of the records book, he has become more of a homebody, often turning down invitations to parties. The problem is that once he's introduced at a party, he becomes the center of attention, with other guests quizzing him about records that he easily recounts. "I sounded so bloody arrogant to know so many things," he said. Despite all this normalcy, Mr. Young says he likes living a bit outside the mainstream, something he has arguably accomplished by storing a very large cockroach in a plastic case next to his computer for three years. The roach, named Lambada, arrived in a package from Brazil with a letter saying the roach was three and a quarter inches long. It was, in fact, only slightly longer than three inches, and still short of the record, a specimen from Colombia that was 3.81 inches long. Americans and Britons approach record-breaking differently, Mr. Young said. In England, records are largely a celebration of eccentricity, and record attempts are first and foremost a way to have some fun. Breaking a record is gravy. Americans are more serious, he said, and consider fun the byproduct of a successful record attempt. In fact, he has been surprised by how dispirited some Americans are to learn they have made a new record for the United States but fallen short of the world record. "That's coming in second," he said. " 'Don't even put me in it,' they say." The most impressive record in Mr. Young's opinion is cited in the section of the book titled "Projectiles." On Sept. 6, 1981, at Siilinjarvi, Finland, Risto Antikainen threw a fresh hen's egg 317 feet 10 inches (roughly the length of a football field), to Jyrki Korhonen, who caught the egg without breaking it. "It's an incredible achievement," Mr. Young said. "Completely and utterly crazy, but it's wonderfully crazy." The feat has so caught his imagination that one day, when his children are a bit older, he plans to take them to a football field with a basket of eggs and give it a try himself. "I would love to know how many eggs they threw," he said of the Finns. "I have wonderful visions of this guy with yolk all over his face, and he finally catches an egg without breaking it, and they go absolutely barmy."

914-> 90 Palestinians Reported Wounded in Gaza Clashes
At least 90 Palestinians were reportedly shot and wounded by plastic and rubber bullets today when Israeli soldiers fired on several thousand stone-throwing protesters in the Gaza Strip who were marching in support of an 11-day-old hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners. The clashes occurred on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, although there was no reason to believe that the Palestinians had targeted the day for protests, which have been occurring almost daily. Although a few people were said to have been seriously hurt, most received light wounds and went home after being treated at local clinics. No deaths were reported. Reports on Injury Toll The reported injury toll, the highest in months in the Israeli-occupied territories, was provided by both hospital and United Nations officials and by Palestinian journalists who had witnessed the events. Israeli army spokesmen, however, said they knew about only 20 to 25 casualties, of whom 12 required hospitalization, all but one for what were described as slight wounds. This sort of discrepancy in reported numbers is not uncommon. In part, it is because the Israeli authorities are not always aware in such situations about injuries that are treated at local clinics, including those run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. In this case, Palestinian journalists who had examined the logs at those clinics said that dozens of wounded people were treated and sent home. An Increase in Violence But even with the lower Israeli figures, the toll was unusually high, reflecting a general increase lately in violence in both Gaza and the West Bank. In recent months, a large measure of normal life has returned, most conspicuously in the West Bank, where shops are keeping longer hours and people are filling streets that used to be deserted most afternoons as part of the Palestinians' anti-Israel uprising. That still is the case. Nonetheless, with the Middle East peace talks in suspension, the last few weeks have seen a discernible rise in the number of reported attacks by Palestinians on Israelis and a similarly greater readiness by Israeli soldiers to fire at both Arab assailants and protesters. The continuing hunger strike by thousands of prisoners has become a focal point for Palestinian unrest, turning into one of the more widespread protests of its kind in several years, with sympathy strikes and marches called almost daily throughout the territories. Several large demonstrations were held in both Gaza and the West Bank today. Although Palestinian leaders deny any political motivation for the hunger strike, calling it a demand by prisoners for better food and conditions, Israeli officials say it is a political maneuver designed to strengthen the Palestinian hand at the peace talks, scheduled to resume in Washington in two weeks. In Gaza today, thousands of marchers took to the dusty streets in several towns and refugee camps, some waving flags of the outlawed Palestine Liberation Organization. Although there was no apparent connection between the protests and the Yom Kippur holy day, some Palestinians said the numbers of marchers were unexpectedly high, possibly because many Gazans who normally work in Israel were home for the day. Some Protests Peaceful At some locations, such as the Khan Yunis refugee camp, the protests were peaceful, and Israeli soldiers made no attempt to break them up. But severe clashes occurred in the Rafah camp at the southern end of the strip, a scene of frequent battles between local residents and Israeli forces. There, witnesses said, soldiers tried to disperse marchers by firing in the air. When protesters then threw stones and at least five gasoline bombs at the Israeli military headquarters, the soldiers reportedly fired directly at people with a combination of plastic and rubber bullets and rubber-coated metal pellets, in addition to tear gas. At least 63 people were wounded in Rafah, journalists who were on the scene said. They included a man who was shot twice in the neck and a woman who lost an eye. Most of the others were lightly wounded, witnesses said. More than two dozen other Palestinians were reportedly also shot elsewhere in Gaza, among them 13 people at the Maghazi refugee camp in the center of the strip.

915-> State Farm Increases Storm Loss by 30%
The State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the insurance company with the biggest stake in Florida, today increased its estimated loss from damage caused by Hurricane Andrew by more than 30 percent, to $2.1 billion. The new State Farm estimate, up from its $1.6 billion estimate released Sept. 9, is the highest so far of any insurance company. Last week, the Allstate Insurance Company revised its estimate to $1.73 billion from $1.05 billion. State Farm's new estimate, based on 145,149 claims inspected in Florida and Louisiana, stems from its discovery that the damage was worse than originally anticipated, a company spokesman, Jim Stahly, said. The private company's initial estimate assumed that the Florida homes met wind-resistance building codes, when in fact many did not, he said. The insurance industry has estimated overall insured damage to homes, businesses, cars and boats at $7.8 billion, although a dozen insurance companies' revisions have added at least $2.5 billion to that figure. The original estimate is now under review by Property Claim Services, an industry trade group. State Farm, which covers about 20 percent of the insured homes and cars in Florida, has already paid out more than $1 billion in claims. It has 2,600 agents and claims people working in Florida.

916-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Tuesday Debate Tops '88 Ratings
The Vice-Presidential debate on Tuesday night attracted more viewers than the 1988 Vice-Presidential debate, though fewer than the Presidential debate on Sunday night. The national rating for the debate, issued yesterday by the A. C. Nielsen Company, was 34.9 for the three broadcast networks, CBS, ABC and NBC, all of which carried the event live. (Figures for other channels, including PBS, CNN and C-Span, will not be available until later in the week.) Each rating point represents 931,000 homes. Nielsen estimated that 32.5 million homes watched at least some part of the 90-minute debate. The three-network rating for the 1988 Vice-Presidential debate was 33.6, and Nielsen estimated that 30.4 million homes watched that event. Sunday's Presidential debate had a 36.9 rating.

917-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail; Illusory or Just Elusive? No Matter, Baker Is Seen
FLASH! There's been a Jim Baker sighting! The President's chief of staff and chief political adviser has been little more than a ghost around the White House since he moved there from the State Department a couple of months ago. No public events. No press conferences. No nothing except some closed-door work on matters of state, particularly political matters. White House wags who managed to catch a glimpse of him in the corridors of the West Wing said he was really only a hologram, one of those deceptive three-dimension film things. Cynics said James A. Baker 3d was being James A. Baker 3d, lying low, out of blame's way, because things were not going well in the campaign he was brought in to fix. Whatever. But the fact is the man was spotted on a trip to San Antonio on Wednesday, with the President, in public. Does he know something we don't? Or was he just catching a ride back home to Texas on Air Force One? When in Doubt, Leave No One Out Is this a Bill Clinton answer, or is this a Bill Clinton answer? He's in Nashville and someone asks which country music performers he'll invite to perform at the White House if he wins in November. Answer: "All of them." When It Pours, Everyone Gets Wet Maybe this one should go in the if-things-can-go-wrong-they-will-go-wrong category. Or maybe this is serious. In any event, now Barbara Bush is slipping in the polls -- after a year of riding so high in them that political wags were saying she, not her husband, should be on the ballot. Back in August, The New York Times/CBS News poll put her favorability rating at 74 percent. In this week's poll, she slipped to 68 percent. But it does not follow that Hillary Clinton's favorability rating went up. It was 33 percent in August and 32 this week. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. So some of the figures could be no more than straws in the wind, if that. One Poll Really Sips Campaign Waters And there are a lot of straws in the wind. . . There is, for example, the true straw poll, in which moviegoers at the 270 General Cinema theaters scattered in 29 states chose either a Bush, Clinton or Perot straw when buying a drink. The latest tally, covering 225,000 purchases last week and including Ross Perot straws for the first time, yielded these results: Clinton 45 percent Bush39 percent Perot16 percent General Cinema boasts that its polls have correctly predicted the last six Presidential winners, usually within a few percentage points of the actual final tally. Then there is the quadrennial Presidential poll conducted by The Weekly Reader, the 64-year-old student paper published in Middletown, Conn. Filled with learning features, it circulates to some 8 million youngsters through the 10th grade all over the country who, in Presidential election years, find mail-in ballots folded between the pages. Not in 36 years have the student readers failed to make the right pick. And their 1992 choice, based on more than 600,000 votes? George Bush over Bill Clinton, 55 to 39 percent. Confused? There's more. Mr. Bush carried the kindergarten-through-fourth grade vote, which is more than 60 percent of the total. But Mr. Clinton carried the higher grades.

919-> Question on Eve of a Shuttle Flight: Is It Worth It?
As six astronauts and the space shuttle Columbia were declared ready for a 10-day voyage, questions were raised today about whether the great risks and costs of a shuttle flight were justified for a mission that seems extraordinarily modest. The main goal of the mission, which is to begin at 11:16 A.M. on Thursday, is to deploy a two-foot, $4 million satellite described by the space agency as looking like a large golf ball. Its mirrored surface is to reflect laser beams used to study movements of the Earth's crust. The satellite was built by the Italian Space Agency and matches one lofted in 1976 by the space agency on an unmanned Delta rocket. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration defended the mission as having great merit, saying they were honoring a commitment made long ago to the Italians and doing experiments that pave the way for important work. But private analysts said the mission's overall goals seemed slight given the cost of each shuttle flight, estimated at up to $1 billion, and the chance of a catastrophic failure -- put by NASA at 1 in 78. They said that an unmanned rocket would cost far less and eliminate the risk to astronauts, and that the mission should have been scrapped or delayed until more experiments of substance could be added. The underlying problem, they contended, is that years of poor planning have left the winged spaceships with little of substance to do. A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to defend the flight and said the Bush Administration last year unveiled a plan meant to set clear ground rules on the kinds of cargoes the shuttle can carry. The official added that the policy's effects would not be evident for a few years because shuttle payloads were booked so long in advance. The Bush Administration's National Launch Policy calls for the shuttles to be used only on missions that require the spacecraft's unique abilities or the presence of humans. It expands on decisions made after the 1986 Challenger accident, in which seven astronauts died, to remove commercial and military payloads from the nation's winged spaceships and to make sure the remaining scientific missions justified the risks. Today at the Kennedy Space Center, NASA officials were repeatedly asked whether this mission met the cost-and-risk criteria. They said it did, even though the shuttle's 60-foot payload bay is clearly far from full. Leonard S. Nicholson, NASA's shuttle director, said a main rationale for the flight was aiding the development of a six-foot, Italian-made rocket that is to boost the science satellite into a higher orbit. The rocket project, he stressed, was begun before the Challenger disaster. "We certainly intended, and have fulfilled, the commitment to fly those payloads that were specifically designed for the shuttle," he said. "So I don't see this as any deviation." In an interview, Louis O. Caudill, NASA's program manager for the satellite, said the rocket project was started by the Italians in 1984 and was originally designed for launching small commercial payloads. 'Honoring a Commitment' "We're honoring a commitment we made to the Italians," he said, "and that's important." On the other hand, commercial cargoes are now banned from the space shuttles, so the small booster rocket has little prospect of use. Flaminia M. Rossi, a spokeswoman for the Italian Space Agency, said the rocket cost $125 million to develop. She said it currently had no customers, and the agency was exploring whether it could be adapted to expendable rockets. Although the science satellite itself, known as the Laser Geodynamics Satellite 2, is identical to one previously launched by NASA, its orbital path will take it over different parts of the Earth, including the earthquake-prone Mediterranean region. By bouncing laser beams off the high-flying satellites and measuring how long it takes the light to return, scientists on the ground can measure movements of the Earth's crustal plates. The risk-and-cost issue was also addressed at the news conference by Alphonso V. Diaz, NASA's deputy associate administrator for space science. He looked to the future, saying materials-science tests on Columbia could not be lofted on unmanned rockets and that the mission was a stepping stone to the 350-foot space station Freedom, which NASA hopes to build around the turn of the century. "We believe it is a vital activity," he said of the materials-science work, adding that the overall mission "does demonstrate the utility of the space shuttle in handling a mixed cargo of payloads." Mr. Diaz said the research projects on the mission had passed muster with scientific-review panels. Among the materials-science tests are ones to study how the absence of gravity affects the solidification of metal alloys, the heat conductivity of chemical liquids and the crystallization of proteins. John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said the limited cargoes for the mission were an embarrassment and the result of years of poor Federal planning. "It's because the station ain't here yet, and they've taken off all the other payloads," he said in a telephone interview. The station, when first proposed in 1984, was to be hauled into space by the shuttles beginning this year. Mr. Pike added that NASA was "flying to keep the shuttle alive," building its constituency and exercising the skills of the 29,000 people who ready, launch and repair the spaceships. Dr. Jerry Grey, director of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a professional society based in Washington, said the mission was exceedingly "thin" and should have been scrapped or delayed until more significant experiments could have been made ready.

920-> Paul Tully Is Dead at 48; Top Democratic Strategist
Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic National Committee and one of his party's pre-eminent strategists, was found dead in Little Rock, Ark., today. He was 48 years old. Coroner Steve Nawojczyk of Pulaski County said Mr. Tully's body was found about 3 P.M. today by a maid at the hotel where he was living in Little Rock. Pending results of an autopsy, the coroner said Mr. Tully appeared to have died of natural causes. Mr. Tully was among the most impassioned and intense of a generation of Democratic political professionals who devoted much of their lives to regaining the White House. He worked in every Presidential election since 1968. He had moved to Little Rock this fall to aid in Gov. Bill Clinton's drive for the White House. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement tonight: "There will be only one Paul Tully. Pacing, driven, and full of joy, Paul's commitment to our party and, more importantly, to making this great nation even greater was a fire that burned bright and long." In a statement, Mr. Clinton said, "Paul had one of the nation's greatest political minds, and one of its biggest hearts." Mr. Tully was a fixture in Democratic Presidential politics, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980, for Walter F. Mondale in 1984, for former Senator Gary Hart's first Presidential campaign in 1987, and, briefly, as a top aide to Michael S. Dukakis. Mr. Tully resigned from that campaign along with John Sasso, the campaign manager, after Mr. Sasso acknowledged giving reporters a videotape that showed Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. using parts of another politician's speech. The disclosure helped set off the collapse of Mr. Biden's Presidential campaign. Mr. Tully was convinced that 1988 was a winnable election for the Democrats, and he spent much of the next four years arguing that a new Democratic majority was emerging in the country; at the Democratic National Committee, he led the party's efforts to prepare for this campaign, and oversaw the integration of those efforts with the Clinton campaign. Economy as Issue Even at the height of Mr. Bush's popularity after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when many Democrats considered this election an almost certain defeat, Mr. Tully made the rounds of party gatherings with his slide shows and his charts, arguing that Mr. Bush had serious vulnerabilities. He was known in political circles for his blunt assessments, his fierce partisanship and his love of the game. At a time when many analysts still believed that the 1992 election would be heavily influenced by foreign policy and the ability to serve as Commander in Chief, Mr. Tully declared, "This is about money in my pocket, prices for the essentials of life, the level of fear on the block." James Carville, the senior strategist for the Clinton campaign, said: "This guy's whole life was Democratic Presidential politics. He had worked for four years on this -- he had every map, every target, he probably knew the name of every swing voter in the country." Mr. Tully was born in New York City, grew up on Long Island, and was a graduate of Yale College and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He is survived by two daughters, Jessica and Miranda Tully; a brother, Jim Tully, and a sister, Patricia McDermott.

922-> Review/Music; Taking the First Steps Of a Long Traversal
The 15 string quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich now loom as one of the most imposing sets of masterworks in this century. These are personal, urgent compositions, many written, we now know, for friends and colleagues who understood the composer's double life: his public front of acquiescence and servitude toward the Soviet Government, shadowed by his private self, who undercut celebratory declarations with dark and bitter irony. The quartets are full of formal compositional tricks -- canons and double fugues -- along with soulful folk songs and robust circus numbers. They are Classical in spirit, almost transparent in their structure, yet are tortured and intricate in their overlapping emotions. They dance and grimace and sometimes seem to talk. There are times, too, when they create sounds and sensibilities that seem beyond ordinary description. So when the Manhattan String Quartet began a seasonlong, chronological traversal of this cycle at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night, I joined the sold-out audience with high expectations. Though performances of the cycle are no longer as rare as they once were -- this ensemble already accomplished this feat once before, during the 1989-90 season and the British Fitzwilliam Quartet presented New York's first cycle in 1982 -- the works are so powerful they almost deserve an annual hearing. As it turned out, the players -- Eric Lewis and Roy Lewis, violins; John Dexter, viola; and Chris Finckel, cello (replacing Judith Glyde, a long-time member of the quartet) -- approached the music with enough sensitivity and skill to justify some of the hopes. In this program of the first three quartets, the instrumentalists were technically polished and musically committed, providing glimpses of the sassy and mordant wit that fill the pages of these scores. Mr. Finckel is just joining the 22-year-old quartet, and I am unable to say how he might be transforming its sound and temperament, but the group's style might be characterized as American modern: wiry, direct and a bit impatient. Throughout the concert I never had less than respect for the players' seriousness; their devotion to this music successfully inspired similar feelings in listeners. But these works now have a distinguished recorded tradition -- with cycles by the Borodin, the Fitzwilliam and the Brodsky Quartets, as well as by the Manhattan -- and it just takes a few moments of listening to the Borodin players from the 1960's, who knew Shostakovich, to hear how much more there is in these works than was audible on Monday. Despite the Manhattan's long acquaintance with these quartets, it almost seemed as if the music had not yet been thoroughly absorbed. These works require a mercurial sense of mood and attitude; they shift suddenly from joviality to fits of splenetic fury. As the critic Harlow Robinson pointed out in the program notes, these works tell jokes. They set up expectations and disrupt them; the second quartet has a Romance that toys with sarcasm; the third has a Waltz that is sardonically moving. The Manhattan players, though, often seemed to miss the point of the works' quirky juxtapositions, or else often conveyed them in the slightly stilted accents of translated humor. When Shostakovich led his compositions into new territories and contrasting regions of sound, the players either did not react in time to the alterations or broke the line by making the shifts too brittle. There were also times when the pulse was just a tiny bit slack when it should have been absolutely rigorous. Something else might have helped as well: a different coloration. Some of the pianissimo episodes should have a hushed mystery; one of the paradoxes of these works is that they seem to combine misery with awe. These are matters of great subtlety, like a comedian's timing. And it was in these minutiae that the players seemed to lapse, thus losing the larger picture as well. There was still more than enough here to reaffirm the importance of this music, and to pique curiosity about how the quartets will fare in later events this season.

924-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Bebel Gilberto The Ballroom 253 West 28th Street Manhattan Through Saturday Like so many younger Brazilian pop singers, Bebel Gilberto exudes a self-possession, unaffected elegance and comfortable sensuality that is almost impossible to find among American pop stars of the same age. The 25-year-old daughter of the bossa nova pioneer Joao Gilberto opened a five-night engagement at the Ballroom on Tuesday as part of the club's second winter festival of Brazilian performers. Her program consists mostly of Brazilian material, interspersed with the Beatles' "If I Fell" and the Gershwins' " 'S Wonderful." Without seeming overtly imitative of her father, who is renowned for expressing intense emotional crosscurrents in a near-whisper, Miss Gilberto's opening-night performance suggested that she has inherited some of his stylistic traits. Like him, she projected a contradictory mixture of sensuality and diffidence in singing that was smoky but unaggressive. Most of the songs were mid-tempo fusions of samba and bossa nova, sung to the adept accompaniment of piano, bass, drums, percussion and reeds. The spiciest number was Vermelho and Silva's "Tic-Tac"; the torchiest Joao Donato's "At Quem Sabe." In two duets composed by Miss Gilberto's pianist, Steve Sandberg, their voices failed to find a comfortable blend. "If I Fell" and " 'S Wonderful" were stripped of their pop and jazz underpinnings and treated as free-form melodies, with the singer floating between the phrases in an alluringly sultry way; in her hands, they became Brazilian songs.

"Some of the most important statements of our life are short: 'I love you' and 'Will you marry me?' The problem with sound bites is that the ones chosen for the news often don't have any substance." -- KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.

928-> COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 3 Hurricanes With Speed and a Purpose
Several years ago, not long after they had been brought together in the place where the sun shines and the quarterbacks glitter with equal intensity, Micheal Barrow, Darrin Smith and Jesse Armstead defined their futures. They were watching former University of Miami teammates prepare for the next level, working out for National Football League scouts, when the thought came to them. "All three of us can go first round," Barrow remembered. "We can work out better. We can run faster. We can do what it takes." Even the bold, young linebackers could not have predicted how indispensable they would become at a school that links its football success to its quarterback lineage. Miami's perfect 1991 season was made possible without a defensive unit that led major colleges by allowing only 9.1 points per game. Torretta Steps Ups But the billboards selling Fast Track Football in south Florida show quarterback Gino Torretta, the latest in the line, preparing to throw to receivers who are poised to race out of starting blocks. Vinny Testaverde, one of those celebrated quarterbacks, won a Heisman Trophy. Russell Maryland won the Outland Trophy as the outstanding interior lineman. Bennie Blades won the Thorpe Award as the outstanding defensive back. But no Miami player has won the Butkus Award for the outstanding linebacker in the award's seven-year history. This year the school has been informed it has three nominees, some of the fastest people on its fast track. Barrow, surrounded by Smith and Armstead, will play a central role in their fourth and final season together as Miami attempts to solidify a position as the college football dynasty of their time. The experiences and personalities of Miami's three leading tacklers last season have made them an emotional core of a team that hopes to claim a fifth unofficial national championship in 10 seasons, and fourth in the last six. Sense of Freedom The way the three go about their work reflects the emphasis that has symbolized Miami's success. A system put in place by former Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson and continued by Dennis Erickson, his successor, has taken advantage of their speed, encouraged their resourcefulness, and emphasized a sense of freedom. "Coach Johnson's philosophy," said linebacker coach Tommy Tuberville, "was let's recruit guys that can run, let's let 'em use their speed, and let's don't tie them down. "We teach them technique, but we allow them to be able to deviate to do things on their own. These linebackers are not real big. When we've played people that have real big offensive linemen, you can't say, 'You've got to take this guy in a certain way.' They play games with the offensive linemen. That's the only way they can survive." Sense of Where They Are When Smith was asked if he could recall a play that was defended successfully as a result of each linebacker having a sense of where the others would be at a given moment, he stopped to think. "It's real hard to think of just one," Smith said. "Darrin makes smooth plays," Armstead said. "Nice, quiet plays. Mike may mess up a little, but he makes that big play -- Bam. I'm like this: I make some quiet ones, but I make some flashy ones, too. Just like our personalities." Smith and Barrow, the heaviest of the three, weigh 230 pounds. But their 40-yard speed ranges from Barrow's time of under 4.6 seconds to Smith's 4.42. Their personalities present a cross-section of the team's; a mix of intensity and outrageousness, a thorough knowledge of each other and their game, and that most rare of Miami qualities, the gift of understatement. Smith Quiet and Confident Smith, whose quiet presence is strong enough that he can reinforce a point just by raising his eyebrows, declined a request of coaches that he play as a freshman. "In everything I do," Smith said, "I look at it in the long term." He was graduated in three and a half years and will follow his plan to use his fifth year to continue work toward a masters degree in the graduate school of business. In Smith's apartment, there is a framed picture of himself at the age of 2, in his father's arms, not long before his father was killed in Liberty City, a neighborhood in Miami. Rudolph Smith, who was a volunteer at a festival to benefit the police, was shot after an argument with two men who ignored a barricade and drove into the area where the festival was taking place. This year, again, before each game, Smith will write the initials R. S. on a wristband and place it around his left leg. Barrow, the vocal leader in the middle after reluctantly moving from an outside position, has become the group's public conscience, emphasizing a need to prevent ego issues from dividing the team. He signed his letter of intent 4 1/2 years ago while wearing a R.O.T.C. uniform. As Barrow stood in front of cameras before the start of practice earlier this month, someone asked him to identify the large, pointed white objects dangling from the chain around his neck. "Amp Lee teeth," Barrow said with a smile. He was careful to add that he could say that now because Lee, the former Florida State running back, has left for the pros. Armstead Overcomes Injury Armstead, perhaps the most intensely recruited player in the history of the program, has overcome reconstructive knee surgery two years ago and trouble with the law while in high school. At the age of 15, Armstead was held overnight in a juvenile center for shoplifting in a mall. "I told my momma I wouldn't get in more trouble," he remembered. "I wasn't a trouble child. I was doing it just to fit in." Armstead's humiliating night, sitting on the floor of a cell while in detention, eventually had a purpose. "I'm glad I experienced it," he said. "I thought I couldn't get in much trouble." He said his best friend in high school eventually asked Armstead to become part of an armed robbery. Armstead chose not to go, the attempt failed, and his friend and others went to prison. The three personalities have merged into a unit despite the tensions the spotlight can create, and the jealousies that could exist. Barrow said problems have been handled through a line of communication from former Hurricanes to the current leaders to the younger players, in person, in loud telephone calls, and even on motivational video tapes. The approach has been simple, but the issues surrounding the Hurricanes are often complex. Pell Grants Take Toll One factor that Barrow has already noticed this summer is an effect of an investigation into fraudulent Pell grants that were obtained by Miami athletes. According to reports, more than 40 past and present Miami football players have been implicated in the scheme of a former academic adviser, Tony Russell, to obtain Federal financial aid by lying on their applications. Two players, receiver Lamar Thomas and reserve running back Jason Marucci, were indicted last Tuesday on charges of fraudulently obtaining Federal financial aid, and will have to wait until later this week to find out if they can play. Shortened Summer Workouts Barrow said he was not involved in the Pell grant fraud, but knew that some teammates had to reduce their summer conditioning in order to earn the money they need to repay the illegally obtained grants. "You look at those guys and see who worked out in the summer and who didn't," Barrow said. "A lot of those guys didn't work out in the summer. They were told to. It's hard to keep track of those guys in the summer." Those failures, Barrow said, will lead to opportunities for reserve players and healthy competition. There is too much at stake -- a No. 1 ranking, a high slot in the draft, and maybe, for one of them, maybe even a Butkus Award. "If one of us gets it," Barrow said, "then all of us get it."

929-> McDonnell Sale Delay
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that the closing of its deal to sell 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation would be delayed beyond its target date of Jan. 31. Michael Burch, a McDonnell spokesman, said the closing would be pushed back "weeks or maybe months" as Taiwan Aerospace analyzed McDonnell's books. Executives from Taiwan arrived at Douglas Aircraft's commercial jet plant in Long Beach, Calif., today to being examining the business. "There are no complications," Mr. Burch said of the $2 billion deal. "Things are going well. But it's an incredibly complex process, and its taking longer to get started than anyone envisioned." Taiwan Aerospace is partly owned by that country's Government, and recent news reports from Taipei said the Government did not expect to approve the deal until late March. The deal calls for Taiwan Aerospace to help McDonnell Douglas build a new jumbo jet, the MD-12.

930-> On Matters of Health, Women's Magazines Give Solid Advice
To the Editor: Elizabeth M. Whelan's "Alarm Clocks Can Kill You. Have a Smoke" (Op-Ed, Sept. 8) attacks women's magazines' health reporting as "silly." What readers may not realize is that Dr. Whelan is known as a mouthpiece for the chemical industry. When she criticizes Family Circle, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, McCall's, New Woman, Redbook and Self for what she calls "health 'advice' [ that is ] a distortion of scientific reality" and describes the medical reporting by all women's magazines as "disinformation," she's wrong. Dr. Whelan refers to PCB's, breast implants, lead and radiation emissions as "hypothetical causes" of health problems despite numerous scientific and government studies citing these hazards. Could her position that trace-level chemicals are not a health threat be influenced by the 50 corporations that finance her American Council on Science and Health? Our magazines have been recognized for distinguished health and public-interest reporting. Contrary to the assertion by Dr. Whelan, we have cautioned women repeatedly about the hazards of smoking despite the fact that a number of our advertisers are cigarette manufacturers. JACQUELINE LEO, ELLEN LEVINE KAREN WALDEN, KATE WHITE New York, Sept. 10, 1992 The writers are editors in chief of, respectively, Family Circle, Redbook, New Woman and McCall's.

931-> Review/Art; A Mulatto-Chinese Cuban With a Gift for Fusion
This is a big year for Wifredo Lam (1902-1982). Two major exhibitions are scheduled for Europe, another will be mounted at the Studio Museum in Harlem in January and at present "Wifredo Lam: A Retrospective of Works on Paper" is on view at the Americas Society. The attention is well deserved -- Lam is an exceptionally interesting, if uneven, artist -- but why is it coming now? The fact that his career has been seriously under-examined has something to do with it; but so does the fact that he is an amazing paradigm of cross-cultural interaction. Born in Cuba to a mulatto mother (half-Spanish, half-black) and a Chinese father, he was reared a Roman Catholic, but was early introduced to the blend of African religions and Christianity called Santeria. He lived in the Caribbean, Spain, France and the United States and married a Spanish woman, then a German, then a Swede. Acutely conscious of his third-world background, he operated ambitiously on the stage of international art. And of all the early modernist painters who brought "primitivism" into their work, it was he who made it his primary subject. Because Lam often used paper as a primary medium, painting on it as if it was canvas, the Americas Society show (organized by Charles Merewether) gives a fairly comprehensive picture of his career. Like many of his contemporaries, he trained as an academic realist, first in Havana (a lovely little 1923 pencil sketch of his father is the earliest work in the show), then in Spain, where he first saw the work of Picasso and Matisse. After Lam moved to Paris in 1938, Picasso's formidable "Demoiselles d'Avignon," with its African sources, clearly influenced his work, though initially with mixed results. A few of the earlyish oil-on-paper pieces pick up on its grating strangeness, though most indicate a still tentative grasp of the kind of synthesis the older Spanish artist had effected. Lam found a supportive and lifelong friend in Picasso, and he became involved with members of the Surrealist movement, whose interest in the unconscious, in non-European cultures and in art as a means for a transformative universalist vision struck a responsive cord. When Andre Breton and others fled Paris for Marseilles in 1940, Lam went with them. The exhibition includes some of the fantastic pen and ink illustrations he executed for Breton's book "Fata Morgana" at that time. They combine Surrealist automatic drawing with a fine, graceful calligraphic style that prompts speculation as to the role Chinese esthetics may have played in Lam's art. In 1942, Lam returned to Cuba, and, it is often observed, came into his own as an artist once he reconnected with Afro-Cuban culture. In "The Murmur" (1943), a female figure is set against striped palm fronds that vaguely suggest Matisse's lively patterns; the black deliberate lines of her fragmented body bring Picasso to mind, but the details of her face are taken straight from West African sculpture. It is the balance of these elements that makes this work so distinctive. Rather than creating an image of a woman with applied elements of an African style, Lam has created a totemic Santeria divinity through the medium of a modernist vocabulary. Such figures occupied his attention for much of his career. They are often composites of women and horses or women and birds, which carry specific meanings of spiritual empowerment (though Lam was not a Santeria practitioner). In them the strands of his amazingly diverse background are brought together. So pervasive is the impulse for cultural fusion in his work of this time that even a gouache of what looks like a neo-Impressionist still life in succulent vegetable greens and yellows actually depicts a Santeria altar. An increasing degree of violence is also apparent in Lam's art in the 40's and after he had returned to Paris to live in 1950: the dark side of Afro-Cuban religions, perhaps, or of Lam's own temperament. One sees it in the stunning oil-on-paper grisaille titled "Head (Canaima)" (1947). Its nightmarish tangle of spikes and horns -- recalling the work of Hieronymus Bosch, which Lam had seen in the Prado -- becomes a recurring motif in Lam's late prints. The Americas Society show concludes with these prints. They confirm Lam's extraordinary gifts as a draftsman, but their version of Surrealist automatic drawing smacks of an easily achieved, mechanical approach to Breton's "derangement." The spiritual energy that sparked the earlier work is gone. Also missing, in the prints and in the show overall, is a sense of the artist's gifts as a colorist. The first and most lasting impression of many of his paintings is the tang and lushness of their light-dappled greens and violets. Even the more highly colored works at the Americas Society look subdued in the necessary low-level lighting, and it is an indication of the neglect Lam's career has experienced up to now that several pieces have been allowed to fade through poor handling. At the moment, Lam's work is vulnerable to damage in other ways as well, specifically in how it is interpreted. That the non-European content of his work has thus far relegated him to the role of exotic outsider in the modernist mainstream is unquestionable. But the Marxist argument presented by the wall text of the Americas Society exhibition, to the effect that Lam was essentially an Afro-Cuban artist making critical use of modernist conventions to achieve a "profound act of disruption" with the West, seems, at the very least, overstated. Lam spoke passionately about his intention of embodying a black sensibility in his work. But he was just as emphatic in his disdain for political art. While he had a profound and direct understanding of non-European culture unavailable to such interested colleagues as Picasso and Breton, he also identified himself as one of their company, a modern artist in the Western sense. (This small Lam retrospective, incidentally, offers a fascinating foil to the current Matisse retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, showing how two artists in the same modern tradition could still be worlds apart.) Given art scholarship's continuing obsession with politics, it is probably inevitable that Lam's work will be read in a narrowly partisan light. But it would be wrong to deprive this complex and fascinating artist, with roots in Africa, Asia and Europe, of his world citizenship and imprison him in yet another restricting version of history. "Wifredo Lam: A Retrospective of Works on Paper" remains at the Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, Upper East Side, through Dec. 20. The exhibition will be shown at La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona, Spain, from Jan. 21 to March 28 .

I swallow my yawns as we move into the living room for our after-dinner liqueurs. Elsewhere in the city, an early morning quiet has settled in. Theater crowds are long gone, night spots deserted. Plane lights wink lazily as they approach the airports for landing, heavy fog clings with clammy fingertips to the piers, ships hoot mournfully to signal their lonely comings and goings. Oblivious to this, and as if by some tribal instinct, my friends have broken into small conversation groups, some nestling into the soft leather sofa and chairs, others sprawling over the floor pillows. They sip their drinks as though they must last the night and it begins to seem that they will. Ted has an early-morning tennis match, but is talking buyouts and mergers and there's no stopping him.

BEFORE AND AFTER By Rosellen Brown.354 pp. New York:Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $21. ROSELLEN BROWN'S powerful new novel, "Before and After," addresses, more than anything else, the cherished concept of personal independence. To what extent is a family free of the community in which it dwells? How closely is each of us tied to the fate of those we love? Do any of the traditional means by which we attempt to define ourselves -- education, good name, success, political integrity -- insure our protection when a chance event intrudes? Ben and Carolyn Reiser, the people at the center of "Before and After," certainly seem safer than most. Ben is a sculptor of ascending reputation, while Carolyn is a capable pediatrician; their children, Jacob and Judith, are bright, attractive teen-agers, occasionally baffling to their parents but for the most part a source of pride and satisfaction. Tucked into their interesting rural New Hampshire house, the Reisers are friendly toward their Yankee neighbors, keeping their urban sophistication subtle, turned down. Long-term and year-round residents, they're rooted by choice if not by birth, just slightly, self-consciously pleased with the accommodations they've made. Ben, especially. "Then the bell rang. "It rang into the ordinary noises of our day. It rasped so harshly that when I tried to go back to it, or just before, it sounded like the gong they ring at boxing matches, urgent, a rip through space and time, promising cruelty and pain. "I've heard about stories, how they're really just a finely strung architecture of the way things were and the way things turned out, held together -- or divided, would be better -- by the most terrible word, the word that lifts the roof off, lands the ax blow, curdles the milk. The blood. All the world's change, its doom, its fatality, is in it: Then . . . ." Like an avalanche, crushing facts thud into Ben and Carolyn's comfortable existence: a girl, a not especially remarkable or particularly nice girl, has been brutally murdered. She was last seen with Jacob -- apparently they had secretly been a couple for some time -- and now the Reisers' beloved son, the boy with eyes "the color of new jeans," is nowhere to be found. That first day, after the local policeman departs, Ben finds damning evidence in Jacob's car and instantly, instinctively, out of primal loyalty, makes a shocking choice from which there is no easy retreat. The deeds of one family member implicate another, who implicates still another, and on and on in a rapidly escalating chain reaction. MS. BROWN, whose previous novels include "Tender Mercies" and "Civil Wars," is tenacious in her examination of each major character. Deftly, artfully, she strips away the delicate shelter of conventional relationships -- husband and wife, parent and child -- and reveals a dangerous arena where virtual strangers, each with his or her own priorities and set of understandings, vie in mortal contention for the choice of values that will predominate and prevail: integrity or survival, love or self-respect. The lines of demarcation blur, altering with the ebb and flow of circumstance, of subjective interpretation. "Before and After" is all about broken rules and skewed allegiances, about being cornered and having no weapons save the familiar tools salvaged from a prior life. A bucolic town, once friendly and folksy, closes ranks against outsiders who have contaminated its "sweet once-upon-a-time." Predictability is replaced by chaos as the jarring revelations of secrets accumulate. Balance is replaced by a world that tilts wildly, utterly destabilized by acts as mundane as taking a picture postcard out of the mailbox or catching a matinee at the local movie theater. As the intricate plot develops -- and this novel, for all its philosophical provocation and literary merit, is also an unabashed, read-until-dawn page turner -- Ms. Brown shifts the focus of her interest from husband to wife, daughter to son, and back again. Characters emerge sharply, their latent personality traits heightened by the test of crisis. Ben assumes the mantle of an almost Old Testament paternity while Carolyn, the scientist, strives to maintain a clinical analysis of the situation. Jacob, in one of the book's most emotional scenes, wrenchingly communicates the wider context of the crime, and Judith, staggered by the collapse she witnesses in every direction, retreats into herself. Of her brother, whom she has always held in awe, she eventually decides: "He deserved to kill himself. At least, if he did that he could prove his honest sorrow. Otherwise -- he was doubly guilty if he lived, and her father was worse. She saw the smile, slightly mischievous, slightly menacing, altogether unfamiliar, that he'd shown while he spun out their foolproof lie. Whenever Snappy caught a bird or a squirrel or even a little lizard, she made a strange sound in her throat, a plea, almost. It was odd, excited and frightened at the same time. A quaking noise. That was what he'd looked like, in some funny way. She had no words for it; she had no name, right now, for her father." Carolyn, appealing for some sign of recognition, even empathy, from the dead girl's mother, is equally at a loss: " 'We're -- we're probably going to lose our son,' she said quietly, and hot tears gathered in the corners of her eyes. Could she really dare to instruct this woman in their shared tragedy? 'I've spent a thousand hours not sleeping, thinking about Martha. I just want you to know. It won't change things, but if you could ----' " 'What?' Mrs. Taverner spoke her first words harshly. 'If I could what ?' "Carolyn shrugged. 'I don't know.' She reached out for the frame of the stall door and held it gratefully. 'If you could think of us as ----' What? 'Human? As parents -- a family, I mean, who's also -- so -- helpless?' " In the end, of course, the Reisers' road doesn't come to a melodramatic end; Ros ellen Brown is too original and truthful a writer to depend on easy solutions. Instead, imperfect American justice is meted out (and captured on videotape), and people "with congruent wounds" find a measure of comfort in one another, then move toward the acceptance of their enduring scars. The path smooths, breaks back into a dappled light, but its destination is no longer clear. Nor, for those involved even on the periphery of this domestic disaster, will it ever be completely so again.BOY IN A CAGE You faced rabbits through a cage, you faced parrots and canaries and guinea pigs. You did not face your son. The glass was impermeably thick. She could see fingerprints, cloudy as scummy water, where the fluorescence flashed against it. You would have to sit next to other visitors? Share conversations about -- well, about anything: this was all you had of each other. Bail or regret or revenge or -- whatever? "I don't think anybody stays in here very long, it's not really a prison, " Ben said quietly, as if they were surrounded by listeners. . . . Carolyn looked around, dispirited. This was not one of those spaces like hospital waiting rooms that had been furnished with kindness to keep spirits up -- it had a scuffed, plain-wood, businesslike look, no visual euphemisms here for bad luck, bad judgment, bad karma. The attitude, she thought, looked like: You got yourself into this, bud, and we're not obliged to keep you happy. Or your family, either. If that makes you feel sad or guilty, fine. . . . She started to rise and so did Ben, but Jacob's jailers had arranged things as awkwardly as they could to prevent any unseemly shows of affection. It was a sealed border. They gawked across the distance like accusers and accused. To reach for him was impossible. But there he was, alive, whole, familiar. . . . He stood utterly still, utterly blank. Carolyn raked his face for a sign -- terror suppressed, or relief, or the beginning of a grief-stricken crumbling -- but she saw a blankness so pure she had to restrain herself from thrusting herself through the window and shaking him. He was very young, she thought fleetingly, to have such absolute control of himself. It was hard to believe this was the moment they'd been praying for. -- From "Before and After." HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO? Rosellen Brown is sure that Dan Quayle will not like her eighth book, "Before and After." "It doesn't have a clean, upbeat, family values kind of ending," Ms. Brown said in a telephone interview from Cambridge, Mass., where she was visiting friends. She stresses, however, that the novel, about a teen-age boy accused of murdering his girlfriend, is strongly rooted in her own perception of parenthood. "You raise your children knowing them intimately," observed Ms. Brown, who is 53 years old and has two grown daughters. "But then you reach a point where that's no longer true." Ms. Brown was also influenced by a murder trial in Houston, where she lives. "I discovered that while husbands and wives do not have to testify against each other, there is no such privilege for parents and children," she said. "I wanted to push these parents to some kind of clarification of how far they'd go to protect their child." The couple, Ben and Carolyn Reiser, tell the story, along with their young daughter, Judith. But the accused son, Jacob, is never a narrator. "He's the blank at the center of the circle," Ms. Brown explained. "I didn't want to give direct access to his mind." Because "Before and After" was initially conceived as a play, Ms. Brown is pleased it has been optioned for a film. She wonders if the movie will remain true to the book, which dramatizes neither the killing nor the trial. "Someone at a staged reading of the first scene [in which the police chief confronts the parents] said it should have happened in the station house, not their kitchen," recalled Ms. Brown. "But this story is not about crime -- it's about how well we know each other and ourselves. It had to take place close to home." -- LAUREL GRAEBER

939-> Do Government Rogues Traffic in Drugs?
To the Editor: Why is it that any time there is a voice suggesting there might be a connection between drug trafficking and rogue elements of our Government, there is a powerful one like A. M. Rosenthal's ("Movies, Drugs, Elections," column, Sept. 11) to deny this voice with catch phrases like "left-wing paranoia." Now Mr. Rosenthal may not agree with the character who implies this in my movie "Bob Roberts," but certainly he can't tell me he hasn't heard these words before. If he hasn't, I suggest he read "The Politics of Heroin" by Alfred McCoy and "Acid Dreams: The C.I.A., LSD and the 60's Rebellion" by Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain, two exhaustively researched books that show connections between agencies of our Government and the proliferation of drug abuse in our country. Certainly we need centers on addiction and drug abuse like those proposed by former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph A. Califano, but more important, we need to begin providing a viable economic alternative to the drug business in areas where drug use is so prevalent. We need tougher investigative journalism to start addressing, in some way, the common knowledge of the streets: that the war on drugs is being waged on the user, not the supplier, and that the war cannot be won because there is no will to find the source. Mr. Rosenthal may not believe that the source is in any way connected to rogue operatives within Government, but a great many people do, and until he is able to refute these beliefs in more definitive terms than taking cheap shots at movies, people will continue to believe the charge. Everything in "Bob Roberts" is something I have heard in America, on all sides of the political spectrum. Nothing is proved, there are no definitive answers, only questions raised. These questions might make Mr. Rosenthal uncomfortable, but maybe that is their purpose. It does no good to deny these frustrated, inquisitive voices a forum.

941-> Detroit Teachers, After Fruitless Talks, Set Strike
With summer drawing toward a close, about 170,000 students are preparing to return to Detroit schools in nine days. But their teachers, having failed to reach agreement on a contract in months of negotiations, are preparing to strike. "A 99.9 percent chance of us not reporting for work Aug. 31 is true," John Elliott, president of the 10,500-member Detroit Federation of Teachers, said Friday. The union's leaders and officials of the nation's seventh-largest school district have not agreed on any of the 60 issues on the bargaining table after more than three months of negotiations, Mr. Elliott said. One of the main issues is money, said Mr. Elliott and the superintendent of schools, Deborah McGriff, who spoke Friday at a joint appearance before the city's religious leaders. "We're competing with 85 other school districts" in the Detroit area "for teacher service, and we are in the bottom 20 percent of salaries," Mr. Elliott said. Ms. McGriff said that she wanted to pay teachers more but that she had to weigh that desire against the need to balance the district's budget and provide sufficient services to students. "I never said teachers didn't deserve more money," she said. Efforts to determine the range of teacher salaries for the district were unsuccessful after Mr. Elliott and Ms. McGriff spoke Friday. Telephones at union and district offices were not answered. 40 Districts in Critical Talks Detroit is only one of more than 40 Michigan public school districts, with about 300,000 students, where contract talks are at a critical stage, union officials say. In Illinois, nearly 200 teachers in two small districts are already on strike. Another walkout looms in Los Angeles, where the union representing 36,000 teachers has threatened to call a strike in mid-September over proposed pay cuts. To help close a $400 million budget deficit, the Los Angeles Board of Education has voted to cut $247 million in employee compensation. Under the plan, most teachers, along with other school district employees who earn $28,000 to $90,000, would undergo a 14 percent pay cut on top of a 3 percent cut last year. A commission headed by former Attorney General John Van de Kamp of California has been created to examine the budget crisis in hopes of averting that strike, which would affect 630,000 students.

943-> EGOS & IDS; Entertaining A la Betsy
The lady knows how to lunch, but can she cook? Betsy Bloomingdale, the widow of Alfred Bloomingdale, who developed the Diners' Club credit-card business, is writing a book on entertaining. "We envision it being a piece as pretty as Martha Stewart's, and with comparable recipes," said Ted Paul, whose press, Beautiful America, in Wilsonville, Ore., plans to publish Mrs. Bloomingdale's book late next year. It is being co-written by Catherine Whitney, the author of "Uncommon Lives: Gay Men and Straight Women" (New American Library-Dutton, 1990). Though Mrs. Bloomingdale is a bona fide member of the jet set and a devotee of French couture, her food and entertaining ideas, Mr. Paul said, will be geared to the average person. "There will be a theme through it that you can do outstanding entertainment without having to spend a pile of money," he said. "It will not be one of these where the first recipe will be for a beach party for 900 at your Eastern Shore home." The book will also include recipes from many of Mrs. Bloomingdale's well-known friends, including Nancy Reagan, Nan Kempner and Joan Rivers.

944-> Pop and Jazz in Review
'The Fabulous Bud E. Luv Show' Jewel Box Theater 321 West 44th Street Through Jan. 26 Who is the world's greatest entertainer? According to an announcement at the Jewel Box Theater, it is none other than Bud E. Luv (Robert Vickers), the quintessential Las Vegas lounge lizard and a star with an ego as big as all outdoors. In "The Fabulous Bud E. Luv Show," the singer, clad in a red smoking jacket decorated with images of dice and martini glasses, runs through many of the songs you never wanted to hear again, from "Mack the Knife" to "Danke Schon," in a style that suggests a distillation of Sonny Bono, Tony Orlando and Dean Martin. Wearing the fixed grin of a sleazy used-car salesman, Mr. Luv, who was christened Bud Euripides Luvalopolis Jr., chats about a typical day's activities (golf with Joey Bishop, lunch with Charro, big winnings at the gaming tables) and oozes endlessly about the "chicks" in his life. Amid those songs you never wanted to hear again, he performs such originals as "The Ballad of Sheila Cornucopia," the story of his failed marriage to his "fifth and seventh wife," set to the tune of "El Paso," and "Talent," a name-dropping list song of stupefying fatuity. The star, who claims to have been on the scene in just about every place where pop history has been made in the last three decades, pays tribute to the "Woodchuck" generation in a medley that includes fragments of Santana's "Black Magic Woman" (re-christened "Black Magic Marker") and the Who's "Pinball Wizard" ("Crap Game Wizard"). The show reaches a hilarious nadir with a Las Vegas-style disco medley, which begins with "The Hustle" and includes fragments of "Boogie Oogie Oogie," "Kung Fu Fighting" and "YMCA." The kind of entertainer epitomized by Bud E. Luv is, of course, an easy target for spoof. What makes Mr. Vickers's performance special is the deadpan accuracy of his impersonation. His tributes to Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones reveal that technically he is almost as good a singer as those he mimics. As withering as his parody may be, it is also obviously driven by a deep affection for the Bud E. Luvs of this world and their oleaginous ways.

945-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; Buchanan Says Bush Stole His Ideas
The conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, seeking to embarrass President Bush in this state's Feb. 18 primary, today accused Mr. Bush of stealing his agenda in his State of the Union Message and called on the President to debate him. As he has done often since he announced in December that he would seek the Republican Presidential nomination, Mr. Buchanan said Mr. Bush had betrayed conservative principles while in office. While crediting Mr. Bush with giving a "well-crafted and well-delivered" speech, Mr. Buchanan accused him of "a little bit of intellectual property theft" and said the President had belatedly returned to such conservative themes as cutting taxes, reducing government regulation and freezing Federal spending, themes that Mr. Buchanan has espoused throughout his campaign in New Hampshire. "For three years, Mr. Bush has governed as a Rockefeller Republican, as a liberal Republican," Mr. Buchanan told reporters here. "Now he's going to run again as a conservative." Any Time, Any Place Mr. Buchanan said he would travel anywhere in the country to debate the President, though he acknowledged that such a confrontation is unlikely. The challenger, who plans to spend the bulk of the remaining days before the primary within New Hampshire, said the issue is Mr. Bush's credibility. He recalled that during the 1988 campaign Mr. Bush promised not to raise taxes, then accepted a tax increase as part of an agreement with Congress on the 1991 budget. Mr. Buchanan said the President's speech on Tuesday night indicated that he "clearly intends to run in New Hampshire as a conservative for the last three weeks of the campaign, because he knows that is the political disposition of the Republican Party in New Hampshire. I don't think it's good enough, and I don't think the people of New Hampshire are going to buy this bill of goods a second time." 'Read My Lips' The question of the President's change on taxes has become the centerpiece of Mr. Buchanan's campaign in this state, which saved Mr. Bush's 1988 primary campaign by giving him a victory over the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, largely on the tax issue. In television and radio commercials that began running last week, Mr. Buchanan criticized Mr. Bush's reversal on taxes, using tape of the President making his now-famous pledge of "read my lips, no new taxes." Mr. Buchanan hopes such a message will hit home in a state that has been battered by a prolonged recession that many voters blame on the President. While recent polls have indicated some movement away from the President and toward Mr. Buchanan, they also indicate difficulties for the challenger. For example, in a telephone survey of 400 Republicans likely to vote in New Hampshire, 21 percent of those polled said they would vote for Mr. Buchanan, compared to 56 percent who favored Mr. Bush. Moreover, 27 percent viewed Mr. Buchanan unfavorably, a high unfavorable rating for a candidate. The survey, conducted for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV of Boston, had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. "People in New Hampshire are very unhappy with Bush," said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC Communications Research, which conducted the poll. "But they don't like Buchanan." A Moral Victory? Even so, Mr. Buchanan is relishing what he sees as one success of his campaign: pushing the President to the right. "There is no question that we not only have been driving the debate, we have been winning the debate," Mr. Buchanan said. "The proof of that is George Bush has moved crabwise in a conservative direction ever since we announced seven weeks ago." The Administration's strategy seems to be to express regret over the tax increase and to highlight the President's call for a cut in capital gain taxes, levies imposed on the profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate. Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who was in the state today campaigning for Mr. Bush, said, "Only speaking for Jack Kemp, I believe the President regrets trying to make a deal with this liberal Democratic Congress." "But the fact is he has come back to the American people and asked them in a call to arms to bring back the tax cut to help restore value to capital assets held by the American people, both fixed and financial," Mr. Kemp said.

946-> Yugoslav Republic Expects Recognition Soon
For Kiro Gligorov, the President of Macedonia, "it is a matter of time" -- soon, he believes -- until his republic receives broad international recognition. Formerly a part of the six-member Yugoslav Communist federation, Macedonia was something of an odd man out as civil war swept the northern republics last year. While it managed to avoid the fighting, Macedonia continued to feel especially vulnerable to external pressures, bordered as it is by Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Albania and with a sizable population of minorities. The 74-year-old President met today with senior Bush Administration officials, who have already expressed considerable sympathy toward Macedonia and its policies in the Yugoslav crisis. Mr. Gligorov noted that at least one problem of foreign relations has been resolved with recognition of Macedonia this month by Bulgaria, which had long coveted Macedonian lands, saying they were essentially Bulgarian in the first place. "It was a brave act," he said of Bulgaria's decision, "especially when you know that some will not like it." In addition, he said, the Turkish Government advised him today that recognition would be forthcoming "in a matter of days," and that Italy and Austria would soon follow. Greece remains a problem, he acknowledged, because the Athens Government says "Macedonia" is a Greek name deriving from classical times and may not be usurped by a foreign government. Athens contends that the use of the name alone implies territorial pretensions to a part of northern Greece that is also called Macedonia. Mr. Gligorov said in an interview here that his people, descendants of Slavs who settled the region 14 centuries ago, have called themselves Macedonians "for hundreds of years." He also pointed out that the Parliament in Skoplje had adopted amendments to the Macedonian Constitution in November that expressly renounce territorial claims and interference in the affairs of other countries. The nomenclature issue has delayed joint recognition of Macedonia by the 12 members of the European Community, which declared diplomatic recognition of the secessionist republics of Slovenia and Croatia this month. -------------------- U.N. Peacekeepers Stalled BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Jan. 29 (Reuters) -- A United Nations envoy said today after a four-day visit that he could not yet recommend sending peacekeeping forces to Yugoslavia because some of the conditions set out in a peace plan had not yet been met. The envoy, Marrack Goulding, a United Nations undersecretary who would be responsible for deploying 10,000 peacekeeping troops, said there was wide support for the organization's plan to end the civil war in Yugoslavia and that one of the key conditions -- a cease-fire -- was holding. But Mr. Goulding, who has met with Serb, Croat and Yugoslav Army leaders, , said there "remain certain differences of interpretation about the plan, and more work needs to be done on resolving these." Milan Babic, president of the Serb-controlled enclave of Krajina in Croatia, told Mr. Goulding on Monday that he objected to proposals to withdraw Yugoslav Army troops from Krajina and replace them with peacekeeping troops.

948-> The Man Who Created Hester Prynne
SALEM IS MY DWELLING PLACE A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. By Edwin Haviland Miller. Illustrated. 596 pp. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press. $35. AMONG subjects for biography, writers do not reliably furnish a good read. Even an indifferent biographer can make drama out of an athlete's career as it rises toward mastery and then declines with the symptoms of age, or out of the events in which a politician is swept up. But intellectuals may live in outward monotony; the residents of Konigsburg, it is said, set their watches by Immanuel Kant's morning constitutional. Among writers whose visible lives are more surprising, there are many who, by guarding themselves against personal scrutiny, insure that their biographies will be little more than annotated bibliographies -- ordinary lives incidental to extraordinary works. Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-64) was such a writer. He kept to the margins of public life, attending sleepy Bowdoin College in the 1820's instead of Harvard, and spending his young manhood (when Melville was at sea, Emerson an itinerant lecturer and Poe a flamboyant literary celebrity) at home in Salem, Mass., with his mother and sisters. He periodically held patronage appointments -- customs inspector at Salem, consul in Liverpool, England -- that kept him solvent. Before his marriage in 1842 he flirted with communal living at Brook Farm, where he seems to have gone more as a witness than a participant, and where one comrade described him as "a hermaphroditical sort of thinker & artist" -- by which was meant not exactly prudery or perversion, but a kind of exclusive self-sufficiency that shut out the need for contact with others. Hawthorne's literary successes were financially modest, but his reputation was (alone among the great writers of the American Renaissance) secure in his lifetime. He married late and became a father after 40. Scrambling to keep genteel poverty at bay, he sometimes missed his rent payments and endured the mixed gratitude and embarrassment of permitting friends to raise funds for him. For a time his wife, Sophia, even decorated lamp shades to supplement their income. Perhaps to compensate for the undramatic outline of Hawthorne's life, Edwin Haviland Miller gives us in "Salem Is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne" the lively flavor of the times. We meet a gallery of eccentrics -- the Bowdoin science professor who was "mortally afraid of lightning"; half-clownish poets like Ellery Channing, of whose verses Poe said, "They are not precisely English -- nor will we insult a great nation by calling them Kickapoo; perhaps they are Channingese." We learn of Bowdoin boys drinking fluid from their alcohol lamps to circumvent college rules against liquor; of Hawthorne skating furiously in the dark before sunrise on flooded Concord meadows; of Sophia confessing that "not at balls & courts should I care to walk in silk attire," but that, when she and Nathaniel were alone, she would be willing to decorate herself with "velvet robe & pearls in my hair to gratify my husband's tastes." There is a valuable rebuke in these vignettes to our conventional notion that 19th-century American culture was locked into gentility. And there is also an implication that if Hawthorne's outer life was uneventful, his inner life had a proportionate intensity that he kept hidden. His secretiveness was notorious in his lifetime and is not the invention of critics who have contended with his riddled texts, or of biographers to whom he has proved resistant. "He is almost the only young American of any ability that I have known," said the disappointed Elizabeth Peabody (she had wanted him for herself as she watched him woo her sister), "who has hidden himself during his nonage and kept his own secret." Mr. Miller's biography does help us to see how Hawthorne's evasiveness must have felt to those around him. Hawthorne's son, Julian, reported Melville's remark that "there was some secret in my father's life which has never been revealed," and Hawthorne's personal style seemed almost calculated to tease. He claimed, for example, to have burned a great many of his works in manuscript, but it is more likely that he made a little bonfire of first drafts, and saved revisions. "I seldom venture abroad till after dusk," he once declared, but his sister Elizabeth said that he strolled frequently about Salem in the afternoon. These sorts of contradictions, small and large, are consistent with the experience of reading his fiction -- which often leaves readers in a state of suspension between undecidable alternatives. Is Hester Prynne chastened or unrepentant at the end of "The Scarlet Letter"? Is Robin in "My Kinsman, Major Molineux" horrified or enchanted by the lust of the mob? Mr. Miller, who has previously written a biography of Herman Melville, is less reckless than some critics who have suggested that Hawthorne carried about with him some dark private knowledge -- that he committed (or at least wished to commit) incest with his sister Elizabeth, or that when he slept as an adolescent in his uncle's bed he was sexually initiated by him. His placid outer life has been an invitation to speculate about the mystery of what set off the seething spirit within. Yet Hawthorne's decorous prose -- like the surface of a painting without evident brush strokes -- has blunted most efforts to penetrate to the author behind it. Even the major public events of his times -- the slavery crisis, the advent and encroachment of machines, the influx of immigrants, the ongoing wars against the Indians -- are little more than hinted at in his stories, or at least kept at the safe distance imposed by a recondite symbolism. MR. MILLER is beguiled by these mysteries and gives in to the temptation to explain them psychoanalytically. He places great emphasis on the childhood trauma of the death of Hawthorne's seafaring father (who died in 1808) and finds traces of it everywhere in the fiction. There is a danger of reductionism here, but finally Mr. Miller's evocation of Hawthorne's early sense of eviscerating loss is convincing. Here we discover the feeling that has consistently been construed as Hawthorne's "secret" -- his sense that to give oneself genuinely to life means to leave oneself vulnerable to loss. He filled his tales with men who hold themselves outside the circle of human interchange, but who, as if engaged in perpetual surveillance, feed on the thrill of discovering the fallibility of others who are more involved in life. Hawthorne knew that if one peers out at the nighttime world, it is best to darken the room. Like his great follower, Henry James, he needed concealment to be able to observe his human materials. He knew that an artist was a kind of leech, and his stories are full of them -- all, to some degree, self-portraits: Coverdale in "The Blithedale Romance," Chillingworth in "The Scarlet Letter," Aylmer in "The Birth-Mark," Mr. Hooper in "The Minister's Black Veil." Hawthorne's secret was finally, I think, his fearful recognition of the responsibility of being mortal. He gave, in his own works, the best account we have of his inner life. His invented characters -- the married man in "Wakefield" who spies in disguise on the wife whom he has abandoned, or the many rationalists throughout his fiction who turn their wives and children into experimental objects -- are not so much wounded as fearful of an imminent hurt if they do not extract themselves from intimacy. On rare occasions Hawthorne did step before the curtain, as in the astonishing love letters to Sophia: "My breast is full of thee; thou art throbbing throughout all my veins. Never, it seems to me, did I know what love was, before. And yet I am not satisfied to let that sentence pass; for it would do wrong to the blissful and holy time that we have already enjoyed together. But our hearts are new-created for one another, daily; and they enter upon existence with such up-springing rapture as if nothing had ever existed before -- as if, at this very now , physical and spiritual world were but first discovered, and by ourselves only." These letters, which reveal a private man admitting a woman to the unvisited sanctuary of his heart, suggest that Sophia may have been the only person who ever really saw into Hawthorne. His secret fear (unbearable until he found her) may have been the knowledge that only the eternal "now" of love could confer upon him the immunity to time and loss that he craved. "In most hearts," he wrote in a late romance, "there is an empty chamber waiting, for a guest." Mr. Miller is at his best on Nathaniel and Sophia -- on their tenderness as well as on their estrangements and reconciliations. It is the grace of his book to approach the sanctuary of Hawthorne's heart not with indignation at its fastness, but with the decency not to barge in.

950-> Westinghouse Dividend Cut Because of Losses
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation slashed its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a share from 35 cents yesterday and announced accounting changes that were expected to reduce first-quarter earnings by about $300 million, or 88 cents a share. The dividend cut was widely expected because of the huge losses that Westinghouse suffered last year on real estate and junk-bond investments made by its financial-services subsidiary. Those investments cost Westinghouse more than $1.68 billion in the third quarter and led to the layoffs of 4,000 workers as top management tried to cut costs. Losses in the Westinghouse Credit subsidiary caused the parent company to lose $1.09 billion last year. Westinghouse has recently sold some of the subsidiary's assets and has put many more assets on the auction block. New Accounting Rules In a statement yesterday, Westinghouse also said it would comply with new accounting rules covering the health benefits of retired employees. The change will cost the company $750 million. A separate change in the company's accounting for income taxes will have the beneficial effect of adding $450 million to its income statement. The Westinghouse board also authorized the company to issue about $500 million in preferred stock that would convert to common stock in three years. The preferred stock is limited in how far it can rise in value. Called preferred equity redemption cumulative stock, the shares pay higher dividends than common stock. Westinghouse has said it wants to raise $900 million in new equity to strengthen its balance sheet. The company's pension fund, which has been partly financed with Westinghouse common stock instead of cash, improved its performance in the last quarter. The company said its contribution of common stock resulted in a $350 million restoration of shareholders' equity in the fund. Strengthening the Company "These steps are consistent with our determination to strengthen the company and complement our recent actions," Paul E. Lego, the company's chairman, said in the statement. "Those actions," he said, "included the establishment of a $6 billion line of credit, a $1.68 billion valuation provision for our financial services subsidiary, the generation of $700 million in cash from the sale of financial-services assets, and implementation of a $200 million corporate-wide cost reduction program." Westinghouse's share price gained 12.5 cents yesterday, to $18.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

951-> Japan Seen Passing U.S. In Research By Industry
JAPAN has equaled or surpassed the United States as the world's top patron of industrial research and development, according to a growing number of science analysts. If so, Japan has a powerful weapon in the trade wars of the 1990's and beyond as it uses research discoveries to launch a new wave of innovative goods and services. The analysts take issue with the Federal Government's Japan-watchers, who calculate that the United States still leads in research spending by business, while acknowledging that America's edge in this area is eroding. An increasing number of private analysts, as well as Japanese economists and American officials, say these Federal estimates are wrong. Japan, they say, has in fact expanded its industrial research so rapidly in the past decade that it now rivals the United States, and perhaps has already pulled ahead. The dispute comes even as the Japanese have seized the leadership role in related fields. Japan, with half the population of America and an economy two-thirds the size, is already known to invest more in new factories and equipment. In 1990, it spent $586 billion on capital investment, compared with the $524 billion spent by the United States. And experts agree that certain of Japan's high-technology industries, including semiconductor fabrication, heavily outspend American rivals in advanced research as well. What is emerging now is the radical idea that Japan as a whole, for the first time, is challenging America's traditional role as world leader in the overall support of industrial research. That role is seen as vital since private industry is increasingly the source of the innovations so important in the international race for commercial advantage. Even experts who doubt Japan's superiority agree it is pouring vast amounts of money into industrial research and say it will eventually overtake the United States if the pace of investment is sustained. A leader of the school that says Japan has already attained superiority is Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who recently told his Congressional colleagues that Japan had quietly scaled the summit of industrial research and development. "It is close to certain that the Japanese are, or will soon be, outspending us on civilian R.& D., especially in industry," Mr. Bingaman said. In an interview, Bruce R. Scott, a professor at the Harvard Business School, agreed and said the way the Federal Government's compares international industrial research spending did not give a clear picture of foreign spending. Significantly, a Federal panel has adopted that view. The Competitiveness Policy Council, recently created by Congress, is a governmental advisory body whose 12 members are appointed by the White House and Congress. Mr. Scott of Harvard is a member, and the council's chairman is C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. The council is circulating a draft report that says Japan has surged ahead of America in business spending on research. The report is to be made public next Monday. Federal officials in charge of comparing research among nations insist that the United States is still far ahead of Japan. But they concede that their methods, which center on adjusting exchange rates between the dollar and the yen, need an overhaul. John E. Jankowski Jr., a senior financial analyst at the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that supports research and monitors spending on scientific research, said the agency's current method was nowhere "near the ideal of what we'd like" but defended it as the best available. Its overhaul, he said, would require a major effort that was unlikely to happen soon in a period of tight budgets. The issue of who leads the world in industrial research has taken on new significance in recent years because such research has quietly become a prime engine of discovery and innovation. For decades, in America and elsewhere, it was governments that financed the lion's share of scientific research and development, putting money into universities, defense industries and state laboratories. In the United States, the government did so with a vengeance during the cold war and pioneered a host of innovations, including rockets, jet engines, computer chips, communication satellites and photovoltaic cells. By 1980, however, American industry had grown so large and had become so dedicated to its own pursuit of scientific advancement that for the first time it surpassed the Federal Government as the nation's top patron of science research. It has maintained that position ever since. In 1989, for instance, the most recent year for which foundation figures are available, American industry spent $71.77 billion on research and development, compared with the $68.72 billion from all other sources in the United States, including the Federal Government. As a result of this and other factors, American industry has become a hotbed of innovation. Swinging Wildly The trend of spending more on industrial research is global. Yet measuring exactly how much nations spend is extremely difficult, experts agree. A crucial problem is exchange rates, which can swing wildly and are often seen as poor indicators of a currency's real value. As a result, economists have developed conversion tables that try to equalize price levels among countries. These are known as Purchasing Power Parities, or P.P.P's. Their aim is to make the clout of differing currencies roughly equal in terms of goods that are traded internationally. For instance, American P.P.P.'s for 1989 show a dollar on average being worth 204 yen. That is much stronger than the dollar's actual market value that year of 138 yen. What that means is that a Japanese camera was cheaper for an American buyer and more expensive for a Japanese buyer than is suggested solely by market exchange rates. The National Science Foundation routinely uses the parity technique, rather than exchange rates, to compare research among nations. It thus finds Japanese industrial research to be relatively paltry. The foundation says Japanese industry spent 8.54 trillion yen on research in 1989, which by the parity technique is equal to $41.90 billion, or a little more than half the comparable American sum. But if calculated at market exchange rates, the figure jumps to $61.83 billion. The Japanese see their investment as even greater. The July 1991 issue of The Japan Economic Survey, published in Washington by the Japan Economic Institute, cited a Japanese Government study that said Japanese business in 1989 spent 9.60 trillion yen on research. Using a market exchange rate of 135 yen to the dollar, the survey said that figure equaled $71.10 billion dollars, or roughly what American business spent that year. The fields where Japan's industrial research investment is expanding rapidly include publishing, printing, petroleum, plastics, fabricated metal products, machinery, communications, textiles, chemicals and transportation. Areas where it is down include agriculture and mining. Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, who heads the technology and national security subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, saw the Japan Economic Survey article, became worried that the science foundation's estimates were faulty and ever since has tried, with minor success, to stir debate on the subject. So far the only published review has been in New Technology Week, a trade publication based in Washington that explored the topic in its Jan. 13 issue. New Technology Week noted that no matter which side in the debate is proved correct, the overall trend is clear. "The R.& D. growth rate in Japan has been consistently over 10 percent for the past three years," it said. "Meanwhile, the growth rate of industrial R.& D. in the United States has been virtually stagnant." Some experts say the problem is overstated. They note that the United States Government supports a vast amount of research, unlike Japan, and that this Federal research greatly aids American industry. For instance, the billions of dollars spent annually on scientific research by the National Institutes of Health is clearly a boon to the pharmaceutical industry. The results from much of this Federal research, unlike business research, are published in scientific journals and are available to the Japanese as well. Some experts say the status of American industrial research may be far worse than the debate over exchange rates so far suggests. Mr. Scott of the Harvard Business School said current methods of comparison are likely to vastly understate Japanese prowess since they focus on consumption rather than production, which in Japan is often remarkably efficient. Using the parity technique to analyze research spending, he said, is crazy. "That's a way to measure Japanese incomes and say what they can purchase," he said. "If you adjust instead for the productive power of the manufacturing sector, you get an exchange rate closer to 100" yen to the dollar. That figure, if applied to Japan's 1989 investment in industrial research, as measured by the National Science Foundation, leads to a dollar equivalent of $85.4 billion. And that, of course, is far ahead of American industry's $71.77 billion investment that same year. While not endorsing the accuracy of such calculations, Mr. Jankowski of the foundation said that any overhaul of America's system for gauging the financial strength of foreign industrial research would have to take such productivity issues into account.

952-> Sunday Outing; Peace and Antiques In Modern Woodstock
This town is famous for the 1969 rock festival that was not actually held there. (The festival took place 50 miles away in Bethel. ) And a part of Woodstock does seem out of the 60's, with shops selling tie-dye clothing, peace buttons, and flower-power T-shirts. But the town's main streets -- Mill Hill Road, Tinker Street and Rock City Road -- are lined with sophisticated clothing stores, upscale art galleries and boutiques and international eateries set in small converted old houses. Craft shops and galleries, most locally owned, feature the work of top artists and craftspeople, many of them transplanted New Yorkers. The three streets converge at the Village Green, a small park in the middle of town where people meet, picnic, or walk their dogs. Since there are many shops to visit, a walking tour of Woodstock is best started at the end of one of the streets, heading toward the green. Some galleries are located above ground level or in the back of another shop, so watch carefully for signs. Oldies but Goodies Antiques stores are scattered throughout Woodstock. Look for old music paraphernalia, especially records from the 60's -- the offerings are abundant, though uneven, and sell for pennies. Other shops include the Gilded Carriage (six rooms of Italian handpainted pottery, table linens, kitchenware, dolls, doll furniture and an extensive selection of greeting cards) and The Rare Bear, devoted to teddy bears -- 1,000 of them, new and antique. For an early start on Sundays, visit one of the 19 historic churches and synagogues in the area. Visitors are welcome at any of the services. For more information call the Woodstock Chamber of Commerce at (914) 679-6234. A popular spot for Sunday breakfast is Misty's on the Green, a small restaurant across from the Village Green. Choices range from Irish oatmeal to fresh blueberry or apple pancakes. Prices are from $2.50 to $8 for breakfast; lunch is also served. For lunch and dinner, there are restaurants offering a wide range of cuisines, such as Joshua's, serving Middle Eastern fare, and the Bear Cafe, which serves American and French food. Prices at both establishments range from $6 to $15. The Bear Cafe is in Bearsville, two miles from the center of Woodstock and home to the Bearsville Theater, which presents plays and rock and classical music concerts featuring nationally known as well as local performers. Joanne Woodward lent her acting talents to the local River Arts Repertory Theater last summer. Starting in the spring and throughout the summer, there are various events held at the Bearsville complex every weekend. For more information or a schedule of events call (914) 679-4406. Musical concerts and theatrical events take place throughout the summer months in Woodstock. For information, call the Woodstock Chamber of Commerce at (914) 679-6234. High on a mountain near the end of Rock City Road is the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Monastery. Its construction began in 1982 and took nine years. The monastery holds the largest metal Buddhist statue in the United States. The giant Buddha is covered with 24-karat gold leaf and sits in the middle of a temple handpainted in bright red, gold, green and blue by Tibetan artisans. Practicing Buddhists live in the monastery, but free tours are given to the public on Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 P.M. A tour takes between 30 and 60 minutes. For more information call (914) 679-5906. If you travel to Woodstock by bus and give the monastery a day's notice, it will arrange to have you picked up at the bus station, at the center of town ($5 round trip). If you would rather take a one-hour walk up the mountainside, there is a hiking trail Getting There By car from Manhattan: Take the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway (Interstate 87) to Exit 19 (Pine Hill Exit), leading to Route 28 West. At the third set of lights (5.7 miles), take Route 375 north to Route 212 (3 miles) and turn left for Woodstock. Adirondack/Pine Hill Trailways runs buses from the Port Authority midtown bus terminal to Woodstock. Some buses are nonstop to Woodstock, others require a change in Kingston. The trip takes about two and a half hours. The round-trip fare is $38, one-way $20. For schedule information call (212) 947-5300.

956-> Style Makers; Gay Ellis, Clothing Designer
The cheerful jackets that Gay Ellis designs for children and adults are inspired by the clothing of the Lapps, or Sami, a largely nomadic people living north of the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia. "The reason Laplanders wore bright colors was in order to be seen in the storm," the 43-year-old designer explained. Ms. Ellis runs her business, Samii Clothes, from a converted barn at Headwaters Farm, the home that she shares with her husband, Rob Brown, an architect, in Sheffield, Vt. Eighteen home sewers execute her designs. Ms. Ellis creates jackets, coats and belted pullovers of fine melton wool in primary colors and subtle jewel tones. The garments are lavishly ornamented with contrasting pinked felt, rickrack and grosgrain ribbon woven in floral patterns. She also designs a few baby styles in Polartec, a fabric that is washable and less expensive than wool. And Samii Clothes produces accessories like Kids Lids and Big Lids, whimsical hats for children and adults. Always interested in costume design, particularly ethnic styles, Ms. Ellis studied textile design at Goldsmith's School of Art at the University of London. In her 1993 line, she will incorporate applique felt work and embroidery techniques that she researched last October in Hungary. Her jackets for adults cost $350; snowsuits for babies, also resplendent with braid and ribbon, are $124. Ms. Ellis's products are available at Almue Stuen, 1061 Madison Avenue (at 80th Street), and Space Kiddets, 46 East 21st Street, in Manhattan, at her retail shop in Stowe, Vt., also called Samii Clothes, and by mail order.

957-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ethnic IssueS; Clinton on Blacks and Jews, and Himself
Gov. Bill Clinton was scheduled to deliver what his Presidential campaign staff said would be an important speech on relations between black and Jews. Instead, the Arkansas Governor yesterday morning talked of his own relations with blacks and his own relations with Jews. In the context of a general message of brotherhood, Mr. Clinton told a New York City audience of how, as a boy in Arkansas, he used to visit his grandfather's store, which had some customers "of African-American descent," and "hand out cookies to kids who came in without regard to their race." Similary, when he was slightly older, Mr. Clinton continued, "one of my best friends in grade school was an Arkansas Jewish young boy." "I remember his bar mitzvah," he said. "I remember what it was like for me, how big my eyes got just being told of all the things he had to learn to do to step up to the plate." 'I Grieve With You' Mr. Clinton spoke at the New York Historical Society after touring a new exhibition called "Bridges and Boundaries, African Americans and Jews," which is co-sponsored by the Jewish Museum and the National Association for the Advancement of Color People. Members of both groups were in the audience. The only reference Mr. Clinton made to actual tensions between blacks and Jews was a single, oblique sentence: "I grieve with you over all the events that put Crown Heights in turmoil last year." He was referring to the racial confrontations that followed the death of a black child struck by a van driven by a Hasidic man. Nonetheless, the listeners mostly responded warmly to Mr. Clinton's use of Yiddish -- "shtick," he drawled -- as well as to his apology for playing golf at an all-white Arkansas country club, and to his denunciation of "the politics of division." "Abraham Lincoln said that a house divided cannot stand," Mr. Clinton said. "We have been gripped by a politics which says, 'As long as a house is divided, we get re-elected, so what do we care?' The wreckage of that political theroy can been seen every time a child is shot or stabbed in a school, every time a neighborhood is inflamed over ethnic division or racial strife." After his talk, Roberta Gratz, who is working to restore the Eldridge Street Synagogue on Manhattan's Lower East Side, said: "I think he really understands the divisiveness of this society. I haven't heard this rhetoric about bringing people together for 25 years, and it sounds pretty good all of a sudden." Pro-Israel Response Irene Blumberg, a teacher, however, was suspicious. "What does this bubba know from bar mitzvahs?" Asked about Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Mr. Clinton carefully fashioned a pro-Israel response: "My position is we now have the parties at the peace table. Why is the United States only hitting on Israel and never saying publicly anything about what changes the Arabs have to make?" The New York Historical Society exhibition that Mr. Clinton toured featured 350 artifacts, photographs, documents, newspaper clippings and works of art, including Eddie Cantor's blackface makeup and the Yiddish translation of a Langston Hughes poem in a Jewish child's textbook from 1939. Mr. Clinton seemed particularly gripped by the haunting 19th century photographs of two black slaves. "They say he's very slick and programmed, but these photos weren't on the agenda of things for him to look at," said Gretchen Sullivan-Sorin, the curator of the exhibit. "And he was genuinely drawn to them and genuinely moved." Yesterday evening, the Clinton campaign began broadcasting two commercials in New York City. The first is an attack on Mr. Brown's proposal for a "flat tax," which features articles from local newspapers. The second describes Mr. Clinton as a someone who has fought "the Establishment."

958-> THE NATION; An Icy Crash Brings Cries For Change
When snow starts to fall or rain begins to freeze, pilots begin to worry. A dusting of snow or a thin gleam of ice on a plane can disrupt the flow of air over the wings, robbing an aircraft of lift. Slush on a runway slows down tires and can be kicked up into the engines. Wing ice and runway slush are two suspects in the latest winter aviation accident, the blazing dive of a USAir jet into Flushing Bay near New York's La Guardia Airport last Sunday night. The accident killed 27 people, and was the fourth in 11 years in which a commercial jetliner crashed during a North American snowstorm with heavy loss of life. Such crashes have provoked an outcry, and some safety experts are saying that the United States has fallen behind other countries in winter aviation safety. Federal and airline officials, under pressure, have begun looking at the ways European countries de-ice planes, and particularly at the recommendations of a Canadian commission that investigated a 1989 crash very similar to the La Guardia one. A little-noticed safety advisory to Canadian airlines last November from Canada's Department of Transportation concluded that the industry was too optimistic about the effectiveness of its most popular de-icing spray. It said that Type I fluid -- the kind that was last sprayed on the USAir plane half an hour before it took off in a steady snowfall -- melts ice but provides no protection against its forming again. "Type I fluids essentially have zero holdover time under any appreciable precipitation," the document said. "They should not be used in freezing precipitation and should be used solely as a de-icing fluid." The Federal Aviation Administration has approved two de-icing fluids, but has refused to issue guidelines on their effectiveness for fear that pilots may develop a false sense of security and stop checking wings. Both use glycol solutions that let water get colder without freezing by interfering with the formation of ice crystals, said Joseph T. Lee, a manager of de-icing products at Arco Chemical, which sells both kinds. The difference between the two fluids lies in how they are applied and how long they stay on. Type I, a water-ethylene glycol mixture like auto antifreeze, is a pink watery liquid that is heated to 180 degrees Fahrenheit before spraying. It melts ice on contact, but then quickly dribbles off the wing. Type II, propylene glycol, has polymers that make it as thick as light motor oil. It clings to the wing and prevents ice from forming for 15 minutes or more. As the plane accelerates down the runway, the wind breaks the long-chain polymers apart so the fluid blows off before it disrupts the air flow over the wing. But to protect the polymers, slower low-turbulence pumps are used and the fluid is not heated, so spraying a plane takes longer and wing ice isn't melted. "You wouldn't want to put Type II on top of a layer of ice -- it just sits there," Mr. Lee said. Some United States airlines at some airports are beginning to wash off ice with Type I fluid and then spray on Type II. But when Type II fluid blows off, some ends up on the runway. Worried that this may make runways slippery, La Guardia Airport has told airlines that they may use Type II at gates but then must clean it off before taxiing aircraft onto runways. Safety experts and Type II vendors say runways do not become slicker, and complain that removing the liquid undoes the benefits. "Your protection washes down the drain," Mr. Lee said. A commission appointed by the Canadian Parliament to investigate the 1989 crash of a Fokker F28 identical to the one lost by USAir has also come up with several conclusions of interest to American officials. One is that a few hundred jetliners built in the 1960's without extendable metal wing slats for extra lift during takeoff may be vulnerable to wing ice. 'Car Washes' on Runways A Boeing Company study of crashes between 1979 and 1990 found that all seven caused primarily by wing ice involved planes without the slats, even though they now represent a tiny fraction of the world's fleet, said T. Craig Martin, a Boeing spokesman. The Canadian commission also called for airlines to do de-icing closer to runways. Continental Airlines and United Airlines have already set up de-icing fluid "car washes" near runways at several airports. But F.A.A. officials have been reluctant to let more fixed objects be placed near runways for fear that planes will hit them. USAir Flight 405 may have had to accelerate through runway slush. James T. Varsel, a former USAir mechanic who is now a union official, said the carrier had difficulty with tail-mounted engines on aircraft like the DC-9 and F28 because slush kicked up by the tires can be sucked into the engines and cause them to fail. He said mechanics had tried using tire chains and flap shields behind wheels to block the flying slush. Wallace D. Hayes, a professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at Princeton University, said that slush's resistance to tires increased rapidly as a plane gained speed. The National Transportation Safety Board is still looking into the La Guardia runway's condition. The F.A.A. is still cautious about changing de-icing procedures. Its rule on wing ice, written before the advent of jet engines on commercial planes in the 1950's, remains that pilots must either look at the plane or touch it before takeoff.

959-> 5 Sides, 5 Floors, With Plans to Grow
The Pentagon's 6.5 million square feet, incorporating five floors and nearly 18 miles of corridors, are insufficient, the Defense Department says. And so the department is moving ahead with a 10-year, $1 billion plan to renovate and add a 500,000-square-foot annex to its huge headquarters on the banks of the Potomac. No one disputes the need to spruce up the Pentagon, which has not been overhauled in its 50-year history and is in violation of local fire codes, is riddled with asbestos and suffers multiple daily power failures that shut down banks of computers. But the plan to enlarge the headquarters at a time of military cutbacks is running into opposition on Capitol Hill. Article, page 22.

960-> THE NATION; Oh, for a Chance to Chatter at the White House!
As Bill Clinton and Edmund G. Brown fight it out for the Democratic nomination, pollsters and public opinion experts are assessing their strength among the constituencies they need to win. How are they doing with the middle class, labor, blacks, Jews? What no one has troubled to look into is how they are doing among that statistically insignificant but intangibly crucial sector -- intangibly crucial in their own eyes, at least -- the intellectuals. As a class, American intellectuals have never been more than minor players in electoral politics. Or, indeed, in much of anything else. Isolated in universities, "marginalized" -- to borrow a term from contemporary academic discourse -- by the specialization of literary studies, they're perpetually on the verge of obsolescence. In his influential book, "The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe," Russell Jacoby lamented the possible disappearance of an "endangered species" from American life: "While the aging industrial plant of America elicits much talk, the aging intellectual plant passes unnoticed." The last two Republican administrations have only exacerbated the intellectuals' sense of isolation. A handful of neo-conservatives -- influential columnists, editors of well-known journals and denizens of think tanks -- may imagine themselves in proximity to power, but Republicans have always been defiant philistines. The golf course is their chosen turf. (How could Mr. Clinton have ignored such obvious symbolism on his ill-advised jaunt to the Country Club of Little Rock?) Ronald Reagan never pretended to have any use for intellectuals, and neither does George Bush. The Glow of Camelot The Democrats, on the other hand, have always cultivated intellectuals, and intellectuals have returned the favor. "He thought that if Adlai could beat Ike in the November election, Culture would come into its own in Washington," Saul Bellow wrote of the crazy poet Von Humboldt Fleisher in his novel "Humboldt's Gift." Humboldt, like his real-life model, Delmore Schwartz, was convinced that "if Stevenson is in, literature is in." But Mr. Stevenson was out. "The Republic summons Ike,/ the mausoleum in her heart," as Robert Lowell summed it up in his poem "Inauguration Day: January 1953." And so it was until the election of John F. Kennedy, who celebrated his inauguration by inviting Robert Frost to read a poem. The nostalgic glow of Camelot is greatly dimmed now, but for intellectuals the Thousand Days was their last great moment. President Kennedy's brain trust "emptied the Harvard faculty," as Hannah Arendt put it. The White House was a virtual salon. The dinner parties were legendary. "We all drank a great deal, and had to sort of be told not to take our champagne into the concert, to put our cigarettes out -- like children -- though nicely," Mr. Lowell remembered. In a BBC program aired in 1964, the year after the Kennedy assassination, the English writer A. Alvarez went around Manhattan with his tape recorder and gathered eulogies from the New York intellectuals. "Kennedy's style was superb," testified Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary. "He was a man who was post-Freud, post-Marx, post-Einstein." He "thickened things up and gave people a certain sense of our actuality in the social structure," said the critic Lionel Trilling. Norman Mailer called him an "existential hero." Intellectuals revere power as much as any other group, if not more; Kennedy rewarded them with the illusion of it, if not the reality. It was rough sledding after that. Lyndon Johnson was enraged by the opposition of prominent intellectuals to the war in Vietnam; when Mr. Lowell refused to attend a White House Festival of the Arts in 1965 in protest against Johnson's foreign policy -- and drafted a public statement signed by 20 prominent intellectuals to explain his refusal -- the President was apoplectic. So much for the salon. There was no one for intellectuals to like until Eugene McCarthy, who wrote poetry (Mr. Lowell tagged around with him on the campaign trail), and Robert Kennedy, who read Camus and was once observed with a copy of Edith Hamilton's "The Greek Way" in his pocket. But they didn't become President. The next Democrat who did was Jimmy Carter, a middle-brow; his favorite poet was Dylan Thomas. Is Bill Clinton the intellectuals' savior? As long ago as 1988, reporting on their diminished role in American life, U.S. News & World Report compiled a Who's Who of "that endangered modern species" -- and there, between photographs of Robert B. Silvers, the distinguished editor of The New York Review of Books, and Hanna Holborn Gray, president of the University of Chicago, was . . . Gov. Bill Clinton. Why Mr. Clinton? The article didn't explain. Never mind. He was perceived to be on the side of intellectuals. He was there. And success, as Woody Allen said, is largely a matter of showing up. But what about Jerry Brown? He's also got high-minded friends. In New York, preparing for the primary on April 7, he often stays at the East Side home of Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, old friends from California. He's spent time with the radical educator Ivan Illich in Cuernavaca, and among his intellectual cronies is the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes. For policy advice he's said to depend on the economist Lester Thurow and on Richard Goodwin, who was a member of Kennedy's inner circle. (Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton both read Mr. Goodwin's forthcoming book, which is tentatively entitled "Promises to Keep: A Call for a New American Revolution," in manuscript.) Is he a big reader? "He doesn't read as much as he vacuums," Mr. Dunne says. "If he sees a book, he will pick it up, take it back to the bedroom and be ready to discuss it in the morning." The trouble with Mr. Brown, as far as some intellectuals are concerned, is that he's too New Age. While Mr. Clinton golfs, he hangs out at the Buddhist retreat Tassajara in Big Sur. Also, his chances of winning are slim, and intellectuals like a winner as much as anyone else. As the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Clinton has been eagerly adopted by the Endangered Species -- if you include in that category some of the more literate journalists. In the corridors of mental power, Mr. Clinton is clearly the man, the one to revive intellectuals' perennial hope of sharing in a power they've never had, and probably never will have. "Clinton is about the renaissance of policy," declared the political commentator Sidney Blumenthal in a New Republic cover story last month that featured a caricature of Mr. Clinton as Superman. The cover line read "The Anointed." Not that Mr. Clinton, despite being a Rhodes scholar, is necessarily an intellectual himself. He's not like Gov. Mario Cuomo, quoting Teilhard de Chardin to every Albany beat reporter who wanders into his office. On the campaign trail in Illinois, Mr. Clinton pulled out a copy of Sara Paretsky's "Guardian Angel" -- she's a mystery writer, but a literary, highbrow mystery writer. His favorite writers, he has said, are Robert Ludlum and P. D. James -- neither likely to top the "10-best" list of subscribers to Partisan Review. (Well, maybe P. D. James.) But Mr. Clinton seems brainy: he graduated from Yale Law School, he's a Rhodes Scholar, he knows -- and is known to know -- intellectuals. The Right Aura? He's not, however, a member of the Eastern Establishment. "Kennedy was an insider in that world," notes Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who still is. "Clinton is an outsider." What matters is his intellectual aura: Garry Wills publishes an admiring piece about Hillary Clinton in The New York Review of Books, noting her contributions to the Yale Law Journal and the Harvard Educational Review, and describing her as "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades." Arthur Schlesinger detects "an end-of-an-era feeling" that prefigures change -- a kind of Hegelian tide that confirms on the mental plane his theory of a 30-year cycle in American history. Perhaps even more significantly, Mr. Clinton strikes the right intellectual note -- one of worldliness and self-deprecation, of rueful irony. In the latest issue of The American Oxonian, the journal of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars, his entry in the 1968 Class Letter reports that daughter Chelsea, "age 11, 5 feet 2 inches, size 9 shoes," loves ballet more than politics. "Accordingly, says Bill" -- in the artful paraphrase of class secretary Robert B. Reich, the policy analyst from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who is one of Mr. Clinton's chief advisers -- "he and Hillary must have done something right." If Governor Clinton wins, Mr. Reich observes, "Bill will be the very first U.S. President from our Oxford class."

961-> U.S. Says Arab Posturing Stalls Talks on Mideast
The Bush Administration singled out the Palestinians today as being primarily responsible for the lack of progress in the latest round of talks with Israel, saying they were too preoccupied with political posturing and not prepared to engage in serious give and take with Israel. Reporters covering the State Department were invited today for a briefing on the Middle East talks with the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Edward P. Djerejian, who, speaking on the record, said the willingness of all the parties to continue the negotiations was "impressive." But the Administration's criticism of the Palestinians was issued by the State Department only on a "background" basis, without attribution to any speaker. The Department chastised the Palestinians for presenting a plan on self-rule that it called an unrealistic, thinly disguised vehicle for independence aimed not at the Israelis but at their own Palestinian public. Coming Down Hard Other officials said later that it seemed as though the Palestinians had turned their daily briefings into propaganda sessions and were more focused on the media than the actual negotiations and that it was time for them to do more negotiating than posturing. The decision to single out the Palestinians -- while pointedly avoiding any criticism of Israel -- appeared to reflect a sense among Administration Middle East policymakers that the Palestinians are really not negotiating in a realistic manner, as well as domestic American political considerations. The Bush Administration has been at odds with many pro-Israel American Jews over its insistence that Israel only be granted the $10 billion in loan guarantees it is seeking if it freezes all settlement-building in the occupied territories. By coming down hard on the Palestianians in the peace talks, the Administration seemed to be balancing its books a bit. The American complaint about the Palestinians was rooted in the two contrasting proposals that Israelis and Palestinians submitted in the latest round of negotiations, which were supposed to focus on arrangements for "interim self-government" for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israelis proposed discussing 12 different areas of daily life where they would be ready to let the Palestinians run their own affairs -- like taxation, health, education, agriculture. The Israelis also brought along experts in each of those areas to discuss them in detail. The Israeli plan, though, did not offer the Palestinians any mechanism for elections, a freeze on settlements or the prospect of an overall self-rule administration of their own. The Palestinians submitted a plan for holding Palestinian elections by Oct. 29, 1992, for a 180-seat parliament and for the creation of a Palestinian executive authority that would assume total control of all aspects of life in the "Occupied Palestinian Territories" -- the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Administration officials say Israeli maximalist positions are as unwelcome to them as Palestinian ones. Nevertheless, the criticism distinguished the Israeli approach from the Palestinian approach in that the Palestinians see self-government as something that is supposed to be implemented, not negotiated. Palestinian independence is treated as a predesignated outcome, the criticism noted, and that is not consistent with terms of reference for the negotiations or a realistic assessment of what is possible. The Israeli plan, the State Department said, at least provides for a vehicle for substantive negotiations. The sides can talk about real things, like taxation or education, and build on them, it said, and that is what makes it preferable to the Palestinian approach. "You can't start at the end of the road first," said a senior Administration official. "The Palestinians have to engage where they can, pocket whatever the Israelis will give them and put aside the rest for later. But they can't come and complain to us that the talks are meaningless, and that their constituency back home is abandoning them, when they could be engaging on things and selling it back home."

963-> Sports of The Times; The Bulls At High Tide
HERE, in the Venice of the West, where people now paddle through the hallways of their offices, the N.B.A. playoffs come just in time. It may take some minds off the flooding of the Loop area from the waters of the Chicago River: What could come first, a second Bulls championship or a dry Wacker Drive? While the United States Army Corps of Engineers and assorted other agencies attempt to battle the flood disaster, now in its second week, and radio reports inform where to find mass transportation shuttles to avoid the saturated streets and sodden subways, the Bulls, high and dry, and happy about it, began preparation yesterday to defend their title. In north suburban Deerfield, they held their first practice of the real season -- that is, the playoffs -- since they concluded their six-month warm-up period, known as the regular season, with a victory over the Detroit Pistons Sunday. It gave the Bulls a 67-15 record for the season, the fourth best in National Basketball Association history. It was very nice, most agree, but it means nothing. Well, not nothing, but not a great deal, either, since a new day will dawn Friday night, when they are hosts to the Miami Heat in the first round of what they anticipate will be a total of four rounds, ending, as it did last season, in the N.B.A. Finals. "Now reality sets in," said the lengthy coach, Phil Jackson. "In a large sense," said Bill Cartwright, the center, "it all just comes down to the playoffs." So they arrived at the Multiplex, a workout emporium for the locals that houses a small gymnasium, and they came nearly as was written at the time of another noted flood -- "two of every sort," when "all the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven opened." (It happens that it has also been raining here.) Here came a pair of large pivotmen, Cartwright and Will Perdue, and a pair of small guards, John Paxson and B. J. Armstrong, and a pair of lithe forwards, Horace Grant and Scotty Pippen, and -- wait a minute! Where's the other guy, where's Michael Jordan? The Bulls know that they must have Michael if they are to set sail with confidence. And we recall: On Sunday, after the game, Jordan was in terrible pain, having suffered from lower back spasms. He had injured himself in the first quarter, but insisted on playing the full game, wearing a back brace, and wound up scoring 32 points. He was well aware that he needed to score more than 30 points to bring his league-leading average to 30 a game, for the sixth straight season. He finished as the N.B.A. scoring leader, for the sixth straight season, and also finished on his hands and knees and in agony in the trainer's room. Immediately, questions were asked: How serious is this? And was Jordan foolhardy in playing with the pain? And some recalled Jordan's hefty ego -- an item not uncommon among megastars -- and others recalled his history of injury. It seems that as hurt as he sometimes is, he comes back as if having taken a miracle drug. Bulls watchers remember, for example, a game in Portland in November when his back hurt so badly he couldn't take off his game jersey, and boarded the plane still wearing it. The next night, against Sacramento, he scored 30 points. "Where's Michael? Is Michael here?" someone now asked at the Multiplex. From the back door, at that moment, came in Michael. Alone. Which probably would have been the case had he climbed aboard the old ark because there has never been another quite like him. He wore a T-shirt, floppy khakis, a baseball cap and a familiar smile. And he walked a little stiffly, but easily. He didn't practice, but hung out in the trainer's room. Health report: good. Even with Jordan at full strength, said Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, "we aren't going to have an easy road. We're not going 15 and 2 like we did last season. Too many tough teams out there. Miami is young and loose and talented. After that there's Detroit or New York, and then maybe Boston or Cleveland. And that's just to get to the finals." And Phil Jackson recalls the 1973 Knicks, who beat the Celtics in the playoffs, after the Celtics had won 68 games during the regular season. "Yes," said Jackson, "I've alluded to such things with my guys." Despite such reality checks, the Bulls remain the best team in basketball, and their record during the warm-up season just underscored that. Still, accidents do happen. And Chicago has had its share. Ask the people downtown who are now investing in periscopes. But that involved the Chicago River. The Jordan has proved more dependable.

964-> FOOTBALL; H.I.V. Tests Stay Voluntary
The National Football League has no information that any of its players have H.I.V., and because players face a greater risk of infection off the field, the league is not advocating mandatory testing of players for the virus that causes AIDS, Dr. Lawrence Brown, the league's adviser on substance abuse said today. "The data would seem to suggest that the risk for H.I.V. acquisition in the N.F.L. is more due to the behaviors off the field," said Brown. "As a consequence, the decision to test is a private one between the player and his medical provider. We do ask the clubs to provide for their players the information and counseling on how and where they can get H.I.V. testing." Brown and other medical experts talked with trainers and player representatives from the 28 N.F.L. teams at a seminar on drug abuse and AIDS. Brown said the league's policy regarding H.I.V. testing for players remains one that offers voluntary testing for players under the legal guidelines of the states where the teams are based.

967-> Ticketing Merger Is Set
United Airlines said today that it would merge its computer reservation system, Covia, with the Galileo system owned by a group of European airlines. The combination will create the world's largest computerized airline reservation system and the first global network. It will be known as Galileo International. "The computer reservation system business is no longer a regional business," said John C. Pope, United's vice chairman. "Like the airlines business, it has become global." Computerized reservation systems allow travel agents to check flight availability worldwide, quote prices and book passengers with a few computer key strokes. The first system started 20 years ago. In the United States, 90 percent of all flights are booked this way, though the proportion is not as high elsewhere. Sales of the system to travel agents represent a major money maker for airlines. The Galileo and Covia operations will be owned by both groups. All but 10 percent of the stockholding airlines involved hold stakes in both systems, and no money will change hands. Galileo International will be based in Chicago, the headquarters of Covia, and its chief executive, Allen Loren, will take over control of the new group. The merger is to be completed by the end of the year. The UAL Corporation, United's parent, will own 38 percent of Galileo International, the USAir Group 11 percent and Air Canada 1 percent.

968-> HOCKEY; Rangers: 52 Years Of Futility and Still Counting
What's a 53d year, more or less? Perhaps not much in the stubborn purgatory of New York City hockey. But for the Rangers, champions of the regular season in 1991-92 and non-winners of the Stanley Cup since 1940, tonight marked a shattering finish to a spring that was supposed to beget something completely different. In one final disappointing playoff performance, the Rangers bungled everything and were eliminated by the resilient Penguins, 5-1. The Rangers were not rescued by Mark Messier, or by anybody else. Pittsburgh won the Patrick Division finals in six games, without the injured Mario Lemieux but with a pair of ultra-mobile youngsters named Jaromir Jagr and Sean McEachern. As the game ticked to a finish, as shots by Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis found an empty Ranger net, the fans at the Civic Arena did not have to be told what to chant. "1940!" they screamed down at the ice, to every conceivable rhythm from the arena's organ. "1940!" 'Somehow, We Didn't Click' "We had such a good year, and then we never seemed to get it going in the playoffs," Coach Roger Neilson said. "Emotionally, we were there again tonight, and all series. We were hitting. But somehow, we didn't click." Game 6 was decided in the second period, when Jagr burned Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom once again and when McEachern backhanded a loose puck, that had been mishandled by Brian Leetch, through the pads of goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck. The Penguins left the ice after 40 minutes of disciplined hockey with a 3-1 lead, and the defending Stanley Cup champions were not about to relax with such a prize in sight. The Rangers applied considerable pressure in the final 10 minutes, but were foiled by goaltender Tom Barrasso and just plain bad luck. The Rangers thus joined the other three regular-season division winners -- Montreal, Detroit and Vancouver -- in early elimination from the playoffs. Unlike those franchises, however, the Rangers have now gone 52 full, futile seasons without a Stanley Cup, and have assured themselves of at least a 53d year before the curse can be lifted. The Penguins will face the Boston Bruins in the first game of the Wales Conference finals here Sunday. The Rangers hardly resembled the pre-strike team that had steamrolled an entire league. Messier, clearly ailing with back spasms, was a non-factor. He practically disappeared in the second period, when the Penguins outshot the Rangers, 12-5, and took hold of the game. He continued to struggle on faceoffs, and was on the ice for four of the five Pittsburgh goals. "I can certainly feel now for people who have had back problems before," Messier said. "I've played with torn ligaments and all sorts of injuries. But I didn't think it was as hard as it was to play with this. I really feel for Mario Lemieux, for what he's gone through with his back all these years." The Rangers were more cautious about their rough-housing from the start tonight, and they were given a bit more leeway by Referee Kerry Fraser. For the first time in this series it was the Penguins who were called for the first penalty, when rookie McEachern slammed Kris King with a high stick 5 minutes 5 seconds into the game. Finally, in the second period, the Rangers were called for their first penalty of the game, a hook by Mike Gartner on McEachern. They paid for this indiscretion quickly, when Tocchet flipped the puck in from in front of the crease at 5:57 for a power-play goal. Vanbiesbrouck was caught down on the ice on the play, having chased Phil Bourque too far behind the net. The Rangers evened things on a goal by Doug Weight at 7:42, when Sergei Nemchinov made a spectacular play behind the Penguin goal. Holding off Pittsburgh defenseman Paul Stanton, Nemchinov still managed to slide the puck off the side of the net to Weight in front for the easy put-away. That Man Jagr Again This tie lasted only until midway through the second period, when Kevin Stevens's centering pass bounced up off Beukeboom's stick to the glove of Jagr. The 20-year-old Jagr knocked the puck down, then backhanded the puck past Vanbiesbrouck at 11:22. When McEachern's backhander from the slot at 13:43 beat Vanbiesbrouck low, the Penguins were on their way to the conference finals and the Rangers faced another off season of self-examination. "Last year I was angry," General Manager Neil Smith said. "This year, I'm just disappointed. "Every aspect of our organization has to be analyzed," he said in answer a question about the performance of his coaching staff. "No analysis was done yet because I thought we were going to win." SLAP SHOTS Pittsburgh Coach SCOTTY BOWMAN finally said that Rangers Coach ROGER NEILSON was innocent in the ADAM GRAVES incident. "I've known Roger Neilson for a long time," Bowman said. "He's not the kind of coach that people made him out to be." . . . Goaltender JOHN VANBIESBROUCK was called for a penalty shot when he dropped his stick early in the third period and tripped SEAN McEACHERN going around the back of the net. Vanbiesbrouck then smothered McEachern's penalty shot between his pads. . . . Neilson scratched TIE DOMI and dressed TIM KERR, a concession to the realities of a tightly called series.

969-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 3 Very Different Approaches To Pitching the Candidates
IT looks as if the three likely Presidential candidates will be handling their advertising -- like so much else in their political lives -- in three very different ways. Now that President Bush's campaign has assigned its advertising to executives from the giant agencies of Madison Avenue rather than the political consultants of Pennsylvania Avenue, attention has turned to the strategies of Gov. Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, and Ross Perot, who is inching closer to an announcement of a third-party candidacy. At this point, while the Clinton and Perot camps caution that their plans have still not crystallized, it appears they will be organizing their ad work along distinctly varied lines. For Mr. Clinton, plans call for Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Grunwald & Associates, a political consulting firm in Washington, to serve as the "lead agency" for the general election, Frank Greer, senior partner, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Great American Media, a unit of Greer, Margolis, has been producing all the Clinton primary election ads. By contrast, the Bush campaign disclosed on Wednesday that the three-man advertising and media strategy team handling the President's primary campaign would be subsumed into the November Company, a coyly named outfit being run by top executives of a half-dozen giant, well-known ad agencies. In keeping with longstanding plans, Mr. Greer said, Greer, Margolis is "putting together teams from the world of commercial advertising, and from Democratic political advertising firms," to augment his firm's work for Gov. Clinton. He added that he hopes to have them working well before the Democratic National Convention begins in July. While Mr. Greer declined to identify the Madison Avenue executives who might assist Mr. Clinton, he confirmed a report in this week's issue of Advertising Age that Roy Spence, the president of GSD&M Advertising in Austin, Tex., "has offered to help, and I'm sure he'll be involved." One advertising executive who has had success in the political arena questioned that approach. "The campaign managers and handlers just don't get it," said Bill Hillsman, president of North Woods Advertising in Minneapolis, who helped elect the Democrat Paul Wellstone to a Senate seat from Minnesota in 1990 with a series of trenchant television commercials. "They're a lot more comfortable," he added, "with political consultants than Madison Avenue people," who can offer a candidate "far better creativity to get the message out." If Mr. Perot does declare his candidacy, political consultants and Madison Avenue executives say they would expect him to form an advertising organization combining elements of the Bush and Clinton approaches, mixing strategists from the realm of selling products with those from the realm of electing candidates. "I've got to believe that in the next couple of weeks, he will begin to make some infrastructure moves," said Scott Miller, a marketing and political consultant in New Canaan, Conn. Though Mr. Miller worked for Democratic Presidential candidates throughout the 1980's, he has volunteered for the Perot campaign. Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., will not be joining Mr. Miller in promoting Mr. Perot. Perhaps because the iconoclastic shop is to agencies what Mr. Perot is to politics, persistent rumors have linked them. "It must be the dream team," Dan Wieden, president and co-creative director, said, laughing. "As an agency," he added, "we're not interested in taking on political accounts." However the political ad efforts are organized, those involved are already considering how to craft their messages. The November Company has no intention of re-creating the strategy that worked so well for the Tuesday Team, the cadre of Madison Avenue executives who helped re-elect Ronald Reagan in 1984 by proclaiming in gauzy, feel-good spots, "It's morning in America." "Times are different," said Martin Puris, chairman and chief executive of the November Company, who is also president and chief executive at Ammirati & Puris in New York. "And the mood is different." Mr. Puris prefers focusing on President Bush's "accomplishments," adding, "If I could expose everyone in America to the President for two hours in the White House and let him talk, I wouldn't have to do any advertising." That is a point on which Mr. Puris and Mr. Greer can agree. "I've got to tell you, people don't think it's morning in America," Mr. Greer said. His goal, he added, is to present the Clinton campaign as one "that even prior to Perot talked about change, about new directions for the country."

970-> HOME IMPROVEMENT
PROPER pouring, finishing and curing are essential to any project using concrete, the mixture of cement, sand, gravel and water. Correct mixing of these materials was covered in last week's column. Pouring, finishing and curing are done in basically the same way, regardless of the project. Constructing a narrow slab (up to five feet wide) for a walk or patio is described here; space does not permit describing how to build wider slabs, steps or footings, all of which are more complicated and usually regulated by local building codes. Wet concrete cannot hold a shape; therefore it is always poured into a homemade mold -- called a form -- to harden. Most forms are temporary, but forms can also be permanently incorporated into a project, for example as decorative borders. All forms must be sturdily built of lumber, plywood or sheet metal, and generally must be braced with stakes driven into the ground. Some excavation is always needed to establish a level base beneath the concrete and to permit installing the forms. For a walk or patio, remove eight inches of soil to accommodate a six-inch layer of gravel for drainage and support, and a slab about four inches thick, the standard thickness. (The normal height of a walk or patio is two inches above ground level.) On firm, well-drained ground, the gravel need be only four inches thick. In all cases, dig an area about a foot wider on all sides than the area of the slab. To build the forms, mark the perimeter of the slab on the excavated surface. Enlarge the width by the thickness of the form material (for the forms described below add one and a half inches to each side), then drive sharpened 18-inch stakes made of 2-by-2-inch or similar lumber into the ground at each new corner. Drive the stakes about six inches deep. Mark the height of the slab above the excavated ground (10 inches, assuming a six-inch gravel layer) on the stakes at one end of the slab, then tie strings at that height and stretch them along the sides of the slab to the other pair. Measure with either a line level or a hose level (both are available at hardware stores) to assure that the strings are horizontal; then tie them. Use the strings as guides for driving additional stakes at approximately three-foot intervals. Mark each stake where the string crosses it, then remove the strings. Place lengths of 2-by-4 lumber against the inner faces of the stakes so the boards' top edges are even with the marks. Nail through the stakes into the boards using double-headed nails (available at building supply stores) to make the forms easy to dismantle later. When nailing, support the board with a large rock or a sledge hammer opposite the nail. After assembling the form's sides, measure between them to check that they are parallel and lay a straight board with a level on it across their tops to make sure they are the same height. Then adjust one side by driving the stakes deeper so that the slab slopes a quarter of an inch per foot for drainage (a total of an inch and a quarter for a five-foot slab). In the same way, attach 2-by-4's across the ends of the form, then saw off the projecting tops of all stakes. When the forms are finished, the corner stakes can be removed. Fill the area inside the form with gravel to the required depth and tamp it with a heavy post or a rented tamper. Smooth the surface with a homemade screed, a 2-by-4 cut to fit the inside width of the form attached to a similar board cut long enough to span the form's sides. (To attach the boards, place them edge to edge and nail into each through short pieces of lumber placed across the seam.) Brush the inside of the form with motor oil or a commercial releasing agent available at building supply stores. Dampen the gravel with gentle spray from a garden hose. Now you are ready to take delivery of professionally-mixed concrete or to mix and pour concrete yourself. For the latter, pour by dumping a wheelbarrow load at one end of the form and spreading it with a shovel into the corners. Then dump successive loads next to each other and spread them so the form is overfilled by about half an inch. Jab the concrete with the shovel to eliminate air pockets. When the form is filled, use a long, straight board to compact and level the concrete by placing the board on edge across the form and moving it in a zig-zag pattern, as if sawing, from one end to the other. You will probably need a helper for this. Afterward, smooth the surface with a bull float (a board having a long, pivoting handle) or a darby (a smaller board with a fixed handle). These tools, plus others mentioned below, are available at most large hardware stores. Push both tools back and forth or in wide arcs, raising the forward edge to avoid digging the tool into the soft concrete. When finished, slice about an inch deep with a mason's trowel between the form and the concrete. Before proceeding further, wait until the concrete is hard enough to hold an impression when pressed with a finger and all water on the surface has disappeared. This may take about an hour. Then round off the slab's edges by sliding a metal edging tool along the route taken with the trowel, and also use a metal grooving tool to cut grooves across the slab's width to control cracking. When doing this, lay a board across the forms as a straight edge. Cut grooves at five-foot intervals in slabs three- to five-feet wide and at three-foot intervals for narrower slabs. As a final finishing step, polish the surface with a small metal trowel called a float, or roughen it by gently sweeping with a stiff-bristled broom. Do not overwork the surface or it will become powdery when cured. To cure the finished slab so that it reaches full strength, spray it with water and keep it tightly covered for seven days with plastic sheeting weighted around the edges. After a week, remove the plastic and the forms but do not allow heavy traffic on the slab for another week.

972-> Norwest Deal Blocked
The Federal Reserve has blocked a proposed takeover of a South Dakota bank by the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, saying the proposed deal would have given Norwest too great a share of the Rapid City market. Norwest's South Dakota subsidiary had sought to buy the assets of the First Federal Savings Bank of South Dakota, based in Rapid City. The Fed said the takeover would have left Norwest with close to 50 percent of total deposits in the Rapid City area and would have given Norwest control of 20 of the 48 bank branches there.

974-> Report Shows Poor Families Going Hungry
Twenty percent of low-income families in Queens with at least one child under 12 years old have at times gone hungry, in some cases because they were not aware that they qualified for Government food assistance, according to a report that will be released today on the extent of hunger in the borough. The report, the Queens Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project, was one of several studies on hunger commissioned across the country by the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. The Queens study, which was sponsored in part by the New York City Human Resources Administration, was based on a survey conducted of 389 low-income families in the borough last spring. Besides finding that 1 out of 5 of the families surveyed had experienced hunger, the report said that 47 percent of those families had at some point run out of money to buy food. The report also said that 20 percent of the families acknowledged reducing the size of a child's meal or skipping a meal altogether because there was not enough money to buy food. 'Eradicating Hunger' "Simply stated," the writers of the report concluded, "the key to eradicating hunger, if that is an acceptable goal in these dark fiscal times, requires that jobs be available for those who seek them and that the wages derived from those jobs should bring people out of poverty." Lawrence M. Mead, an associate professor of politics at New York University and an expert on urban poverty, said yesterday that, though he had not read the report, the findings sounded very reasonable and unsurprising, in part because some families are not resourceful enough to take advantage of available programs. Among Federal hunger initiatives, the report found that almost 40 percent of the families who were eligible for the Food Stamps program or the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, were not participating in those programs, in many cases because they did not know they were eligible or were too embarrassed to apply.

977-> U.S. Urges Doctors to Fight Surgical Pain (and Myths)
The Government recommended today that doctors provide painkillers swiftly and aggressively to patients after surgery to decrease suffering and speed recovery. Federal health officials said myths about pain and its management cause half of the patients who undergo surgery in more than 23 million procedures each year to suffer unrelieved, unnecessary pain. "We can do more, and we can do better, to control pain after surgery," the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, said at a news conference. "This guideline discusses the actual physical damage which a patient can sometimes suffer as a result of pain, and it shows that inadequately managed pain can inhibit recovery, prolong hospitalization and thus potentially contribute to higher-than-necessary costs." Talks With Patients Urged In the first of a series of nonbinding medical care guidelines, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a new agency mandated by Congress, called on doctors and nurses to take more time to monitor and measure pain and to treat it aggressively with drugs, relaxation therapy and other means. It is no longer sufficient to give pain medication "as needed," or only after the patient complains, said the guidelines. Doctors should work with patients before and after surgery to plan medication and other treatment to keep patients as pain-free as possible, they said. To aid in this, doctors should make it common practice to have patients rate their pain, such as using a simple 10-point scale, to track progress in managing it, the guidelines said. The guidelines said numerous studies show it is easier to control pain before it starts, or when it is at a low level, than to wait until the patient is suffering. "Prevention is better than treatment," said the guidelines. "Pain that is established and severe is difficult to control." "When doctors simply call for injections of such painkillers as morphine and codeine 'as needed,' the results are often undermedication and unnecessary pain in roughly half the patients," said Dr. James O. Mason, head of the Public Health Service, of which the new agency is a component. Dr. Mason said part of the problem was myths about pain "that have become part of our culture" -- such notions that pain is necessary to build character, that infants do not feel pain, that elderly patients have a higher pain tolerance and that narcotics used for postoperative pain are often addictive. The postoperative pain guidelines are the first of many planned by the new health policy and research agency, which is charged with developing advice for doctors and other professionals concerning health practices that may be the center of uncertainty, and improving the quality and efficiency of patient care. Unlike similar consensus conferences on health issues sponsored by other government agencies and private groups, the new agency's work focuses on more extensive examinations of medical literature concerning practices that are in wide use, said Dr. J. Jarrett Clinton, administrator of the agency. After gathering further information from other sources, such as public meetings and interviews, expert panels assembled by the agency develop treatment guidelines. Dr. Clinton said a big difference between these guidelines and those from other groups is that they have been tested at hospitals and clinics before they are released. In coming months, the agency hopes to release similar sets of guidelines concerning such problems as treating cancer pain, senility, urinary incontinence and patients who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS but who have not yet developed symptoms. Not Trying to Dictate Dr. Mason said that the guidelines were voluntary and were not an attempt by the Government to dictate medical practice. The guidelines should be viewed like those on immunization or AIDS care issued by the Federal Centers for Disease Control, or the recommendations of panels from the National Institutes of Health, which are generally accepted by doctors nationwide, he said. Dr. James Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, and Dr. Barbara Redman, executive director of the American Nurses Association, immediatedly endorsed the pain guidelines. "They do not dictate treatment and must never be viewed as 'cookbook medicine,' " Dr. Todd said at the news briefing. "These are guidelines, which we prefer to called parameters because they define a range of options available for doing something. It's still individual care." To study pain, the agency brought together an 18-member panel that included specialists in pediatrics, neurology, physical therapy, pharmacy and medical ethics, nurses, pain experts and a consumer representative. The panel, headed by Dr. Daniel B. Carr of Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. Ada K. Jacox, a registered nurse and sociologist with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, began working on the guidelines in 1990. Use of Morphine Discussed The panel's recommendations, which also cover pain management for trauma and certain diagnostic procedures, discusses types of drugs that should be used, from narcotics to aspirin, dosages and dose schedules. For instance, the guidelines recommend using morphine first, instead of meperidine or Demerol as is common now, for managing severe postoperative pain because morphine is easier to use for continuous dosing. Dr. Jacox noted that doctors and patients have been reluctant to use morphine because of fears of addiction, but several good studies indicate this risk is very small, occurring in less than 0.04 percent of cases. The panel also issued these recommendations and findings regarding pain: *Newborn infants, especially those born prematurely, require special pain treatment, and adequate relief is necessary for medical and ethical reasons. Recent studies do not support the belief that painkillers dangerously depress infant breathing. *Relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, as well as such nondrug methods as applying heat, cold or massage can help decrease postoperative pain. *Patients, particularly the elderly who may have misguided ideas about stoicly enduring it, should be encouraged to report pain. *People with well-controlled pain, such as those who self-medicate through metered intravenous infusion pumps, tend to be discharged earlier and may suffer fewer chronic pain problems later. The Health and Human Services Department said the guidelines would be distributed to doctors, nurses, professional medical societies, health care schools, insurers and consumer groups. An abbreviated version for patients, now in English and soon in Spanish, will also be available. The entire practice guide for professionals, quick reference guides for pain management in adults or children, and the patient guide are available without cost from the AHCPR Publications Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, Md. 20907, or by calling a toll-free telephone number, 800-358-9295.

978-> Gunshots Fired at Congressional Candidate in Bitter Chicago Race
The volatile race between Gus Savage, the firebrand six-term Congressman, and his challenger, Melvin J. Reynolds, a political moderate and former Rhodes scholar, took a bizarre turn late Thursday night when Mr. Reynolds was injured as shots were fired into his campaign car. Mr. Reynolds was cut on the right side of his forehead by shards of glass, shattered by at least two gunshots from an adjacent car five days before Tuesday's 17 primary. He was treated at a nearby South Side hospital and released that night. The incident occurred about 10 P.M. while Mr. Reynolds was stopped at traffic light on a residential street as he was returning home from a day of campaigning. Speculation About Shooting As the police began their investigation and assigned plainsclothes officers to escort Mr. Reynolds round-the-clock, there was more speculation than fact. Supporters of Mr. Reynolds stopped just short of directly accusing the incumbent of any wrongdoing, while supporters of Mr. Savage accused Mr. Reynolds of setting up the shooting to gain voter sympathy. Others figured that it was yet another random shooting in a troubled neighborhood and said all it proved was that maybe both men needed to spend more time talking about violence in the district than about each other. "The rumors are flying," said Paul Green, a political science professor at Governors State University. "Is it Savage or is it a setup? Or is it the travails of being in a car at night in that neighborhood? Either way, you know you're not in New Hampshire anymore." Today Mr. Reynolds, indignant and red-eyed, said that he did not know who might have fired the shots and said that he could not imagine Mr. Savage planning a shooting. But he blamed what he called the Congressman's incendiary politics for creating a heated atmosphere. Mr. Savage, for example, has called Mr. Reynolds "a plantation politician," beholden to Jewish supporters who the Congressman says want to control blacks. "When you insinuate and make wild accusations, perhaps you should think about the consequences of your words," Mr. Reynolds, a community organizer and former college professor and administrator, said at a news conference. "Gus is a master at racial politics, a master at it." Mr. Savage did not return telephone calls to his campaign headquarters and aides would only say that they were busy planning a "Truth Rally" on Saturday at a South Side Baptist church. The two men, both of them black, are in the middle of an impassioned, neck-and-neck campaign for the state's newly drawn Second Congressional District, once a mostly black, working-class district that has now become whiter and more affluent with the addition of suburbs to the south. It is the third time the two men have faced each other in a battle for the district. In previous Democratic primaries, Mr. Savage won by a narrow majority as Mr. Reynolds split the anti-Savage vote with a third candidate. This time there is no third candidate. And the district's new voter mix, which is now 48 percent suburban, was seen as a benefit to the 40-year-old Mr. Reynolds, whose appeals for accountability and racial unity sit well with middle-class black moderates embarrassed by Mr. Savage and whites frightened by his often combative, racially charged speech. But the 66-year-old Mr. Savage has deep roots in his loyal black wards where people remember his crusading civil rights days as the publisher of a community newspaper and do not care what his mainstream critics think. A Chicago Tribune poll of registered voters found Mr. Savage leading Mr. Reynolds, 44 percent to 35 percent, with 21 percent undecided. The poll, conducted Feb. 19-21, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. In recent weeks, Mr. Reynolds is believed to have narrowed the gap. "Ten days ago, I would have bet you the best dinner in town on Gus," said Don Rose, a longtime political consultant. "But it is a much tighter race than I would have expected." For now, the shooting is expected to help Mr. Reynolds pick up support. In campaign appearances and radio spots, he has attacked the incumbent's political persona as divisive and ultimately harmful to constituents, who he says lose out because Mr. Savage has alienated possible allies. But Mr. Savage's followers consider Mr. Reynolds a turncoat for running against their Congressman. They do not want to hear about how Mr. Savage had the worst attendance record in the House in his first term or about accusations that he made unwanted sexual advances to a Peace Corps worker on an official trip to Africa two years ago. That hostility has made Mr. Reynolds vulnerable, his supporters and some analysts say. Vandals have twice broken windows at his campaign headquarters and he has reported being threatened with physical harm. For the last six weeks, he has been wearing a bulletproof vest, which he said he was wearing during the shooting. "Last night someone tried to kill me," Mr. Reynolds said at the news conference. "It wasn't pleasant; it wasn't funny. It's something I hope I never have to go through again." Democratic Party leaders tried to rise above the incident. "This is not the Al Capone era," said Thomas G. Lyons, chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County. "It's a big city here with a lot of people in it that from time to time do strange things. I don't think there is anything that should be read into that. It might make another argument for gun control." In a place where politics is a municipal pastime and where ballots have been cast in the names of dead voters, some people shrugged off the shooting. "This is one of the oldest political gimmicks in the book," said William Shaw, a Democratic State Representative and ward committeeman in Mr. Savage's district. "These Chicago politicians will go to any length. I think people will see through this and send the Congressman back to Congress." Speculation on Cause Some said that while Mr. Savage might be many things, he was not violent. "It doesn't strike me as anything halfway related to Savage's style," Mr. Rose said. "For my money it's either random or a setup." Others said some of Mr. Savage's followers might have taken his bellicose words too seriously. "Savage's supporters are very emotionally tied to their representative" said John Pelissero, an associate professor of political science at Loyola University. "If they see anyone, even another African-American, as a threat to him, they might get very upset." Either way, most people agree that Tuesday will be Mr. Reynolds's best and maybe only chance to beat Mr. Savage. But few are counting on it.

979-> HOCKEY; Just Try To Stop Them Now
They changed ownership after last season, lost their Stanley Cup winning coach during the regular season and their most valuable player during the playoffs. But the Pittsburgh Penguins never ceased to persevere. Tonight, their resilience paid off with a 5-1 victory over the Rangers that ended the Patrick Division finals in six games. "We've been fighting adversity since last fall," said Bryan Trottier, who is seeking his second Stanley Cup ring with the Penguins after earning four with the Islanders. "This group worked harder after we lost some key players." While the Rangers go home to endure the pain and agony that comes with failure after high expectations, Trottier and the Penguins move on to face the Boston Bruins in the semifinals for hockey's most coveted prize After they finished sixth among the 22 teams in the National Hockey League at the end of the regular season, tied with the Devils and Chicago with 87 points, few gave the Penguins a chance to get past the first round of the playoffs against Washington. This was especially the case after the Penguins had lost three of the first four games of that series. But the Penguins, who won their first Stanley Cup last year under Bob Johnson, who died of a brain tumor last fall, captured the last three games with Washington. Despite their impressive rally against the Capitals, the Penguins were still the overwhelming underdog against the Rangers, the league's top team in the regular season with 105 points and 50 victories. And Pittsburgh's chances against the Rangers diminished even more with the loss through injury of Mario Lemieux, Joe Mullen and Bob Errey. Lemieux's broken left hand, however, seemed to lift the Penguins to a higher level of play, to knit a team that had no choice but to band together or be dethroned. Although they had to replace three of their top players with reinforcements from Muskegon, the Penguins rallied and played solid hockey over the last four games. With little known players like Jock Callander, Mike Needham and Dave Michayluk, the Penguins found ways to hold their own against the glamorous New Yorkers. Under the guidance of Craig Patrick, the general manager, and the tutelage of Scotty Bowman, who took over the coaching reins on an interim basis after the death of Johnson, the Penguins are serious Stanley Cup contenders again. They reached the semifinals tonight by getting solid performances from such key players as Tom Barraso, Jaromir Jagr, Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis. Barrasso made 33 saves, several of the spectacular kind, keeping the Penguins in the game when he had to. In the scoreless first period, he made 15 saves, and in the third period, he held fast as the Rangers were pressing in desperation. "Tommy was just solid," Bowman said. "He gave us a key Game in New York in Game 5 and again tonight." Tocchet and Jagr also repeated their heroics of Game 5 at Madison Square Garden two nights ago. Tocchet again scored the game's first goal, again on the game's first manpower advantage for the Penguins, except that this time it came in the second period. Jagr again had the winning goal, giving the Penguins a 2-1 lead 11 minutes 22 seconds into the middle period after Doug Weight had tied it for the Rangers. Shawn McEachern got the third goal before empty-net goals by Tocchet and Francis sealed the victory for the Penguins. SLAP SHOTS In what must be a Stanley Cup record, another penalty shot was awarded to the Penguins, who had one in Game 5, too. Unlike the one Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden that JAROMIR JAGR converted, this time JOHN VANBIESBROUCK stopped the shooter, SHAWN McEACHERN. The penalty shot was awarded to McEachern after the official ruled that Vanbiesbrouck threw his stick at the puck controlled by McEachern.

980-> Review/Ballet; A Baryshnikov Debut at Age 44, In Balanchine's 'Duo Concertant'
At the age of 44 and with several knee operations behind him, Mikhail Baryshnikov cannot be expected to be the dancer he once was. Yet his stage presence remains as potent as his reputation and George Balanchine's "Duo Concertant," which balances stillness with movement, was the perfect vehicle for the superstar's appearance with the New York City Ballet on Saturday night. Box office appeal raised its not-so-subtle head at this first of six guest performances by Mr. Baryshnikov this month at the New York State Theater with the City Ballet. Ticket sales have slipped, as they have for American Ballet Theater this spring. But as this occasion proved, higher-than-ever prices in a recession are no deterrent when the public is offered what it perceives as something outside the everyday dance event. The City Ballet, even under Balanchine, has never been rigid about a policy that supposedly excludes guests. Mr. Baryshnikov left the City Ballet in 1979 after dancing with it for 15 months. A few years later, although he was then artistic director of Ballet Theater, he returned for a handful of appearances in Balanchine's "Steadfast Tin Soldier." In this case he is obviously giving the City Ballet a boost (the house was packed). In return he is surely deriving some artistic satisfaction from a debut in a Balanchine ballet, albeit an atypical one. Mr. Baryshnikov himself has made no bones about the fact that his classical virtuoso days are over; he could conceivably still execute the bravura feats that thrilled his initial audience but this would be at great physical cost. In recent years he has turned to modern dance. Last October he was a guest with Martha Graham's company at the City Center and three weeks ago he performed a Mark Morris solo for the "Friends in Deed" benefit at the Joyce Theater. For the most part, he has been touring with his own modern-dance troupe, the White Oak Dance Project, which has yet to appear in New York. In one of his interviews, which publicized the group's European tour, Mr. Baryshnikov suggested that he could not now meet the technical demands of William Forsythe, whose latest work for the City Ballet was also on this program. "Duo Concertant," created by Balanchine for the City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival, makes demands of a very different sort. The entire ballet is a poetic conceit: Two dancers pretend to listen to an onstage pianist and violinist and then start dancing as if the music impels them to do so. The idea that music is the springboard for dancing (as is not necessarily true for some other choreographers) is a given in Balanchine's world. But here the choreographer turns his credo into a mini-allegory. In the last of the five sections, the woman seemingly represents a muse. She and the man cannot find each other at first but finally she remains rooted to the spot as he kneels at her feet: the lover before his feminine ideal, the cavalier before the ballerina, Balanchine's artistic ideal. Mr. Baryshnikov, when not required to stand still, plunged into the choreography with the same fierce attack he originally showed in other Stravinsky-Balanchine ballets like "Apollo" and "Rubies." His emphasis again was on accents and staccato phrasing. If he eventually toned down this approach under Balanchine's guidance, in this instance it created a dramatic relationship with Yvonne Borree, his young partner, that was not out of place. Some of the stage images were even reinforced through this boldness and the moment when both dancers suddenly begin dancing, their mimicry of the musicians, which often goes unnoticed, stood out in witty clarity. Miss Borree mimed violin playing and Mr. Baryshnikov attacked an invisible keyboard. The very real musicians were the violinist Guillermo Figueroa and Jerry Zimmerman who played the grand piano behind which the dancers were first seen. It was up to Mr. Figueroa to carry the burden of expressing the lyricism that was Stravinsky's concern here and he did so admirably. Although other casts have danced this chamber ballet to chamber music since Peter Martins and Kay Mazzo originated the roles, the model has been the nobility of that first cast. Miss Borree, a corps member already cast prominently in the City Ballet repertory, and Mr. Baryshnikov made for a livelier, more realistic duo. They stood and listened obediently by the piano in the opening Cantilena section and sprang into action for the next two Eclogues. The dancing looked more compact and snappier than usual, but its swoons, elongated with swanlike beauty by Miss Borree, presaged the final section. The Gigue contrasted Mr. Baryshnikov's bouncy phrasing against Miss Bourree's sleekness, although both blurred the small crossing steps. The ballet's affected moments -- professional dancers holding hands like children -- become affecting at the end. In this Dithyramb the two dancers seek each other in the darkness. Mr. Baryshnikov threw himself down before his confident young ballerina with wonderfully blunt romantic ardor. He was warmly received by the audience as were the casts in the other ballets, including Mr. Forsythe's "Herman Schmerman." In Balanchine's "Prodigal Son," Robert La Fosse reversed the Tom Sawyerish innocence of his duet with Helene Alexopoulos's wittly danced Siren with the heart-wrenching drama of his final scene. Peter Boal repeated his fine questing solo in Balanchine's "Square Dance," in which Nichol Hlinka gave every step more than full value through her exceptionally articulate dancing and musicality.

981-> Lorenzo Tanada Philippine Politician, 93
Former Senator Lorenzo Tanada, a longtime opponent of Washington's role in the Philippines, died today. He was 93 years old. Mr. Tanada, who had been undergoing kidney dialysis, died on the way to a hospital, his family said. He was elected to the first Philippine Senate in 1947 and served for 24 years, longer than any other senator. He organized the Anti-Bases Coalition and other groups to rally public opposition to the presence of American troops. In September, Mr. Tanada received a standing ovation from the Senate after it rejected a new lease for the Subic Bay naval base, the last American military installation in the Philippines. Mr. Tanda is survived by his wife, Expedita, and nine children, including Senator Wigberto Tanada.

982-> BASEBALL; Special Sadness for Nixon As His Friend Is Banned
Otis Nixon had just returned home Thursday night when he turned on the television set and learned the news about Yankee pitcher Pascual Perez. Today, he acknowledged that it struck him immediately. Nixon said the announcement that Perez had once again tested positive for illegal drugs left him sad. But the emotions the Atlanta Braves outfielder felt were probably more complex than that. Last season, Nixon went through his own drug-related episode, a positive test that resulted in a 60-day suspension last September and kept him from playing in the National League Championship Series and the World Series. "Pascual is a personal friend of mine," Nixon said. "When I heard about it last night, it hurt. I had a lump in my throat." Permitted to Train Nixon must sit out the first 16 games of the 1992 season to complete the suspension he received last Sept. 16, but he is permitted to train with the Braves, and today he played in an exhibition game against the Yankees here at Fort Lauderdale Stadium. In 1988 and 1989, Nixon and Perez were teammates on the Montreal Expos for a season and a half. Nixon said they attended group aftercare sessions in 1989 after Perez submitted to drug rehabilitation early that year. Nixon acknowledged that dealing with his own addiction is a daily struggle. "You can't put it behind you," he said. "It's something you deal with on a daily basis. The most important thing is a strong aftercare program. If you get that together, everything else will follow." On days like today, he said, when it becomes fresh in his mind again, it is the things he has learned in the aftercare sessions that carry him through. "If a situation comes up like this that's out there in front of me, I've got things I do on a daily basis in my aftercare program," he explained. "It's not like I wake up and think about drugs and I go to sleep thinking about drugs. It's not like that at all." Nixon said he would attempt to speak with Perez just to offer his best wishes, not his advice. But it was clear today that the Yankee pitcher was on his mind. "He's a very good person," Nixon said. "You see him on the field and see him pitch, and you think he's a very different person or pitcher. But he's a good person deep down."

984-> Study Suggests Early Prostate Cancer May Be Best Left Alone
Men with early prostate cancer who are not treated for their disease have excellent survival rates that rival those seen in patients who receive aggressive therapy against the malignancy, Swedish researchers have reported. The finding suggests that for a subgroup of patients with the tumor, doing nothing may be as good or better than surgically removing the prostate gland or blasting it with radiation, the standard treatments in the United States for early-stage prostate cancer. Some doctors applauded the new report for highlighting scientific ignorance about the best way to approach prostate cancer, a disease that varies widely in its aggressiveness and how lethal it is. But others condemned the study as highly misleading and having little or no relevance to the great majority of prostate cancer patients. The critics worried that the report could lull men into believing that prostate cancer was relatively benign and could be shrugged off as a nuisance of the elderly, when in fact it is the type of cancer that is the second-biggest killer of American men, after lung cancer. The disease afflicts a pecan-sized gland at the base of the bladder that generates fluid to nourish sperm. 'Could Be Very Harmful' Dr. Jan-Erik Johansson and his colleagues at Orebro Medical Center Hospital and Uppsala University in Sweden are reporting their results today in The Journal of the American Medical Association. "Why JAMA would accept a paper like this absolutely shocks me," said Dr. Patrick W. Walsh of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. "I think it absolutely could misdirect people, and it could be very harmful." Dr. Walsh is an author of another report in the journal showing that the levels of a blood protein called prostate-specific antigen is a sensitive technique for diagnosing prostate cancer, particularly when used in conjunction with an annual rectal examination. The two new studies should jointly raise the pitch of an already strident debate among doctors over the merits of early detection of prostate cancer. The Swedish study may also call into question the belief among Americans and their surgeons that the best way to treat prostate cancer, like any other malignancy, is by routing it out as quickly and completely as possible. No Initial Therapy In the new Swedish study, the researchers followed 223 patients with very early prostate cancer, defined as a tumor that was still confined to the gland and that bore cellular traits marking it as differentiated, a relatively indolent type of malignancy. The patients received no initial therapy for their disease. Ten years after the original diagnosis, only 10 percent had died of prostate cancer, a figure that does not differ significantly from success rates with surgery for an early-stage tumor. The disease had progressed somewhat in another 24 percent of the Swedish patients, but not to the point where it was likely to kill them soon. Dr. Johannson said the latest results did not prove that no therapy was as good as surgery but showed instead that the benefits of surgery had yet to be scientifically demonstrated. "We are not saying that therapy is of no use," he said. "We are saying that surgery should be thought of as still experimental." Some researchers proposed that those whose surgery for prostate cancer was a success might be just those who had a relatively benign form of the illness to begin with, and thus would have fared well even without treatment. They have also proposed that those who die of the disease could be afflicted with such a malevolent cancer that no matter what was done, they were likely to die. "I'm highly supportive of Dr. Johansson's work, and I think it's very, very important," said Dr. Willet F. Whitmore Jr., an attending surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York who has studied prostate cancer. But other urologists criticized the study for being highly selective in choosing which patients to include. "When they set up their selection criteria, they picked people so they would have a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Dr. William J. Catalona of Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis. Others criticized the researchers for masking unpleasant data that tarnished the seemingly rosy outcome of some patients. For example, Dr. Walsh said, when the disease progressed, patients ended up needing either to have their testicles removed or to undergo chemical castration with hormones. Doctors are struggling to understand prostate cancer better. It has surged in frequency by more than 50 percent since 1973, and this year about 122,000 American men are expected to contract the cancer, while about 32,000 will die of it. The cancer is especially prevalent among older men,

985-> THE EARTH SUMMIT; What Some Preach in Rio Is Not What They Practice at Home
Environmentalists from the global North and South, who may not agree on much else about how to save the world's environment, are united on one contention: When the Earth Summit is over and nations face the task of putting promises to work, the people most likely to make a success of saving the planet will not be found in large international bodies but in small grass-roots organizations caring for their own land. Whether governments in many developing nations will allow them to assume this role is another matter. In some of the nations whose leaders were most strident in Rio in condemning the industrial world -- among them Malaysia, India and Indonesia -- environmental groups and individual campaigners have been harassed, assaulted and arrested. In Kenya, an environmentalist. Wangari Maathai, was nearly beaten to death by policemen this year. "The third world cannot wrap itself in a green flag and lecture to everybody," said Michael Wright, senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, who ran its program linking local development to human needs. "It's a mixed record." While good working relationships between governments and grass-roots organizations have developed in places as scattered as Zimbabwe, Costa Rica or Bangladesh, leaders of environmental and social-action groups in many other developing countries have drawn official ire by challenging government excuses for environmental failures. They rarely get an international hearing. World Bank's Role Opposed These dissident environmentalists say, for example, that poverty is frequently not the main cause of the degradation of forests and waters, or the explanation for overpopulation. They doubt that more money in the hands of their governments will solve environmental problems as long as politicians are not held accountable by the people and corruption erodes enforcement of laws protecting nature. They oppose the global environmental policy role being assumed by the World Bank. "There continues to be a significant gap between ecological priorities perceived by these environmental and social-action groups and the ecological priorities of governments and global organizations," said Smitu Kothari, who leads protests in India against the dislocations caused by a huge hydroelectric and irrigation project in the Narmada River valley. The project, supported by the World Bank, has drawn criticism from human rights and environmental groups in Japan, the United States and Europe as well as in India. "The World Bank is one of the most unaccountable institutions on the planet," Mr. Kothari said in an interview. "It doesn't consult local people. Unless local communities really come into their own and are given control, you are not going to be able to save land and recover our ecosystems." Government pressure on environmentalists has been most intense in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, in northern Borneo, where loggers with political connections are razing tropical rain forests and displacing thousands of indigenous people. Earth torn from hillsides once covered with jungle tumbles into Borneo's powerful rivers, which run brown as chocolate, discharging streams of mud into the turquoise waters of the South China Sea. Two organizations, Friends of the Earth Malaysia and the World Rain Forest Movement, have been under official scrutiny and criticism for years. Another Malaysian group, the Environmental Protection Society, has been called "a thorn in the flesh of the nation" by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 1987, five environmentalists were imprisoned as "security risks" for opposing a proposed dump for radioactive waste. Malaysia, now Japan's largest supplier of tropical timber from Southeast Asia, is among those nations most opposed to an international treaty that would monitor forest use. Even in the Philippines, where President Corazon C. Aquino has encouraged the growth of environmental groups and given local organizations and clans the power to make decisions about the use of their natural resources, journalists who expose links between politicians and concessionaires doing illegal logging or mining get death threats, a Filipino reporter who received such a warning said in an interview from Manila. In China, rapid desertification, the loss of lakes and rivers and the destruction of forests were catalogued by He Bochuan, a lecturer in philosophy at Sun Yat Sen University in Guangdong, in a book recently translated into English as "China on the Edge: The Crisis of Ecology and Development." He saw official policies at the root of most problems. "False reporting, ineptitude and bad management are the main causes for the huge discrepancy between the impressive claims and the meager results of China's reforestation campaign," he wrote, explaining why China lags well behind most other nations in protecting or restoring forest cover. A Natural Link The book was withdrawn from circulation in China after the suppression of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The link between environmentalism and political change is a natural one, leaders of the movement say. "In Eastern Europe it was the environmental groups that first acquired legitimacy as nongovernmental forces and became the focus of opposition," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute. Mr. Wright of the World Wildlife Fund said that environmental action thrived best in a democratic, multiparty setting where popular participation in government is strong. "It's hard to find an environmentally responsive dictatorship," he said. Mr. Brown sees a lot of hope in the phenomenal growth over the last few years of nongovernmental organizations in the developing world and their increasing ability to communicate internationally with like-minded people. But he said that these groups needed to expand in size and membership to exert influence on recalcitrant governments. Nongovernmental organizations "have to broaden their bases to include the stalwarts of the community, otherwise governments like Malaysia's and others' can continue to make life very difficult for environmentalists," he said. Intellectual Leadership Mr. Brown said that environmental groups had provided the intellectual leadership worldwide on ecological issues. "There is not a single national government with a global environmental research organization," he said. "At Rio, we could see the dependence on environment groups for information." After Rio, said Mr. Wright, the world has to get down to building "intermediate organizations" to serve as links to local environmental groups. "We've got to get something between the megadonors and the poor woman in the village trying to feed her family," he said.

986-> Off the Rolls -- A special report.; Cuts for New York and Connecticut
New York have adopted drastic cuts in its general assistance program as part of its budget this year and Connecticut seems likely to do so. But in New Jersey, which recently imposed stricter eligibility requirements for such programs, no cuts have been proposed. In Connecticut, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. proposed a $113 million reduction in February for the general assistance program, which is intended primarily for poor single people and childless couples. The bill, which is before the Legislature, would cut or eliminate aid for at least two-thirds of the 35,000 people in the program, the State Department of Income Maintenance has estimated. In addition, a person deemed employable could receive aid for only six months of any 12. The program currently provides up to $311 a month. As part of a bipartisan compromise, New York State is expected to cut its total welfare budget by $120 million this year, with most of the cuts coming from the general assistance program, which is called home relief. Under the proposals, all recipients of home relief would be required to seek employment for at least 90 days. At least 343,000 people are enrolled in the program, which provides a maximum of $352 a month. No cuts have been proposed for the general assistance program in New Jersey, which provides a maximum income of $270 a month and has 27,000 people enrolled.

987-> Review/Music; Heralded in Celebration, A Maturing Movement
The early-music movement, with its impassioned devotion to musical instruments and styles before the 19th century, was once the vanguard of musical taste; it was fervently opposed to the manners and repertory of mainstream concert life. But as it has grown in popularity, the movement, once avant-garde, has begun to settle into maturity. That was the impression I got this weekend, sampling programs in the second Berkeley Festival and Exhibition, devoted to early music, which came to an end today. The eight-day festival, first held in 1990, is the West Coast counterpart to Boston's Early-Music Festival, offering in alternating years an opportunity for this close-knit community of performers, scholars and listeners to gather in common cause. Its hosts are the music department of the University of California at Berkeley, the San Francisco Early-Music Society and Cal Performances, a presenting organization. About 12,000 tickets were sold to 47 events on the Berkeley campus and at the local First Congregational Church; the events included Gustav Leonhardt performing Couperin, the Artaria Quartet venturing into the world of the classical fugue and Hopkinson Smith playing Bach suites on the lute. The festival was also the occasion for the annual meetings of Early Music America and the Historical Harp Society. And it presented an exhibition of beautiful reproductions of early bows, viols, recorders and harpsichords. In all these festivities, the pre-bourgeois world of European music making was paid tribute, but there were also signs that instead of trying to treat early music as a universe isolated from the mainstream, the movement was trying to connect it directly to the present. Under the artistic direction of the scholar and organist John Butt, this year's festival loosely focused on Bach, not a revolutionary choice. On Friday afternoon, in a symposium on Bach's position in history, a provocative paper by a cellist and musicologist, Laurence Dreyfus, also argued that Bach was much closer to the world that came after him than the world that preceded him. In another symposium (in which I participated), Bach was connected still more closely to the present: the subject was the lessons that Bach's musical culture offers to our own. This shift in perspective was found even in an intriguing recital offered on Saturday evening by Elisabeth Le Guin, a thoughtful cellist who played Bach's Cello Suite in C (BWV 1009) with Robert Schumann's piano accompaniment. That would have been heretical a decade ago. The more traditional early-music movement was represented by a sinewy concert conducted by Mr. Leonhardt, one of the movement's most renowned musical spokesman. There is probably no other figure who has so clearly defined the style of so-called authentic performance in over 150 recordings as harpsichordist and conductor, most notably in his collaboration with Nikolaus Harnoncourt on the recordings of the complete Bach cantatas. On Friday night at the First Congregational Church, Mr. Leonhardt led the accomplished Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, along with theBerkeley Chamber Chorus in an unusual program that presented two of Bach's interpretations of the "Magnificat" text: the great Latin setting (BWV 243) and Cantata 10. Though the chorus was a bit underrehearsed, Mr. Leonhardt, with his brisk tempos, his unsentimental approach and his acute attention to detail, revealed how much of Bach's faith grows out of the pleasures of the dance. The performances were joyful, confident and, at times of introspection, extremely refined. The baritone Max van Egmond sang with warmth and intelligence, joined by two sopranos, Emily Van Evera and Nancy Zylstra; a countertenor, Jeffrey Dooley, and two tenors, Jeffrey Thomas and Steven Rickards. These performances showed how much the early-music movement has already accomplished. Now it will begin to face different problems. On paper, for example, this festival lacked some of the coherence that can come from better definition and sense of purpose. And though there were some intriguing programs, there weren't major events like 1990's programming of Handel's oratorio "La Resurrezione" and Niccolo Jommelli's opera "La Schiava Liberata." Despite some interesting ideas, there were also frayed edges: the first half of Bach's B-minor Mass on Saturday night, performed by the American Bach Soloists, needed much more preparation. This means that as these festivals evolve, they will have to be more than gatherings; they will have to earn their justification not just from within the movement but from the world outside it, which is as it should be, since early music is now becoming mainstream.

988-> LESBIAN COLONEL REMOVED BY GUARD
A Vietnam veteran who rose through the officer ranks to become chief of nursing for Washington State's Army National Guard was discharged from the military today because she is a lesbian. The 50-year-old officer, Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer, whom Guard officials say they would keep on if they could, is one of the highest-ranking members of the armed forces ever removed from the service because of the Pentagon's longstanding policy against homosexuality. Colonel Cammermeyer, who was married for 16 years before divorcing and who has four sons, first disclosed that she was a lesbian three years ago, during an interview for a security clearance that might have allowed her to take courses at the National War College in Washington, D.C. "I don't think it was until that top-security clearance investigation that I could say and believe, 'This is who I am,' " she said today from American Medical Lake Veterans Hospital in Tacoma, where she has a civilian job as a clinical nurse specializing in neurosciences. As a result of Colonel Cammermeyer's disclosure, a military board convened last July at Camp Murray, near Tacoma, and recommended that she be honorably discharged. The commander of the Washington State Guard, Maj. Gen. Greg Barlow, adopted that recommendation today despite personal anguish that he said it was causing him. The action against Colonel Cammermeyer was first reported by The Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, which quoted General Barlow today as praising her work but saying that he must carry out Defense Department policy. "Does that make it easy for me to look the woman in the eye and announce that?" the general told the newspaper. "No, it doesn't." The discharge of Colonel Cammermeyer, who has served in the military for 26 years, is to take effect on June 11. She said that at this point nothing less than intervention by President Bush or Defense Secretary Dick Cheney could save her National Guard career. Such intervention does not appear likely. Asked about it today, a Defense Department spokesman, Lieut. Col. Doug Hart, reiterated the Pentagon's position that not only homosexual acts but even homosexual inclinations were incompatible with discipline and morale among uniformed members of the armed forces.

The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, appointed Sanford Gaines to the new position of deputy assistant trade representative for the environment. Mr. Gaines has been a professor of environmental law at the University of Houston and a lawyer at the Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental organizations and foreign governments have criticized what they characterize as Washington's lackadaisical attitude toward the environment. Mrs. Hills also appointed David Weiss to the new position of deputy assistant for Canadian affairs.

990-> Home-Equity Lending Up
Home-equity lending by banks continued to grow rapidly last year, even though many banks tightened their credit standards, the American Bankers Association said in a study released yesterday. Among large banks, which tend to be the most active home-equity lenders, 62 percent tightened credit standards last year, according to the association. Among the 413 banks surveyed, 35 percent said they tightened credit standards last year, and 10 percent said they planned to tighten standards this year. Bankers are concerned about the sluggish economy and weak real estate prices. Although growth in home-equity lending slowed in 1991 from annual rates of more than 20 percent in previous years, it continued to grow more rapidly than other kinds of lending. Last year, home-equity loans at banks grew by 14 percent, to $70.2 billion, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, while loans to businesses fell more than 9 percent, to $558.9 billion. Bankers like home-equity loans because of their low rate of loss, the fees that may be charged on the loans and the opportunity to sell other financial products to home-equity borrowers.

991-> U.S., Trying to Buff Its Image, Defends the Forests
The United States, under fire at the Earth Summit for perceived foot-dragging on treaties intended to protect the planet's climate and its biological diversity, is trying to restore its standing, at least partly, by leading a drive to save the world's forests. But opponents of the forests initiative are suspicious of the Bush Administration's motives, and the prospects that the initiative will advance at the summit, or that it will do much to repair Washington's environmental reputation, are in doubt. Coming into Rio, the Administration found itself at odds with much of the rest of the world over treaties to control global warming and preserve the world's plant, animal and microbial species. On forests, however, the Administration has taken the lead in pushing a position that is endorsed by many environmental groups and by other industrialized nations. But in doing so, it has fallen afoul of the vehement opposition of developing countries for which forests are a major economic asset. These countries assert that while they believe in protecting forests, they are theirs to do with as they please. They accuse the United States and other industrialized countries of attempting to coerce them on the issue for domestic political gain. And they bridle at what they see as an attempt to abridge their sovereignty by countries that long ago cut down their own trees for profit but now want to place the main burden of global forest conservation on countries struggling for economic survival. "We are certainly not holding our forests in custody for those who have destroyed their own forests and now try to claim ours as part of the heritage of mankind," Ting Wen Lian, a Malaysian diplomat who has emerged as the developing countries' chief spokeswoman on the issue, said as the forest negotiations began this week. Her country and the United States are the two largest timber-exporting nations in the world. Forests as Global Asset The United States argues that forests, especially tropical forests, are being destroyed at an alarming rate in the developing world and that the planet as a whole will be the loser. Forests, it argues, are a global asset that help regulate the climate by absorbing heat-trapping carbon dioxide and are the repository of a major portion of the world's living species. William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and chief of the United States delegation to the Earth Summit, has announced that "the principal priority of the United States at this conference is better management and conservation of the world's forests." Armed with a commitment from President Bush to step up foreign aid for forest protection and an announcement that the United States was abandoning clear-cutting in its national forests, Mr. Reilly attempted to put new weight behind longstanding Administration efforts to secure agreement here that an international treaty on forests be negotiated and signed after the Rio summit. But Ambassador Ting dismissed President Bush's offer of new money as irrelevant to the forest negotiations here. Despite the developing world's opposition, Britain and Germany have been leading an effort to integrate President Bush's announcement of $150 million a year in new funds for forest preservation into a broader initiative involving a number of countries. U.S. Seen as Obstructionist The United States has been seen by much of the rest of the world as an obstructionist on the key issues of global warming and biological diversity. The Bush Administration successfully sought the adoption of commitments to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases that is weaker than most other industrialized countries wanted, although Administration officials contend that the resulting treaty is a prudent first step in view of the scientific uncertainties over global warming. The United States plans to sign the climate treaty, but not the treaty on protection of species. While it supports the central conservation features of the biodiversity treaty, it opposes other aspects relating to patent protection, regulation of biotechnology and the mechanism for transferring funds from rich to poor nations for conservation purposes. Earlier, in pre-summit negotiations, it had been hoped that a forest treaty could be signed here along with those on global warming and protection of species. But developing countries would not hear of it, and now environmental groups fear that even the statement on forest principles may not survive Rio. "They're really in trouble on this document," said William Mankin, a forestry expert for the Sierra Club. "They don't have enough time to do this." Negotiators working on a wide range of summit issues, including forests, must complete work by Wednesday so that documents may be prepared for the three-day summit phase of the conference beginning on Friday. Defending Forestry Record Mr. Reilly argues that despite such high-profile issues as the cutting of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, the United States record on forestry in the last century is good, if not a model. As in many other industrialized countries, Americans cut down their forests at a rapid rate and in an uncontrolled fashion until about a century ago. Since then, the Americans argue, the United States has built up a vast body of expertise on how to manage forests so that they can be exploited economically while maintaining an extensive forest cover. There are more forests in the United States now than a century ago, and their total volume has increased markedly, through growth and reforestation, in the last decade. One goal of the Americans and Canadians is the adoption of the principle that the sustainable use of forests should be governed by international guidelines on forest management. "We want to be measured by internationally accepted standards," said Jagmohan Maini, a forest official in the Canadian Government. "We will meet or exceed any such standards." Canada is a principal ally of the United States on the forestry issue. Many developing countries, said Mr. Maini, "are reluctant to recognize the global role of forests." Moreover, he said, "some of them are suspicious of our motives, which is very unfortunate. It shows we have failed." Indeed, Ambassador Ting said in a statement here this week that she understood that "the almost obsessional anxiety to have a forest convention" is driven by concerns that have nothing to do with forests or trees, but rather mainly by the desire of developed countries "to appease their public opinion and thus get electoral mileage out of forests." Environmentalists said the present draft of the statement of forest principles is so weak as to constitute a step backward. It falls far short, they say, of a 1991 World Bank prohibition on providing funds for logging in primary tropical rain forests and an international agreement recently reached to confine the trade in tropical timber, by the year 2000, to materials derived from sustainably managed forests.

993-> G.E. Posts 8% Higher Profit
Spurred by growth in its nonindustrial units, the General Electric Company today reported an 8 percent increase in its second-quarter net income. As a result, G.E.'s board said it would raise its quarterly dividend 7.3 percent to 59 cents a share from 55 cents. On an annualized basis, the dividend is expected to increase to $2.36 a share from $2.20 a share. G.E.'s financial performance hit analysts' projections precisely. Earnings were $1.22 billion, or $1.42 a share, compared with $1.13 billion, or $1.30 a share a year earlier. Revenue was up 4 percent, to $15.4 billion, from $14.8 billion in last year's second quarter. The second-quarter dividend will be paid in September, the company said, and the board will discuss the 1993 dividend at its November meeting. G.E. also said it would suspend its $10 billion stock buyback program at the $5 billion mark later this year. The company said, however, that it would continue to repurchase stock to fund employee programs. The company said it might be able to use the cash that would have been spent on stock to exploit global opportunities. The electronics and services giant did not identify any particular sectors for acquisitions. The second-quarter performance illustrates how important G.E.'s non-industrial businesses are to the company. Its financial services sector, the GE Capital Corporation, which includes Kidder, Peabody & Company as well as one of the nation's biggest credit operations, reported 24 percent growth in income. Spurred by strong television ratings for the National Basketball Association's final games, NBC's operating profit increased sharply on flat revenue. G.E.'s Power Systems group, which makes turbines and equipment sold to electric utilities, reported income and revenue gains. And its technical products business, which includes G.E.'s electronic medical systems, earned more because of productivity increases. G.E. reported only flat earnings for its electrical appliances business, however, and lower income for its industrial products, aircraft engines and materials operations. John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, warned that the company saw a "fragile" global economy, even though domestic orders had improved. He said continued emphasis on productivity and improved cash generation would support continued growth.

994-> Peru's Leader Dissolves Congress
President Alberto Fujimori announced Sunday night that he was dissolving congress and suspending the constitution. Troops in armored personnel carriers took to the capital's main thoroughfares. Peru is mired in a deep recession and beset by the hemisphere's most violent guerrilla insurgency. Mr. Fujimori has been hamstrung in his reform efforts by a hostile congress. Mr. Fujimori announced the moves in a surprise 22-minute television address, saying he was ordering them as Commander in Chief of the military in the name of guaranteeing order and preserving democracy. The president said he intended to reorganize the Government "for an honest and efficient administration of justice." Radio stations said additional troops were placed at the congress and judicial palaces and the attorney general's office. They were also posted at the offices of domestic and foreign news organizations. Lima's streets were quiet but the announcement came too late to gauge public reaction. Mr. Fujimori was elected to a five-year term in 1990 while head of a hastily organized party that is now in disarray, and governs largely by decree because he lacks a legislative majority. He has relied heavily on the military, which last held power from 1968 to 1980 and is a potent force in Peruvian politics. The military has apparently been reluctant to take power again because of the chaotic situation. Some analysts say paramilitary violence -- the rightist response to the rebel Shining Path guerrilla movement -- poses as great a threat as the Maoist-inspirted insurgents. "The country should understand that the temporary and partial suspension of the existing legality is not a denial of real democracy," Mr. Fujimori said. He called the changes he intends to make "the starting point of an authentic transformation to assure a legitimate and effective democracy, which will permit all Peruvians to participate in building a more just, more developed and more respected Peru." Has Taken Drastic Steps Mr. Fujimori has taken drastic steps to control inflation and try to heal a shattered economy in a country where more than half the people live in poverty. He has removed price controls and subsidies, lowered trade barriers, freed the foreign exchange market, begun selling off state businesses and sharply reduced government spending. His leftist opponents in congress contend that by cutting social spending the president is aiding the Shining Path in its recruitment efforts. The Shining Path has in the past year made inroads from its base in the Andes to Lima and other coastal cities. Nearly 25,000 people have died in political violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

995-> Placated by Shamir, Israeli Foreign Minister Retracts Threat to Quit
Foreign Minister David Levy pulled back at the last minute today, withdrawing the resignation he had announced a week ago in exchange for promises of a larger slice of power if his party leads Israel's next government. Eleventh-hour concessions to Mr. Levy by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir put an end, for the moment, to a crisis that had threatened to split the governing Likud Party at the start of the campaign for the June election. But the concessions also created new resentment within the party, especially on the part of Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who reportedly complained in a meeting of senior Government officials that Mr. Shamir had caved in to what he regarded as political blackmail. After the dust had settled a bit, party members agreed that they were not so much running for re-election as limping, after a series of self-inflicted wounds that have been coupled with a resurgence of strength and confidence in the opposition Labor Party. The most recent polls show Labor enjoying a steadily widening lead over Likud, which has led most Israeli governments for the last 15 years. While the voter mood here can be mercurial, and the elections are still 11 weeks away, the consensus among politicians and others is that Labor and its leader, Yitzhak Rabin, have the upper hand. But it may not be strong enough, they say, to form a government without Likud as a partner in an updated version of the "national unity" coalition that prevailed from 1984 to 1990. In contrast to a week of theatrics inside the stumbling Likud, the Labor Party selected a slate of Parliament candidates by primary last week, in a change from the old system of selection by the party Central Committee. How Much to Concede to Arabs? The result is a bumper crop of new faces and a list of candidates that is reasonably balanced among ethnic groups. Likud strategists have begun attacking the lineup as top-heavy with doves who, they say, would compromise Israel's security by being too eager to offer territorial concessions to the Palestinians and to neighboring Arab nations. But Labor Party leaders reply that their voters also selected half a dozen retired generals, including Mr. Rabin, who can be counted on not to give away the store in negotiations over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Labor's platform calls for a year's freeze on new settlements in the occupied territories, and the party is far more willing than Mr. Shamir, who is unbending on this subject, to give up some land in return for peace. On top of that, Labor can turn Likud's own words against it. After the internal fisticuffs over the Foreign Minister's threatened resignation, there is no shortage of recordings of self-damaging Likud speeches. In them, Mr. Levy and his Sephardic supporters -- Jews with origins in North Africa and the Middle East -- accused Mr. Shamir and other Likud elders of being prejudiced against Sephardim, unconcerned about social-welfare issues, lukewarm to the peace process and unnecessarily hostile to the United States. "There is a need to heal the wound," Mr. Levy said at a news conference today, explaining his turnaround. Some of his followers acknowledged more bluntly that the recent battles have created "traumas that will linger," in the words of Prosper Azran, Mayor of Qiryat Shemona, a town in the northern Galilee region, and a Levy adviser. But the situation can be turned around, declared Reuven Rivlin, a member of Parliament in the Levy camp. "We believe here in Israel in miracles," he said. "We have a direct line to God. It's a local call." Others cited Likud's tradition of loyalty. "After a hot campaign, most Likud voters go home," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University. "This is a party whose supporters are much more responsive to claims of loyalty. It's almost like going back to your old synagogue." The Politics of Ego Mr. Levy, who has been the most enthusiastic supporter of Mideast negotiations among senior Government officials, has been the central figure in the Likud battle. But this dispute had little to do with policy differences and almost everything to do with power politics and egos. The Foreign Minister has been brooding since October, when Mr. Shamir bumped him aside as head of the Israeli delegation to the peace conference's opening session in Madrid. After his supporters were shoved into low-ranking slots on the Likud list of Parliament candidates, his unhappiness swelled and finally exploded. Announcing his intention last weekend to leave the Government, he charged that as a Moroccan-born Jew, he was the victim of blatant discrimination by the Ashkenazim, the Jews of European origin, like Mr. Shamir, who have dominated Israeli politics under both Labor and Likud since statehood in 1948. Critics complain that Mr. Levy screams racism whenever he does not get his way. Still, the accusation of bigotry hit Likud hard, as the party that rose to power in 1977 as the political voice of disaffected Sephardim. As late as Saturday night, hours before Mr. Levy was to submit his formal resignation to the Cabinet, a schism seemed unavoidable. But apparently Mr. Shamir, after having dismissed the dispute as "a joke," concluded that he could not afford to have Mr. Levy walk away in a huff. At the last minute, the two struck a bargain. Mr. Shamir promised that if Likud controls the next government, Mr. Levy would remain as Foreign Minister and keep the largely titular post of Deputy Prime Minister. In addition, Mr. Levy would be able to name another Cabinet minister, and his supporters would get important jobs in Parliament, the Likud party organization and the Jewish Agency, which is responsible for immigration into Israel. Afterward, both emphasized party unity, but mutual trust clearly was thin. Taking to heart Samuel Goldwyn's admonition that a verbal agreement isn't worth the paper it is written on, Mr. Levy made sure that this deal was signed.

997-> Sobriety Roadblocks Rejected in Michigan
Letting the police set up roadblocks to stop motorists and check them for drunken driving infringes on citizens' rights to be free from unreasonable searches and thus violates the State Constitution, a divided three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled today. "Although we fully recognize the enormity of the problem caused by drunk driving," said the decision of the state's second-highest court, "we do not believe the proposed elimination of Michigan citizens' rights to be free from suspicionless seizure a proper response to the problem." The case stemmed from the only checkpoint ever set up by the state police in Michigan, on May 17-18, 1986, when motorists in Saginaw County were stopped and briefly examined for signs of intoxication. Ruling in June 1990 on the same case, the United States Supreme Court found that drunken-driving checkpoints were permissible under the Federal Constitution and sent the case back to the state courts for a determination of whether they met the requirements of the Michigan Constitution. Citing Framers' Intent Today the appeals court stood by its original ruling, saying the framers of the Michigan Constitution had never intended to permit people to be stopped unless there was suspicion that they had done something wrong. Checkpoints would violate Michigan's longstanding tradition holding that officers may not indiscriminately stop automobiles without some reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity is occurring, the court said. A change in that tradition, the decision said, should be made only by the State Supreme Court. The court said this was especially true since the checkpoint had yielded a meager result: 126 drivers were stopped; only one was arrested. In a dissent to the 2-to-1 decision, Judge Roman S. Gribbs said the courts had held that the State Constitution's rules on searches and seizures were no stiffer than those of the Federal Constitution. Since the United States Supreme Court said the roadblocks do not violate the Federal Constitution, he said, the state court should rule likewise about the State Constitution. Through a spokesman, State Attorney General Frank Kelley said this morning that no decision had been made yet on whether to appeal.

998-> In Liberia's Illusory Peace, Rebel Leader Rules Empire of His Own Design
Only the legions of edgy and heavily armed guards at checkpoints leading to this sleepy village give any hint of the grand ambitions envisioned here. For if the guerrilla leader Charles Taylor has his way, this remote outpost will become the strategic center of a vast military and administrative empire. Already nearly 95 percent of Liberia, the West African nation founded by freed American slaves, is in effect run from Gbarnga by Mr. Taylor's forces. The area has its own currency and banking system, an international airfield, a thriving export trade in diamonds, gold, rubber and timber -- even its own radio and television network. By contrast, Monrovia, Liberia's capital and its once-bustling political and economic center, about 120 miles to the south, is on the verge of ruin. The capital is administered by an interim government that was installed by West African nations in the autumn of 1990 as part of a regional peace plan. But these days, Monrovia is on its knees. Were it not for the efforts of the United Nations, Catholic Relief Services and other foreign aid agencies, there would be no electricity, running water or food for most of the 500,000 people. Shadows of Violence The situation in Liberia, a nation of about two and a half million, might be regarded as a peculiarity, attracting little international attention, were it not for the threat of still another armed conflict on a continent racked by insurgencies and instability. Many African and Western analysts believe that Mr. Taylor, who is 44 years old, has been associated with terrorist attacks and anti-government insurgencies in the neighboring nations of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Gambia. And in the flurry of military activity, recent reports say hundreds of civilians may have been killed in the cross-fire and thousands displaced. There is little sign of peace soon. "Effectively, Charles Taylor's control over most of Liberia creates a new nation in the region," said Makau wa Mutua, director of the human rights program at Harvard Law School. "This situation is most tragic," he said, "because the West, which is consumed by changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, has abandoned this small nation as its social and political fabric slowly dies." Accomplishments, as Well Perhaps foremost among Mr. Taylor's accomplishments is that he has been able to do so much in two and a half years. The rebel leader, who insists that he be addressed as President Taylor, has never run for office. If elections are again organized, he says, he would be willing to take part, but only as the incumbent president. Mr. Taylor has built his domain despite the apparent opposition of much of the population. And leaders of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States, a trading consortium with a military contingent, have repeatedly called on Mr. Taylor to disarm his troops and allow their 7,000-member peace force to enter his territory, a request he has largely ignored. More recently, the United Nations suspended a $130 million food-distribution program in territory controlled by Mr. Taylor, charging continued harassment of aid workers at checkpoints and the confiscation of relief vehicles. In December, a United Nations relief aide from Europe was pistol-whipped by Taylor soldiers, and a number of workers have been arrested and detained on allegations of spying. Aid officials say they have been particularly angered by Mr. Taylor's insistence that food and other supplies be shipped only through the port of Buchanan, which is controlled by his forces, rather than through the much larger port at Monrovia. "Taylor rules by terror and intimidation," a relief worker said, "and most of us feel it's not worth risking our lives in that kind of situation. One reason Taylor is getting away with it, is most people are afraid to travel up there anymore. It's just too volatile." Flight to and From U.S. As a student at Bentley College, near Boston, Mr. Taylor helped organize Liberians in the United States to oppose President William R. Tolbert Jr., whose Government, like its predecessors, was dominated by a minority group of descendants of freed American slaves who migrated to Liberia in the early part of the 19th century. When Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe overthrew President Tolbert in 1980, Mr. Taylor returned to Liberia to join the new leadership. But in 1983, after falling out with Sergeant Doe, by then Liberia's head of state, he fled to the United States. The Liberians sought his extradition on charges that he had diverted $900,000 in Government funds, and a court in Boston found sufficient grounds to detain him. In 1985, while awaiting extradition, Mr. Taylor broke out of jail. Over the next five years, his whereabouts were largely unknown. According to Liberian and American authorities, he spent much of this period in Libya as the guest of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. In December 1989, Mr. Taylor and about 100 guerrillas invaded northern Liberia from the Ivory Coast. The insurgency gained momentum, even while splitting bitterly into rival factions. Eventually, a former Taylor follower, Prince Johnson, captured, tortured and killed President Doe. A five-nation West African force intervened, saying the war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their citizens were trapped in Liberia and an estimated half-million Liberians had fled to neighboring countries. Altogether, nearly half of Liberia's people were uprooted, and an estimated 20,000 died. In October 1990, the West African group formed an interim government headed by Amos Sawyer, a former university professor. But Mr. Taylor refused to recognize Mr. Sawyer's government, defiantly moving his military and administrative operations here, designating Gbarnga as Liberia's capital and effectively partitioning the country. Superficially at least, Gbarnga seems far removed from the social and economic chaos that engulfs Monrovia. The Taylor government, which now calls itself the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly, has spent lavishly to create a version of a well-planned bureaucracy. On nearly every corner, signs direct visitors to ministry offices. But often, these are little more than one-room shacks staffed by untrained and illiterate people. The Warrior The sense of unreality is heightened by hundreds of posters and paintings of Charles Taylor: Sometimes he is dressed in traditional West African garb, wearing a white cap and a flowing gown; in other pictures, he is in a jacket and tie, staring defiantly or posing with foreign dignitaries. Recently, Mr. Taylor's face has begun to appear with the word "ghankay" written in bold letters underneath. Ghankay means warrior in Gola, one of Liberia's main languages. Mr. Taylor has denounced Liberia's new "Liberty" $5 bill, first minted in January by the central bank in Monrovia, and prohibits its use in the area he controls; only the old bill is legal tender. He levies a fine equivalent to $3,000 on anyone caught carrying Liberty notes in his territory. The American dollar is still accepted on both sides, but the exchange rate varies. While the official rate remains one Liberian dollar for one American dollar, in Monrovia the black market pays five to eight Liberian dollars for an American one, and in the Taylor area, the black market gives three to five dollars for an American one. If many Liberians find doing business in Mr. Taylor's territory hard, the experience of foreigners has been quite different. Liberian-American Mining Company, one of the region's biggest iron-ore producers, has resumed exports to Europe. Riches and Troops Analysts in this country say that Mr. Taylor has granted lucrative concessions to a number of foreign diamond and gold exporters, particularly from Germany and France. Now, the taxes and export duties from timber, rubber and mining operations -- which once flowed to the central government -- are controlled by him. No one knows for sure how many troops Mr. Taylor has, but most analysts say perhaps 10,000. They are a menacing force. Dozens of soldiers, sometimes boys as young as 9 or 10, carry machine guns at the checkpoints. Mr. Taylor is fighting a threat from a rebel movement including former members of President Doe's army and the Mandingo ethnic group, which in recent weeks have engaged his forces along the Sierra Leone border. In December, a study of his territory by the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, an advocacy group based in New York, found "reports of widespread physical attacks against civilians, including the rape of young women," at the checkpoints. A similar report in October 1991 by Africa Watch said "dissent is not tolerated" in these areas, "creating fear and uncertainty among the civilian population."

999-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New York; New Alliance Party Leader Attacks Arkansas Governor
A Harlem appearance by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas disintegrated into a raucous shouting match yesterday after Lenora B. Fulani, the New Alliance Party's candidate for President, challenged Mr. Clinton to open up the Democratic Presidential debate process. Mr. Clinton was forced to suspend his remarks and eventually retreat from a room at Harlem Hospital, where he was delivering a health care speech, when Ms. Fulani stood on a chair and led a handful of supporters in chants of "Democracy now." "This is not about democracy," Mr. Clinton responded. "This is about whether I will be an instrument of your will." This was the second public disruption in a Clinton campaign event within the last few days. On Wednesday, an AIDS protester provoked an angry response from Mr. Clinton when he shouted at him from the audience at a money-raising event. Mr. Clinton, who at first tried to respond to Ms. Fulani's demands that Larry Agran, the former Mayor of Irvine, Calif., be included in the debates, was drowned out by the protesters. Mr. Agran is running for President on the Democratic ticket and has consistently complained of being excluded. Ms. Fulani, who is not on the ballot in the New York primary, ran as a Democratic candidate in New Hampshire and raised enough money to qualify for Federal matching money. "You just met black people on Super Tuesday when you needed them," she told Mr. Clinton. She added that he was "an insult to the black community." Many people in the mostly black audience reacted angrily, yelling at her to sit down and "show some respect." "We did what we came here to do," she told reporters afterward. One man interrupted the impromptu news conference Ms. Fulani held afterward to berate her for disrupting the Governor's appearance. "I came here to hear him," Cedric MacAlester told Ms. Fulani. "I hear you all the time." When she told Mr. MacAlester that she was speaking up for black people, he shot back: "Don't tell me about black people. I've been black all my life." Mr. Clinton said afterward that it would be "fine" with him if the debates were opened to include Mr. Agran, who was not present today. "But I don't know that I should deprive the people of New York the chance to hear my views in a debate, when the sponsors of the debate decline to let them in," he said.

1000-> Growing Ranks of Homebound Patients Put Strain on Medicaid
To the Editor: "New York Medicaid Strained by Newly Poor" (The Week in Review, March 22) discusses cases of some who are not poor who have qualified for long-term care under Medicaid by impoverishing themselves. But you do not give a complete account of the cause of New York State's Medicaid budget crisis. Certainly, the home-care system is not the major problem. The majority of the 100,000 home-care patients are poor -- most are very poor. Because they have no way to pay for long-term care (Medicare and most private insurance don't pay for it), they have been made destitute by the system. The economics tell the story. On average, it costs $2,200 a month for home care, with home-care workers earning a meager $6.50 an hour. Institutional alternatives cost more. Patients can afford neither. Most patients in the home-care system didn't earn $2,200 a month when they could work, and few pensions provide that much. As a result, a lifetime's savings can be quickly exhausted. The cost of care is not the only issue. In the last two years, hospitals report occupancy rates of more than 90 percent, and long waits for elective procedures are common. This occurs though the average hospital stay has gone down. Also, because New York State has one-third fewer nursing home beds per 1,000 of the elderly than the rest of the country, finding an empty nursing-home bed is as rare as finding a clean subway car. Given the higher cost of institutional care and crowded conditions in hospitals, it is no wonder that there has been a 30 percent increase in the number of homebound patients requiring 24-hour care. You expose abuses in the system, and these need to be corrected. But they are a small part of the story. The real story is the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who are dependent on, and are well served by home-care services. MEGAN E. MC LAUGHLIN Executive Director, Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies New York, April 2, 1992

1002-> Wall Street; Will Alexander's Prove the Short Sellers Wrong?
The stock of Alexander's department stores has climbed a staggering 75 percent since May 15, when the company filed for Chapter 11. "It's a classic little short squeeze," said Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service in Half Moon Bay, Calif. He is one of many investors who are shorting Alexander's shares -- that is, selling borrowed shares, hoping to replace them later with cheaper shares. As Mr. Murphy tells it, a lot of incautious investors sold the stock short without first arranging to borrow the shares, a practice known as "naked shorting." When they later found they could not borrow the shares, they were forced to go into the market and buy them. The stock price soared. Will the rally last? Some analysts think the store chain has enough assets to justify the recent climb, but Mr. Murphy disagrees. "We figure that, once all the debts are paid and the real estate is sold, there will be between $2 and $5 of value per share." Alexander's closed on Friday at $21.375.

1005-> VOWS; Josefa Mulaire and William Tester
"BRING your umbrella," Josefa Mulaire said a few days before her wedding. It was good advice. Last Sunday afternoon during a downpour, she married William Tester in the backyard of her childhood home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. During the ceremony, they stood on the bride's favorite spot in the yard, holding umbrellas that buckled in the wind while some 90 guests watched from inside a nearby tent. The rain soaked the bride's dress, splattered the groom's eyeglasses, leaked through the roof of the tent, ruined hairdos and turned the ground to mud. But in the end, the monsoonlike weather only added to the merriment. The wedding was a mix of the traditional, the alternative, the mystical. Ms. Mulaire, 34 years old, a bartender at El Teddy's restaurant in TriBeCa and an artist, wore a 35-year-old wedding dress that belonged to her aunt and was so big and puffy that it knocked down chairs when she walked through the tent. Mr. Tester, 32, whose first novel, "Darling," was recently published by Alfred Knopf, wore a morning suit in the oldest style he could find at Baldwin Formals in Manhattan. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Melissa Townsend, a gnostic minister who also reads tarot cards at El Teddy's. Ms. Townsend often read the couple's cards during their eight-year relationship, guiding them through breakups, reunions, anxiety over book reviews and career changes. "I really believe if ever there were two people who will be together, it's Josefa and Bill," Ms. Townsend said. "The readings have confirmed that." In the tent, everyone sat at round tables that were decorated with gifts, including windup toy monsters and miniature boxes containing plastic rings, for the guests. The band, an all-male trio that was stationed in one corner of the tent, was appropriately called the Unwed Dudes. Decked out in bowling shoes and red suspenders, the musicians played everything from "Amazing Grace" to "Singing in the Rain," on instruments as varied as an 1886 fold-up organ and a cello that hadn't been played in 10 years. The groom's older brother, Ken Tester, surveying the dripping tent, muddy ground and crying babies, said: "Bill and Josefa love chaos. The more chaotic, the more unplanned, the more at home they feel. Did you hear their proposal story? Billy popped the question to Josefa when they were on a driving trip out West. He said, 'Honey, would you hand me the cookies and by the way, will you marry me?' " The one element of the wedding party that went as planned was the feast, which was so well orchestrated that William Tester compared it to a military invasion. The caterers, Steve Smith and Victoria Lewis of Thyme for Design of Manhattan, carried dish after dish into the tent: a salad of edible flowers, poached salmon, crostini and white bean salad with sage and artichoke hearts. Mr. Tester, who grew up on a cattle and produce farm in Ocala, Fla., said: "This wedding started out as a quiet, sit-down picnic. But if you live in New York, you can't just have cold cuts and white bread. You have to have pate; no, venison pate; no, venison pate with sun-dried tomatoes on top."

1008-> Russians in Antarctica Stage Protest Over Pay
SCIENTISTS at Russia's five stations in Antarctica say they have stopped sending data home to protest the difficulties their families face in Russia. In a statement signed by Dr. Vladimir Nazarov, leader of the Vostok station, the Russians cited their nation's severe inflation and said: "The miserable salary of Russian polar explorers, working in the rigorous climate of Antarctica, is hardly enough for our families even to buy food. We cannot help them. We can only send moral support by telephone." Since past pleas for more pay had no result, the scientists have stopped sending scientific information to Moscow and St. Petersburg, although they are still collecting data. The Vostok station is the most remote of any in Antarctica. The site is 11,300 feet above sea level on the central plateau of the polar ice sheet, which is thousands of feet thick. 125 Degrees Below In past winters temperatures there have been lower than anywhere else on earth, falling below -125 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter, with its almost perpetual darkness, began on Saturday. Officials in Moscow and St. Petersburg say they are aware of the protest and have already increased the pay of those in Antarctica. The scientists' request to be paid, at least partly, in hard currency could not be met, said Yuri F. Zubov, head of the Committee of Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring of the Russian Federation. At Vostok the Russians have been drilling holes deep into the ice. The most recent, as well as an earlier one, has reached 8,370 feet. Dr. Michael Bender at the University of Rhode Island said that ice from the bottom of the hole came from snow thought to have fallen between 190,000 and 230,000 years ago during the next-to-last interglacial period.

1009-> Fed to Cut Money-Supply Goal
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the Fed was planning to reduce its target for monetary growth below current levels to reduce inflation. But in his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, the Fed chairman said the central bank was holding off for the moment because it was still trying to analyze the erratic behavior of M-2, the most closely watched gauge of money. The measure includes cash, savings and checking accounts, money market funds and short-term certificates of deposit. "We were generally in agreement that we have to bring the ranges down another notch to conform to our long-term goal of price stability," he said. He said the Fed had provisionally adopted a target range for growth in the money supply for 1993 that is identical to this year's. The Fed's goal is growth of 2.5 to 6.5 percent for M-2 and of 4.5 to 8.5 percent for debt. He noted that growth in M-2 had been far below the Fed's targets in recent months. He added, however, that the historic, fairly consistent relationship between the growth of M-2 and growth in the overall economy seemed to be breaking down. He explained, for instance, that many people were moving their savings from six-month certificates of deposit, which are considered part of M-2, into mutual funds, which are not considered part of M-2. He said the Fed's chief policy-setting committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, would reconsider its targets for money growth no later than its meeting next February. "The reason we forestalled in moving this time was primarily because of the fact that the problems involved in relating M-2 specifically to gross domestic product have gone so far off track," he said.

1010-> Scientists Put a Ruler on Northeasters
SCIENTISTS at the University of Virginia have devised a system for measuring the relative power of northeasters, the devastating winter storms that cause much of the beach erosion along the Atlantic Coast. Meteorologists have long analyzed hurricanes using a measurement system, the Saffir-Simpson Scale. But although northeasters occur far more often, and consequently do far more damage, there has been no comparable analytical framework for them. The researchers who devised the new scale, Prof. Robert Dolan, a marine geologist, and Prof. Robert E. Davis, a climatologist, say they hope their system will enable scientists to estimate the strength of storms from physical properties. Storms are currently rated by estimating how soon a comparable storm is likely to occur again or by comparing property damage, a somewhat arbitrary standard that can be skewed by local property values, development density and other factors unrelated to the weather. Also, Dr. Dolan said in an interview, the scale would help identify places where jetties or other shoreline construction or features may be intensifying or reducing erosion. "The usefulness is not by any means academic," Dr. Dolan said. "In the case of management of the coast it becomes important. If erosion seems to be excessive, was the storm the problem or was it something else?" Type of Cyclone Technically, both hurricanes and northeasters are cyclones, in which winds circle around a center of low barometric pressure. But hurricanes typically form in late summer as fast-moving storms with strong winds roaring tightly around the low pressure "eye." By contrast, northeasters typically form along fronts as lumbering winter storms with their strongest winds from the northeast. Though their winds rarely reach hurricane strength, in some cases, like the Halloween storm that battered much of the Eastern Seaboard last year, northeasters hundreds of miles wide can linger off the coast for days, their waves relentlessly pounding the beaches. A place where a hurricane makes landfall can be devastated, Dr. Dolan said. "But the probability of a hurricane smacking into a particular place on the Atlantic Seaboard is extremely remote," he said. "With these huge northeasters that stretch from Cape Hatteras to Cape Cod, every community is going to be impacted." The hurricane scale is based on wind speed and air pressure at the eye of the storm; the Dolan/Davis Scale for northeasters relies instead on the duration of the storm and its maximum wave height in water deep enough that the configuration of the bottom does not affect the waves. "Oceanographers have known for years that the energy of a wave is roughly proportional to the square of the height," Dr. Dolan said. "For the massive amounts of data we're working with, it works out fine." Calculating Power Index Dr. Dolan and Dr. Davis tracked 42 years of northeasters up to 1986. They used climate data to estimate wave heights and studied the 1,347 storms that produced waves five feet or higher, the size at which significant beach erosion begins to occur along the mid-Atlantic Coast. They calculated a power index for each storm by multiplying the square of its peak wave height by its duration in hours. Dr. Dolan and Dr. Davis developed the scale using weather records for the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but they say it can be applied to the rest of the East Coast. They hope to further test and refine their work this winter with studies of weather data from Cape Cod, the New Jersey coast and Cape Canaveral, Fla. Also, they have studied only a few of the northeasters that occured since 1986, and they want to bring the record up to date. By the new scale, the Halloween storm was the most powerful northeaster they measured. The storm, which lasted 114 hours and produced waves up to 37 feet high, caused extensive damage from New England to Florida. But Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland, said the scale was flawed in that it did not take storm surges into account. "The surge level is very important in terms of whether a northeaster tops the dunes or beats itself out on the beach face," he said. Still, he said, "I applaud the effort." Dr. Dolan said he and Dr. Davis agree that the scale needs more work. "It's entirely possible that a group of specialists will modify it," he said. "That's fine. We accept that. We proposed it to get things going." He said he had been studying coastal geology for 25 years and waited all the while "for someone to come up with a northeaster classification that would be suitable for almost any location on the Atlantic seaboard," adding, Finally I said, 'We've got the data. We know what the storms are doing. Let's just do it.' "

1011-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Guys, Dolls and Fellas Sing Out for Clinton
Some of Broadway's current biggest names held a party for Gov. Bill Clinton at the St. James Theater last night, raising money for his Presidential campaign and using the occasion to press an agenda of their concerns, including AIDS research and unfettered Government financing for the arts. Such themes were woven into an evening in which Clinton supporters paid $250 to $1,000 each to see snippets of performances from Broadway shows like "Guys and Dolls," "The Will Rogers Follies," "Crazy for You" and "Jelly's Last Jam." "It never occurred to me I'd be hobnobbing on Broadway with the cultural elite," Mr. Clinton said, referring sarcastically to Vice President Dan Quayle's description of people he says are undermining traditional values. "To hear Dan Quayle tell it, I are one." The songs and dances were accompanied by political one-liners and, in one case, a full-throated heckler who shouted at the Arkansas Governor for several minutes about his state's sodomy law, which Mr. Clinton has said he does not support. Many of the comments, from stars like Richard Dreyfuss, Alec Baldwin, Peter Gallagher and Blair Brown, were directed at President Bush, his appointees and Mr. Quayle. Three members of the cast of "The Most Happy Fella," for example, sent the audience into hysterical laughter when they presented a number on potatoes, mocking the Vice President for his misspelling of 'potato' in an elementary school spelling bee last week. And Mac Davis, the lead actor in "The Will Rogers Follies," wrote a song with lyrics that went: "There was this young fella named Quayle He was out on the campaign trail, doing well Till he told that fifth-grader Put an E in potater I guess that's why he didn't get into Yale." Everyone, including Mr. Clinton, wore the red ribbons that signify concern about AIDS. And Dr. Mathilde Krim, a leading AIDS researcher, described Mr. Clinton as "a man who understands what can be done." Mr. Baldwin, who plays the brutish Stanley Kowalski in "A Streetcar Named Desire" talked about how he was persuaded to come speak on Mr. Clinton's behalf: "They told me I didn't have to break anything or scream or take my shirt off, so I agreed."

1012-> THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; When Patient's Life Is Price of Learning New Kind of Surgery
"SEE one, do one, teach one." That is the classic doctors' description of the way new procedures and operations are taught. But the credo seems destined for deserved oblivion. Alarmed about rising numbers of deaths and serious injuries from a new method of gallbladder surgery, in which surgeons use miniature video cameras and instruments inserted through tiny incisions, the New York State Health Department has demanded tighter regulations. It has directed hospitals to be stricter in deciding which surgeons can perform the procedure and to pay more attention to their results. New York's action is forcing doctors and health officials elsewhere to begin to deal publicly with a fundamental issue they have long failed to address: the learning curve. There are at least two kinds of learning curves in surgery. One is when young surgeons first perform an established operation. The other is when established surgeons first perform a new operation. For either, learning surgery invariably involves errors until practice makes near perfect. Usually the initial practicing is done on animals. But there comes a time for each surgeon's first patient. Although surgeons have long accepted the inevitability that some patients will be injured from the learning curve, rarely have they or health officials spelled out the limits or the rules. Instead the key decisions have been left to individual surgeons and hospitals. But New York health officials were emphatic in saying that a learning curve was not justification for serious injury to patients. The Health Department insists that surgeons not be allowed to perform the new laparoscopic procedures independently until they have shown adequate skill in at least 15 supervised cases. The learning curve is a complex policy issue. It involves the tangled web of medical politics -- turf battles between specialties, and town-gown conflicts between professors in teaching hospitals and practicing surgeons in community hospitals. It also involves consumerism and the economic interests of equipment manufacturers and the health insurance companies that pay the bills. Doctors generally greet new techniques with caution because history teaches that initial waves of enthusiasm are often tempered by the discovery of unexpected complications. While a few new techniques succeed, many others fail, and it takes time to sort them out. But any caution for the laparoscopic gallbladder operation among surgeons has been offset by surging patient demand of a magnitude rarely seen in medical history. The prospect of less pain and a return to work several weeks earlier leads most people facing gallbladder surgery to choose the new procedure over the traditional one. And not surprisingly, the laparoscopic procedure is rapidly replacing the older operation among the 500,000 Americans who have gallbladder surgery each year. In the procedure, several small holes are cut in the abdomen. A laparoscope, a device with a light and camera that is attached to an external video monitor, is inserted for a close-up view of organs and tissues. Instruments are inserted through the other holes and manipulated from outside the body. The learning curve for laparoscopy is important. One reason is that the required hand-eye coordination differs significantly from that used in traditional abdominal surgery. Laparoscopy is an indirect approach: when surgeons watch a television screen and pivot long-handled instruments through a hole, they lose the feel for the tissues. They have to adjust to new ways to judge how much pressure to apply in finding pathways and cutting through tissue. Another reason is the restricted field of vision imposed by laparoscopes, even those with wider angle lenses. Operators have a much more limited view of the anatomy when cutting with the laparoscope than in the traditional operation, where they look directly at organs and tissues and can handle them. While most operations go smoothly, the complications that can result from laparoscopy include some that are not generally seen with the older operation. Many complications are not recognized until days, even months, after laparoscopic surgery. Strong economic pressures have compelled many surgeons to learn the new technique because those who can do only the old one risk losing patients to competitors who offer the laparoscopic procedure. Most new operations have been developed in academic medical centers and some are scrutinized in scientifically controlled studies before being made standard for practice. Such introduction tends to be slow as younger surgeons, who learned the technique during training, go off and practice in community hospitals. But the new technique, introduced by surgeons in France and the United States in 1989, is one of the few major procedures to come out of community hospitals. Its development and rapid acceptance caught most teaching hospitals off guard. In a break from the usual collegiality in surgical teaching, some surgeons who performed it initially charged other surgeons $500 to watch them do one procedure. Responsible surgeons then practiced on animals and moved on to patients by assisting colleagues already skilled in the procedure. But some surgeons began doing the procedure on their own with little further training. Soon courses were set up, often financed by equipment manufacturers as is customary. Most courses are conducted on weekends, where the tuition fees run up to $4,000. The curriculum and quality vary widely. Beyond lectures and videotaped instruction, the best courses offer hands-on practice on animals, often pigs. Early on, few teaching hospitals offered courses to teach the laparoscopic gallbladder technique to practicing surgeons. Now, in an unusual twist, many community surgeons are teaching the professors. From the start, there were warnings about the prospects of botched laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. But the exact rate of complications is not known because of the lack of scientifically controlled studies and a national registry. A few regional and national surveys have been carried out. But because they were based on voluntary reporting, experts say the frequency of botched operations is probably seriously underestimated. Several surgical groups have published their experience with laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. But because surgeons tend to report their best results, statistics in medical journals seldom offer a realistic picture of practice in all hospitals. The American College of Surgeons in Chicago has said that laparoscopic gallbladder surgery should be performed by surgeons qualified to perform the traditional operation because they are the only ones with the skills to treat any complications. Knowing how to do the traditional operation is critical because problems in about 10 percent of cases force surgeons to switch immediately to the standard one. But an unresolved issue is that with the rapid disappearance of the older operation, few younger surgeons will know how to do it in the future. "It is only when you feel confident with the older gallbladder operation, knowing where the ducts and arteries are, that you should be tackling the laparoscopic technique," said Dr. Christopher G. Eliades, a surgeon in Nashua, N.H., who has performed 50 laparoscopic gallbladder operations. The college's statement also reflects the turf battle with gynecologists who learned laparoscopic techniques long before general surgeons picked it up. The American College of Surgeons has never issued a document on the learning curve. And the college has not addressed the issue of how credentials are obtained to perform laparoscopic gallbladder surgery because it considers it a matter for individual hospitals, said Linn Meyer, a spokeswoman for the college. Dr. Hiram C. Polk Jr., the chairman of surgery at the University of Louisville, said: "If the public has to wait a few months while a corps of people are being trained, that is not all bad, particularly since you are not talking about a cure for cancer. You are talking about a traditional treatment that was certainly safe and had good long-term results." Many surgeons insist that the new gallbladder technique is safest when carried out by two surgeons. For example, Dr. Mohan C. Airan, associate head of surgery at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, said no major injuries to the common bile duct occurred among more than 1,000 cases in Chicago hospitals that adhered to strict criteria, including the presence of two surgeons. But despite the widespread belief that the new procedure saves money, many insurers are not paying for a second surgeon, jeopardizing patient safety, Dr. Airan said. Limited data from published studies suggest that most complications occur among a surgeon's first 20 or so laparoscopic gallbladder operations. Despite centuries of experience with the learning curve, surgeons seldom tell patients they are the first to undergo a procedure in their hands. Now, as public officials and medical leaders tackle the learning curve issue, they might consider offering a steep discount to a surgeon's first patients and then work out a sliding scale of fees for successive cases.

1014-> Assessing Damage: Costs Keep Growing
Top insurance executives flew over communities flattened by Hurricane Andrew, knocked on the doors of policyholders and said later that the damage was the most intense they had ever seen. In the Gulf of Mexico, the storm damaged drilling platforms and rigs and disrupted supplies of natural gas; prices have already started to climb. And Florida's lime groves, which provide 95 percent of the nation's supply, were severely damaged. The larger orange and grapefruit groves, to the north, escaped the hurricane. Business Day, page D1.

1015-> Abortion Rights Law Wouldn't Work Anyway; Only the Poor Suffer
To the Editor: Is it only people active in the protection of poor women's access to contraception who see through the Governmentspeak of Bush Administration officials? In "What Abortion Isn't" (letter, July 28), Dr. William R. Archer thrusts the abortion issue where it has no place and distorts facts about the program he administers, Title X of the Public Health Service Act, which provides family planning services to poor women. Dr. Archer maintains that Title X funds have increased for 20 years. In reality, the program was funded at $162 million in 1981 and is now at $150 million, a significant cut, without allowing for inflation. Title X's restriction that "none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning" has been scrupulously observed, and even the General Accounting Office has not been able to find otherwise. Yet the Bush Administration, in an effort to promote its political agenda, has created the "gag rule," which prohibits apprising a pregnant woman of all her options -- childbirth, abortion and adoption -- when she requests information at a Title X clinic. The gag rule is back in the courts, with the Administration pressing hard to force family planning clinics to deny poor women the same information that any woman who can pay for her health care can easily obtain. I agree with Dr. Archer that abortion is not a method of family planning. Who ever said it was? But please spare us the righteous tone and the attempts to force a political position on poor women trying to take responsibility for their reproductive lives.

1017-> At the Bar; From the mountains to the prairie to the oceans white with foam, a law firm sells itself.
Imagine that Shea & Gould, the law firm representing the Mets, sponsored their broadcasts, too. Or that some televised, inside-the-Beltway brawl like the McLaughlin Group was brought to you by Covington & Burling. Or that "L.A. Law" was sponsored by a real Los Angeles law firm like O'Melveny & Myers. It sounds far-fetched, for the fanciest corporate law firms have ceded the airwaves to their poorer cousins in the personal injury, divorce and immigration bars. Corporate types have always marketed themselves more discreetly, through country club lunches, agate type in the back of Metropolitan Opera playbills, and, increasingly, by planting self-aggrandizing articles in the press. But a bold experiment, or at least what counts for one in the world of pin stripes and white shoes, is under way in Seattle. Forty-three times last month, in 60 seconds of saccharine broadcast during commercial breaks on the local news, "Good Morning, America" and "This Week With David Brinkley," the 110-lawyer firm of Williams, Kastner & Gibbs sang of its commitment to excellence. On the screen were actors impersonating lawyers at work and play -- sailing, fishing, water skiing, jogging, reading to their children, all All-American towheads who look like young Al Gore 3d. Also on display were soaring images of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle may be short of prairies and fruited plains, but as the commercial made clear, it has plenty of purple mountains majesty and oceans white with foam. One would be hard-pressed to know from all this that Williams, Kastner is actually a law firm, the seventh largest in the Northwest, let alone that it specializes in such mundane matters as insurance defense work and corporate litigation for the likes of Aetna, Johnson & Johnson and the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. In fact, one wouldn't even know the firm has a telephone or an address. But wherever Williams, Kastner is, it is clearly morning there. Of course, communicating information is not the point of advertisements like this. Does anyone really know what Archer Daniels Midland, or other stalwarts of Sunday morning public affairs programming, actually makes? Does anyone really care? The object, instead, is to deliver an image, announce one's presence, disseminate one's name. Whatever business it ultimately generates, the advertisement has already brought kudos to its producer, the R. W. Lynch Company of San Ramon, Calif. This week Lynch, which bills itself as the largest producer of lawyer advertising, will collect one of the first five "awards for dignity in lawyer advertising" at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association, an organization that would just as soon see all such professional peddling disappear. The Lynch Company sunk $250,000 into the production, a good part of which went, presumably, to filming on one of those rare days when Seattle is sunny and Mount Rainier can actually be seen from downtown. But in the lingo of manifest destiny, Lynch sees the corporate bar as the last frontier of lawyer advertising. Make it palatable enough, it appears to believe, and in tough times like these, even the stuffiest law firms will swallow it. "Attorneys must find ways to differentiate themselves, one from the other," the chairman of the company, R. W. (Randy) Lynch, said in a news release. "They must achieve favorable top-of-mind awareness and recognition by existing and potential clients, many of whom perceive parity among firms -- a corporate firm is a corporate firm is a corporate firm." As befits corporate lawyers, Williams, Kastner did not tread onto Madison Avenue lightly. How would clients react on seeing the firm tout itself on "Meet the Press?" Thus, before anyone had seen the first gauzy images of children feeding pigeons in Westlake Mall or sailing on Lake Union, the firm's managing partner, Jerry Edmonds, sent out a sincere alert to the firm's 325 top clients. He explained to them why the firm had taken its first few baby steps into hucksterdom ("Williams, Kastner & Gibbs is not as well known as we believe it should be"), assured them that the firm had not lost its marbles (the commercials, he wrote, were priced "affordably") and hinted that lest they thumb their noses at the undertaking, they, too, stood to benefit ("The more successful we can be, the more we can develop our capabilities to serve you"). And, in case they had any reactions, he enclosed a "feedback form" and a stamped envelope. The firm's marketing director, Susan Johnston, said few clients had replied, but those who did commented favorably. "Some people thought the approach was perhaps too sentimental, but you can't hit everyone," she said. And how had other firms reacted? "They tease and scoff and make snide remarks," she said. "but in their heart of hearts they're thinking, 'Why don't we have one of those?' "

1018-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Mixed Trading for Dollar, While Gold Moves Higher
The dollar was mixed yesterday in sluggish trading, with money traders apparently worried that the central banks might take concerted action again to support the United States currency. Gold prices rose to $358.90, up $1.30 from Tuesday's close. A late bid at the Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $357.50, up $1.50. Kevin Logan, chief economist in the New York branch of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a Congressional committee on Tuesday that the dollar should not fall much further "just reminded everybody the central bank is out there." On Monday, the Fed and several other central banks intervened in the currency markets in a coordinated swoop, supporting the sagging dollar by purchasing large amounts of the currency and selling German marks. The mark had been rising because of an increase in German interest rates last week. The dollar fell yesterday against the German mark in New York trading to 1.4850, compared with 1.4870 late Tuesday. The dollar closed in New York at 126.63 yen, up from 125.25 yen Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 125.42 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at 126.95 yen. The British pound fell to $1.9065 in New York, from $1.9095 Tuesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9025, from $1.9105 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.3150 Swiss francs, down from 1.3235; 1,127 Italian lire, down from 1,130.00; 5.0145 French francs, down from 5.0245, and 1.1882 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19185. Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.4885 German marks, up from 1.4880; 1.3215 Swiss francs, down from 1.3235; 5.0235 French francs, down from 5.0255; 1.6785 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6780; 1,128.50 Italian lire, down from 1,130.50, and 1.1903 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1925. Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $359.38 an ounce, from $357.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $358.85, from a $357.90 bid late Tuesday.

1019-> BARCELONA: BASKETBALL; Croatia Gives Petrovic Chance to Be a Leader
For Drazen Petrovic, there were two major differences between this suburb of Barcelona and East Rutherford, N.J. One was that the stands were full. The other was that the stands were happy. Exuberant might be a better word. This afternoon, Petrovic scored two foul shots with 9.1 seconds left and led the scoring with 28 points to give surging Croatia a 75-74 basketball victory over the crestfallen Unified Team. The comeback guaranteed Croatia of at least a silver medal when it plays the United States on Saturday night for the gold medal in the 1992 Summer Games. Croatia was playing on the bittersweet emotion of gaining its national identity, only to become involved in a bloody civil war in the breakup of Yugoslavia. There was a brief window of time, two years ago, when Yugoslavia was the onrushing national basketball team in the world. The dream was that they would pass the shaky Soviet Union and stand up to the United States. But then Yugoslavia came apart, and so did the Soviet Union, and now it was tiny Croatia against whatever was left of the Soviet Union. Free Throws a Must "A lot of pressure tonight," Petrovic said in quite good English. "Six or seven players used to play for Yugoslavia. You can't understand. Our country has only 4 or 5 million people and we are playing them. I must make my free throws." When the game was over, Petrovic spotted a Croatian flag. He ran into the stands, commandeered the flag and thrust it into the air. "I see from the track that some winners run with their flag," Petrovic said. "I wanted to do that, too." He has taken the ball and run with it. He might as well take the flag and run with it, too. Petrovic has been the big guy, the stud, the dude, the main man, all those respectful names athletes give to their leader. In his three seasons in the National Basketball Association, Petrovic has never run a team. He played one year for Portland, which already had its stars, and has now played for two years for the New Jersey Nets, a team so mired in bickering and confusion and ennui that no leadership has been possible. But with this new team, this Croatian national team, Petrovic is a man with three years of N.B.A. experience, a 6-foot-5 1/2-inch guard still discovering how much impact he can have on a game. He was fearless against Michael Jordan and today he was fearless against the Unified Team. Late in the game, he jabbered at the players who tried to elbow him off his stride. "I told them the game was not over, that we would win," he said. "I was talking in English. I don't know if they understood." They got the point. Croatia had identity and motivation, and Petrovic did not mind admitting it. "It's not only a basketball game," he said later. "It's civil war. When you have people killing each other, you have to hustle. We've been up and down in this tournament. We are so nervous." Petrovic had his family with him in New Jersey during the regular season, but now they are in Zagreb, and he reports things are calm there. "But in Bosnia," he added, "things are getting worse. The Serbs are trying to kill people." The emotion took them so far, but still it was necessary to play smart basketball. In the final minutes, clawing for the ball, they fouled Aleksandr Volkov, the Ukrainian who missed four straight free throws. "Coach says, 'We got to foul Volkov.' That was a good call for our coach," Petrovic said, praising Petar Skansi. Now Skansi must come up with some kind of game plan for the United States team, coached by Chuck Daly, who will take over the New Jersey franchise in October. Petrovic is giving Daly some major impressions to take to fall camp. But first, can Croatia even dream of beating the United States? "We need seven or eight guys playing their best game," Petrovic said. "They don't have their best game. We mix our defenses on zone. I learn this in the N.B.A. You go out there and try to beat the other team. It is the only way."

1020-> Indochina's Missing: An Issue That Refuses to Die
On the evening of March 29, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon, eager to put the Vietnam War behind him, told a national television and radio audience that the time had come to bring down the curtain on the Vietnam experience. "Tonight, the day we have all worked and prayed for has finally come," he said. "For the first time in 12 years, no American military forces are in Vietnam. All our American P.O.W.'s are on their way home." For some who served -- and who waited -- the words rang hollow the moment they were uttered. Neither statement was true: American forces, some of them suddenly metamorphosed into civilian advisers, had remained behind in Indochina. And, as newly released documents are now confirming, Administration officials knew that not all the prisoners had returned when the last of 591 men came home that week. 'Not Reading the Reports' "We sat around and laughed," John F. King, an Army intelligence specialist at the time, recalled in an interview today. "We said, 'Hey, he's not reading the reports we're sending him.' " Mr. King, now director of public affairs for the Vietnam Veterans of America, was on a team assigned to interview a small group of returning prisoners of war, he said. But when Operation Homecoming was over, only one of the men on his list came back. The spring of 1973 was neither the beginning nor the end of the bitter P.O.W-M.I.A. story, which is now woven into the politics of both the United States and Vietnam and which has become the last hurdle to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi. A Lack of Trust "We have to trust each other," Trinh Xuan Lang, Vietnam's chief delegate to the United Nations, said in an interview last week. But American demands on Hanoi, he said, "prove there is no trust." American officials also have doubts. "We recognized from the outset that reopening negotiations with Vietnam was a potential minefield," Richard T. Childress, formerly of the National Security Council, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs on Wednesday, as he recalled the Reagan Administration's efforts to restart talks in the early 1980's after a period of silence. "Given my experience," he said, "we should never take Vietnamese pledges, promises or excuses at face value." Hanoi and Washington began talking about prisoners in the 1966, a year after American ground troops were introduced into Vietnam. In 1973, the year the United States withdrew from the war after the Paris peace accords and prisoner exchanges were carried out, the Nixon Administration quickly lost what little opportunity or will it had to pursue the issue of prisoners who did not return. Officials who worked on the issue during that period have tried to recreate in Senate committee hearings over the last few months a sense of that turbulent period, when Americans wanted to put a divisive war behind them, and when the Nixon Administration was headed into the vortex of the Watergate scandal. There were a few abortive suggestions that Washington threaten to restart the war if Hanoi, then moving forces into South Vietnam, did not live up to its peace treaty pledges to honor Saigon's independence and give a fuller accounting of the American dead and missing. But Congress would not condone military action, nor would it agree to pay Hanoi any of the $3.25 billion in reconstruction aid the Vietnamese say they were promised; Washington regarded it as a proposal. "By the end of April 1973, therefore, our strategy for Vietnam was in tatters," Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's national security adviser, wrote in his memoirs, "Years of Upheaval." Lobbies were forming on behalf of the missing, led by the National League of Families. Ann Mills Griffiths, the executive director of the League, said its early activities included demonstrations and filing suit to stop the Pentagon from making an automatic "presumption of death" judgment in missing cases. Later, Mrs. Griffiths would serve as a representative of families on many negotiating trips to Hanoi. She says she observed a pattern in Hanoi's tactics in which talks would move forward, and then suddenly stall. During the Administration of President Gerald Ford, the issue of the missing was more or less put on hold. Approach by Carter When President Jimmy Carter took office, a new approach was made to Hanoi. The United States moved toward establishing relations, on the theory that the job of looking for any Americans who may have remained in Vietnam would be easier in a better climate that provided wider access to the Vietnamese countryside. The first of a series of reports on the prisoner-missing issue had been released around the time of Mr. Carter's election. The report, prepared by the House Select Committee on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, under the chairmanship of Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, concluded that no Americans were held alive as prisoners in Indochina, but that a partial accounting of the missing was possible. Those conclusions have been supported by many officials and subsequent commissions, though not by many family members. President Carter's efforts to open links to Hanoi were thwarted by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978. In the late 1980's, the prisoner-missing issue picked up steam in the United States as President Ronald Reagan vowed to make an accounting a "national priority." Since 1982, the Administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush pursued a policy of regular contacts with Hanoi, sending delegations to seek resolution of at least some of the 2,266 cases of people unaccounted for since the war. In more than half these cases, servicemen are assumed to have died, but their bodies have not been recovered. In 1987, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was appointed a special presidential envoy to Hanoi. He has been urging the Vietnamese to open their archives to help solve about 135 "discrepancy cases," where American officials are convinced by the information they have that Hanoi must know what happened to the servicemen involved. In 1991, Hanoi, still hoping for an American embassy, allowed the United States to open a P.O.W.-M.I.A. office. Americans insist that Vietnam can do more to resolve the discrepancy cases, thereby moving the stalled talks on normalizing relations farther along a hypothetical "road map" devised by the State Department.

1021-> HORSE RACING; Sky Beauty Becomes Belle of Her Class
If the old Saratoga Race Course indeed makes some champions and breaks others, it may have done a little of both today. Sky Beauty, a daughter of Blushing Groom and granddaughter of Nijinsky II, stayed undefeated and shot toward the head of the class of 2-year-old fillies by winning the 77th running of the Adirondack Stakes. She now has a three-race winning streak and a strong tactical position in the yearlong race for the championship of the juvenile division. And along the way today, she ran past a pair of contenders, Missed the Storm and Distinct Habit, also both undefeated until they tangled with Sky Beauty. It's not that Sky Beauty has simply won three straight for her owner, Georgia Hofmann of Florida, and her trainer, H. Allen Jerkens. It's the way she won the three: by two lengths in her debut at Belmont Park on July 3, by 2 1/2 lengths in her encore race two weeks later and by 3 1/2 in her first stakes race today. Fast First Quarter She stalked both Missed the Storm and Distinct Habit for five furlongs, and Eddie Maple kept his head even when it looked as if Missed the Storm might travel wire to wire after rocketing the first quarter-mile in 214/5 seconds. Then Sky Beauty kicked past both leaders in the homestretch and blew them away. At the close, she had opened major daylight on Missed the Storm, who had even more daylight (seven lengths) on Distinct Habit, the winner of the Schuylerville here on opening day 16 days ago. The time was a snappy 1:10 flat for six furlongs, the payoff a gentle $5.80 for $2 to win, and Sky Beauty brought home $70,560 of the purse of $117,600. "I didn't have to do anything with her in the stretch," Maple reported, giving the credit to Sky Beauty. "She's a talented filly, and this race should move her forward." How far forward? At least to the next milestone, the Spinaway Stakes at Saratoga on Aug. 31, which is two months to the day before the Breeders' Cup championships. "If she comes out of this race O.K.," Jerkens said, "if she moves forward off it, yes, that could be next. I wanted to try and conserve the horse." Yearling Market Improves After a slow start, the auction market for yearlings turned stronger at the annual Saratoga sales. On the opening night Tuesday, 52 horses were sent into the ring and 40 were sold at an average price of $79,025, which represented a significant drop from last year's average of $121,105. But on the second night of the sale, 44 horses were sold, only 8 were bought back by their owners and the average price rose to $108,886. On the final session Thursday, 40 horses were sold at an average price of $102,350. The sale ended with 124 yearlings sold at an average price of $97,145, a drop of about 20 percent from last year. "We're obviously still looking at a market decline," said D. G. Van Clief, president of the Fasig-Tipton auction company. "But some elements are worth noting. Last year's sale, for example, was helped by a strong contingent of horses being sold by Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky, and we don't have a large group like that this time." Interest by foreign investors also perked up as the sale continued. Only half a dozen of the yearlings sold on opening night were bought by owners from abroad. But the highest price that night was paid by Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai, who posted $325,000 for a daughter of Fappiano. At the second session, the sheik also led the list when he put up $350,000 for a colt sired by Private Account. The overall market reflected the continuing slump in horse prices of the last few years. At the world-renowned Keeneland sales of selected yearlings last month, the average price for a horse dropped 19 percent and the gross sales plunged 35 percent. The Saratoga sales customarily trail those at Keeneland in quality and price.

1023-> BARCELONA: ROUNDUP; U.S. Wrestler Sets Mark With Medal
Bruce Baumgartner made a bit of Olympic history today and, in the process, gave the United States its first gold medal in wrestling in these Summer Games. Baumgartner defeated Jeff Thue of Canada, 8-0, in the 286-pound category. The victory brought Baumgartner a gold medal to go along with the silver he won in the 1988 Games and the gold he gained in 1984, making him the first American wrestler to win medals in three Olympics. There was an unusual incentive for Baumgartner, a 31-year-old from Cambridge Springs, Pa.: homesickness. "I have a 2-year-old son, and we called him from here on his birthday," Baumgartner said. "I missed it because I was here. My wife had coached him to say, 'Win the gold, Daddy,' and that really motivated me." Baumgartner said he was not sure if he will wrestle after these Games, but if he does, his son, Bryan, will again be part of the equation. "One motivation that keeps me going is to give him a chance to see me wrestle when he will be old enough to remember it," Baumgartner said. Three United States wrestlers remained in medal contention, with their competition due to wrap up on Friday: the five-time world champion John Smith in the 136 1/2-pound weight class, Kevin Jackson at 180 1/2 pounds, Kendall Cross at 125 1/2 pounds and Chris Campbell at 198 pounds. Campbell, a 37-year-old attorney from Fayetteville, N.Y., is a long shot for anything but a bronze because he has one loss. Smith is considered a good bet for his second straight gold medal, especially after today's 8-0 victory over Karsten Polky of Germany. SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING Scoring Mistake Benefits U.S. Performer BARCELONA, Spain, Aug. 6 (AP) -- Kristin Babb-Sprague of Pleasanton, Calif., won the synchronized swimming solo gold medal today after a scoring mistake by a judge drew protests from the silver medalist, Sylvie Frechette of Canada. Babb-Sprague edged Frechette, the defending world and Olympic champion, by 0.131 points as scores for their routines were added to Wednesday's marks for compulsory figures. Fumiko Okuno of Japan won the bronze medal. The Canadian delegation objected to the decision of an international swimming federation appeals jury, which ruled to uphold one of Frechette's scores from Wednesday's figures, even though the judge who cast the score declared it a mistake and wanted to change it. A Brazilian judge had pressed the wrong button and punched in an 8.7 score but immediately sought to change it to 9.7. An apparent computer malfunction prevented her from doing so, and the referee, an American, would not allow the change. Olympic officials admitted there had been some confusion but ruled Frechette's score could not be altered because, under the rules of the sport, "an issue of fact cannot be reversed." WATER POLO U.S. Squad Moves to Medal Round BARCELONA, Spain, Aug. 6 (AP) -- Goaltender Craig Wilson saved the United States' medal hopes in water polo. Wilson, from Davis, Calif., had 16 saves today as the United States used a tight defense to beat Germany by 7-2 to advance to the medal round. The Americans will face Spain or Italy in the semifinals Saturday. An 8-5 loss to the Unified Team on Wednesday had put the United States, the gold medal favorite, in a must-win situation against the Germans. Two of Wilson's saves were from point-blank range. "Some days they feel like golf balls," he said. "Today was a beach ball day." The Germans made only 2 of 26 attempts. Davis now has saves on 61 of 85 shots in his 5 Olympic games. KAYAKING AND CANOEING Two Continue Bid to Repeat as Medalists CASTELLDEFELS, Spain, Aug. 6 (AP) -- Greg Barton, who won two gold medals in the 1988 Olympics, moved into the finals in the both the singles and pairs kayak events today. Barton, of Bellingham, Wash., won his heat in the K-1 1,000 meters with the second-fastest time overall. He and Norman Bellingham of Washington advanced to the finals in the K-2 1,000, finishing second in their heat with the third-fastest time overall. They are seeking to become the first to repeat as gold medalists in the pairs event. Bellingham had also advanced to the finals in single kayak 500 meters in the semifinals Wednesday. Six United States boats are in the finals, putting the Americans in position for their best Olympic showing ever in canoeing and kayaking. TABLE TENNIS Swedish Player Wins Country's First Gold BARCELONA, Spain, Aug. 6 (AP) -- Jan Ove Waldner, a two-time world champion, gave Sweden its first gold medal of the Olympics by beating Jean Philippe Gatien of France, 21-10, 21-18, 25-23, in men's singles. Kim Taek Soo of South Korea and Ma Wenge of China won the bronze medals, as they did at the world championships last year. Waldner, 26 years old, was the first non-Chinese to win a gold medal in Olympic table tennis this year. China had won in women's singles and doubles and men's doubles after taking two of four titles in 1988.

1024-> U.S. SAYS AIRLIFTS FAIL SOMALI NEEDY
United States disaster experts who made a one-day visit to Mogadishu, Somalia, said today that emergency airlifts proposed by the United Nations would not solve the problem of how to get food to tens of thousands of starving people. The director of the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, James R. Kunder, said after the visit to Mogadishu on Wednesday that the major barrier to helping the hungry was the continuing fighting between rival clans in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. A greater effort had to be made, he said, to win agreement between the warring factions in Mogadishu to allow food already in the country to get to the people in need. Mr. Kunder's remarks were made at a news conference in Nairobi, Kenya, and made available in London by news agencies. In telephone interviews, members of Mr. Kunder's team said that they had concluded that the fighting by heavily armed members of rival clans in Mogadishu was mostly over food and that hasty airlifts would only increase the level of fighting while the starving would still not get the food. Tens of Thousands Dead Earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council approved an emergency airlift of food to Somalia, a mostly desert country of 4.5 million to 6 million people on the Horn of Africa. Tens of thousands of Somalis have died from the combined effects of war and drought in the last few months. A special task force on Somalia was formed at the State Department this week under the leadership of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, officials said. The task force would decide what measures to take in Somalia after hearing from Mr. Kunder on his return to Washington on Friday, the officials said. Because of the neglect of Somalia so far, officials said there would be a temptation to mount airlifts as a way of appearing to be doing something even though they may not achieve much. Mr. Kunder, the most senior United States official to visit Mogadishu since the outbreak of civil war there 18 months ago, said, "People are dying in the thousands daily because aid workers cannot move relief food." He described the conditions in Somalia as "the single worst humanitarian crisis in the world." "It is appalling that there is food at the Mogadishu port and at a store nearby but it cannot reach millions of starving people a few kilometers away because of the insecurity," he said. Urges U.N. Pressure Mr. Kunder said the United Nations needed to pressure the two competing warlords of Mogadishu, Mohammed Farah Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohammed, to insure that there was no further shelling of commercial ships coming into the port. Mr. Kunder was accompanied on his five-hour stay in Mogadishu by Fred Cuny, a disaster consultant to the Agency for International Development, and two other agency officials. The team members said that ways had to be found to saturate Somalia with food so that the incentive for the fighting would be reduced. They said food should be trucked over the border from Kenya and left at staging posts in southern Somalia so that people could pick it up there rather than having to trek to provincial centers like Baidoa, or moving across the border into Kenya as refugees. In the last several months, tens of thousands of hungry nomadic Somalis, their cattle and camels stolen, have arrived in Baidoa, 150 miles northwest of Mogadishu. Many of them have died. There are now more than 330,000 Somali refugees in northern Kenya , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The American disaster experts said another way of getting food to people was to sell relief food to Somali merchants in Kenya who would take the food back to Somalia and sell it at fair prices. Through competition, the price of food would drop and Somalis with some money could buy it, leaving the free food to the most destitute.

1025-> SENATOR DEMANDS BANK-CASE INQUIRY
In an extraordinarily blunt letter to Attorney General William P. Barr, Senator David L. Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, asserted today that the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency had misled prosecutors, a Federal judge and the American people in the case of a multibillion-dollar bank fraud involving Iraq. The Senator's letter, laying out the reasons for his concern, called for Mr. Barr to immediately reverse his decision rejecting the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the two agencies' handling of the case. Mr. Barr turned down a similar request in August from the House Judiciary Committee, and Senator Boren's appeal is likely to put new pressure on him to reconsider. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was consulting members of his panel today on the issue. The Intelligence Committee, which will open its own investigation on Friday, informed the Justice Department today that it intends to send a team to Atlanta to take sworn statements from the prosecutors and investigators. Gates Expected to Testify Mr. Boren, who is a lawyer, will also call a number of C.I.A. officials, including Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, to determine whether the agency cooperated fully in the investigation of the case, which involved the making of billions of dollars in loans to Iraq. The committee will also interview senior department officials, but has not yet decided whether to interview Mr. Barr or former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. "A truly independent investigation is required to determine whether Federal crimes were committed in the Government's handling" of the case, Mr. Boren said in the letter. The Justice Department said that Mr. Boren's demand for an independent prosecutor was motivated by partisan politics. "You can expect the Democrats to make these calls every day for the next three weeks," said Paul McNulty, a department spokesman. A C.I.A. spokesman, Mark Mansfield, said the agency would not comment. In his letter, Senator Boren listed four reasons why Mr. Barr should reverse himself: the recent discovery of classified documents relevant to the case; the strong public criticism of the prosecution by Judge Marvin H. Shoob, who recused himself because of his opinions about the case; a C.I.A. admission that, at the strong urging of the Justice Department, it produced what the Senator called a "misleading letter" to the prosecutors, and the announcement by both the C.I.A. and the Justice Department that they have started investigations of the case. The Senator also made new charges. He said that documents continue "to trickle out of the C.I.A.," adding that prosecutors and Judge Shoob were not given documents that his committee had earlier received, and that his committee only last week received documents that had been given to the Justice Department. Who Was Responsible? And Mr. Boren called into question the Justice Department's charge that the C.I.A. failed to produce documents. He said in a statement that the F.B.I., part of the Justice Department, "received or was knowledgable of nearly all of the key classified reports at the time they were originally issued." Over the last few months, the case has turned from a simple bank fraud into one that had implications for American relations with Italy and Iraq. A newly disclosed Justice Department memo, for example, shows that Rinaldo Petrignani, Italy's Ambassador to the United States, in a breach of diplomatic protocol, accompanied bank officials to a meeting with the Atlanta prosecutors and investigators. A year and a half after Federal agents raided the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, prosecutors indicted the manager, Christopher P. Drogoul, charging him with loaning Iraq billions of dollars in violation of bank regulations, and therefore, of defrauding his superiors. More than three years after the raid, the C.I.A. is still uncovering documents that might have helped establish the complicity of the Rome headquarters in the case. But such revelations would have weakened the case against Mr. Drogoul and might have implicated the Rome bank, which is almost wholly owned by the Italian Government. The Senate panel's investigation will also focus on whether C.I.A. officials themselves had access to all relevant documents when writing certain reports, or whether the internal system is so compartmentalized that it shuts out the agency's own officials.

1026-> HOCKEY; Lemieux Is Sidelined Amid Slash Controversy
Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins, considered by many to be hockey's best player, will miss tonight's game and possibly the rest of the National Hockey League playoffs because a bone in his left hand was fractured on Tuesday night when Adam Graves of the Rangers slashed him with his stick early into a 4-2 Ranger victory at Madison Square Garden. The injury to Lemieux seriously damages Pittsburgh's hopes of repeating as Stanley Cup champions and can only help the Rangers in the quest for their first championship since 1940. The Patrick Division final, which resumes in Pittsburgh, is tied at 1-1. Graves received a two-minute minor penalty for slashing Lemieux, but his act is being reviewed by Brian O'Neill, the N.H.L.'s executive vice president, who serves as the league's chief justice in these matters. A suspension of Graves is a possibility although Graves and Ranger officials say it would be undeserved. Mullen Out, Too Shortly after the play involving Lemieux, another high-scoring Penguin forward, Joe Mullen, swerved to avoid a trip by Paul Broten and was crashed to the ice by a blind-side hit from Kris King. Mullen left the game and never returned, and yesterday the Penguins announced he was out indefinitely with a strained knee ligament. King was not penalized. Videotapes of the slash to Lemieux have been sent to O'Neill, who was in Chicago last night for a game between the Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings. O'Neill is expected to travel to Pittsburgh today and could meet with Graves and Ranger officials before tonight's game. Gary Meagher, a league spokesman, said that no player can be suspended without a formal hearing and that none was scheduled as of last evening. The circumstances of the injury and the stature of the player injured could be factors in a decision by the league, which already has had its 75th anniversary season tainted by a 10-day players strike near the end of the regular season. Critical of Violence Lemieux, the league's leading scorer this season and its most valuable player in last spring's playoffs, is a frequent critic of violence in hockey. He has also criticized the officiating, which he says tacitly encourages violations of the rules that minimize the contributions of players with talent and maximize the effect of aggressive players with mediocre skills. Earlier this season, when he thought the officials weren't calling penalties properly, Lemieux called the N.H.L. "a garage league." Lemieux and most Penguin officials refused comment on the injury yesterday. But Coach Scotty Bowman said that "hockey doesn't need to lose a player like Mario Lemieux in an incident like this; he's a very important player to the N.H.L." Calls to Lemieux's home seeking comment were answered only by a tape machine. Protective Role for Graves Graves, although a much-admired and effective member of the Rangers, is a role player. He is known primarily for his checking skills and his willingness to protect Mark Messier, the Ranger superstar, whose absence from Game 2 with back spasms raised talk of the possibility that the injury to Lemieux had evened matters. No one disputes the notion that if the Penguins play without Lemieux and the Rangers play without Graves, the Rangers get the best of the deal. The injury occurred 5 minutes 5 seconds into the game, with Pittsburgh ahead, 1-0. After Lemieux fell to the ice in pain, Graves gave his prone body a shove while the Garden fans hooted and cheered, much as fans did two years ago in a playoff game after Pat LaFontaine of the Islanders suffered a concussion when two Rangers lined him up for a collision. As LaFontaine was being rushed to the hospital, fans surrounded the ambulance and rocked it while pounding on the windows. After Tuesday night's game, Coach Roger Neilson of the Rangers said "it's great not having to worry about Lemieux." Neilson complained to reporters yesterday that the quote was taken out of context. A review of the audio tape revealed that Neilson was responding to a question about how the injury to Lemieux had changed the Ranger strategy for the rest of the game. In an interview with reporters after practice at Rye Playland yesterday, Neilson said that Graves "slashed him too hard and he got a two-minute penalty for it." Neilson that said Kevin Stevens of the Penguins had slashed King and that act wasn't penalized. The Rangers have put together a videotape of this and other incidents to use if they are called before O'Neill for a hearing. Neilson defended Graves's tactic of hitting Lemieux's gloved hands with a piece of wood. "You are supposed to go for the hands," Neilson said. The coach said he was concerned about N.H.L. justice because this case involves a star player. "A different standard may exist," Neilson said. Graves Explains Graves said he was trying to hit Lemieux in the glove to loosen his grip on the stick and take away the puck. "I hit him right in the glove; it was quite evident," Graves explained. "The play that I did was not invented last night. You see four or five guys coming across with their sticks on gloves every game. "My record speaks for itself. I never use the stick. I can't say I'm an angel, but you go back and look at my record and you can see I don't use my stick. You can't say I'm a goon." Graves said Lemieux is "a class guy, a great player," adding that "I wouldn't want to hurt him. I've got to live with whatever happens." 'Give Him a Litle Whack' The slashing incident occurred when Graves was killing a Ranger penalty and the Penguins had a man advantage. When killing penalties, it is common for the short-handed team's players to swing their sticks in the direction of players with the puck, often hitting their sticks and sometimes their gloves. Phil Bourque, a Pittsburgh forward who also kills penalties, said, "You try to hack a guy's stick, give him a little whack across the hands." But Bourque said that Graves's action was extreme. "After I saw the tape, I said, 'This is a joke; this is ridiculous,' " Bourque said. "He wound up like a baseball swing, a two-handed, wild baseball swing, and definitely intended to hurt him." King, with a bandage on his right arm following practice yesterday, said he had a bruised muscle from Stevens's slash. He said that such slashes were common and that the one he took was different from the one Lemieux took because he didn't go down the way Lemieux did. "It's a good play," King said. "You either hook the hands or you slash at them. It warranted a two-minute penalty, nothing more."

1029-> Producer Prices Join Retail Sales in 0.3% Rise
In continued evidence of meager economic growth, retail sales edged three-tenths of 1 percent higher in September amid subdued inflation, the Government said today. Still, the rise in sales in September, aided to some extent by rebuilding in Florida and Louisiana after Hurricane Andrew, combined with an upward revision in the August sales figure to dampen hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. "The economy is still moving ahead, though very slowly," commented Edward Guay, a senior economist for the Cigna Corporation, the Connecticut-based insurer. The Producer Price Index for finished goods climbed three-tenths of 1 percent, keeping the inflation gauge for the latest 12 months at the same 1.6 percent pace it averaged in July and August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the index rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Labor Department calculated. Gains in retail sales, which account for one-third of economic activity, were concentrated last month in durable goods, which climbed to $58.74 billion from $58.27 billion, the Commerce Department reported. This was a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Sales of nondurables inched down one-tenth of 1 percent, to $102.39 billion. But while the aftermath of the hurricane undoubtedly pushed sales totals higher, the department could not quantify the impact. Not only were many forces, including some negatives, at work, but today's so-called advance report was also based on a relatively small sample of 3,000 retailers. Next month's "preliminary" estimate of September sales will cover 12,000 outlets, while the final tally will cover 22,000. This also helps explain the frequent, substantial revisions of the figures, which now show August retail sales unchanged instead of down five-tenths of 1 percent. The biggest hurricane effect was seen in a 2.6 percent sales jump reported by merchants in building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes. This followed a 1.5 percent decline in August, a result largely unaffected by the hurricane since it occurred one week before the end of the month. Sales of furniture, home furnishings and equipment climbed 1.9 percent in September, and there appeared to be at least minor hurricane-related sales gains in the four-tenths of 1 percent increase for automotive dealers. Ronald Piencykoski, a Commerce Department specialist, pointed, for example, to people leasing recreational vehicles as substitutes for lost homes. On the other hand, sales of some nondurables, including food and clothing, appeared to have been cut by the storm, partly reflecting the appearance of soup kitchens and donated items. Sales declined 1.5 percent at the nation's food stores last month while sales at restaurants and bars eased two-tenths of 1 percent. There was no change at drug and proprietary stores, but solid gains were recorded by department and other general-merchandise stores, which enjoyed a five-tenths of 1 percent increase, and by gasoline service stations and apparel and accessory stores, both up 1.9 percent. Caution on Storm Mr. Piencykoski cautioned against overestimating the effects of the hurricane, noting that Dade County, Fla., the area hardest hit, accounts for only seven-tenths of 1 percent of national sales. Last month's retail spending was 4.4 percent higher than that of September 1991, but this does not make allowance for price changes. Consumer inflation has run at a 3.1 percent pace over the 12 months through August. The Consumer Price Index for September is to be published Thursday. Though the consensus among private economists was that the economy was showing little improvement, the Bush Administration welcomed today's report. In a statement, Commerce Secretary Barbara Hackman Franklin said sales for the third quarter, which rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent, represented a "solid increase" from the second-quarter annual pace of nine-tenths of 1 percent and was "evidence of an ongoing recovery" in the economy at large. Today's inflation report covering prices received by producers was marked by an eight-tenths of 1 percent surge in the price of energy, mainly gasoline, and a 4.3 percent jump in the price of tobacco prices. Food rose four-tenths of 1 percent, but there were sizable declines for passenger cars, prescription drugs, periodicals and soaps and detergents. Prices at the intermediate stage of production edged up two-tenths of 1 percent after two months of no change. Energy and feeds gained in price while construction materials rose slightly more than in August. Prices declined for both durable and nondurable materials used in manufacturing. Goods at the crude level rose 1.6 percent following two months of negligible or no change, the report said.

1035-> COMPANY NEWS; INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS WILL BUY BACK SHARES
The board of International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. has authorized the buyback of up to 2.5 million common shares, or 6.5 percent of the company's common stock. The company said the repurchased shares would be used for employee benefit plans and other general purposes. International Flavors shares were trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at around $108, making the cost of buying back those shares about $270 million. Diane L. Mustain, an analyst with Duff & Phelps, said the company was repurchasing the shares because of low returns on its $400 million in cash. Capital spending only uses about $40 million a year, and cash flow is high, she said. International Flavors, based in New York, makes flavors and fragrances from natural and synthetic materials.

1036-> Lady Rothermere, Society Hostess, 63; Benefited Charities
Lady Rothermere, a society hostess and the wife of the Third Viscount Rothermere, the British newspaper publisher, died on Wednesday at a villa in the south of France, her family said today. She was 63 years old. Her son, Jonathan Harmsworth, said she apparently suffered a heart attack in her sleep at the family home in Cap-d'Ail, about seven miles northeast of Nice, according to a spokesman for The Daily Mail in London. Her husband, Lord Rothermere, is chairman of the Associated Newspapers group, the successor to a newspaper dynasty founded in the 19th century by a forebear, Alfred Charles William Harmsworth, later Viscount Northcliffe. The group publishes The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and The London Evening Standard. Lady Rothermere, who was sometimes called Bubbles, frequently entertained politicians, aristocrats and celebrities at lavish dinners, using the parties to raise money for charities. Wouldn't Play the 'Heavy' She once said of her marriage: "When I married my husband, I didn't just marry a man, as my father-in-law pointed out to me, I married an empire. And, in a way, I think I projected a frivolous image of myself on purpose because I did not want to be the 'heavy' wife of a newspaper publisher." But she did not like her nickname, bestowed by the magazine Private Eye. "It smacks too much of the social butterfly," she once said. Lady Rothermere divided her time between homes in London, Jamaica, Paris, California and New York. She also had a home in Sussex, England. Born Patricia Evelyn Beverley Matthews, the daughter of an architect, she became an actress in her 20's. Her first marriage, to Christopher John Brooks, ended in divorce in 1956 after the birth of a daughter, Sarah-Jane. She married Vere Harmsworth, now Viscount Rothermere, in 1957. Besides her husband, her eldest daughter and her son, she is survived by two daughters from her second marriage, Geraldine and Camilla.

1037-> ARTS/ARTIFACTS; Toys Transformed by Wit and Whimsy
Compared to the mechanical and live birds in "Batman Returns," the toy ducks, penguins and cats that Charles Bell uses as models for his paintings are Lilliputian. But the fantasy images he creates, using wind-up toys to depict circuses, Greek myths and takeoffs on other artists' works that he photographs and then paints, are frequently as eerie or witty as those in the film. Typical of Mr. Bell's Photorealist paintings is one that portrays clowns with hands shaped like ducks' feet and legs locked together like a tail; they are doing handstands while a seal balances a ball on its snout and a ballerina twirls eternally. The artist's modern-dress "Judgment of Paris" uses dolls: Barbie beauty queens and G. I. Joes. And his takeoff on a primeval landscape by Henri Rousseau depicts dinosaurs in a fantastic jungle. Although Mr. Bell's work is not currently on view, his paintings of toys, marbles and pinball machines are documented in "Charles Bell: The Complete Works 1970-1990," by Henry Geldzahler, published recently by Harry N. Abrams. "I started buying toys in 1969 or 1970," the 57-year old artist said, surveying his collection of about 350 wind-ups and dolls that fill several shelves in his lower Manhattan studio. "I'm a still-life painter and was seeking alternatives to apples and oranges." He was certain he had found the answer when he happened on some cartoon-character toys that were complex enough in design to function on several levels. "A toy duck is just a piece of bent metal -- and we know that," he said, referring to an image in his 1982 painting "The Critics." "But it also represents a duck -- and we know that, even though it doesn't look like a real duck. So it's this multilevel subjective nature of what we accept as reality that fascinates me." When Mr. Bell began buying, toys made of lithographed tin and celluloid that were produced between 1900 and 1960 in the United States, Germany and Japan were plentiful and inexpensive. "Tin toys were every toy collectors' rejects then," he said. "They were too new and too common. And everyone was concentrating on cast iron. At the first auction I went to, the opening price for a group of tin toys dropped to $5. And the auctioneer pleaded for someone to bid." Mr. Bell acquired the lot for $5. Later, he paid as much as $1,200 apiece for some of the birds, beasts and comic-character toys he bought at auctions and flea markets. However, when he bid for German toy battleships from the turn of the century, he was consistently outflanked by a prominent collector. "Malcolm Forbes outbid me every time," he said. Mr. Bell's first attempts at painting toy still-lifes misfired. "Two or three people said they thought the paintings would be wonderful in their little girls' rooms," he recalled. "I was shocked to think I was trafficking in nostalgia when that was certainly not my intent." He packed away his toys and did not return to them until, as he put it, "the East Village art scene was hopping a decade later." This time he conceived his toy paintings as parodies rather than portraits. In his paintings of myths, gods are toys and toys are gods. And his caricatures of other artists' work and sendups of cabarets and circuses are transformed by the way he heightens the expressions on his toy models. The grin on a monkey's face becomes a leer, and the quizzical look on a bird deepens to a frown. No one misread Mr. Bell's paintings when they were eventually exhibited at the Louis K. Meisel Gallery in the SoHo section of Manhattan. His work, which is shown every two years by the gallery, is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, as well as in the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art Museum and the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. Mr. Bell's affinity for Surrealism is evident in his paintings and in the artists he chooses to imitate. The work of Giorgio De Chirico inspired his 1986 painting "Midsummer's Dream," in which a dull-eyed doll is serenaded by jesters on stilts and a clown who clashes cymbals. And a fiery scene of devils, dragons and monsters, watched by an angel clinging to a painter's palette, is his interpretation of the style of Hieronymous Bosch. "I'm very taken with the idea of the clown and the circus," he said. "Sometimes clowns are macabre." In "Lullaby," from 1983, Mr. Bell depicts a clown as a white-faced, malevolent voyeur with wicked, knowing eyes and a frozen smile peering out at the world from a picture frame. The large red dot on the tip of the clown's nose and the green splashes on his cheeks are believed to be part of the makeup that circus performers adopted in the late Middle Ages as a commentary on the Black Plague. Mr. Bell's appetite for ambiguities in toys may be rooted in his own past. "I had a sort of Norman Rockwell upbringing," he said. "We lived on that cultural oasis in the prairies settled by people from the East seeking oil and jobs on the railroads -- Tulsa, Okla. Some people called it the Magic Empire."

1038-> Bias Beating And a Death Shock a City
Last weekend in this small Southeast Florida city, a 19-year-old pre-medical student who came to this country as a child with his parents from Vietnam, was fatally beaten by a group of young white men after he objected to a racial slur one of them used. The student, Luyen Phan Nguyen, of Coral Springs, died Monday. The Broward County Medical Examiner said the fatal blow was a kick behind an ear that fractured a neck bone and severed arteries. On Wednesday, with newspapers and television stations reporting each development, the police began arresting young men they said were tied to the beating. On Thursday, 175 friends and family members held a Buddhist ceremony for Mr. Nguyen, and some prayed near where he was beaten. Afterward, the county's small Asian community pleaded for justice. Former classmates at Coral Springs High School said Mr. Nguyen was popular and an excellent student. He was on the school math team, ran track and was in the environmental club. He would have been a sophomore this fall at the University of Miami. Lingering Unease for Residents With the arrests and the family's anguish receiving wide publicity, residents said it would take a long time to recover from the kind of violence and bias that were virtually unknown in their upper-middle-class city of 85,000 people. "This is Coral Springs, a family neighborhood," said Yazid Ali, who moved here a year ago from Jamaica, Queens, with his wife and young son. "In this neighborhood, you can't fix your car in the street. You get a ticket for that. You can't have a sign advertising your business on your car. There are so many rules. I can't understand how this could happen." The incident began late Saturday at a party attended by Mr. Nguyen and the young men in the apartment complex where Mr. Ali lives. Someone made a derogatory remark about Mr. Nguyen's nationality. He protested and left, witnesses told the police. They said several young men followed Mr. Nguyen out the door. "It started off with some young guy wanting to be a tough guy, and everybody just got involved," said a police investigator, James P. Milford. "They chased him down like a hunter chases down an injured deer." Mr. Ali said he heard cursing and "drunk talk" around 11 P.M. in a grassy area between buildings. He went to his balcony and saw 15 to 20 people, some of them hitting someone on the ground. "I yelled, 'Let him up, let him up!' " Mr. Ali said. "They were really beating up this kid." 8 Arrested in Beating A neighbor telephoned the police as the beating continued and after a few minutes, Mr. Ali said, it stopped. Witnesses said the attackers got into cars and left as residents tried to help Mr. Nguyen, who appeared to have stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived and took him to a Fort Lauderdale hospital, where officials said he was on a life-support system until he died. By Friday, the police had arrested eight men in the case, 18 to 22 years old, and charged them with second-degree murder. Coral Springs's police chief, Roy A. Arigo, said that some of the suspects had minor criminal records but that most were middle-class working men with no record of trouble. One had just returned home after completing Marine boot camp at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and one said he was unemployed. The others said they worked at resorts, automobile dealerships and other businesses. Rights groups issued pleas for tolerance, saying they feared the incident might be an indication that bias was on the rise here. The state authorities said 43 bias crimes were reported in Broward County in 1991, none involving Asians. Like Mr. Ali, many Coral Springs residents seemed to fear that the kind of violence they fled in other parts of the country and that they associate with other parts of Southeast Florida seemed to be gaining in the city. Coral Springs's Mayor, Jeanne Mills, blamed a "party out of control," where "everyone was under some kind of influence." Chief Arigo said: "Coral Springs enjoys a very low crime rate. In fact, the crime rate is the lowest for a city of our size in Southeast Florida, but this just goes to show you that no matter where you live, violence is part of society."

One night was not enough to ease the sting Jason Staurovsky felt from having missed two field-goal attempts in the Jets' 20-17 loss to the Falcons Sunday afternoon in Atlanta. But it did appear to be enough time for the Jets' head coach, Bruce Coslet, to become more steamed about his team's performance. Sitting on a picnic table in the locker room at the Jets' training center this afternoon, Staurovsky was still kicking himself over the missed attempts. "Obviously there were a couple of other things that happened throughout the game," Staurovsky said. "A fumble here and there. But the offense got me an opportunity to win the game. That's their job. They did their job and I didn't do my job. That was the difference in the game, basically." Everyone's to Blame While not absolving Staurovsky for the misses, Coslet took a holistic approach to the loss. "I wasn't satisfied with anything," Coslet said, clearly perturbed. "There isn't a player in that locker room that couldn't have played better. We had our opportunities and we didn't captialize on them. Basically, we spotted them 20 points and a full quarter. We played three quarters of the game and spotted them 20 points and that's why we lost." Coslet was asked how much patience he would have with Staurovsky, who beat out Raul Allegre for the job during training camp mainly on the strength of going 5 for 5 in field-goal attempts in five preseason games. "Just like I do with everybody else," Coslet said. "I can't put a time on that. That's not a very fair question. What if he makes the next 10 in a row. If he misses his next 10 in a row, we've got a problem." The more immediate concern for Coslet is that he not let his team slip into the pattern that plagued it last year: losing games that they should win. He wasn't about to accept talk of deriving something positive from losing. "A loss is a loss," he said. "We're past that stuff. I'm tired to getting off to a slow start. I'm tired of teams we should beat beating us. That's not acceptable. Why in the world would you get off to a slow start in the season opener? You got me. It must have been the lavender locker room." Coslet was referring to the fact that the visitors' locker room in the Georgia Dome is painted a pastel lavender. The Falcons' locker room is gray. Maybe the lavender did have something of a soothing effect on the Jets in the first half, because they came out playing as if they thought they were spending the day at the beach. The Jets' defense was on the field for 12 minutes 30 seconds of the first quarter, while the Falcons ran up a 17-0 lead. "Early they creased us running, but also early we ran into a real hot quarterback," Coslet said, referring to Falcons quarterback Chris Miller. "We put decent pressure on him. There were people in his face. He got outside of contain a couple of times and had a little more time than we like. "I think the biggest problem with the defense was the missed opportunities with the running game and the missed tackles. Then, we got kind of rattled defensively. It looked to me that we were out of synch early. Then, they got their stuff together and played reasonably well. But you can't spot a team a quarter. It was 9-0 in first downs in the first quarter. It was like trying to play the Chicago Bulls and it's 30-0 at the end of the first quarter." Coslet said the Jets were never able to establish their running game, because they fell behind quickly and had to pass to get back into the game. And because the passing game was successful, he saw no reason to abandon it. Quarterback Browning Nagle, who completed 21 of 37 passes for 366 yards and 2 touchdowns, was three yards short of N.F.L. record for passing yards by a rookie quarterback -- a record base on statistics kept since 1975. Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny Testaverde passed for 369 yards against New Orleans on Dec. 6, 1987. Nagle's performance made him the No. 2-rated passer in the American Football Conference after the conference's first day of games with a 108.6 rating, behind Pittsburgh's Neil O'Donnell, who has a 122.2 rating. EXTRA POINTS Rookie tight end JOHNNY MITCHELL injured his shoulder after making his first National Football League reception, a 23-yarder in the third quarter. Mitchell, his left arm in a sling, will be out for this week's game against Pittsburgh with what the team is calling a sprained shoulder. Mitchell described it more as a slight separation.

1041-> Rabin Says Syria Spurned Any Ties
Despite optimistic assessments of progress in the Middle East peace negotiations by Israeli and American officials, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said today that Syria has made no offers to establish diplomatic, cultural and commercial relations even if Israel returns the entire Golan Heights. In an address transmitted from Jerusalem to delegates at the B'nai B'rith International convention here, Mr. Rabin said the general mood has improved in the peace negotiations involving Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians. Syrian negotiators outlined their views on peace in the Middle East in a document presented to Israeli officials a week ago. The text of the document has not been released, and not one of the negotiators has described the Syrian position in terms as specific as Mr. Rabin's. Even in exchange for the return of the Golan Heights, a 500-square-mile plateau that Israel captured in 1967, Syria has indicated that it would accept a peace agreement but "not open boundaries, not embassies, not commercial and cultural relationships," Mr. Rabin said. The Syrian Embassy was closed today and Syrian officials could not be reached for comment. Reassured Delegates on Quarrel Mr. Rabin also sought to reassure delegates at the convention that his recent quarrel with the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential lobbying group, did not extend to all American Jewish organizations. Mr. Rabin castigated the group's leaders in a private meeting here on Aug. 13 for antagonizing the Bush Administration in their aggressive but unsuccessful effort last autumn and winter to win American loan guarantees for the resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel. In a clear reference to the public affairs committee, Mr. Rabin said, "My remarks were made in a very close circle and in relation to one organization." He added that during his career, which included serving as Ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, he had "learned to appreciate, to admire the devotion of the Jewish community in the United States." President Bush agreed last month to provide $10 billion in loan guarantees sought by Israel after Mr. Rabin and his Labor Party won elections in June, replacing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud Party. Mr. Rabin has moved quickly to scale back the construction of Jewish settlements in occupied territories, as Mr. Bush advocated. Urged Return to Usual Role As relations between the Administration and the Israeli Government chilled during Mr. Shamir's tenure, the American Jewish organization expanded its long-time lobbying of Congress and low-level Federal bureaucrats to include senior State Department and White House officials. Mr. Rabin urged the group last month to return to its traditional role, while leaving high-level diplomacy to the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Mr. Rabin encouraged American Jews today to continue expressing their views to members of Congress, but he avoided any mention of lobbying the Administration. Yet Mr. Rabin has been quietly mending fences with the American Jewish group too, sending a letter to the organization two weeks ago in which he applauded its efforts at the recent Democratic and Republican conventions and emphasized that the meeting on Aug. 13 had been "friendly and constructive." An official of the organization declined to comment on the Prime Minister's remarks today. Mr. Rabin also spelled out his opposition to the formal annexation of territory by Israel, which would mean more Palestinians living in Israel. Such a move, he said, would sow the seeds for civil strife comparable to the recent warfare that has wracked some former Yugoslav and Soviet republics. The recent violence in these states shows "what happens when you bring about by force a binational state," Mr. Rabin said.

1042-> RUSSIA TURNS OVER KAL FLIGHT DATA
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today handed over documents about the shooting down in 1983 of a South Korean airliner to the American and Korean Governments and to relatives of the passengers, all of whom were killed. The file released today contains the transcript of recordings from a cockpit recorder on Korean Air Lines Flight 007, as well as copies of reports to Yuri V. Andropov, then the Soviet leader; photographs of parts of the downed plane, and other documents. Details on the contents of the file were not immediately available, as the material was being translated from the Russian. But Hans Ephraimson-Abt, who heads the association of family members of the victims, said he hopes that the material will finally put to rest much of the speculation that has surrounded the disaster. The destruction of the plane took the lives of 269 people and set in motion one of the last cold-war confrontations. "Even if we don't learn anything startlingly new, we will at least get confirmation of what we do know," said Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, "and we will be able to deal with the theories that have been floating about and either put them to rest or confirm them." Unraveling a Mystery The delivery of the material was a milestone in the long quest by the families of the victims to understand why the Boeing 747 jumbo jet strayed into Soviet airspace, and why Soviet air defense forces shot it down near Sakhalin Island on Sept. 1, 1983. Some theories say a navigational error put the plane off course; others suggest that it was on an intelligence mission. At the Kremlin ceremony today, Mr. Yeltsin said the release of the documents involved a "difficult, but necessary decision" on an issue that he had promised, during a Washington visit in June, to resolve. The release of the material was timed to precede Mr. Yeltsin's trip next month to South Korea, where the mystery surrounding the downed airliner has remained a source of tension with the Kremlin leadership. Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, today criticized the old Soviet leadership for its refusal to cooperate in investigations into the plane's destruction. "For 10 years, the Soviet Union knew and hid these documents," he said. "Now in new democratic Russia, we are handing them over as a full member of world civilization." Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, who lost his daughter in the crash, said that repeated requests for information to the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had gone unanswered.

1043-> Moldova's Parliament Seeks Peacekeepers
The Moldovan Parliament voted overwhelmingly today in favor of bringing in a peacekeeping force to put down fighting in the former Soviet republic. Russians and Ukrainians who dominate in the Trans-Dniester region of Moldova want independence from the former republic, which is populated mainly by ethnic Romanians.The war between the groups is among the worst of several ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union. The Commonwealth of Independent States, struggling to fill the void created by the collapse of the Soviet Government, on Monday decided to create by month's end a peacekeeping force to separate warring ethnic factions throughout the former Soviet Union. Peacekeeping troops are expected to number between 2,000 and 10,000. The force would be dispatched to an area only after a formal request from the Government with legal jurisdiction over a conflict zone. The Moldovan Parliament fulfilled that requirement today when it voted 225-3 to ask for peacekeepers. Spokesmen for both sides said Tuesday that 22 people were killed and 48 wounded overnight in rising fighting in Moldova.

1044-> SERBS LETTING GAS FLOW TO SARAJEVO
Serbian nationalist forces reopened a natural gas pipeline to Sarajevo today, bringing central heating to at least some parts of the city just as autumn chills were driving thousands of people to the city's parks and graveyards and river banks in a desperate rush to cut trees for winter fuel. The pipeline that feeds Siberian natural gas to Sarajevo was cut off eight days ago, somewhere in the arc of Serb-held Bosnia that lies between this besieged city and the border of Serbia, about 100 miles east. The cutoff followed Serbian attacks three weeks ago that cut the last of the electricity and running water reaching the 400,000 people estimated to be living inside the Serbian siege lines. The electricity and water remained cut off today, but United Nations officials said they hoped that electricity would begin flowing again on Thursday after utility crews working under United Nations military escort complete repairs on transmission lines outside the city. With electricity restored, the United Nations officials said, the pumping station that supplies 80 percent of Sarajevo's water, also under Serbian control, should also come on stream again. But United Nations officials struck a skeptical note born of repeated frustrations in efforts to restore electricity to the city. Gen. Philippe Morillon, the United Nations military commander for Bosnia, predicted on Monday that electricity would soon be restored, but within hours power lines that had just been repaired were wrecked again by mortar fire. The Serbian move to restore at least some of the city's means of winter heating came as something approaching panic began to sweep through the city. Despite orders from the Government, which has sought to save trees in public areas, there has been a stampede in recent days to chop down the oak, chestnut and poplar trees that have made this one of the leafiest cities in the Balkans. The city's streets have been busy with people pushing freshly cut logs on handcarts, or dragging branches miles to their homes, and some districts have already been effectively deforested. On one occasion this week, a policeman fired over the heads of people chopping trees in a park, but Oslobodjenje, the city's principal newspaper, reported that they ignored the warning shots. They evidently judged that the greater danger was the impending Bosnian winter, with temperatures that sink below freezing by late October and move toward zero as the winter deepens. Cemetery Trees Felled At 7 A.M. today, a dozen men in blue overalls were ignoring mortar and sniper fire from Serb-held hillsides above them as they used a chain saw to fell the last of the chestnut trees that have shaded the Lion Cemetery, where nearly 3,000 victims of the Serbian attacks on the city have been buried. The men, from a neighborhood miles away, appeared there for the first time on Tuesday, flourishing a permit given to them by the Bosnian Army, which has taken control of many aspects of Sarajevo life. Although the permit was for Tuesday only, the men returned at dawn today, maneuvering amid the muddy graves to fell trees and make firewood that they said they could sell for 50 German marks, about $35, for a cubic yard. This is about five times the current monthly salary of a Sarajevo surgeon. Watching the men from a tree stump was Lejla Kocukalic, a 20-year-old who was a member of Yugoslavia's swimming team in the 1991 world championships in Australia. She, too, had been in the graveyard since dawn, gathering smaller branches and carrying them 300 yards to the apartment she shares with her widowed mother. "I haven't got a saw, and I'm not so strong anyway, so I wait for the little pieces they don't want," she said. A Rare Serbian Concession The restoration of natural gas was a rare concession by the Serbian leaders, and it will be short-lived if it follows the pattern of previous Serbian moves to ease the siege. The heavy weapons with which the Serbian forces have surrounded Sarajevo been been restrained for periods of a week or more, then unleashed again, and this has been the case, too, with the severing of electricity, water and telephone links. General Morillon has announced three times in two months that the Serbian leaders have promised to restore these links, only to have the pledges broken. Repair teams escorted by United Nations troops have been fired on repeatedly. This week a work crew approaching the siege lines north of Sarajevo with safe-passage documents from Serbian leaders was turned back by a Serbian commander who warned that his men would open fire on any other crew approaching his area.

1045-> CAMERA; Other Eyes, Other Ideas
FOR photographers who want state-of-the-art darkrooms or a few dozen extra eyes, camera clubs can offer a supportive environment to sharpen one's craft. Deneen Grogan of Jersey City, N.J., for example, is a member of not one, but two clubs: the Camera Club of New York, 853 Broadway, at 14th Street, Union Square (212-260-7077), and the Palisades Camera Club in North Bergen, N.J. (201-861-2430). "Each is unlike the other, and they contribute different things to my growth in photography," said Ms. Grogan, 28 years old, a serious amateur with professional ambitions. The Camera Club of New York has seven quality darkrooms available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for its 125 members. Dues are $475 a year; a locker for a year is $25 extra. "It's good to go somewhere and simply sit down and work," Ms. Grogan said. "I don't have to pull apart my kitchen to make it into a darkroom and then put the place back together after I'm finished." Both the New York club and the one in New Jersey let her compare notes with other photographers; they talk about composition, discuss processing techniques, and argue the merits of different equipment. The Palisades Camera Club, she said, is her think tank. Once a month, the 35 members photograph the same subject, like "cemeteries," "running water" or "a quiet moment." Finished slides and prints are later presented for discussion. The club, with dues of $30 a year but no darkrooms, meets twice a month in a conference room at Palisades General Hospital in North Bergen. In return for use of the room, the club holds photographic exhibitions in the hospital's lobby. John Medoff, a founding member of the club, reports that it is affiliated with the Photographic Society of America, an 8,000-member group with 25 chapters. The society will help you find a camera club in your area. (For information, write Photographic Society of America, 3000 Founders Boulevard, Suite 103, Oklahoma City 73112) Another source for finding out about local camera clubs is your neighborhood camera store. At the New York club, Ms. Grogan said, there is less time to talk because members are busy at work in the darkrooms. But in New Jersey, discussion and debate are the reasons to meet, and the discussions cover everything from esthetics to the mechanics of photography. "Both clubs have taught me that there is more than one way to make a picture," Ms. Grogan said. "I have experimented with different developers, different films and new printing papers as a member." The New York club introduced her to different films. "I'm a Kodak Tri-X user in black and white," she said. "For a while, I switched to Ilford Delta ISO 400. Lately I've switched back to Tri-X, but I have had the experience of using the Ilford emulsion and know what I can do with it when I need it." For color Ms. Grogan likes Kodachrome 64 and Fuji Velvia 50. Besides Tri-X, she uses Kodak T-Max P3200 black and white in available light. Her cameras are a Yashica FXD single-lens reflex with a 50-millimeter lens, and a Minolta X-7000 with a 135-millimeter lens. She finds that a tripod is a must for low-light photography. She prefers D-76 as her developer. Since joining both clubs, she feels her perspective on photography has changed. "It now includes more areas of seeing," she said. "I recently looked back at my earlier work and asked myself, 'Did I do that?' Today I find more interesting subject matter and my technique is better." Several months ago, Ms. Grogan called on Joseph George of the Cultural Arts Commission of Jersey City and asked if she could show him her photographs for a possible show. He was impressed and scheduled an exhibition at the Five Corners Library, 678 Newark Avenue. Her 30-picture show, "Photographs of City Life," opens on Sept. 1 for a month. The entire Palisades Camera Club plans to attend the show's opening night. "You can learn something from everybody," Ms. Grogan said. "I feel I have 160 teachers: the members of both clubs."

1046-> AUGUST 16-22: Soldier of Fortune; Magazine Liable for Death Arranged Through an Ad
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta last week upheld a $4.3 million damage payment to the survivors of a murdered businessman whose associates hired a contract killer through a classified advertisement in a magazine. The ruling in a case involving Soldier of Fortune magazine found that the ad, headed "Gun for Hire" and saying "All jobs considered," suggested on its face a substantial danger of harm to the public, according to the 2-1 decision by a three-judge panel. The man who placed the ad, Michael Savage, and the accused killer, Sean Trevor Doutre, were convicted of Federal conspiracy charges in the death of Richard Braun, as were his business associates, Bruce Gastwirth and John H. Moore. It wasn't the first time Soldier of Fortune had been in court over an ad. But in a civil case filed in a Texas court in 1990, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held in favor of Soldier of Fortune, saying the advertisement at issue was ambiguous.

1048-> Government Steps Down in Lebanon
The Lebanese Government resigned today after two days of nationwide riots over the worst economic crisis the country has experienced in 49 years of independence. Prime Minister Omar Karami announced his resignation here after angry demonstrators tried to storm his residence and the neighboring villa of President Elias Hrawi. Soldiers and policemen guarding the officials fired over the heads of the protesters to disperse them. Big clouds of black smoke hung over Beirut after thousands of demonstrators burned rubber tires, and set up roadblocks to stop traffic. All roads leading in and out of the capital were closed and large-scale disruptions were reported in all parts of Lebanon from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north. 4-Day General Strike Protests were also held in most Christian districts after a four-day general strike was called by labor unions as of Tuesday. Shops, banks, schools and offices were shut. Marches quickly turned into riots as demonstrators broke up in bands who went around smashing bank signs. Most of the glass doors and windows in a building housing the Chamber of Commerce in mainly Muslim West Beirut were broken. In the Christian part of town, a crowd of several hundred people tried to attack the residence of Justice Minister Khatichik Babikian but were turned back by the police. In Tyre, demonstrators on Tuesday attacked and set ablaze the residence of Finance Minister Ali al-Khalil. A number of people were hospitalized suffering from cuts or breathing problems brought on by inhaling smoke, police and hospital officials said. The Government's resignation leaves the country, with its civil war wounds still unhealed, in a power vacuum. Officials said the Prime Minister had not intended to step down until agreement had been reached on a new Cabinet, but that today's riots, which involved his own home, speeded the resignation. It is now up to President Hrawi, a Christian, to choose a new Government. Under the Lebanese political order, the Prime Minister should be a Sunni Muslim. The Speaker of Parliament is a Shiite Muslim. Popular fury had erupted over the near collapse of the national currency and soaring prices of essential commodities. The value of the Lebanese pound in relation to foreign exchange has been on the decline for the last three months, but in the last two days it slumped to an all-time low, selling at over 2,000 pounds to one American dollar compared to one third that rate at the beginning of the year. Dollars Are Demanded Shops and gasoline stations refused to deal in Lebanese pounds and insisted on being paid in dollars. An empty treasury after 16 years of civil war plus lack of foreign assistance and reluctance by investors to pour money into the Lebanese market have contributed to what amounts to a real depression. The Government's inflationary policies, such as increasing the salaries of civil servants by 120 percent at the beginning of the year, have been cited by economists and politicians alike as the real cause for the crisis. But in his resignation speech today, read at a news conference at his residence, Mr. Karami asserted that Lebanon was the target of a conspiracy to force it to yield to Israel. He said promised outside assistance dried up because his Government has insisted that Israel withdraw unconditionally from what it calls its "security zone" in southern Lebanon, and because Lebanon had refused to take part in Middle East talks to discuss regional problems. Lebanon took part in the five rounds of direct negotiations with Israel but, like Syria, it stayed away from multiparty meetings held in Moscow in January, and will not attend those scheduled for later this month. The Karami Cabinet had argued that talks on disarmament, sharing of water, refugees and the environment should be put off until direct negotiations had produced tangible results. Mr. Karami visited Damascus on tuesday and held consultations with officials there on the deteriorating situation in his country. Officials said the Prime Minister served notice he no longer was able to remain in office. Syria, with 35,000 troops deployed on Lebanese territory, is the main power broker here. Mr. Karami, 59 years old, formed his 30-member Cabinet about a year and a half ago as one of national unity, to close the chapter on the civil war and lead Lebanon on the road to peace and recovery among the ministers were leaders of the seven main Muslim and Christian militias which had confronted each other across the demarcations lines during the factional fighting. From the start, the Cabinet was rocked by conflict, with ministers boycotting Government sessions or criticizing the performance of the administration. The problem was compounded by the Cabinet's inability to deal with rampant corruption in the civil service.

1049-> SUMMIT IN MUNICH; 7 LEADERS DIVIDED ON A-PLANT SAFETY
Leaders of seven major industrial nations failed today to agree on ways to assure the safety of deteriorating nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The two leaders who are urging such a program, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France, met today to discuss the matter. According to Mr. Mitterrand's chief spokesman, Jean Musitelli, they concluded that a major international effort to upgrade the plants was not now possible because of "strong opposition" from the United States and Japan. But French and German officials said that a program smaller than they had advocated would proceed despite the disagreements that emerged at the Group of Seven summit meeting here. "It will take place even if not everyone takes part," said the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel. "A second Chernobyl is possible. It must not come to that." About 60 Plants Involved Mr. Waigel said aid from the West should be used not simply to repair dangerous plants but "to change the whole energy policy in these states so they can conserve energy, develop alternative energy sources and thereby create more leeway for shutting down plants that are unsafe." About 60 nuclear power plants in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and former Soviet republics are believed to be operating without the safeguards that are required in most Western countries. Among them are 15 plants in Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine that are similar in design to the Chernobyl plant, where a disastrous accident attributed in part to a design flaw occurred in 1986. A report prepared by the European Community and distributed to the participants in Munich said that in addition to the 15 Chernobyl-type plants, four plants in Bulgaria were "manifestly unsafe" and 10 others in Central and Eastern Europe "constitute accident hazards because of serious design inadequacies." The French-German proposal would have created a $700 million fund to make emergency repairs to the most dangerous nuclear plants. Officials say they do not know how much the repairs might ultimately cost, but estimates range from several billion dollars to more than $100 billion. Bush's Views Reported Chancellor Kohl's chief spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said today that the United States had earmarked $25 million for the repair of aging nuclear plants, but that American officials refused to accept creation of a new international fund for the purpose. "The American President said that this problem would not be solved by creating a new bureaucracy," Mr. Vogel said. He added that President Bush had insisted that all aid aimed at improving the safety of nuclear power plants be provided on a nation-to-nation basis rather than through a joint fund. The European Community has pledged $270 million for the project and leaders of Scandinavian countries have said they are preparing a contribution of roughly equal size.

1050-> FOOTBALL; Byrd Is on the Outside, And Looking Inward
As with most things that have happened to the Jets this year, Dennis Byrd's move from defensive tackle to defensive end has fallen short of expectations. In a way, Byrd is the personification of the Jets' season to this point. "It's been harder than I thought it would be," Byrd said. "But I really enjoy playing defensive end. I just want to. . . ." Then, like the pass rush of the Jets so far this season, Byrd stopped himself, searching for the right direction. "It's been like," he resumed, " 'Lord give me patience now.' One-of-those type things." Looking for First Sack After three games, Byrd has only five tackles. He has not made a sack, which is one reason why the Jets' pass rush appears no better than it was last year. The pass rush was further set back by the loss of defensive end Jeff Lageman, who is out for the season after reconstructive knee surgery. Two years ago, Byrd had 13 sacks as a tackle and last season he had 7 from that position, an inordinately high number from an interior line position. The Jets thought it would be a good idea to free Byrd up by moving him back outside, where he played as a rookie in 1989, and take advantage of his quickness. But so far, that quickness has been nullified by pushy tackles who double up with tight ends to knock him off the path toward the quarterback, taking away his initial quick burst. And when he has gotten to the quarterbacks, they have somehow slipped through his grasp. "I've missed three," said Byrd, regarding his sack opportunities. "You go back and look and I've had three guys in my hands and just missed them. "I sit at home at night and I think, 'I don't get those back.' At the end of the year you just add those onto your total and it makes you sick. I missed one against the 49ers on the first touchdown drive. I came underneath and had him around the waist and he just slipped loose. It's embarrassing. It's like everything else. I just play for the future now." A Hit on Hostetler The last time the 6-foot-5-inch, 266-pound Byrd had an impact hit on the quarterback was in preseason. It was Byrd's hit on Jeff Hostetler that left the Giants quarterback with an injured back and pelvis, and forced the Giants to go with Phil Simms in their final preseason game. Greg Robinson, the Jets' defensive line coach, said Byrd and the entire defense to an extent have been forced to alter game plans early because the Jets have been falling behind early. "When people don't have the pressure of being behind, you struggle more, because you have to play both the run and the pass," Robinson said. "When you have to do that, it's hard to be a great pass rusher." Doing It More Naturally Byrd said that he was just getting comfortable playing at end, but that he didn't know when he will turn into the player the Jets were hoping he would be when they moved him. "Right now I'm getting to where I'm starting to react to plays like I want to," he said. "It's starting to become more natural. There are some plays that have hit me and I go, 'Gosh, I wish I had known that.' "I really am playing much more confident in the position. I am still learning. It took Jeff a whole year to get real comfortable at it until he exploded and was just ready to go. I hope it doesn't take me that long." The Jets can't afford to wait, either, with an 0-3 start. And this Sunday, against Rams quarterback Jim Everett, the Jets will need as much pass rush as they can muster. Everett, though his career has been in decline for the last three seasons, is still a dangerous passer if he gets time to throw deep.

1051-> Russian Files Show Stalin Ordered Massacre of 20,000 Poles in 1940
The Russian Government today for the first time made public secret documents revealing that Stalin's Politburo in March 1940 had specifically ordered the execution of more than 20,000 Poles, including nearly 5,000 senior Polish Army officers, whose bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forests of Katyn. The documents, handed over by Russia's chief archivist to President Lech Walesa in Warsaw, appear to end a grisly mystery that has long haunted Russian-Polish relations, even after Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in April 1990, first admitted Soviet guilt in the Katyn massacre. Sharp Attack on Gorbachev Today, a spokesman for President Boris N. Yeltsin sharply attacked Mr. Gorbachev for concealing the direct involvement of Stalin and other Communist leaders in the massacre. Mr. Yeltsin also chose today to fulfill a promise to help resolve another painful case, releasing documents on the downing of a South Korean jetliner by a Soviet warplane in 1983. [ Page A9. ] The Poles disappeared in late 1939 and early 1940 during a period of German-Soviet cooperation when Soviet forces occupied eastern Poland and wiped out any organized Polish resistance. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Moscow quickly aligned itself with the Polish government in exile and released those Poles still in its custody. But a mystery persisted over the missing thousands known to have been in the Soviet zone of Poland and who had disappeared. The Nazis announced to the world in 1943 that they had unearthed the remains of thousands of Polish officers in the Katyn forests near Smolensk west of Moscow and said evidence suggested they had been killed by the Soviets. Moscow called the announcement a lie and said the Poles had been killed by the Nazis. The postwar Communist Government in Poland was compelled to accept Moscow's version, even though virtually all Poles in exile and independent historians never accepted Moscow's version and were certain that the Poles had been transported to the Soviet Union and killed there. A major mystery until today was how directly involved Stalin and the Politburo were in the mass killings. In 1987, Mr. Gorbachev promised to cooperate in resolving the Katyn massacre. The first official reports blaming the Soviet Union appeared in Poland in 1989, but even in his public apology in 1990 Mr. Gorbachev never revealed the complicity of the Kremlin's Communist leaders, nor the extent of the crime, even though he appears to have known the details. Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman pointedly attacked Mr. Gorbachev for this reticence during a meeting with journalists today. "The respected Mikhail Sergeyevich long ago -- many years ago -- knew of this tragedy and the true identity of the guilty ones," said Vyacheslav Kostikov. "But he remained silent." According to minutes , from the March 5, 1940, session of the Politburo, the N.K.V.D., the Soviet secret police organization that was the forerunner of the K.G.B., was instructed to carry out "the supreme punishment -- execution by a firing squad" against "14,700 former Polish officers, officials, landowners, policmen and gendarmes, held in camps for prisoners of war," as well as another 11,000 "members of different subversion and espionage organizations, former land- and factory owners, former Polish officers, former officials and former clergymen, arrested and held in jails in the western regions of Ukraine and Byelorussia," the republic now known as Belarus. The minutes from the Politburo meeting, presumably headed by Stalin, were contained in two folders of top-secret papers from the party's archives, copies of which were produced today in Moscow by Mr. Kostikov. Yeltsin-Gorbachev Feud "These files contain documents that clearly demonstrate that the Communist Party was the direct organizer of the annihilation from the face of the earth of the Polish officer corps," said Mr. Kostikov, who showed a copy of an order directing the execution of 295 generals and colonels, and 2,080 majors and captains. Coming during a politically charged inquest into the legality of the banned Soviet Communist Party now being held before Russia's Constitutional Court, the release of the Katyn documents today became a weapon in the Yeltsin Government's campaign to discredit the party and its last leader, Mr. Gorbachev. The long-running feud between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev has intensified in recent weeks over Mr. Gorbachev's refusal to testify before the Constitutional Court. After he twice failed to appear as a witness before the court, Mr. Gorbachev was barred from traveling outside the country. The travel ban was suspended this week to allow him to attend the funeral of the former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt on Saturday in Berlin. But Mr. Gorbachev was forced to call off a planned 10-day visit to Italy after the Russian Government said the permission to travel, granted on "humanitarian" grounds, was restricted to Germany only. Walesa's Praise for Move Mr. Kostkov noted that the documents released today came from Mr. Gorbachev's personal archives, which had been removed from the sixth division of the Party's Central Committee archives. He also said Mr. Gorbachev kept silent about the evidence of the Kremlin's direct involvment in the Polish massacres, even after ordering the Soviet prosectuor's office and the K.G.B. to continue its search for the culprits on March 3, 1990. In Warsaw today, Rudolf Pikhoya, chairman of Russia's Archives Commission, who acted as Mr. Yeltsin's personal envoy, said that two most important documents were withdrawn from the Central Committee archives on March 4, 1990, and put in Mr. Gorbachev's archives, the news agency Itar-Tass said. Mr. Pikhoya also said the package of materials given to President Walesa contained not only the Politburo resolution, but also a report by Lavrenti P. Beria, head of the N.K.V.D., on the numbers and categories of Polish officers kept in camps and prisons. The documents also list the Politburo members' vote on the execution order. Mr. Walesa praised Mr. Yeltsin for delivering the documents, long sought by the Polish Government, and said their delivery "indicates new correct relations between our countries." Files Indicate a Cover-Up The release of the Katyn documents, including one annotated by Stalin, mark one of the most important disclosures from secret Communist Party files since the archives were first officially opened to the public last spring. But the timing of the release, and the pointed attack against Mr. Gorbachev that came with it, confirms the suspicions of many historians that the archive's most sensitive documents have been held back, to be used selectively and for political purposes. The files revealed today in Moscow covered not only the events of 1940, but also evidence of the post-Stalin leadership's concerted efforts to deny any responsibility for the Polish massacres. In 1971, Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko persuaded the Politburo to issue a formal protest against British historians who were blaming Stalin for the executions at Katyn. As late as 1990, a Central Committee official, Valentin M. Falin, suggested that Mr. Gorbachev tell the Poles that a thorough search of the archives had produced no hard evidence on the culprits in the massacre. The truth about the massacres in the Katyn forests was first officially acknowledged in Poland in 1989, and appeared in Russia for the first time in March 1990 in Moscow News, a liberal Soviet publication. Mr. Gorbachev's apology came a month later, during a visit by President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland to Moscow. That was then considered a milestone for the Gorbachev policies of openness as the Kremlin slowly began to delve into history's "blank spots," chapters that had been rewritten by the Kremlin's aggressive propaganda machine. In an official Government statement issued in April 1990, the Soviet Union expressed "profound regret over the Katyn tragedy," calling it "one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism." In the Moscow News article, Natalya Lebedeva, a Soviet historian, wrote that although no documentary evidence was then available, all indications were that Stalin had ordered the Polish officers slain in 1940. She said Stalin had a special grudge against the Polish Army because of its victory over Soviet forces in 1920.

1052-> Iran-Contra Figure Points to Wider Role for Bush
Richard V. Secord, a leading figure in the Iran-contra affair, said today that he believed that President Bush was more involved than has been acknowledged in the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran in the mid-1980's. But Mr. Secord added that he had no direct evidence to support that conclusion. In an interview granted to promote sales of his new book about the Iran-contra operations, Mr. Secord disputed Mr. Bush's frequent contention during the 1988 Presidential race that he was "out of the loop" during important White House deliberations over arms sales to Teheran. To the contrary, Mr. Secord said he believed Mr. Bush played an active role in convincing President Ronald Reagan to agree to one-for-one swaps of arms shipments for individual hostages, shortly after Mr. Bush met in July 1986 with Amiram Nir, a top Israeli official who oversaw that nation's involvement in the negotiations. Mr. Secord talked with Mr. Nir "a couple of days" after that meeting, and came away convinced that Mr. Bush "knew virtually all the tactical details of the Iran initiative," Mr. Secord said today. Mr. Secord, a retired Air Force major general and an associate of Oliver L. North who oversaw many details of those arms deals and of arms shipments to Nicaraguan rebels, or contras, pleaded guilty in 1989 to one felony count of making misleading statements to Congress during an inquiry of the Iran-contra affair. An Administration official rejected Mr. Secord's comments today in a single sentence. "How can a gun-runner know about the inner workings of the National Security Council?" said the official, who refused to be named. It is not entirely clear how much Mr. Secord's assertions enlarge what Mr. Bush has already admitted to knowing about the Iran arms shipments. Mr. Secord said today that he had no hard evidence of Mr. Bush's involvement in the deals beyond what Mr. Nir told him in July 1986. Mr. Bush has previously said he first learned intimate details of the sales when Mr. Nir briefed him on the secret program, 11 months after it began.

1053-> AUGUST 16-22; Less Banana More Appealing?
At last, Chiquita bananas are living up to their name. They always sounded as if they ought to import cute little bananalets and leave jumbo-sized bananaramadamas for competitors with rotund names like Dole to supply to pratfall artistes and soda jerks on the split shift. Instead Chiquita, like everyone else, sold mostly the standard nine-inch number, and consigned the short end of the bunch to mushy things like baby food. But now the company has discovered what many parents have long known: A nine-inch banana is way too much for a 30-inch 2-year-old. It won't fit into an eight-inch lunch box without folding. And it's more than one official serving on any diet for a 40-inch-waist. So Chiquita is test-marketing Chiquita Juniors. The truncated yellow fruits are seven inches long, sometimes cost a bit more, and are available now only in Cincinnati and New Orleans. They'll still whip a spider monkey off its perch but, the company says, most humans will find them handier.

1054-> Global Bankers' Muted Happy Hour
Adventure may be the life of commerce, as Walter Bagehot, the 19th-century English economist, once said, but caution, he added, is the life of banking. And during a monetary crisis, bankers, whether commercial or central, are fretful, even downright dull. "Slightly muted," is how Curtis J. Hoxter, head of Hoxter Inc., a New York public relations firm, characterized the weeklong gathering of approximately 2,000 bankers for the annual International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The meetings ended today. "There is more emphasis on personalized events," Mr. Hoxter said. "Instead of inviting everyone, it's more valuable to have senior officers. That makes the social side a bit more subdued." While there are still islands of elegance like the French Embassy party, the Republic Bank of New York party at the National Gallery, and Institutional Investor magazine's 25th anniversary celebration at a nightclub at the Four Seasons Hotel, pared-down guest lists were part of the austerity that seemed a fact of life at this year's gathering. Citibank, which featured a circus at one of its parties several years ago, this time sponsored a sedate, invitation-only reception at the National Museum of Women in the Arts. There were truffles, Champagne, petits fours, sliced meats, a string quartet and a pianist. But no elephants on parade. 'Business Is Lousy' "I've been coming to this for 15 years," said Remy Cohn, a board member of the Italian Banco Euromobiliare, on his way to one of the more stylish affairs of the week, the invitation-only reception by the Istituto Mobiliare Italiano credit agency at the Metropolitan Club. "If there is business, everything looks the same. The parties are lavish, the Champagne pours. But if there is no business, there are less people. Business is lousy. Now everybody is cutting expenses." Certainly, the limousine business felt the fallout of monetary free fall. A clutch of chauffeurs nearby grumbled about the scaling back over the last several years. "The problem is in Europe," said Bob Moore, a driver for Nimrod's Limousine Service, who stood with the service's single-named owner, Nimrod, and two fellow chauffeurs, Jim Young and Carlton Jackson. "That's why you've got all those sedans instead of limousines," said Nimrod, motioning with disgust at a phalanx of Lincoln Town Cars. Open Mouth, Close Mouth So what do bankers do during a downturn? After the daily meetings of various alliances of rich countries and developing countries, called "Part 1" and "Part 2" countries, to avoid any perjorative implications, they talk and eat, and eat and talk, and talk and eat their way around the city. They work rather than party, with most people spending only 45 minutes or so each evening at the parties at hotels, embassies, museums, town houses and private clubs. "It's hard work -- physical and mental strain," Mr. Hoxter said. "By Day 3, you've had enough." Isamu Koike, managing director and general manager of the New York branch of the Industrial Bank of Japan, was trying to keep up, dashing from the Istituto Mobilaire Italiano reception to the reception of Euroclear, the Brussels banking group, at the Four Seasons. "Can't talk," he said. "Limousine's here." Have Marks, Will Buy The Germans, criticized as the bad boys of the monetary world in recent weeks, were gleeful. "I don't think we're the problem," said Heinz-Werner Firmenich, vice president of Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz of Germany. Mr. Firmenich and Paul K. Schminke, a board member of the German bank, who stood at the oyster bar at the Euroclear reception, said they would be taking advantage of the strength of their currency. "I think the situation is making it rather cheap here, don't you?" Mr. Schminke said mischievously. "So we will buy." "A lot," Mr. Firmenich said. He added, "Shirts at your Custom Shop, shoes, ties." "And something from your Banana Republic," Mr. Schminke said. "Oh, yes, we will buy." Over the years, the I.M.F. and World Bank have been criticized for the lavish entertaining styles at the conference of some of their poorer members. But that seems to have waned precipitously. "In many instances, we've sponsored breakfasts for 12 people where they get an English muffin and scrambled eggs," said one World Bank official who insisted on anonymity, who represents several sub-Saharan African countries. "They're all Muslim, so they don't do bacon or sausage." The official added: "Our countries host nothing. They're too poor. In one instance, one time last year, one of our embassies was so poor here in Washington, they turned off the telephone. Every single one of these fancy-pants affairs are the commercial bankers or the investment bankers." The World Bank and the I.M.F. have also scaled back their entertaining, in part because of their expanding membership. As this year's meeting ended, there were 173 members of the two groups. Three former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, joined, as did San Marino, a tiny enclave on the west coast of Italy. A country, for the purpose of the I.M.F. and World Bank, must have clear borders, control over its territory and its policy, and should have its own central bank. Each country must join the I.M.F. before it can become part of the World Bank. Security at this year's affairs was as tight as in years past. Guests had to present invitations, and on Sunday at the big I.M.F. party they had to pass through a security check. Indeed, there has been a rise in sponsoring cultural events as entertainment, which seem to have less of an appearance of extravagance than lavish parties. The Republic Bank's reception in the West Wing of the National Gallery was the most coveted event of the week -- and failed to be dimmed by a torrential downpour. "Its the best of the best," Mr. Cohn said. "You've got a first-class crowd, a first-class setting, all the politicians, governors of the central bank." A Bow to the French On Sunday night, Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, sponsored a concert, invitation only, in the intimate Terrace Theater, seating about 350, at the Kennedy Center. The room was filled with central bankers and commercial bankers from around the world. Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman performed three pieces and an encore. In flawless English, Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, introduced the two Israeli musicians. First, he noted that Sunday was the day of the vote in France on the Maastricht treaty, outlining steps toward European unity, and then he said it was fitting for a piece by a French composer, Jean Marie Leclair, to be on the program because France plays such an important role in Europe. Referring to the currency tensions in Europe, Mr. Koppers said: "You may have noticed that over the past few days there have been some sudden changes in the intercountry value of bank notes. Well, we want to present to you some notes that are universal and harmonious."

1056-> Germany Accuses East's Spy Chief of Treason
The former head of East Germany's highly successful spy service was charged today by German prosecutors with suspected treason, espionage and bribery over a period of more than 30 years. According to a summary of the charges brought by the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe, the accused, Markus Wolf, personally directed some of the most notorious East German spies, including Gunter Guillaume, who was infiltrated into West Germany in 1956 and succeeded in becoming an aide to Chancellor Willy Brandt. After Mr. Guillaume was unmasked in 1974, Mr. Brandt resigned. The indictment mentioned 11 other cases, but it said that "the exact number of espionage cases in which the accused was personally involved, either directly or indirectly, has not been established." Mr. Wolf, now 69 years old, retired as head of East German foreign intelligence in 1986. He fled Berlin just before unification in October 1990, spending most of a year in Moscow, where he had spent his childhood before and during World War II. He returned a year ago to face the charges against him, and after a brief imprisonment was freed on bail. He lives in Berlin under close court supervision. Despite the charges brought today, it is not clear whether Mr. Wolf will have to face trial. In July 1991, a Berlin court dismissed espionage charges against his successor, Werner Grossmann, and asked the Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether it was permissible to charge agents of the Communist regime with espionage against the West when both sides had been spied on each other until unification. The constitutional court has not yet given its ruling. Mr. Wolf said in a telephone conversation today that he had not yet seen the charges and would make no comment on them. He has been busily jotting down his life story for an American publisher since early this year. Two earlier memoirs were published in Germany in 1989 and 1990. In his most recent book, "On My Own Account," Mr. Wolf conceded that his service's contribution to Mr. Brandt's resignation was, however unintended, a big mistake, since the former Chancellor had pursued policies that brought about the West German recognition of the East. And when a journalist called him one of the most successful intelligence chiefs ever, Mr. Wolf noted that the compliment hardly seemed deserved, since the country his service was meant to defend had sunk without trace two years ago.

1058-> Joe Sapora, 87, Wrestling Standout And College Coach
Joe Sapora, the wiry collegiate wrestling champion who coached the sport at City College from 1932 to 1968 and helped steer Henry Wittenberg to the heavyweight gold medal in the 1948 Olympics, died Monday at Ormond Beach Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 87 years old and lived in Daytona Beach. His wife, Marguerite, said he died of pneumonia. During his 36 years at City College, Mr. Sapora, who was a professor of physical education, turned out his share of champions. Although Mr. Wittenberg was undoubtedly the best, Mr. Sapora's greatest accomplishment as a coach may have been when Jacob Twersky, a blind wrestler, made it to the collegiate finals in 1942. Mr. Sapora, who was born in Hazleton, Pa., stood 5 feet 6 inches, weighed 115 pounds and did not take up wrestling until he got to the University of Illinois, where he won two collegiate championships. He later captured two Amateur Athletic Union titles for the New York Athletic Club. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three brothers, George of Brookings, Ore.; Allen, of Champaign, Ill., and Robert of Adelphi, Md.

Andrea Marcovicci Oak Room Algonquin Hotel 59 West 44th Street Through Jan. 30 Early in "Just Kern," her touching tribute to the music of Jerome Kern, Andrea Marcovicci sings a rendition of the Kern-Johnny Mercer standard "I'm Old-Fashioned" that is so emphatic it becomes a proclamation of her musical conservatism. Kern, she explains afterward, is her favorite of all the composers she sings because his music is so "unapologetically sentimental" and "hopelessly romantic." By singing his songs at the Algonquin, she goes on, "There is no better way of stepping back in time." But what has made Ms. Marcovicci the club's most popular regular performer is the disparity between her personality and the bygone musical ethos she extols with such breathless enthusiasm. The only thing that seems old-fashioned about this beautiful and self-confident woman is her nostalgia. Ms. Marcovicci's rose-colored vision of the past imagines an era of grace, gallantry and true love, when people lived out the Manhattan romance portrayed in Fred Astaire movies. The personality she projects is a contemporary version of a lonely society girl in a 50-year-old Hollywood movie. Musically, Ms. Marcovicci has little in common with old-time torch singers like Helen Morgan who popularized Kern's melodies. With her reedy, folk-pop voice and indeterminate phrasing that often treats lyrics as a series of emotional gusts, Ms. Marcovicci follows no traditional rules. Her pitch is often flat. Yet Ms. Marcovicci projects such a total conviction that her weaknesses fade into the background during a performance. At Thursday's show, the singer, ably abetted by her pianist, Glenn Mehrbach, found a compelling emotional through-line in almost every number she touched. Nothing better illustrated the way Ms. Marcovicci embodies a contemporary woman living out a dream of the past than her handling of "Can't Help Loving That Man." As she sang it, tears glistened in her eyes. But no sooner had she finished it than she observed wittily that it was "a song that you heard as a kid that prepared you to be mistreated as an adult." That's having your cake and eating it too.

Vernel Bagneris Michael's Pub 211 East 55th Street Through Nov. 7 When Jelly Roll Morton was hard up for cash, one scheme he considered was to put salt in Coca-Cola and sell the concoction door to door as a cure for tuberculosis. This odd notion is one of many interesting biographical tidbits that Vernel Bagneris offers in his diverting cabaret show, "Vernel Bagneris Presents Jelly Roll Morton: A Me-morial." Mr. Bagneris is the New Orleans-based mastermind behind the shows "One Mo' Time," "Staggerlee" and "Further Mo'." His portrait of Morton is compiled from tapes of the pioneering jazz pianist that were made for the Library of Congress in 1938. Although the show covers much of the same ground as the Broadway musical "Jelly's Last Jam," Mr. Bagneris's vision of Morton is much lighter in spirit than Gregory Hines's towering theatrical portrayal. The 50-minute revue does not attempt the in-depth exploration of character and jazz history that the Broadway show offers. It is a series of brief sketches separated by musical numbers performed by Mr. Bagneris and his pianistic cohort, Gunnar Larsen, who is an expert interpreter of Morton's music. When Mr. Bagneris arrives onstage in a flashy pin-stripe suit and a blue beret, he boasts of having invented jazz and, with Mr. Larsen actually playing the notes, he demonstrates how he turned an aria from "Il Trovatore" into a jazz song. Vocal numbers that Mr. Bagneris performs in a light, dry voice are interspersed with Morton piano pieces played with vigor and technical polish by Mr. Larsen. The musical high point is his bravura rendition of Morton's technically daunting "Fingerbuster." The show has its moments of pathos. In the saddest story the character tells on himself, he recalls spending thousands of dollars to lift a curse on his career and even burning all his clothes. Only later, he says, did he learn that the woman curing him was in cahoots with an enemy, and they were laughing at him the whole time.

1064-> Moscow Resounding With the Thundering Hoofs of the Anti-Reform Posse
The debate over Russia's future has broken out into the open with a vengeance as an increasingly vocal opposition prepares for a bitter battle over President Boris N. Yeltsin's program of economic reform. Acting in open defiance of the Russian leader, the Parliament's conservative majority today rebuffed his appeal for a postponement of the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's top legislative body, which is to convene on Dec. 1. By delaying the session until spring, Mr. Yeltsin had hoped to head off a certain showdown over the fate of the Government as his own broad authority to rule by decree expires. Pro-Yeltsin members of the Russian Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament, today interpreted the vote as a death knell for the Cabinet, led by Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar. "Everybody knows that the deputies will not discuss economic issues on Dec. 1, but will begin an attack against the institutions of the presidency and the Government," said Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a parliamentary deputy and military adviser to Mr. Yeltsin. Warnings About the Right The lopsided 114-to-59 vote to convene the Congress on schedule came as several top officials continued to warn of a constitutional coup d'etat. Meeting with foreign journalists recently, several of Mr. Yeltsin's top ministers described an organized campaign by ultra-nationalists and former Communists, acting under the wings of the Parliament's leadership, to topple the Government and bring economic changes to a halt. "We are now dealing with a combination of forces that only yesterday could not get together," Gennadi Burbulis, the State Secretary and a top adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, said on Friday. Mr. Burbulis said "revanchist" forces were regrouping on local councils in the provinces, as well as in old Communist trade unions and even in some universities. But, he stressed, the Parliament is the main "testing ground." Summoned today before Parliament to explain such assertions, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev confirmed the warning he gave on Friday about "the threat to the strategic course of the Russian reforms, including from a certain part of Parliament." A Loud Voice Says 'Resign!' As the political temperature rose, one opposition splinter group today published a letter in Pravda, the former Communist Party daily, calling for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation. "Life has irrefutably convinced us that you can not bring Russia out of its crisis," said the leaders of the group, Civic Society, in the front-page appeal to Mr. Yeltsin. "You are leading her not to renewal, but to a dead end. If Russia is dear to you, resign!" Other fringe groups have called for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation, but today's appeal was the boldest attack yet on a leader who a year ago was considered a hero at home and abroad for his role in blocking the August 1991 coup attempt against the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But in recent months, public discontent over a worsening economy, rising crime and a legislative logjam has eaten away at even Mr. Yeltsin's popularity and authority, putting him on the defensive. Deadline for Yeltsin Mr. Yeltsin's special emergency powers, which he was granted a year ago, have been the main force driving the Government's economic program. By one estimate, 95 percent of the legal and economic changes in Russia have been enacted through Mr. Yeltsin's liberal use of the executive decree. But these powers expire on Dec. 1 and are unlikely to be renewed. The weakening of the Government's position has given rise to new forces, of which the most credible seems to be Civic Union, which is backed by a group of influential industrialists who have argued for a pause in the economic changes. Although it has stopped short of calling for Mr. Gaidar's resignation, Civic Union has lent its weight in Parliament to several critical anti-Government votes. Other, more radical forces are also positioning themselves for a fight: The National Salvation Front, a coalition of right-wing groups, has scheduled its opening congress for this weekend, when the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia is also planning demonstrations to call for higher wages and a freeze on food prices. Another sign of growing temerity was the storming last week of Moskovsky Komsomolets, a popular Moscow daily, by members of the nationalist and anti-Semitic group called Pamyat. The attack was condemned by Mr. Yeltsin and others, but it sounded alarms among progressives in the Russian press corps. What Is There to Discuss? Last week, Mr. Yeltsin called for the next session of the Congress of People's Deputies to be postponed until spring, a proposal backed by a newly formed council of regional leaders and a commission that is still drafting a constitution. Mr. Yeltsin said that without a draft constitution to discuss, the congress would be politically destabilizing. "In Russia, certain forces have attempted to set up parallel power structures, and not just in some regions of the country," Mr. Yeltsin said on Friday. "Even in the Parliament, the so-called Russian National Salvation Front is very active. I do not understand why deputies and the leadership of the Supreme Soviet tolerate such neighbors." The Congress, with 1,038 deputies, is expected to focus on the state of economic changes. Mikhail Chelnokov, a deputy and member of the Civic Society faction, told the news agency Interfax that the Congress would examine Russia's "catastrophic situation." He also mentioned impeachment of President Yeltsin, which requires a two-thirds vote. A Question of Pace Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, who heads the Government's ambitious program to put industry in private hands, said Communists want to convene the Congress as soon as possible, before the distribution of shares in state industries begins. Since it reconvened in September, the Parliament has delivered other slaps at the Yeltsin-Gaidar team. Several weeks ago, a majority registered their "dissatisfaction" with the Government. On Tuesday, Parliament voted to take control of the printing plant and other property belonging to Izvestia, a leading pro-reform paper. In their attacks on the Parliament last week, the Government ministers specifically criticized its chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, an economist who was elevated to his post two years ago with the support of Mr. Yeltsin and the reform-minded delegates who then enjoyed a slim majority. But in the last year, Mr. Khasbulatov has proved to be a treacherous ally for Mr. Yeltsin, waging personal vendettas against Izvestia and individual members of the Government. Although he offered to support the move to postpone the Congress, today's vote indicated that he had done little to stem the rising anti-Government tide. The emergence of Civic Union in the past month has helped swing the balance in the Parliament against the Government. Civic Union, which is endorsed by Mr. Gorbachev, appeals strongly to the moderates, who are neither hard-line Communists nor committed reformers but who are receptive to arguments that economic changes have come too hard and too fast.

1068-> Illegal Sales of Cascade Stock
Cascade International, a bankrupt retailer, said its former chairman, Victor Incendy, who vanished in mid-November, had sold large amounts of stock illegally to bolster reported revenues. It also said that substantial "preferential payments" were made to unnamed people or companies before Cascade's bankruptcy filing last month. The company is seeking to recover the payments. Aaron Karp, Cascade's interim chairman and former corporate counsel, reported those actions in a letter to shareholders that was released by his office tonight. He also said that several agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, had begun investigations into Mr. Incendy's activities and that Cascade was cooperating with the authorities. Mr. Karp said Mr. Incendy and the company's transfer agent, the Fidelity Transfer Company, had issued large numbers of shares of Cascade common stock. By selling those shares, Mr. Incendy was able to inflate the company's revenues, Mr. Karp said. He said Cascade would be unable to audit its financial statements for the last two years and a current audit could not be done until information was gathered from operations. Cascade, one of the top small stocks of 1991, stunned the investment community on Nov. 20 by disclosing that it was unable to find Mr. Incendy. It also disclosed at that time that "the financial statements of the company may not be accurate." Cascade stock, which traded as high as $11.25 in August, collapsed to $2.75 before it was delisted on Nov. 19.

1069-> Russia's Central Bank Resists Cuts in Lending
Responding to Western pressure to cut back lending, a top official of Russia's Central Bank says that if the bank fails to provide fresh financing for the farm sector before spring planting, Russia's already damaged economy could go into a tailspin. "We are under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to shrink credit and we want to shrink credit, but we can't right now," said the official, Nikolai Domonov, a Central Bank director in charge of supervising Russia's new commercial banks. "If we pull back, the agricultural sector has no other means of obtaining credit." Pulling back on credit in Russia means, in effect, that the Central Bank must print fewer rubles. Fewer rubles makes the currency more valuable and thus would help make it more easily converted into hard currencies, including the dollar. A strong, easily convertible ruble, in turn, attracts foreign investment, encourages exports and makes imports easier to purchase. All are goals sought by Western governments and the fund, which represents their views. Sharing that view, President Boris N. Yeltsin's top economic advisers, led by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, have been pressing the Central Bank to curtail printing money, which is then lent to commercial banks and, through the banks, to the public. Mr. Domonov's explanation of the Central Bank's resistance was an unusually detailed attempt by a high Central Bank official to publicly explain its differences with Mr. Yeltsin's advisers and the fund. The Central Bank's reluctance to cut back lending does not reflect a disagreement with Mr. Gaidar over goals, Mr. Domonov said in an interview this week. In several small ways, he argued, the Central Bank is trying to reduce the number of rubles in circulation. The problem is that the commercial banks that loan to industry, particularly to agriculture, have no other source of funds beyond borrowing from the Central Bank. "We must refinance now and put off until after the fall harvest reductions in credit," Mr. Domonov said -- in effect, asserting that the fund's efforts to make the ruble convertible into hard currency this month or in March might have to be delayed. The Central Bank's difficulties reflect the evolution of banking in Russia. Until a year or so ago, state-owned banks essentially distributed money allocated by the Government. Now most of those banks have been turned into companies. Although the Russian Government still holds a majority of their shares, they operate as if they were independent, raising money to make loans to state and private enterprises. Most of the banks that loan primarily to farmers and to agriculture equipment companies do not take deposits, depending instead on loans from the Central Bank. The money is reloaned at interest rates higher than those charged by the Central Bank. The Central Bank currently has 135 billion rubles outstanding in loans, much of it to banks that relend to farmers and state-owned farm equipment companies, Mr. Domonov said. The money-losing farm sector has not repaid the commercial banks and they in turn have not repaid the Central Bank, leaving the latter with three choices as spring planting approaches. The most drastic would be for the Central Bank to call in its loans and take the money out of circulation. That would force the commercial banks to collect from the agriculture sector, an attempt that could result in numerous defaults, Mr. Domonov said. As a second alternative, the Central Bank could refrain from issuing additional credit, leaving the agricultural sector without enough money to pay for new equipment and spring planting. That makes the third choice the only acceptable one: to finance the farm sector so that the nation can renew its food supply, Mr. Domonov said. "Normally, we should not refinance the banks that lend to agriculture," Mr. Domonov said. But the Government can't do the job through subsidies, because of a huge budget deficit. "That leaves us no choice but to refinance," he said.

1070-> How to Make a Quick Economic Turnaround; Tax-Cut Illusions
To the Editor: In "Don't Look for Jobs in Japan" (editorial, Jan. 6), you advocate stimulating the economy through further cuts in the interest rate and/or tax cuts and increases in government spending. Such policies have traditionally been used to pull the economy out of recession by stimulating demand. But at a time when, as you say, Americans are already overconsuming, and when a disproportionate share of that consumption is of products made by other countries, such demand-based policies may do more to stimulate further the economies of those other countries than our own. How many Americans, if they have extra cash in their pockets or can get a lower-rate loan, will use it to buy an American car? And of course at the same time lower interest rates make it even less attractive to put any of that extra cash into savings, which, as you rightly point out, is the real key to reinvigorating the American economy. PAUL JELLINEK Mercerville, N.J., Jan. 10, 1992

1071-> ISRAELI SETTLERS ANSWER ASSAULTS
A member of Parliament from the Likud Party welcomed visitors today to his new office and home set up in a trailer at dawn at this site north of Jerusalem by Jewish settlers. The trailer of the legislator, Michael Eitan, parked in a muddy clearing in a grove of pine trees, was one of five similar outposts scattered today by settlers throughout the occupied territories after the ambush of an Israeli bus and car in the West Bank on Tuesday in which seven people were wounded by gunfire. Two radical Palestinian factions, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the pro-Iranian Party of God asserted responsibility for the attack. The settlers' response increased pressure from right-wing militants on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Government, which moved closer to dissolution today after the far-right Tehiya party voted to leave the coalition. Settlers Evicted Leaders of Tehiya and another small right-wing party, Moledet, have threatened to resign their Cabinet posts if Israeli negotiators offer a plan for autonomy in the occupied territories in talks with Palestinians in Washington. Their departure would leave Mr. Shamir two seats short of a majority and perhaps lead to early national elections and create uncertainties in the move toward peace. The army forcibly evicted settlers from two West Bank sites, in Hebron and near Jenin, and a third outpost in the Gaza Strip town of Deir al Balah was also reported to have been vacated. Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned that illegal actions would not be tolerated and that the makeshift settlements would be dismantled. But Mr. Eitan, who has parliamentary immunity from eviction, stayed put in his mobile home along with a group of yeshiva students and settlers in an adjacent room. Flanked by an old typewriter and a few loose-leaf binders hastily arranged on a shelf, he said that the trailer would henceforth serve as his parliamentary bureau and residence in midweek sessions of the national legislature in Jerusalem. Mr. Eitan and his companions linked today's settlement action to the Arab-Israeli peace talks now under way in Washington, as well as to the attack on Tuesday. Protest at Shamir's House "Arab terrorists shed the blood of Jews here in order to scare them away from the Land of Israel, and the terrorists in Washington have revealed their true political aims, which is the destruction of the State of Israel," he said. "In the face of Arab terror we are building. The more they shoot, the stronger we hold on." Sarah Gal, who arived from the West Bank settlement of Bet El, said: "This is the most humane and civilized response to an assassination attempt against innnocent people. We won't respond in kind." Another settler from Bet El, Becky Pinsky, added: "As long as we're being shot at, it's absurd to have peace talks. Let's have a cease-fire first, then we can talk." Before putting up the West Bank outposts, settlers demonstrated in front of the homes of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister Arens, demanding a crackdown on Arab violence. One speaker warned that if the Government took no action, there would be a "rebellion" by thousands of settlers who would take matters into their own hands. In Ramallah, Riyad Malki, a prominent supporter of the Palestinian front and an outspoken opponent of the peace talks, reported that settlers smashed windows in his home and painted it with Stars of David. Violence has risen sharply in the occupied territories since the start of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations in late October. A series of shooting attacks in the area has taken the lives of four Israelis, and set off the militant protest campaign by settlers.

1072-> Los Angeles to Distribute Condoms in High Schools
The Board of Education here voted on Tuesday night to make condoms available at all public high schools to combat the spread of AIDS, making this the fourth big city school system in the country to adopt such a policy. The board rejected a proposal to become the first district in the nation to make condoms available to junior high school students. The 4-to-3 vote followed six tumultuous hours of public comment and board debate before a deeply divided audience of more than 200 people. The meeting was interrupted several times by shouted insults and obscenities, and the police removed a few hecklers from the audience. A panel created by the district to devise an AIDS prevention policy had recommended that the board make condoms available without parental consent to all students in the seventh grade and beyond. But the board limited the program to high schools and gave parents the power to bar their children from receiving condoms. "Any circumstance under which we break the ice on this and get condoms into schools is better than not having them at all," said Jeff Horton, a board member who supported the committee's entire proposal. Last February, the New York City Board of Education became the first in the nation to endorse condom distribution in all public high schools. In September, the board narrowly defeated a parental consent motion. Gaining Momentum Condom distribution has gained considerable momentum since New York took the lead on the issue. In August, the Massachussetts Education Department recommended that state school districts make condoms available to teen-agers, and a few small districts have done so. In October, the San Francisco adopted a policy of condom availability in all high schools, followed in December by Seattle. In several cities, including Philadelphia, Chicago and Baltimore, schools have pilot condom-distribution programs of limited scope. In Los Angeles, critics accused the district of straying outside its proper role, and asserted that condom distribution would send a dangerous message to teen-agers. "To say to students you can have safe sex with a condom is a lie," said Leticia Quezada, a board member who cast a dissenting vote. "There is no such thing, even if you use condoms." As in New York and other cities where the issue has been debated, opponents threatened to go to court to block condom distribution.

1073-> HOCKEY; For Rangers' All-Stars, Three Just Isn't Enough
The Rangers take themselves so seriously this season that there was considerable grumbling today when the National Hockey League announced that center Mark Messier, defenseman Brian Leetch and goaltender Mike Richter were among the 15 players added to the Wales Conference team for the National Hockey League All-Star Game in Philadelphia on Jan. 18 Although this marked the first time since 1977 that the Rangers will dress as many as three players for the game, the players wondered aloud after practice why there could not be more. Why not four, or five? "The selection process is so strange; I've given up trying to figure it out," said Mike Gartner, passed over despite 24 goals. "I'm disappointed, but not that surprised. I think I'm on as good a pace as I ever was." Complex Calculations Gartner joined several other players around the league who probably deserved to play in the game but will not participate because of a complicated process that involved fan balloting and demanded at least one player from each team. Among the 15 players added today to the 6 starters in the Wales Conference were defenseman Scott Stevens (10 goals, 27 assists, 37 points) of the Devils and wing Ray Ferraro (20-19-39) of the Islanders. Left off were Claude Lemieux (25-12-37) and Peter Stastny (21-23-44) of the Devils; Derek King (24-15-39) of the Islanders; Sergei Nemchinov (20-10-30) of the Rangers and Joe Mullen (26-30-56) of the Penguins. Even Richter, who gladly accepted his first-ever invitation, had some problems with the process. Three's a Crowd? For the first time, a panel of four winning general managers (Mike Keenan of Chicago, Rogatien Vachon of Los Angeles, Harry Sinden of Boston, and Craig Patrick of Pittsburgh) made the selections, instead of the All-Star coaches. Also for the first time, there were three goaltenders selected instead of two. Richter, with a record of 15-6-1 and a goals-against average of 3.00, had no way of knowing whether he or Don Beaupre of the Washington Capitals (14-7-1, 2.88 goals-against) was the second choice behind Patrick Roy of Montreal, and this troubled him. "It's a fantastic honor, but I wish only two goaltenders were going, even if I was the third," Richter said. "That way, making the team is more of a special thing." Richter felt uncomfortable discussing this honor with goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck dressing in the next stall. "My position is comparable to Beezer's, and I feel awkward accepting it," he said. "And what about Gartner and Sergei? Is their value any less for not making it?" Leetch was named to the team for the third successive season. Ridiculously, Messier was overlooked in the fan balloting, finishing eighth with just 20,539 votes. Ahead of him were such nonsuperstars as John Cullen, Pierre Turgeon and Dale Hawerchuk. "That's O.K.," Messier said, of the puzzling fan vote. "When I was in the Campbell Conference, I never finished higher than sixth, either." SLAP SHOTS Instead of conventional practice today, the Rangers broke up into four teams and played a series of hockey and hand-eye coordination games.

1074-> Market Place; Ralston Purina: Profitable but . . .
THE Ralston Purina Company is solidly profitable, with a roster of famous product names like Purina dog food, Chex cereals, Wonder bread, Beech-Nut baby foods and Eveready batteries. Yet its stock was among the poorest performers in the food and consumer packaged-goods group last year. Ralston's shares rose by just 10 percent, compared with more than 40 percent for its main competitors and 26.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. Nor will William P. Stiritz, the publicity-shy chairman and chief executive of the St. Louis-based company, be able to report a rousing start to the new year at the annual meeting today. "Ralston is totally out of favor," said Robert J. Cummins, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company. "Their earnings have left a lot to be desired for several years." Ralston's pet-food business, cereals and huge baking operations are all under intense competitive pressure, leaving analysts doubtful that strong earnings growth can soon resume. Prospects would be even bleaker but for the double-digit earnings advances at Eveready, which now accounts for more than 25 percent of profits. But some analysts say Ralston is now so undervalued that it may be a good long-term investment. "I hold my nose, close my eyes and rate them a 'buy' because they are so cheap relative to the others," said Roger W. Spencer, who follows food companies for Paine Webber Inc. Perhaps the biggest attraction of the company, analysts say, is the cash its operations generate. Lawrence Adelman, who follows Ralston for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimates the company will have $1.4 billion to invest after capital spending and dividends over the next five years, a larger amount relative to its share price than any food company except CPC International Inc. "The bet on Ralston is how management will use that," Mr. Adelman said. In the past, Mr. Stiritz has most notably used free cash to buy back Ralston stock. Since 1982, the company has repurchased about 126 million shares, adjusting for splits, reducing the number of shares outstanding to fewer than 111 million and raising earnings per share faster than net income has grown. Some analysts, like John M. McMillin of Prudential Securities Inc., are predicting more sizable share repurchases, which should help to bolster the share price, which ended at $57.25 yesterday, down $1.25. At that price, the stock carries a price-earnings ratio of 17.52, compared with the higher ones of the Quaker Oats Company, General Mills Inc. or the Kellogg Company. Despite the lagging performance in 1991, Ralston's share price is nearly 10 times higher than when Mr. Stiritz became chief executive in 1981. Analysts say Ralston's pet-food business, which provides 40 percent of its earnings, has been hurt by several trends. The $8 billion industry is mature, with a number of big companies fighting desperately for market share. High-priced specialty products sold through veterinarians, like the Colgate-Pamolive Company's Science Diet, have chipped away at the high end of the market. After being slow to recognize the threat, Ralston has begun to respond with its own products. But the weakening economy has led some pet owners to move to canned brands, where Ralston is weaker, from dried products, where it dominates the market. And a growing percentage of pet food is purchased at discount retailers like Wal-Mart instead of at supermarkets, the traditional focus of Ralston's marketing. "The pet-food business is dog-eat-dog," Mr. Spencer said. "Ralston needs something with a fairly wild upside to balance it." That something will not come from baking. Products like Wonder bread and Hostess snacks generate profits but have scant room to grow. Total sales of baked goods are flat, and the battle for market share is nearly as fierce as in dog food. Ralston and its rivals spend heavily on new products just to hold their market share or eke out modest gains. Cereals do not seem to be the answer, either. The company's flagship Chex brands are also-rans in a market dominated by heavyweights with huge advertising budgets, like General Mills and Kellogg's. Ralston has been deft at developing branded cereals for children based on licensed characters, like Batman and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, but such brands tend to decline after a short period of faddish appeal. Ralston's biggest cereal success has been in manufacturing products for supermarkets and others to sell under private labels. Analysts estimate that Ralston has more than 60 percent of this growing business, but profit margins are substantially lower than for branded cereals. Meanwhile, the company's Beech-Nut baby foods group has been losing market share to the Gerber Products Company, the industry leader. That leaves Eveready. Ronald Morrow, who follows Ralston for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, figures that Eveready's earnings may grow as much as 15 percent this year. The Eastman Kodak Company has slackened its efforts to wrest market share from Eveready and Duracell Inc., the two dominant players, and Eveready is expanding overseas. But Mr. Morrow says it is hard to imagine much of an improvement on current growth rates without a breakthrough in technology. He and a number of other analysts say that even though the company may be undervalued, Energizer batteries alone cannot move Ralston onto their "buy" lists.

1076-> But Can I Read It in the Bathtub?
To the Editor: "Is the Electronic Book Closer Than You Think?" (The Week in Review, Dec. 29) raises a number of questions for me. Will I be able to underline passages that capture my fancy? Will I be able to insert marginal notes when I want to argue with the author? Will I be able to copy pages to mail to my friends, and will those pages be on old-fashioned paper? Will I be able to use the electronic book to squash bothersome insects? Most important, will I be able to read it in the bathtub, where much of my catching up takes place? Until these questions are answered to my satisfaction, I will cleave to the rectangular device that has served humanity for the last 400 years. OSCAR SHEFLER Pittsburgh, Dec. 30, 1991

1077-> Stocks Down Sharply, With Dow Falling 27.06
Stocks closed sharply lower yesterday, in heavy but cautious trading. Investors were tentative in advance of today's February employment data and because of pressure from a weak bond market and concern over rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 27.06 points, 3,241.50. The February unemployment report is the first of the key economic numbers due out this month that are expected to give the market a sense of the economy's strength. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 208.94 million, virtually unchanged from 208.91 million shares traded on Wednesday, as losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,267 to 486, or a nearly 3-to-1 ratio. The composite index dropped 1.74 points, to 224.92. Edwin Walczak, first vice president and chief investment officer for Vontobel U.S.A., the United States base of the Swiss Private Bank, said that the market appeared directionless most of the day until the bond market began to dribble away and stocks followed. "I think this reiterates that this high-multiple market requires low interest rates to sustain itself, and at this juncture, in the absence of proven economic growth and improved corporate earnings, the bond market has begun to govern the performance of the equity market," Mr. Walczak said. Index of 500 Stocks Down The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, fell 2.82 points, to 406.51, with the American Stock Exchange index off 3.15 points, to 410.24. Heavy trading on the Nasdaq took the composite down 8.32 points, to 621.97, while the Russell 2,000 dropped 2.58 points to finish at 208.69. Stocks fell at the opening bell, partly continuing Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Dow lose 21 points as well as weak bond prices. A larger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims helped ease some of the early selling. It was considered good news for equities, but it also lowered bond prices and pushed up yields, raising concern among stock investors about climbing interest rates. Birinyi Associates, the Wall Street research firm, said program trading played a large role in taking the market down; the total impact of the programs on the Dow was a 21.79-point drop, it said. In other trading activity, shares of Merck & Company finished unchanged at 151 1/4, following Wednesday's selloff after rumors of a negative report about its widely sold cholesterol drug Mevacor. Robert Hodgson, an analyst with Cowen & Company, repeated his "buy" recommendation, especially on any weakness in the shares. A day after its credit rating was lowered by Moody's Investors Service, I.B.M. shares continued to trade lower, closing at 86 5/8, off 3/4. Micro Healthsystems, which makes bedside computers for hospitals, moved up sharply in trading yesterday. It appears that the stock is among a few being recommended as "buys" over the next six months by money managers who took part in a dart board versus managers contest held by The Wall Street Journal for a number of years. Jonathan Steinberg of Financial Data Systems Inc., who has finished first in six of 10 tries, picked Micro, and it appears that he has a following. The stock was up 3 1/4, to 19 3/4. The Gap fell 2 3/8, to 46, even though the specialized retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year ago, and higher than the mean 57 cents analysts had expected. Robert Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, repeated his "buy" recommendation, but investors were disappointed by its February sales. Sunrise Technologies rose 1 3/4, to 14 3/4, after it said the United States Food and Drug Administration had cleared its Holium laser product for surgery. In trading yesterday, the Dial Corporation was down 1/8, to 50 1/8. On Tuesday the shareholders of Dial approved a spinoff of its commercial finance subsidiaries and mortgage insurance business, with the GFC Financial Corporation as the parent company. The spinoff schedule called for Dial common stock to continue to trade through March 18, with the right to receive the GFC stock distribution of one GFC share for every two shares of Dial. March 4 was the record for distribution, the same day GFC stock began trading on a when-issued basis. And in when-issued trading yesterday the stock was at 22 1/2, up 3/4.

1082-> Review/Fashion; Saint Laurent Finds Beauty In Perfect Cut
Caught between the glories of its past and the uncertainties of its future, the haute couture industry has been presenting a fragmented image in the showings of its spring and summer collections this week. Forgetting that fashion is based on change, some couturiers are reliving their past successes and others are marching in place, while a few are showing eccentric clothes. Discussions are going on at every level as to whether the rules for acceptance to the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne should be changed, as if that will solve everything. Twenty-one designers are members of the government-supported group that organizes the haute couture industry and schedules its twice-yearly showings. A cause for sadness among the admirers of Claude Montana's modernistic clothes for Lanvin was the announcement that his well-received collection, shown Tuesday, would be his last for the house. The reason given by Michel Pietrini, the president of Lanvin, was that Montana, who made his reputation with ready-to-wear shown under his own name, refused to be involved with the Lanvin ready-to-wear collection. He will be replaced at Lanvin by Dominique Morlotti, who has designed men's wear for Christian Dior. Probably the best argument in favor of the status quo is the work of Yves Saint Laurent, who celebrates his 30th anniversary as the head of his own couture house next week. Now 56 years old, he began as an assistant to Christan Dior in the 1950's. His collection, which opened up no new directions, stressed clothes that were wearable, pretty and superbly constructed. The technical prowess of his workrooms was demonstrated by the perfect cut of suit jackets, princess dresses and long, slender evening styles that could be dazzling without any scarfs, jewels or other extraneous decoration. Often they were shown that way. He didn't even fool around with hem lengths, the conundrum of the season. The hemlines of both his narrow and his full skirts stop a reasonable few inches above the knees. Slightly more noticeable is his trouser length. All his pants are cuffed a few inches above the ankles, giving a clear view of the high-heeled shoes. There wasn't much of a leg show in this genteel collection. Only occasionally was a skirt unbuttoned to give a glimpse of thigh. Polka dots were everywhere, usually in black or navy with white; they overshadowed even the flowered prints, and were even on some shoes and hats. Pierre Berge, his company's chairman, has predicted that the couture as it now exists will not be around in another 10 years. Saint Laurent has insisted, with fervor, that even if the couture disappears he will make dresses for private customers in his own workrooms. His clients return his passion. Dotted around the long runway at the Intercontinental Hotel this morning, they sat forward in their seats, following each model with great concentration, nodding approval to themselves or their companions. "Sublime," said Deeda Blair of Washington, a longtime couture fan. Jacqueline de Ribes, herself a designer as well as a couture client, said: "I like it because it is what we really want. It is sober and elegant." The most interesting visitor backstage was Vivienne Westwood, the London designer whose clothes are outrageous even by British standards. "I asked for an invitation six months ago to be sure I got in," she said. "I'm so glad I did. It was wonderful. The technique -- it's the basis for everything." The applause was consistent throughout the show. Often enough it was for the simpler designs, as if each viewer was a connoisseur, appreciative of the skill it takes to make these unencumbered styles look perfect. Or perhaps it indicated a latent need for classic, straightforward clothes that were not designed to make a fashion statement or reveal a designer's fantasy world. At any rate, the first style that brought an enthusiastic clapping of hands was an indigo blue classic shirtdress worn with high-heeled spectator pumps, No. 6 on the program. The next to draw a response, a few moments later, was a pants suit of white wool crepe with a one-button jacket. Besides the ankle-length trousers, the only offbeat thing about it was the chiffon scarf threaded through the belt loops. It was in an intense blue to match the blouse -- an idea that could easily be copied by individual women. A superb colorist, Saint Laurent uses his skill discreetly in this collection, pinning a red sequined butterfly to the back of a black cire jacket that looks like leather, or adding lime green gloves to a navy suit. As the show progressed, enthusiasm grew for the many polka-dot styles for day and night, for loose, swingy play dresses decorated with multicolor appliques and for showpieces like a frothy puffball of black dotted tulle tiers hung on camisole straps. Still, the audience also responded to such unpretentious styles as a blue wool princess dress or a white sleeveless sheath topped by a bolero jacket. The designer said his theme was youth, and he expressed it well. The departure of Claude Montana from Lanvin left some fashion professionals troubled about the state of the couture. He was considered one of the forward-looking designers, though in two years on the job he had not attracted a wide circle of clients. He will continue his own ready-to-wear collection, which expresses some of the same ideas. "I am shocked," said Sonia Rykiel, as she entered the Saint Laurent show. "No one could say he was not good." Retailers were similarly concerned. Joseph Boitano, a senior vice-president of Bergdorf Goodman, said the Montana collection represented a real breakthrough for couture fashion. Ellin Saltzman, corporate fashion director of Macy's, called it "the most modern collection of the season." And Kalman Ruttenstein, vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, said: "Montana's new vision of the couture would have taken us into the next century. He brought a freshness to the couture vocabulary." He added that he was looking forward to seeing Montana's next venture into the couture area. He may have a chance. Montana said that his work with the couture was "an incredible experience" and that he hoped to repeat it under other auspices. Some kind of luxury ready-to-wear was another alternative, he said. Mr. Morlotti will introduce his ready-to-wear at the fall openings in March and will show a couture collection in July.

1083-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BIG EAST NOTEBOOK; O'Brien Has Everything, Except Pact
In a conference that reaches a consensus about as often as the sun is in total eclipse, there is a widespread amazement among Big East coaches and administrators that Jim O'Brien's future as coach at Boston College has not yet been happily chiseled in stone. In the midst of Boston College's most exciting basketball season in years, O'Brien's future officially extends no further than this year, the final season of his contract. But his uncertain status represents far more than one school's internal debate of whether a coach will stay or go. A conference that once prided itself on the stability of its programs -- with Seton Hall's commitment nearly five years ago to a vulnerable P. J. Carlesimo the most dramatic example -- has never faced a circumstance that would match O'Brien's possible release. 4 Sophomores and Recruits On Way With four sophomore starters, the Eagles have a 12-7 record. After two straight 1-15 league records, Boston College has won 4 of 10 Big East games this season. And with commitments from two highly regarded recruits, 6-foot 8-inch forward Robert Blackwell of Bishop Ford High in Brooklyn and 6-10 center Paul Grant of Brother Rice in Birmingham, Mich., O'Brien is assembling a group capable of reaching the league's highest echelon. "Look at what he has done for them," said Lou Carnesecca of St. John's. "They're starting to pay dividends. They're starting to put money into the bank. Next year, it will pay high dividends." But for whom? The scenario happens far too often: New coach is brought in. Old players continue to develop. New coach benefits from subtle, but decisive, concessions from the admissions office, or helpful administrative assistance, that the old coach never received. The new coach reaches a higher level and everyone looks like a genius, except for the old coach looking for a Division III job. Chet Gladchuk, the Boston College athletic director who succeeded William Flynn in December 1990, said he has been encouraged by the team's recent success. "It seems as though we've turned a corner," he said on Thursday afternoon, a day after a 70-60 loss to St. John's in which the Eagles cut a 19-point second-half deficit to 4. Gladchuk said a decision on O'Brien could be reached before the end of the season. Three important factors, he said, are his own newness as athletic director, the timing of the Eagles' recent success after a 127-140 record in O'Brien's five previous seasons and the significance of issues beyond victories and defeats. "In a transition period," Gladchuk said, "there is a period of understanding and growth between an administration and a coaching staff, and a confidence in each other. That is what is happening here now. That leads to, at some point, a decision." A Milestone for Sealy When St. John's meets Villanova at Alumni Hall tonight, Malik Sealy, with his fifth rebound, will become the eighth player in school history with more than 800 rebounds and 1,000 points. The others: George Johnson, Sonny Dove, Tony Jackson, LeRoy Ellis, Mel Davis, David Russell and Wayne McKoy. The continued emergence of sophomore Shawnelle Scott as a force near the basket could mean that Sealy does not have to be perfect in order for the Redmen to win. After the victory at Boston College, Sealy said Scott's improvement caused him to feel less personal pressure. Boeheim Doing Something Right Jim Boeheim wasn't very happy last November when fellow Big East coaches predicted that Syracuse would finish sixth in the Big East. Making matters worse, for the first time in eight years, Syracuse went unranked in the preseason. Boeheim thought that coaches were perhaps saying he could win only with seasoned talent. Whatever the coaches meant, Boeheim has made his point. On Monday, in its first key Big East showdown, Syracuse overcame an 11-point second-half deficit and defeated 10th-ranked Connecticut, 84-83, to take sole possession of first place in the conference. How is Syracuse doing it? "We just keep finding ways to win; I don't know exactly how because I don't know anything about coaching," said Boeheim, who is often criticized, despite a career winning percentage of .767. "But I'm sure we're doing something right out there."

1084-> NEW ELECTION PLAN IN ALBANY CREATES MINORITY DISTRICTS
A joint legislative committee today unveiled a redistricting plan that would create several new seats in the State Legislature for black and Hispanic office-seekers while protecting the Republican lock on the State Senate. The plan, a result of intense backstage politicking in the Capitol, would set new lines for the 61 State Senate districts and 150 Assembly seats that are all up for election this fall. The redrawing is required once a decade because of population shifts charted in the United States Census. The dominant feature of the new plan is the drawing of several districts in New York City to give minorities a better chance of winning seats, including the creation of five new Assembly districts where minorities represent a majority of the voting population and where there would be no incumbent. Emphasis on New York City Each house was essentially allowed to draw up a plan for itself. The Senate plan would give all nine Republican Senators from Long Island a strong likelihood of retaining their seats. It would also make room for as many as four new minority seats in New York City by pairing off eight white incumbent Democrats to run against one another in the fall, and potentially create one new Republican seat in the Rochester area by causing two Democrats there to run against each other. The Assembly plan would try to increase the Democrats' nearly 2-to-1 hold on that chamber by pitting several upstate Republicans against one another, but would also try to increase minority representation by creating new Democratic seats in New York City that could drive some white incumbents out of office. The redrawing is intended to conform to Federal civil-rights laws aimed at giving minorities greater representation in state legislatures and the Congress. Although there are several cases where white lawmakers represent districts in which a majority of the population is nonwhite, there is not a single district in the New York State Legislature where the reverse is true. Still, while several lawmakers would be forced to run against one another in the fall elections to accommodate the changes, the vast majority were clearly protected. "The most modern of computers have been used for the most ancient of purposes -- self-preservation," said Henry J. Stern, the president of the Citizens Union, the Manhattan-based government watchdog group. The plan was presented by the co-chairmen of the Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment, Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican of Rockville Centre, and Assemblyman David F. Gantt, a Rochester Democrat. It is not final, but because the two lawmakers who drafted it were deputized by the powerful legislative leaders, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader, several officials predicted that it would bear a close resemblance to the plan the Legislature would ultimately adopt. Even with that, it will not be final: for the first time in his nine-year tenure, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been thrust into the reapportionment struggle, and he has repeatedly pledged to veto any plan that could be labeled an "incumbency protection act." Because there are bound to be scores of lawmakers unhappy with the new lines, it is not clear that the Legislature could muster enough votes to override any veto. Increasing the Odds Along with the expansion last year of the New York City Council and Federal insistence that minorities be fairly represented, the plan outlined today could provide substantial opportunities -- though no guarantees -- for minority politicians in the city seeking office. Although members of minority groups make up about 57 percent of the city's population, they hold less than than a third of the city's seats in the State Legislature, according to the Majority Coalition for Fair Reapportionment, a nonprofit group that has advocated for the voting rights of black, Hispanic and Asian residents. But the new plan would have several other effects, including forcing several white incumbents across the state to run against one another in the fall, a prospect that set off political convulsions in the Capitol today. Because each house was essentially allowed to draft its own lines for the report, the plan clearly showed the different priorities in the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led Assembly. Different Priorities The Senate lines seemed to maximize the Republicans' hold on suburban, upstate and conservative urban areas that has given it a 35-26 edge in that chamber, which has been no easy feat given that Democratic voters outnumber Republicans 3 to 2 in the state. In the Assembly, more of an attempt was made to increase the Democratic party's already lopsided edge in that chamber: lines were shifted so that as many as 10 Republican Assembly members might be forced to run against one another, with new districts created where Democrats could have a chance to capture them. The process appeared to be particularly chaotic in the Democratic-controlled State Assembly today, where Mr. Weprin, who has headed the chamber for barely a month, appeared to face a mini-revolt from several members who said they felt the redrawing had been conducted haphazardly. "I think they carved me up to no end, just carved me up," said Anthony S. Seminerio, a Democratic Assemblyman who made a much-noted outburst defending lawmakers' pay during Governor Cuomo's State of the State speech this year and whose southeastern Queens district was divided into several pieces. "I went to the Speaker and said 'Why me?' and he just shrugged." Strange Shapes As is so often the case in reapportionment, many of the new districts outlined today took on crazy shapes that were designed to accommodate either demographic or political demands but that could fire a schoolchild's imagination. For instance, a new eel-shaped Senate district would hook up through the northern Bronx and around the edges of the Westchester County city of Mount Vernon, where blacks make up a substantial part of the population. By skirting minority areas, this new district would probably help an incumbent Republican Senator who would seek to represent it, Guy J. Velella, whose current district includes parts of Westchester and the Bronx. It would be nearly 70 percent white. The adjoining district, meanwhile, which would include black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Bronx and Mount Vernon, could help a black or Hispanic get elected. Its registration would be 80 percent nonwhite. To be sure, many people were unhappy with the proposed lines. Some groups representing minorities said that even more minority seats could have been created. A Typical Scenario And John J. Faso, a Republican Assemblyman from Kinderhook who handles reapportionment issues for his party, denounced the plan as "a partisan gerrymander upstate and a racial gerrymander downstate." Because the Senate redistricting would essentially sequester minority voters who overwhelming tend to vote for Democrats, it was clear that the plan could also bolster the Republicans whose major bastion of power in state government, their control of the Senate, presently rides on their ability to hold six seats from New York City -- two in Queens and one in each of the other boroughs. The battle here is the latest indication of both the racial tensions and the strange alliances that have accompanied reapportionment battles around the nation. In New York City last year, the United States Justice Department forced the city to redraw some lines for the expanded City Council because it said the existing configuration did not guarantee minorities a fair chance at representation.

1085-> 'Grand Canyon' Wins The First Prize At Berlin Festival
Lawrence Kasdan's "Grand Canyon," about a diverse group of people in Los Angeles and the impact of violence on their lives, was awarded the top prize, the Golden Bear, at the 42d Berlin International Film Festival today. The award, greeted with a mixture of applause and booing at a crowded news conference at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, gave Americans a sweep of the top prizes at this year's festival. American films have also won the top prize at the Cannes International Film Festival for the last three years. "The Hours and Times," an hourlong film by the young American Christopher Munch, a re-creation of a holiday spent in Barcelona in 1962 by John Lennon and the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, won the Wolfgang Staudte Film Prize. This is the top award given to films in the International Forum of Young Films, the section of the Berlin festival devoted to new, experimental and innovative entries. Jury of 11 From 10 Countries "Grand Canyon" was one of 25 films from 19 countries in the main competition. The jury was headed by the French actress Annie Girardot, and had 11 members from 10 countries (there were still two Germans on the jury, one from the eastern part of the now unified country and one from the west). Competition awards were formally presented tonight at the Zoo Palast, the festival's main theater. The discussions were unfailingly amicable, said a jury member, and near-unanimity was reached in awarding "Grand Canyon" the top prize. Last year, a controversy arose because the winning film, "La Casa del Sorriso" ("House of Smiles") from Italy, had reportedly been rejected by both the Cannes and Venice festivals. The only thing close to a backstage crisis this year came on Thursday when a competition film, "Independent Life," by the Russian director Vitaly Kanevski, was suddenly withdrawn by its French producer. Rumor had it that it was headed for Cannes. Its place in the Berlin competition was taken by Alain Corneau's "Tous les Matins du Monde," which just won the Cesar, the French version of the Oscar, for best picture of the year. And the Winners Are . . . Other awards in the main competiton went to Istvan Szabo's "Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe," from Hungary (winning the Silver Bear); Jan Troell (best director, for "Il Capitano," a Swedish-Finnish-Danish co-production); Maggie Cheung (best actress, for "Ruan Ling Yu," Hong Kong-Taiwan); Armin Mueller-Stahl (best actor, for "Utz," Britain-Germany-Italy); "Beltenebros" (best cinematographic values, Spain); "La Frontera" (best debut film, Chile-Spain); "Infinitas" (new perspectives in cinematographic art, Russia), and Barbara Thummet (special mention for her acting in "Gudrun," Germany). The jury chose to give no prize this year for short films, and suggested a re-examination of the selection process. The Berlin festival inspires a host of secondary prizes. Among them were the International Film Critics' prizes for Eric Rohmer's "Conte d'Hiver," of France; Aki Kaurismaki's "Vie de Boheme," of Finland, and Derek Jarman's "Edward II," of Britain; the Caligari Film Prize for an American production, Tom Kalin's "Swoon"; the Gay Teddy Bear and the International Confederation of Art Cinemas prizes, both for another American film, P. J. Castellaneta's "Together Alone," and the Prize of the German Art Film Theater Association and the Readers' Prize of the Berliner Morgenpost, a newspaper, both for George Sluizer's "Utz."

1086-> Elizabeth Sarcka, 98; Aided the Mentally Ill
Elizabeth Man Sarcka, a founder of Spring Lake Ranch in Vermont, one of the earliest halfway houses for the mentally ill, died on Sunday at Hampshire House, a community care home in East Montpelier, Vt. She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens. She died of a stroke, her family said. Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention. Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens. Active in volunteer work at the United Nations, Mrs. Sarcka was president of the Queens Chapter of the United Nations Association from 1975 to 1979. She also served as executive secretary of the League of Nations Association of Greater New York from 1927 to 1928. A graduate of Barnard College, she was honored with the distinguished alumna award in 1983 and the Barnard Medal of Distinction in 1985. Born in New York City, she came from a prominent New York family. Her father, Alrick H. Man, a Wall Street lawyer, developed the community of Kew Gardens in Queens, on property that had been bought by her grandfather, Alban P. Man. She is survived by her daughter, Anne of Montpelier, Vt.; a niece, Lucy Jinishian of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a nephew, Alrick Man 3d of South Londonderry, Vt.

1087-> Late Buying Pushes Dow Up by 32.42
Stock prices posted crisp gains in active trading yesterday, as investor confidence returned after two days of losses. With low interest rates continuing to be a driving force, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 32.42 points, to 3,255.81. The surge appeared suddenly late in the afternoon, aided by waves of computer-program buying, said Philip H. Smyth, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading. He said the firm detected heavy program buying from about 3:18 P.M. to near the close, and the combined effect of the programs added 20.79 points to the Dow. New York Stock Exchange volume was heavy at 228.1 million shares, up from 218.8 million on Tuesday, and gainers nearly doubled decliners, 1,147 to 628. The Big Board composite index rose 2.55 points, to 230.19. Other Indexes Rise The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 5.49 points, to 418.13, while the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.55 points, to 413.18. With the computer problems of Tuesday fixed, the Nasdaq composite index posted a 15.81-point gain, to 620.68, and the Russell 2,000 moved 2.76 points higher, to 203.71. Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said the high number of gainers compared with losers in the market yesterday, a reversal of the previous day, told the story. "Someone yelled charge, and it wasn't Teddy Roosevelt," he said. "This market never showed a large number of new lows and that was a sign that this was a short-term consolidation and the market is now ready to move ahead," he added. "There is still a lot of money sitting in the hands of the equity mutual funds contributed by indivdual investors, in addition to large amounts of money still left at low-return money funds and certificates of deposit." Among stocks yesteday, Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 2 1/8, to 83 7/8, as a few analysts made positive and repeated "buy" ratings on the stock, saying the giant pharmaceutical company's earnings should not be hurt by breast-implant lawsuits. Clearly Canadian Beverage rose 2 3/8, to 22 1/4, as Gary Chin, an Oppenheimer & Company analyst, initiated his coverage with a "buy" rating. Amid concerns about future earnings, shares of Silicon Graphics, a computer company, fell 2 1/2, to 47 5/8. Trading was initially delayed because of an imbalance of sell orders. Sun Microsystems's announcement yesterday of a pact with Cray Research to build high-end computers was called "very positive" by Timothy McCollum of Dean Witter Reynolds. Traders expect Sun to report good results next week. Sun rose 1 3/4, to 33 1/4, and Cray gained 2 1/2, to 47. Surprisingly strong third-quarter results helped Computer Associates to a gain of 3 1/4, to 15 1/8. The software maker posted earnings per share of 43 cents, while Wall Street expectations had been for 36 cents a share.

1088-> Patents; A New Spinnaker for Racing Yachts
Lincoln F. Baird, an avid amateur sailor in Los Angeles, won a patent this week for a new spinnaker -- the large, triangular headsail on racing yachts -- that he says fills up with wind better and can propel a boat much faster than traditional sails. The key to the new invention is a horizontal tube of lightweight fabric that runs around the the outside of the sail. The tube inflates at the same time that the sail fills up with wind, and it remains inflated because check valves in the tube prevent the air from escaping. The result, Mr. Baird said, is that the tube becomes a supportive beam that keeps the sail spread out even when the wind shifts. Mr. Baird said his invention prevented the spinnaker from collapsing the moment it slipped out of the proper wind alignment and allowed it to fill up with air more efficiently. Mr. Baird said he had used his sail in a number of races, and won them. Despite its unconventional feature, he said, the sail is legal in most competitions. He received patent 5,095,837.

"Paths of Exile," a concert commemorating the 500th anniversary of the Jews' expulsion from Spain, is to take place at 8 tonight at the Town and Village Synagogue, 334 East 14th Street, Manhattan. The concert by Voice of the Turtle, a folk-music group, will include Ladino and Hebrew music from Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries as well as the New World. Tickets are $15.

1090-> CUNY Inquiry Finds History of Problems
An investigation into the deadly crush at a celebrity basketball game at City College has found a history of poor supervision of student-run social events and has determined that the problems at the game were not "isolated or unique." The investigation, by the City University of New York, the college's parent organization, found that in the six months before the game, three other student functions at City College were marred by overcrowding, assaults and in one case, a killing. A 40-page report on the inquiry, which was conducted by CUNY's Office of Internal Audit, is to be released in a week, but some of the findings were disclosed this week at a public committee meeting of the university's board of trustees. At the meeting, Richard F. Rothbard, CUNY's vice chancellor for budget, finance and computing, did not lay blame on any individual. But he made clear to the trustees that the college administration should have viewed the three events before the game as "danger signals" -- warnings that remedial action was urgently needed. 2,000 People in a Room for 500 Nine people died at the college on Dec. 28, as a crowd of 5,000 tried to enter the college's gymnasium through a single stairwell to watch a basketball game between two teams of rap musicians. Yesterday, Charles DeCicco, a City College spokesman, said the school's president, Dr. Bernard W. Harleston, would not comment on the report until it was formally released. Dr. Harleston, who has been president for 10 years, has come under severe criticism in recent months for responses including his handling of spring student protests that forced the campus to be closed for more than three weeks. Mr. Rothbard said CUNY investigated to determine whether the basketball game, which was sponsored in part by the college's Evening Student Government, reflected wider problems in supervising student-sponsored campus events. He said the university auditors, who looked at campus events over the last year, found a "lack of viable, comprehensive and enforceable" controls on using campus buildings and protecting campus property. In addition, he said, the investigation found that student groups routinely sought to "circumvent" college rules. One of the examples cited in the report, as summarized by Mr. Rothbard, was a dance run by the Aspira Hispanic Club on June 14. The dance attracted 2,000 people to a cafeteria that had a capacity for 500. A college security guard was punched in the face trying to stop some people from crashing the event, but there were no disciplinary proceedings. At another student-run party, one man shot another to death in a fight. Neither the victim nor the assailant were students, but both were attending the event sponsored by the Hard Core Righteous Party on July 13. As a result of the incident, college officials began providing metal detectors and security guards at student events in the college's North Academic Center, where the party was held. The school also banned the sale of alcoholic beverages at such functions. But in an attempt to sidestep that rule, students at a dance sponsored by the Latin American Engineering Student Association on Sept. 21 solicited money while passing out glasses of beer. As at the party in June, almost 1,500 people crowded into the cafeteria. The report says that although fights broke out at the dance, no one was brought up on disciplinary charges. Critical City Report Last month a report by Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen severely criticized City College officials for inadequately supervising the basketball game and the planning for it. Specifically, Mr. Mollen cited school officials for not knowing that the game involved rap stars, who could be expected to draw large crowds; for not identifying outside promoters; for not monitoring ticket sales, and for not providing adequate security. The CUNY report raised questions about the possibilities for fraud and theft at student-run events, noting that in general, college officials were extremely lax in monitoring ticket sales and were often unable to account for how money collected was spent. Although students were often required to pay in advance for using college space, university auditors found that college officials often made only minimal attempts to collect such fees. The university's report found a lack of coordination between several college offices responsible for overseeing campus events. Mr. Rothbard also noted that audits dating to 1983 recognized serious problems in supervising student activities, but that the college had not put into effect many of the audits' recommendations. After the deaths, the vice president of student affairs retired and the director of student affairs and the security director were relieved of their responsibilities for the roles they played in supervising the celebrity game. Trustees attending the meeting on Monday were allowed to read a draft of the university report as Mr. Rothbard made his presentation. But the report is apparently considered so sensitive that they were not allowed to keep copies because Dr. Harleston had not yet responded to its findings. At City College yesterday, a spokesman said a response was being prepared.

1091-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Debate; Economy, and Brown, Are Focus of a Democratic Round Table
The remaining contenders for the Democratic nomination returned to the debate round table tonight, wrangling about who has the best plan to revive the nation's sluggish economy. In the debate, broadcast by ABC, the expected two-man contest between former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas failed to materialize. The candidates took aim instead at Edmund G. Brown Jr., who won his first state primary this week. Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California who stepped down as chairman of his state party last year, came in for criticism when he faulted the other Democrats for falling victim to the "choke hold" of special interests who sponsor "thousand-dollar fund-raisers." Challenging Brown Mr. Brown won the Colorado primary last week with a shoestring campaign that has become a new threat to the other Democrats, and Mr. Clinton, Mr. Tsongas and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa all challenged his anti-establishment message. "Jerry Brown is a born-again insurgent," Mr. Clinton said. "He was the biggest of the big money raisers until he decided to run for President." Mr. Harkin added, "You can't sit there with a straight face and paint us all as corrupt, Jerry." Each candidate competed to prove he was not captive of a selected few big contributors by citing the numbers of individuals who have given money to his campaign. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, who disagreed about the need for a cut in the capital gains tax rate to spur investment, cast their dispute as a fundamental disagreement on the best way to revive the economy. "While we're having this discussion, in Japan, they're investing," Mr. Tsongas said. "In Germany, they're investing. So there is an inevitability to what happens if you don't invest." Mr. Clinton said reducing capital gains taxes would benefit the rich and stockholders who fared best in the 1980's. Both he and Mr. Harkin said they would favor targeted investment tax credits and a middle-income tax cut instead. The candidates returned to their disagreement over tax policy in answer to nearly every question, demonstrating their conviction that the economy will be a cutting issue across the South. Earlier today, Mr. Clinton seized on a published report of Congressional Budget Office statistics concluding that the richest 1 percent of Americans gained the most in the 1980's. Waving copies of the front-page New York Times article at a news conference today and again in the debate tonight, Mr. Clinton accused Mr. Tsongas of being the candidate of the rich. It is a theme that is certain to dominate the final weekend of campaigning for Super Tuesday as Mr. Tsongas reaches for a critical victory in Florida and a respectable showing elsewhere. Mr. Brown challenged Mr. Clinton's claim to minority voters' loyalties by asserting that the Governor had failed to pass a civil rights bill in Arkansas and had pandered to white voters by having his photograph taken at a prison boot camp in Georgia where the majority of the prisoners are black. Mr. Brown said the photograph, which appeared in The New York Times and showed Mr. Clinton talking to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia in the foreground, conveyed the impression of "almost a bunch of Willie Hortons" with "two white guys standing in front of them like colonial masters." Mr. Clinton rejected the racial characterization and said he went to the boot camp to demonstrate his commitment to alternatives to incarceration. The taping of the debate was delayed 45 minutes tonight after three of the candidates, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, threatened to walk out over a disagreement on how the question-and-answer exchange would be conducted. Donald Sweitzer, an adviser to Mr. Harkin, said the disagreement turned into a shouting match with the candidates on one side and Peter Jennings of ABC News, the moderator, and Roone Arledge, the ABC president, on the other.

1092-> SUNDAY VIEW; The Wink In 'Happy Fella' Is Still There
We really ought to be tossing something in the air this morning. Our hats. Confetti. The bambino. In a world where things usually go wrong, "The Most Happy Fella" has come through splendidly. Success has not given it a swelled head. Nobody has thought to gild the sets or pad the orchestra, which consists exactly of two tuxedoed pianists. Frank Loesser's musical is every bit as warm and endearing at the Booth Theater as it was last summer, when it proved to be a gargantuan hit for the tiny Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. "The Most Happy Fella" has always been the most deliriously musical of musicals -- packed with snappy Broadway show tunes, exquisite love songs, passionate arias, exuberant trios and "Big D," the hoedown that put Dallas on the map. That much we've known since 1956, when at least one reviewer complained that the work, about an aging Italian patriarch in the Napa Valley and his mail-order bride, contained music enough for at least two shows. What the Goodspeed set out to discover was whether or not you could hear the pitter-pat of the human heart in the prodigious outpouring of melody. It wasn't just a question of scaling an expansive Broadway musical down to size. Any production at the Goodspeed -- 398 seats nestled in a Victorian candy box -- is necessarily going to be an intimate production. It was a matter of emphasis. What if you treated "The Most Happy Fella" as a drama about the hesitation, the generosity, the self-doubts and the sudden shivers of joy that overtake people when they're falling under each other's spell? The director Gerald Gutierrez meant no disrespect to Loesser's score, but with only those two pianists in the orchestra pit the priorities were clear: he was putting the characters' emotional lives first. The set designer John Lee Beatty even covered up the unused portion of the pit, which allowed the performers to edge even closer to the audience, further enhancing the coziness. What happened, of course, was that Loesser's score not only sounded better than ever, it also seemed more of a piece -- its operatic urges no longer at odds with its happy-go-lucky outbursts. The cast, headed by Spiro Malas and Sophie Hayden, bloomed all down the line. A transfer to Broadway was inevitable. The only potential snag in the felicitous scenario was this: Would the producers leave intact what was wonderful in its discretion and its subtlety? Or, Broadway being Broadway, blow it up. In more ways than one. Well, there's been some polishing here, some tightening there. Mr. Beatty's scenery looks to be fresh as rain. And Scott Waara has taken over the role of Herman, the goofy farmhand who can't help liking everybody he meets, especially Liz Larsen, who plays a wry, wisecracking waitress as if the species had never been seen before. (That simply means that the secondary love interest is in better shape than ever.) Otherwise, the production's gloriously confidential mood remains unchanged. The Booth, one of Broadway's smallest theaters, couldn't be more hospitable. There, as at the Goodspeed, a wink does the work of a wink and an inadvertent trembling of the jaw is sufficient to suggest that the heroine is less brave than she's pretending. Set against the lush Nothern California vineyards and friendly main street of Napa in the 1920's, "The Most Happy Fella" takes an unlikely match and makes it seem inevitable. On the inside, Tony (Mr. Malas) is as decent a man as they come -- understanding enough to forgive his bride for the one-night stand that has left her pregnant; wise enough to claim the child as his own. On the outside, however, he's an old, balding immigrant who speaks broken English and looks suspiciously like a Dead End Kid grown up. Rosabella, his intended (Ms. Hayden), is a tired San Francisco waitress whose puffy face testifies to years of disappointment and dashed dreams. It doesn't help that Tony, no one's idea of Prince Charming, lures her to his Napa farm with guileless letters and a photograph of his dashing young foreman. As soon as she spots the ruse, her defenses go right back up, hiding the needy soul and the heart that's aching to give itself to someone. If "The Most Happy Fella" is a joyful experience, it's not because love triumphs in the end. Love triumphs all the time in B movies and vapid sitcoms. It's because in the extraordinarily delicate performances of Mr. Malas and Ms. Hayden, the characters' inner qualities gradually work their way to the surface, remaking external reality. The two not only come to see each other with different eyes, but we do, too. By the time they sing their exultant duet, "My Heart Is So Full of You," the spirit has transformed the flesh. A June-November pairing that flouts every traditional romantic expectation ends up seeming totally natural. Desirable even. That's why it was so critical to keep the production intimate and every spectator close at hand. "The Most Happy Fella" chronicles a huge change of heart, but it does so by tiny increments. Play it grandly, sweepingly, for the upper gallery, as the New York City Opera did recently, and the tale turns to bombast and melodrama. Play it with homely truth, and the evening acquires the lovely glow of fireflies at dusk. The show's moods are not exclusively sentimental, although while I'm on the topic, I should mention "Joey, Joey, Joey," surely as seductive an expression of wanderlust as any in the Broadway canon. (Charles Pistone sings it with a beautiful wistfulness.) "Standing on the Corner" is the kind of brazenly chipper four-part harmony that's been getting its own tribute these days Off Broadway in "Forever Plaid." And for sheer brio, how can you beat "Abbondanza," an exhilaratingly nutty celebration of nature's bounty. Mark Lotito, Bill Nabel and Buddy Crutchfield tackle the number with the reckless panache of provincial acrobats sipping vino on the high wire. I'm tempted to say that the old saw about good things coming in small packages applies here, if it's ever applied anywhere. Except that "The Most Happy Fella," belying its actual dimensions, never seems contained. So much enchantment pours off the stage of the Booth that one is left with an impression of profligacy. Nothing is smaller than a big show that's empty. Or bigger, for that matter, than a little show that's so full to the brim it's bursting. 'The Baltimore Waltz' In "The Baltimore Waltz," a discombobulating new play at the Circle Repertory Company, a brother and sister take a grand tour of Europe, while the playwright Paula Vogel goes on a guilt trip. A few hard facts may be helpful here. In 1986, Ms. Vogel's brother Carl, then HIV-positive, proposed that she visit Europe with him. Unaware of his condition and caught up in other projects, she declined the offer. Early in 1988, Carl died of AIDS in Maryland. The trip never got taken. Written a year and a half later, Ms. Vogel's play is the journey they might have experienced -- part dream, part movie pastiche, part wish fulfillment. Carl is still Carl, a San Francisco librarian, fired for wearing a pink triangle on the job. Anna, an elementary-school teacher, is the stand-in for the playwright. An additional character, billed only as Third Man, crops up as everybody along the way, including Harry Lime, the black marketeer, whom Orson Welles played in the movie classic "The Third Man." The playwright's greatest deviation from reality, however, is to make Anna the sick one, not Carl. Early in the play, the doctor informs her she has ATD, "Acquired Toilet Disease," a terminal illness contracted by sitting on public toilet seats. Single schoolteachers between the ages of 24 and 40 seem to be the chief victims. Medical science is baffled. Safe toilet practices offer the only protection. "Do squat, don't sit," advises the Department of Health and Human Services. While the European voyage will be in the nature of a last goodbye for the siblings, they entertain the tiniest of hopes that Dr. Todesrocheln, an 80-year-old Viennese urologist, will be able to save Anna. Off they go -- Anna, dressed in a trench coat and black slip, and determined to have one last fling in each country they visit; Carl, wearing a suit coat over his striped pajamas and clutching a stuffed rabbit, ready to explore higher, more cultural pursuits. The Third Man, for his part (or parts), is kept busy playing cliched versions of the amorous Frenchman, the stalwart Dutchman who put his finger in the dike, the abusive Berliner in black leather and Dr. Todesrocheln, a Dr. Strangelove knockoff in a fright wig and blood-spattered laboratory coat. Reluctant to write yet another AIDS play, Ms. Vogel has brought a bizarre sense of fantasy to bear on a situation that, unfortunately, has become all too common. But even as she's letting her imagination run riot, a terrible remorse seems to have her in its grip. One impulse wars against the other. "The Baltimore Waltz" is too tortured to be whimsical, too wigged-out to be moving and just hermetic enough so that you may not care. The action takes place in a sterile hospital room that could also be an airport waiting lounge. (The lush travelogue music tells you when it is Paris or Vienna.) The director Anne Bogart -- never one to clear up a mystery -- has chosen to accent the play's eccentricities at the expense of any internal logic. The symbolism of Carl's stuffed rabbit alone is enough to keep you in a state of befuddlement. Depending on the scene, it would seem to represent contraband, a phallus, a badge of initiation, the innocence of childhood or a stuffed rabbit. At one point, Carl enthusiastically suggests showing the audience slides of the Rhineland. The lights are dimmed and the pictures turn out to be depressing views of Baltimore. No problem there. When shots of Disneyland creep into the mix, though, Carl is furious. As who wouldn't be? Anna is played by Cherry Jones, who projects some of the waifish vulnerability of the young Shirley MacLaine; Carl, by the bland Richard Thompson; and all the others by Joe Mantello, whose energy is more astounding than his versatility. They all appear to be deeply committed to Ms. Vogel's work. But then, "The Baltimore Waltz" would be most meaningful to those most directly involved. Isn't therapy?

1094-> TENNIS; Finally, Graf Gets To Start Her Year
Another new year, another new catastrophe for Steffi Graf. "At least, the year is finally starting for me," she said Friday, lounging in her hotel suite here after an evening of watching John Malkovich emote onstage. Tonight, she was to play Jana Novotna in a semifinal of the Virginia Slims of Chicago, her first tennis tournament of 1992. "I had such a bad start last year that I had no problems in motivating myself for this one," said the 22-year-old German, who began 1991 with a disappointing quarterfinal loss at the Australian Open to Novotna, then eventually lost the No. 1 world ranking to Monica Seles last March. Graf went so far in her pursuit of a fresh start that she dismissed her longtime mentor, Pavel Slozil, to start from scratch with a new coach, Heinz Gundhardt. First, the Flu "I was training hard, I was even lifting weights," she said. "I really meant for this year to start different." Graf, mistress of malady, began 1992 in typical fashion. Four days after a complete physical checkup that informed her she had finally achieved maximum resistance to the allergies and viral infections that seem to follow her around the globe like an unwanted personal aura, she came down with a maximum version of the flu on a flight from Germany to Australia, where her new year was scheduled to begin. By the time her flight landed in Perth, her ears were blocked and her equilibrium had vanished. After she played several Hopman Cup matches, the doctors ordered her to rest, and the rumor mill traced her illness to several dramatic sources. "They said I was sick because I was depressed and not happy with myself and tennis and felt so locked into my life," said Graf, who holds 10 Grand Slam singles titles. "No kidding, I'm not a person who jumps out of bed in the morning and says how great everything is, but the truth was, I got the flu from my brother. Simple." And as soon as she recovered from that, she came down with a harsh case of the German measles. She still can't figure out where she caught that. "I was feeling better, and then one night I felt a bump on the back of my head and I started getting red marks on my chest," she recalled. "But then there were eight bumps, so I knew I couldn't have banged my head that many times and not known it." Australian physicians, unsure of just what ailed her, sent Graf home to Germany, where her mother, meeting for her at the airport, almost didn't recognize her. "My hands and joints were swollen and everything hurt so much that I was walking like a very old lady," Graf said. "My mother took one look at me and said, 'What have you done to yourself now?' " Once the measles subsided, Graf got back to the business of starting her year with a new coach, new methods, and something of a new attitude. Sequestered in Florida with Gundhardt, she submitted to a practice regimen that at first was nearly as painful as her measles had been. Moving Around the Court "He has a different way of doing things from Pavel and me; he had me hitting from the corners for 15 minutes, and then hitting from the net for a half-hour straight," said Graf, who is continually bombarded by suggestions that she volley more often. The latest such adviser was a fan who spoke with her as she signed autographs during a Kraft Tour promotion here on Thursday. "Come to the net more," urged the fan, and received a classic Graf shrug in reply. "Come to Chicago more," he added. "That's better," she said. But Graf hasn't been able to dodge Gunthardt so easily. "He doesn't listen too much to what I say," she said. "If I say I can't do it, he tells me I can. I'm the kind of person who needs to be pushed, and sometimes Pavel was too close to me to push hard enough, I think. Heinz doesn't just push once, he keeps at me." The changes he has imparted to Graf's game are, so far, "small differences, but they are there," she said. "I'm using my hips more to bring power to the serve, and I'm hitting my forehand a little earlier," she added. As for her volley: "I know what the right thing to do is, but I don't always make myself do it." In Chicago, Graf has kept to herself, as usual, accompanied to Bulls games and the theater by her mother. The stiff shoulder that prohibited most volleys and overheads and forced a myriad of "tablets and injections just to make it through Wimbledon" last spring is gone, as is wrist strain that made it "hard to even hold the racquet" last fall as she claimed three straight tournament victories after her loss to Martina Navratilova in the United States Open semifinals. "At last, all is fine -- so far," Graf said. Navratilova Rallies The city that named a day in her honor only Wednesday seemed on the verge of retracting the welcome mat Saturday. Martina Navratilova's quest for a record 158th singles title as well as a record 12th title at the Virginia Slims of Chicago almost came to a premature halt in the semifinals this afternoon against Lori McNeil. But after being "just killed" in the opening set, Navratilova regained her composure, broke McNeil in the first game of the second set, and emerged with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory. "It was like she had a radar and knew what I was going to do even before I did," Navratilova said of McNeil's first-set assault. "But when I broke her to start the second, that broke the spell and I was back in the match." Navratilova, 35 years old, shares the record for most career victories, 157, with her retired contemporary, Chris Evert.

1095-> Software Case Countersuit
Computer Associates International Inc. said today that it had filed a lawsuit against the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, seeking $2 billion in damages for software fraud. The claim filed in Federal District Court here was a countersuit to a lawsuit filed by Electronic Data against Computer Associates earlier this month. Electronic Data dismissed the new suit as "frivolous." Computer Associates said Electronic Data was liable for software license fees and related charges and accused the company of "fraud; multiple, intentional breaches of software contracts, copyright infringements and misappropriation of trade secrets." On Jan. 9, Electronic Data sued Computer Associates, accusing it of breach of contract, misuse of a copyright and failing to provide software and maintenance required under licensing agreements. In a separate move in New York today, Computer Associates, based in Garden City, L.I., filed a suit against Electronic Data's parent, the General Motors Corporation, seeking $500 million for breach of two software contracts.

1096-> Puerto Rico Gripped by Its Watergate
Nearly 14 years after two young members of a radical pro-independence group were executed by police officers on a remote mountaintop, Puerto Ricans remain gripped by the case and riveted to its latest twist: televised hearings on whether high-level Puerto Rican and Federal Government officials helped plan the killings and cover them up. The case, known as Cerro Maravilla for the mountain where the killings occurred and already the subject of two books and a movie, is now the focus of hearings by the Judiciary Committee of the Puerto Rico Senate. An earlier Senate investigation of the killings exposed them as murders and led to the conviction of 10 police officers. A central question of the hearings, which resumed Tuesday after a holiday hiatus, is whether the Governor at the time of the incident, Carlos Romero Barcelo, and agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have had a role in the killings or the cover-up. Carlos Soto Arrivi, 18 years old, and Arnaldo Dario Rosado, 24, were shot on July 25, 1978, by police officers who said the two opened fire as they prepared to sabotage a television relay tower on Cerro Maravilla. But several of the officers, who were granted immunity from prosecution, testified in Senate hearings in 1983 and 1984 that the two youths were beaten up and killed after surrendering to as many as 20 officers who lay in wait. The officers had learned that the youths would be there from an informer who had infiltrated the group. Likened to Watergate The current inquiry is guided by the theory of Senate investigators that Cerro Maravilla was part of an effort by some local and Federal officials to fabricate terrorist acts and discredit the island's pro-independence movement in order to help advance statehood. The two men were killed not because of their importance as individuals, the investigators say, but because the Romero Barcelo administration wanted to make examples of them to show that it would deal harshly with terrorists. The evidence coming out of the current hearings indicates that both the Governor and the F.B.I.'s San Juan office knew of the plans for the police stakeout, but the testimony has yet to offer proof that either one knew that the youths would be killed. However, Samuel Dash, who was chief counsel to the United States Senate Watergate committee and is now a consultant to the Puerto Rico Senate, said he sees similarities between the two cases. "What I've seen here is the abuses of power and violations of democracy that I saw during Watergate," said Mr. Dash, a law professor at Georgetown University. But the motivations of the Senate have also come into question. The investigation has taken place under the auspices of the Popular Democratic Party, which advocates that Puerto Rico remain a commonwealth of the United States and which controls the governorship and both houses of the Legislature. The party has repeatedly raised Cerro Maravilla as an issue in electoral campaigns against the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which Mr. Romero Barcelo led at the time of the killings. "The Cerro Maravilla accusations have been the most infamous and vicious ever made against a politician in Puerto Rico," said the former Governor, who narrowly averted defeat in the 1980 elections but lost in 1984. "They don't have a shred of evidence because there is none." Investigations after the killings by local and Federal authorities, including the United States Justice Department's civil rights division, produced no criminal charges. But after the 1983-84 Senate hearings, the Justice Department reopened the case. Ten police officers were convicted on charges of perjuring themselves during Federal grand jury inquiries and were sentenced to prison terms of 6 to 30 years. Included in the group were the three officers who pulled the triggers, two of whom were also convicted of second-degree murder. F.B.I. Infiltrators The Senate President, Miguel A. Hernandez Agosto, said the current hearings seek to find out why the Federal investigations failed despite evidence that the police had lied about the case. According to testimony from Desiderio Cartagena, who was assistant police superintendent at the time of the killings, the F.B.I. office in San Juan and the police department were working jointly to investigate terrorist activities, and their task force had the two youths who were killed under surveillance. The F.B.I. refuses to discuss the case, but in an August 1990 letter to Mr. Hernandez Agosto, the bureau's Director, William S. Sessions, admitted that the bureau's San Juan office "erred in not pursuing an independent investigation" to determine the accuracy of the police account. He also said that after Cerro Maravilla, bureau procedures were revamped nationwide to insure a particularly thorough review of civil rights cases involving deaths. The evidence in the new hearings, which began last October, has gone beyond Cerro Maravilla to hint at a broad array of government activities designed to undermine the independence movement, a minority force on the island. One document introduced at the hearings, a May 1978 memo prepared for a White House aide for domestic affairs in the Carter Administration, culls internal F.B.I. papers from the 1960's to relate how the agency infiltrated legal pro-independence groups to influence their actions. Senator Fernando Martin, a member of the Judiciary Committee and vice-president of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said Cerro Maravilla is an example of the harrassment "independentistas" have suffered under both pro-statehood and pro-commonwealth administrations. "The independentistas have always known that the independentismo has been persecuted," he said. "The difference now is that the people of Puerto Rico also know it." Mr. Romero Barcelo, 59, now in private law practice, has refused to testify before the Judiciary Committee in closed session but said he would do so at the public hearings. He has denied any involvement in the case -- saying he believes the killings were not premeditated but "something that suddenly happened" -- and said the Senate investigation was a political ploy to discredit the New Progressive Party. He said he considers the case closed. The scandal has undoubtedly had severe political implications for the New Progressive Party, which has not held the governorship since 1984. The new party president, Dr. Pedro J. Rossello, acknowledged that Cerro Maravilla played a role in the losses but, citing the commonwealth party's loss on a recent referendum despite advertising that alluded to the case, said that its effect is now "almost null." A Father Watches The proceedings have provided plentiful political grist for a country where voter turnout surpasses 80 percent and most are long familiar with the case's cast of characters. Although many Puerto Ricans say they are fed up with the case, the legislative hearings propelled the government television station to the top of the ratings last year. Cable television channels in New York City began showing tapes of the hearings in full this month. But the proceedings are often seen through the prism of the view on statehood. Statehooders like Luis Baerga, 57, a postal worker from Carolina, remain skeptical of the investigation, and denounce the millions of dollars already spent on it. "They bring it up when elections are coming up," Mr. Baerga said. Among those watching is Pedro Juan Soto, father of one of the murdered youths. He refuses to comment on the hearings until they are completed, but he said he doubted the Senate could effectively take on the Federal Government if in fact Federal agents were party to the deaths or any cover-up. "I don't think this will lead to anything," he said. The hearings are expected to last for at least two more months, and could lead to more indictments. In addition, Mr. Dash said he has pressed for Congressional hearings on the case and is meeting with F.B.I. officials in Washington to apprise them of the Puerto Rican Senate investigation. Marco A. Rigau Jr., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that at the very least he expected the hearings to have a cleansing effect. "This is a process of purification," he said. "We have to get the truth out -- how people have been persecuted for political reasons and how the pro-independence ideology was criminalized -- so that something like that is never repeated."

1097-> Pop and Jazz in Review
Zizi Pozzi The Ballroom 253 West 28th Street Through Saturday Zizi Pozzi, the fifth performer to appear in the Ballroom's winter festival of Brazilian music, represents a sophisticated change of pace from the exuberant, samba-driven sounds that have characterized much of the series. A Sao Paulo native and popular Brazilian entertainer for more than a decade, Miss Pozzi is an asute connoisseur of quality songs, which she interprets with a riveting, mercurial intensity. The singer, who is appearing at the Ballroom through Saturday and at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts in the Bronx on Sunday evening, has a middle-sized, jazz-pop voice that at times recalls such American counterparts as the young Annie Ross and Rickie Lee Jones. Like them, she has a way of stretching out a phrase, then turning it emphatically on a ripe, jazzy vibrato. And at Tuesday's opening-night show, she also took several songs in and out of speechsong. Her expressive range is enormous. A typical Pozzi performance is a spontaneous emotional journey whose moods run from a piercing torchiness to a euphoric excitation. Underpinning the controlled volatility of her singing is an unbridled rhythmic freedom and a dramatic flair that treats each lyric as an intense, one-sided conversation. Sentiments are boldly accentuated by physical gyrations and powerful hand movements. Instead of a typical Brazilian samba ensemble, Miss Pozzi was accompanied by a trio whose percussionist, Marcos Suzano, infused a rich pop-chamber sound with rhythms that went well beyond the pulse of traditional samba. The striking arrangements were woven around Benjamin Taubkin's lush acoustic piano (discreetly augmented with electronic orchestration), and the impressive multi-instrumental playing of Lui Coimbra on guitar, charango and bowed cello and viola. The show reached a carefully prepared emotional peak with three ballads -- Gilberto Gil's "A Paz" and "Rebento," and Caetano Veloso's "Oracao ao Tempo" -- whose balance of sensuous rhythm and lush melody showed contemporary Brazilian songwriting at its zenith.

1098-> SPORTS PEOPLE: BASKETBALL; Worthy Out for Season
Seven-time All-Star JAMES WORTHY will be sidelined for the rest of the season, the Los Angeles Lakers announced yesterday after the 6-foot-9-inch forward underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. "The surgery has been completed, there was general wear and tear there, a little debris was cleaned up," said JOHN BLACK, the Lakers' public relations director. "He'll begin rehab soon and just try and get ready for next year." Worthy, 31 years old, averaged a team-leading 19.9 points in 54 games this season. The Lakers announced that they had signed veteran forward CLIFF ROBINSON, who most recently played for Rapid City (S.D.) in the Continental Basketball Association, to take Worthy's roster spot. (AP)

1101-> Dow Up 27.28 to End Week at 3,235.91
Stocks advanced yesterday in moderate trading after a smaller-than-expected rise in producer prices indicated that inflation was being restrained. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,235.91, up 27.28 points for the day and 14.31 for the week, while the broader market was stronger, too. The lower producer price numbers reduced the fear of inflation and diminished the chances that the Fed might tighten credit. 'Triple Witching Hour' Analysts at MMS International expect the market to trade in a narrow range into next week, ending with next Friday's "triple witching hour," when March options on individual stocks, the March Standard & Poor's 500 futures and options on the S.& P. futures all expire. Vincent Graziano, head of equity trading for Labe Associates, noted that since mid-February, the market remained confined to its tight trading range of 3,200 to 3,300 on the Dow. "While it looks for further signs of an economic recovery, the market will likely do what it has for the past month, and that is to move in no clear direction," Mr. Graziano said. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 177.9 million shares, down from 180.3 million on Thursday, with gaining issues ahead of losers, 987 to 675. The S.& P. 500 index rose 1.95 points, to 405.84, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 0.47 point, to 404.06. The Nasdaq composite was up 2.70, to 618.62, and the Russell 2,000 was up 0.77 point, to 206.76. The stock of Litton Industries jumped 1 1/8, to 97, after its board approved a 2-for-1 stock split. Pfizer, on the other hand, fell 1 1/4, to 71 3/8, after the Food and Drug Administration said it wanted the company to warn patients of the possible higher rate of fracture for some large heart valves. The F.D.A. said it might be necessary to replace the valves. Athena Neurosciences, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, rose 1, to 13 1/2. David Webber, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, initiated coverage of the stock with a "buy" rating. The analyst said the rating reflected his optimism about the company's research into Alzheimer's disease and its research into other areas of new drugs for neuro-degenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Lotus Development rose 1 7/8, to 38 5/8, after several analysts repeated buy ratings for the software company after a meeting with management that included a demonstration of several new products. T2 Medical, which operates infusion therapy centers where patients are given medicine and nutrients intravenously, rose 2 1/2, to 47 1/2. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette adjusted its recommendation on the stock to "very attractive" from "moderately attractive." VLSI Technology, rose 1 5/8, to 9 1/2. The company and Intel, unchanged at 64, are in talks on a technology sharing agreement, in which Intel would acquire a minority equity interest in VSLI.

1102-> The Art Market
Art in Order When the Philadelphia Museum of Art opened its doors 64 years ago, Fiske Kimball, the founding director, wanted to display the works of art in a chronological manner that he envisioned as a "walk through time." But while the Philadelphia originally intended to give the public an orderly historical look at 900 years of art, it has instead tended to group collections as they have been donated to the museum. All that is about to change. This summer, at a projected cost of $9.4 million, the museum will embark on its first reorganization and renovation. Over the next three years, all the European art -- which occupies nearly 50 percent of the gallery space and includes thousands of objects ranging from 830 European paintings to an entire French 18th-century Rococo salon -- will be placed in chronological order. According to a master plan devised by the Philadelphia architect Robert Venturi more than 10 years ago, about 70,000 square feet of space will be renovated and 10 new galleries added. Jeffrey D. Ryan, the project architect, who worked with Mr. Venturi on the master plan and now works on his own in Houston, will oversee the renovation and consult with Mr. Venturi. Lighting for 83 galleries will be redesigned, too, by George Sexton Associates of Washington. Restoration and conservation are also part of the museum's plans. Over 80 paintings and 150 decorative art objects will be cleaned and restored by a team of experts, some from the museum's staff and others who are being brought in for the project. In addition, new labels will be written for each work. And many objects that have never been on view are to be taken out of storage and put in the new galleries. "During the reinstallation, no more than 20 percent of the galleries will be closed at a time," said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's director. "We're determined to stay open and busy." So far, $4.3 million has been raised for the project. The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund has given the museum $2 million. A challenge grant given in two installments and totaling $1,275,000 has come from the National Endowment for the Humanities. In January, the Women's Committee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art pledged $500,000. Like all museums, the Philadelphia has had its day-to-day financial problems. "It's no surprise these days that it's hard to raise money for exhibitions," Ms. d'Harnoncourt said. "But that really has nothing to do with the reinstallation project." The director said she hoped to raise the remaining $5.1 million by June 1993 from foundations, corporations and private sources. It's not just money that has made this reinstallation plan possible. Because of a court ruling three years ago, the museum will for the first time be able to rethink the presentation of the Johnson Collection, which has been the linchpin of its holdings. The collection consists of 1,279 works, including outstanding Italian, Flemish, 17th-century Dutch and 19th-century paintings. It was bequeathed by John G. Johnson, a Philadelphia lawyer and art patron, to the City of Philadelphia. In 1933, it was placed in the museum under terms of an agreement that the collection be installed in a block of galleries separate from the rest of the museum's holdings. The Orphans Court in Philadelphia decided, however, that sections of the Johnson collection might be juxtaposed with other art. "It means that works can be organized in relation to their period," said Joseph Rishel, curator of the Johnson Collection and of European paintings. "For example, Mr. Johnson's 17th-century Dutch pictures can be next to the museum's Dutch works. In nearby galleries a period room and decorative arts from the same period will be displayed together. The motivation here is logic and clarity." When the first phase of the project is complete, the medieval galleries on the second floor will be transformed so that the early Italian and northern European paintings from the Johnson Collection will be installed in and around the museum's holdings of medieval and Renaissance architecture, sculpture and decorative arts. Switching Galleries More gallery hopping has been reported this week: Both Joel Shapiro and Peter Halley are leaving prominent SoHo galleries for operations with a more uptown image. While both artists declined to discuss their departures, many art-world experts say they believe that given the rocky economy, both moves reflect a desire to join more high-powered and high-profile operations. After 23 years with the Paula Cooper Gallery, Mr. Shapiro has decided to join Pace, which has galleries both in SoHo and on 57th Street. He is not the first artist to make such a move over the last few years. Robert Mangold and Donald Judd also left Ms. Cooper's gallery and are also now showing at Pace. Ms. Cooper did not return phone calls. But Douglas Baxter, Pace's director, confirmed the report. "We are thrilled to be working with Joel," he said. "Paula has represented him well, but after 23 years, the artist felt it was time his work was given another context." Mr. Halley is leaving the Sonnabend Gallery and will be showing instead at Gagosian, which also has Madison Avenue and SoHo galleries. "It's entirely true that Peter is leaving us," said Antonio Homem, the director at Sonnabend. "I think it's quite a curious move. During the late 80's, we were careful to protect our artists from the negative effects of the secondary market and now Peter is joining Gagosian, who got where he is by dealing in secondary art." Larry Gagosian says that market, the trade in second sales of contemporary art, is one of his gallery's strengths. "It benefits the artist," he said. "When someone has a painting to sell, my gallery is better positioned to place it." Mr. Gagosian said he was planning an exhibition of Mr. Halley's work at his new Wooster Street gallery. "It will be the first time we'll show paintings in that space," Mr. Gagosian said. "I don't think galleries steal artists," Mr. Gagosian added. "Over time artists feel they've exhausted a relationship and then it's time for them to move on." Wright Sale Three perforated cypress panels, a dome skylight, countless light fixtures, a door and window sashes, as well as an array of items ranging from copper trim strips to a pot rack -- all parts of the Usonian exhibition house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright -- will be auctioned by Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago from March 15 to 17. In 1953, the Usonian house (a Wright term based on the initials U.S.) was built where the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is now on Fifth Avenue as part of an exhibition of 60 years of Wright's work; it was dismantled a year later. The proceeds from the Chicago auction will be donated to the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. "Fragments of the house have been floating around for nearly 40 years," said Carla Lind, executive director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. "While we're in the business of saving houses, we could never re-create the Usonian house from what is left. And anyway, the house was not meant to be lived in." These house parts were thought to have been destroyed. But in 1984, they were discovered by David Henken, a contractor and former Wright apprentice who erected the house. He stored most of the pieces in a storeroom in his own Pleasantville, N.Y., home. When they were discovered, Mr. Henken donated them to Channel 13 for its annual auction. Thomas Monaghan of Domino's Pizza bought the fragments at the auction. He then donated them to the conservancy. Six years before he designed the Guggenheim building, Wright erected the two-bedroom Usonian house, which was designed to illustrate the architect's theories about affordable small residences. At the time, Wright estimated the design could be duplicated in the New York area for $35,000. Now the dome skylight once used over the kitchen work area is expected to fetch $400 and the perforated panels have a presale estimate of $3,000 each. "The point of the auction," Ms. Lind said, "is to raise money to benefit other Wright buildings."

1103-> Sihanouk Says Violence Threatens Peace
A day after the shooting of a leading dissident, Prince Norodom Sihanouk warned today that political violence was threatening to disrupt Cambodia's fragile quest for peace. The dissident, Uong Phan, who is expected to survive, was wounded on Tuesday by unidentified gunmen riding in a military-style jeep. The attack came less than a week after the assassination of Tae Bun Long, an official for religious affairs who had spoken out against Government corruption. "We must avoid at all costs killing and acts of violence," said Prince Sihanouk, who heads an interim National Reconciliation Council made up of the four sides in Cambodia's civil war. "Don't take revenge. This is now a time of peace." In October, the Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and three guerrilla factions signed a peace plan formally ending 13 years of civil war. Some foreign diplomats and Cambodian Government officials have speculated that a hard-line faction within the Interior Ministry and its security apparatus is responsible for the recent political violence. But Prime Minister Hun Sen attributed the violence to opposition groups that he asserted were trying to destroy the peace plan and topple his Government.

1104-> RECORD BRIEFS
Sibelius: Symphony No. 1, 'Karelia Suite,' 'Finlandia' Oslo Philharmonic conducted by Mariss Jansons. EMI Classics CDC 54273; CD. What ever happened to sweep in music-making? It may be unfair to pick on Mariss Jansons for lacking a quality that eludes nearly every conductor of his generation. But again and again one is struck here by impressive details that just don't add up by the final note. And the Oslo Philharmonic's lean sonority would be more appropriate to Sibelius's later works. For a bracing rendering of the young composer's torrential Tchaikovskian passion, listen to the broad, succulent sweep (and the legato, another seemingly extinct orchestral quality) of the early-60's First Symphony by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. If you can't wait for Sony to issue the Ormandy on CD, Okko Kamu (Deutsche Grammophon 429 526; also cassette) offers a good stopgap.

1105-> Review/Fashion; The Avant-Garde Calls the Hippest Tune
To look like a hip young Parisian next fall, you'll want to wear a sleek black leather jacket over a transparent black T-shirt and a long tight black skirt. That's what many of the avant-garde French designers have suggested. The fashion groupies attending their shows in the past two weeks have already adopted at least parts of the uniform. Their outfits are finished off with heavy black shoes or boots and, this being France, a cigarette. For dressing up at night, the idea is to pour yourself into a dress that fits like an Ace bandage. That's the Azzedine Alaia school of design. He won't be showing his fall collection until July, but one of the newest members of that school is Herve Leger, who has been in business about two years, after training at Lanvin. He has turned his back on the Lanvin classics and gone all out for second-skin clothes that celebrate a woman's curves. His show on Wednesday attracted much of the world's top foreign press and retailers. Silk Body Bandages Mr. Leger bandages the body with sewn-together strips of stretch silk or viscose woven together with Spandex, sometimes all in one color and sometimes with contrasting bands. The dresses are variations on this theme, made different by the directions of the strips and the bareness of the necklines. These clothes are not for shrinking violets. Neither are all the black leather garments of other designers. Last year's motorcycle jacket has been replaced by a slim long-lined leather jacket at nearly every fashion show from Chanel to Colonna. Jean Colonna is the darling of those members of the bistro-and-club set who can't afford real leather. He uses leatherlike black vinyl for snug-fitting jackets, skirts, pants and jump suits. They looked right at home modeled in a smoke-filled, dimly lighted theater in Pigalle with Edith Piaf on the soundtrack. Martine Sitbon, a great favorite with the French, designs two collections, one under her own name and one for Chloe. Both are rather theatrical, but in different ways. The Chloe models were slickly made up like Hollywood movie stars of the 1940's, with bright red lipstick and softly waved shoulder-skimming hair. They wore fur scarves with classic daytime suits for the lunching ladies. They went glamorous for evening with pouffed dresses that were short in front and long in back, and with a series of black dresses loaded with enough jet beads, ruffles, lace and fringe to qualify for the Ziegfeld Follies. Transvestites dolled up like movie stars of yore enlivened the audience at Ms. Sitbon's eponymous collection. The models in the show wore flamboyantly colored haystack wigs or bravura hats with giant plumes. Either the skirt or the top of the dress was often transparent, sometimes given a little modesty by strips of solid fabric or by a massive bib of jewels. She liked combining black leather jackets with sheer long skirts, and added bustle-like layers of ruffles to the backs of evening dresses. You'd never mistake her clothes for anything but French. Fluttering Layers Maurizio Galante, an Italian who has shown in Paris for the last three seasons, has a more romantic, feminine approach to fashion, like his compatriot, Romeo Gigli, who attended the Galante show. His cocoons and cape coats have collars that are elongated, or folded in intricate ways. Some have sleeves outlined in points that resemble sharks' teeth or dinosaurs' backs. His prettiest styles are evening dresses and coats of multiple layers of organza or taffeta that flutter like flower petals in the breeze. He does these in soft wine tones that range from rose to burgundy. Oscar de la Renta isn't the only American showing a collection here. Isabel Toledo had an intimate presentation one morning last week in a cafe near the Bastille. Models with exaggeratedly arched brows over black-rimmed eye sockets like the women in illustrations by her husband, Ruben, an artist, covered the lower part of their faces with veiling. They paraded long dresses with flowing skirts in black or red jersey. Maybe Ms. Toledo's example will give other young Americans the courage to make the trans-Atlantic hop.

1106-> Susan Walsh To Wed in May
Dr. and Mrs. Robert J. Walsh of White Plains have announced the engagement of their daughter, Dr. Susan Maria Walsh, to Patrick Francis McCarthy, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Francis D. McCarthy of Island Park, L.I. A May wedding is planned. Dr. Walsh, 30 years old, is an attending pediatrician at Albert Einstein Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated from New York University, from which she also received her medical degree. Her father is an attending obstetrician and gynecologist at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York. Her mother, Dr. Wanda S. Walsh, is an associate professor of pediatrics at N.Y.U.. Mr. McCarthy, 29, graduated from St. John's University, and is a computer salesman in New York for International Business Machines Corporation. Both his parents also work for I.B.M. in New York. His father is a commission analyst and his mother is a secretary.

1107-> Study Faults No-Bid Contracts
Despite recent changes in New York City's contracting policies that were intended to increase competition, nearly 41 percent of the city's $4.4 billion in contracts were awarded without competitive bidding in the fiscal year that ended last June, according to a study released by the City Comptroller yesterday. The report found no significant improvement in the level of competition for city contracts between the 1990 and 1991 fiscal years. The study is based on an examination of all city contracts worth more than $10,000 for goods and services and more than $15,000 for construction. "This report shows that there is much room for improvement in city procurement," the Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, said in a statement. "Given the city's fiscal state, it must make major efforts to get the lowest price and best quality for goods and services through competitive processes." New Guidelines The city has changed its purchasing rules in the last two years, starting with the new City Charter that created a Procurement Policy Board that set new contracting guidelines intended to increase competition. Louis Haber, a spokesman for the Comptroller, said that those changes "apparently have not gone far enough" and that the city needed to consider additional measures to insure greater competition. "Competition saves the taxpayers money and results in higher-quality services," Mr. Haber said. John Beckman, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said the administration agreed with the Comptroller that there was room for improvement in the procurement process. "That's reflective in the efforts we've been making in developing and implementing Procurement Policy Board procedures and other contracting improvements," he said. The report found that $2.55 billion worth of contracts, or 59 percent of the total awarded, were bid competively, either thorugh sealed bids, requests for proposals, or a prequalified bidders list. The remaining 41 percent of the contracts were awarded through renewals, negotiated acquisitions, sole-source provisions, emergency response, legal mandate, lease negotiation or intergovernmental procurement.

1108-> GOLF; Who'll Get a Last Shot at the Masters?
The Masters, which always promises the first truly defining moments of the golf year, is being greeted with even more anticipation than usual as Thursday's opening round approaches. Will the 56th edition of the tournament provide the seemingly overdue occasion for either Fred Couples or Jose Maria Olazabal to win his first major championship? Or will Nick Faldo or Seve Ballesteros return to re-establish himself as the best at the biggest moments? Will an American win for the first time since 1987? And how many times will John Daly reach one of Augusta National's short par-5's with a drive and a wedge? With so many possibilities in the air, there seems only one sure thing: No matter who's the winner, it's a very good bet that this year's Masters will be decided by one stroke. Sarazen Started It Ever since Gene Sarazen holed a 220-yard 4-wood shot for a double-eagle at the 15th to eventually send the 1935 Masters into the tournament's first playoff, Augusta National has been producing large 11th-hour stroke swings that lock two or more players in thrilling battles to the bitter end. That has been particularly true in recent years. Three of the last six Masters have ended in playoffs, while the other three were decided in regulation by one shot. In the 1980's, the only runaways were produced by Ballesteros, who won the 1980 and 1983 Masters by four shots each. It has become largely accurate to say that the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday, a stretch of holes where a hot golfer can make up a lot of shots in a hurry. Both Gary Player in 1978 and Jack Nicklaus in 1986 shot closing 30's on the final nine to pass several players and win by a stroke. In professional golf in general, bunched fields and close finishes are usually more prevalent when birdies are flying. But at Augusta National, it is more than just birdie binges that lead to close finishes. Rather, it is the nearly equal possibility for very small or very large numbers that several of the finishing holes, particularly the watery par 5's and par 3's, provide. Augusta National's strategic "risk-reward" design allows trailers to gamble to bolt back into contention, while at the same time allowing leaders to play safe for pars. While many pursuers will fail and actually fall farther back, often one or more of the challengers gets back into the thick with improbable successes. At the 1990 Masters, Raymond Floyd led by four shots over Faldo after making a birdie on the 12th hole on the final day. On the relatively short but dangerous par-5 13th and 15th holes, Floyd logically chose to lay up in two to insure he made no worse than pars. But ahead, Faldo had boldly reached both greens with long second shots and made birdies. The Englishman also took dead aim at a precariously placed pin on the par-3 16th and holed a difficult putt for another birdie. When Floyd made his only real mistake of the day, a three-putt for a bogey at the 17th, he fell into a playoff that Faldo won. Two 'Almosts' The kind of ebb and flow that is possible at the Masters was illustrated last year by the cases of Olazabal and Tom Watson, who finished one and two shots back of the winner, Ian Woosnam. Olazabal was leading on Saturday when he made a horrendous quadruple-bogey 7 on the par-3 sixth hole, but he got the strokes back with four birdies on the back nine. Then on Sunday, the young Spaniard was leading again when he made three bogeys in a row beginning at the par-5 eighth hole. But he again recovered, this time with birdies at the 13th, 14th and 15th to pull into a tie, until he was finally undone by a bogey on the 18th. Watson's back nine of a final-round 73 was the proverbial roller coaster. He birdied the difficult 10th, bogeyed the 11th, double-bogeyed the 12th, eagled the 13th, then dramatically eagled the 15th to tie for the lead. He remained tied until he double-bogeyed the 18th for a fitful par 36. "That's Augusta," said a rueful Watson. "Anything can happen on that back nine." As it happens, anything almost always includes the closest possible finish.

1110-> Ford Plans $3 Billion Outlay To Raise Production Levels
The Ford Motor Company announced a $3 billion investment in new machinery and plant space today, some of which will be used to build a new mini-van in late 1993. When auto sales were brisk in the 1980's, Ford was tightly constrained by too little production capacity, and today's announcement is a step to correct that problem. The No. 2 auto maker's actions will affect a number of plants in the United States and Canada and should result in 1,300 new jobs at Ford's truck plant in Louisville, Ky., a spokesman said. Before the recession, Ford's hourly employees typically worked a great deal of overtime to meet demand for vehicles. Ford's investment is a bullish one that anticipates a rebound in vehicle sales over the next few years, particularly in the fast-selling light-truck segment, which includes mini-vans, utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The new van, to be built at an existing Ford plant in Oakville, Ontario, will be Ford's third mini-van model, positioning the auto maker to be far more competitive with the Chrysler Corporation, which created the mini-van and still dominates that market. Ford now sells the rear-wheel-drive Aerostar model, and later this year it will introduce the Mercury Villager, which it developed with the Nissan Motor Company. Ford said it might be able to build up to 300,000 new mini-vans, which could make a substantial impact in an American market that now numbers about a million sales a year. Chrysler sells about half of all mini-vans; the General Motors Corporation sells about one-fifth, and Ford and import models account for the rest. Alex Trotman, executive vice president of North American operations, said he was announcing the programs well in advance of production in late 1993 because of the long lead times necessary to finish development work and the need to discuss the programs with two unions, the United Automobile Workers and the Canadian Automobile Workers. The Oakville plant, which currently builds the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz cars, will shut down for retooling in October. Ford will spend $900 million on renovation there, in addition to $400 million already spent on a new paint shop. But Ford must also drop one work shift at an adjacent truck plant in Oakville. Seven hundred workers will be transferred from the truck plant to the new mini-van plant, and another 400 workers will eventually be hired as well, the company said. Ford will also spend $650 million to expand and renovate its Louisville plant. It will consolidate there the production of larger F-Series pickups -- those with a loaded capacity of more than 8,500 pounds. Ford now builds heavier-duty F-Series pickups at other plants. The Louisville plant will continue to build medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Changes at Engine Plant Finally, Ford said it would spend close to $1 billion to renovate and retool its Windsor, Ontario, engine plant for a new family of truck engines, beginning in 1995. The plant now builds 5.8-liter and 7.5-liter V-8 engines. Ford needs new engines, in part to meet stricter fuel-efficiency, clean air and other regulatory requirements. About 700 Ford workers are currently laid off in Windsor. Mr. Trotman said approval of the investments was subject to new labor agreements at the affected plants, in addition to "favorable government rulings and final internal approvals."

1111-> Leaving Robust Business in Hands of Tested Managers
Sam Walton, the founder and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., had assembled and tested a respected management team that will carry on at the nation's largest retailer. Mr. Walton died yesterday at age 74. And with largely untapped territories in the West and Northeast for expanding its discount retailing empire, Wal-Mart has excellent prospects for continuing to grow, analysts and industry consultants said. Yet, Mr. Walton's death will leave an inspirational void in the company's senior ranks. He was a dynamic, tough-minded leader who enthralled employees with a genuine embrace of America's small-town life. Wal-Mart's sales this year will probably exceed $55 billion, said Walter F. Loeb, a retailing consultant. The company, which has two stores in Mexico City, has its eyes on a leap into Europe by 1995 that should keep sales and earnings rising, Mr. Loeb said. Wal-Mart's stated goal is to reach $100 billion in sales within the decade. The challenge to Wal-Mart's management will be to re-create Mr. Walton's motivational powers in fresh ways, said Philip Evans, a vice president with the Boston Consulting Group. He analyzed Wal-Mart's operations in the last year and wrote about them, along with two colleagues, in the current issue of The Harvard Business Review. Mr. Walton hand-picked senior executives who were more expert than he in areas like finance, systems and logistics, Mr. Evans said. Because Mr. Walton "embedded the skills that he had" throughout the organization, Wal-Mart is not likely to falter soon, Mr. Evans added. President in Post for Eight Years David D. Glass, 56, succeeded Mr. Walton as chief executive in 1988 and has been president for eight years. A native of the Ozarks like Mr. Walton, but a less exuberant personality, he has acquired trucking companies and smaller retailers and spent heavily on modern technology and other components to support the company's far-flung merchandising system. One of three vice chairmen and Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, Donald D. Soderquist, 58, has a voluble style with much of Mr. Walton's spark in front of a crowd. The company will probably look to him to serve as chief motivator. "The company's structure is such that they will continue to operate as in the past," Mr. Loeb said. "Sam very much turned things over to the people he trusted. He preferred being in the stores as long as he could."

A Long Island woman has been declared brain-dead after her crack-addicted husband beat her on the head with a frying pan, the police said. Benjamin Browne, 36 years old, was arrested in Queens Saturday night by New York City police after a 15-mile car chase, said Detective Sgt. Daniel Severin of the Nassau County police. New York City police turned Mr. Browne over to Nassau County authorities, who charged him with second-degree attempted murder, Sergeant Severin said. The victim, Nasreen Muhammed, 51, had been married to Mr. Browne for about a year when she tried to kick him out of their home on March 29, Sergeant Severin said. Mr. Browne reportedly attacked her, then fled, the sergeant added.

1116-> Gerald L. Klerman, 63, an Expert On Depression and Schizophrenia
Dr. Gerald L. Klerman, a psychiatrist and expert on depression who was a former chief of the Federal mental health agency, died on Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan. He died of kidney disease, his family said. Dr. Klerman was an educator, researcher, clinician, author and administrator. He specialized in depression, schizophrenia and panic and other anxiety disorders. He was appointed head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration by President Jimmy Carter, holding the post from 1977 through 1980. Conducted Study on Depression In his work on depression, he studied the effectiveness of combining drug treatment and psychotherapy, developed interpersonal psychotherapy and conducted a study that found depression increasing among people born since 1935 and also occurring at earlier ages. He was the author of numerous articles and several books. Dr. Klerman was born in New York City and graduated from Cornell University and New York University's medical school. He did his residency at Harvard and worked two years as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health. From 1966 to 1970 he was a professor at Yale and also director of its mental health center. He moved to Harvard where he taught at the medical school and was the director of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital and director of the Eric Lindemann Mental Health Center. After his Federal service, he was a professor of psychiatry and vice chairman of research at Cornell Medical College and New York Hospital and a psychiatrist at the affiliated Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic. His marriage to Lorraine Vogel ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife of seven years and research collaborator, Dr. Myrna Milgram Weissman; two sons, Jacob of Los Angeles and Daniel of Chicago; two daughters, Elizabeth of Boston and Karen of Philadelphia; a sister, Jean Klerman of Fairbanks, N.J.; three stepdaughters, Susan Weissman of Chicago, Judith Weissman of Manhattan and Sharon Weissman of Boston; a stepson, Jonathan Weissman of Boston; three grandchildren, and one stepgrandchild.

1117-> Fall Collections End On a Brighter Note
The fall fashion shows opened in Milan, Italy, last month on a lugubrious note with mournful colors, longer skirts and a feeling that the slow economy through most of the world had deflected interest in new clothes. By the time the last designers had introduced their collections in New York on Friday, the mood and the perception had changed. Having experimented with longer clothes for a year, designers had figured out how to do them successfully. Long, fitted clothes covering the body to the ankles looked as sexy as short ones that bared all. Equally important was the spirit of conciliation in the air as most designers -- Geoffrey Beene was the notable exception with his avoidance of anything that hid the knees -- continued to introduce knee-baring skirts alongside their newer long styles. Nobody wanted to be considered a fashion dictator. Everyone seemed to respect women's reluctance to call their existing wardrobe obsolete. Trousers Are Back Uncertainty over hemlines brought trousers back to the fashion foreground as designers with long memories, or access to fashion publications of the period, recalled the events of 1970. That's when hemlines dropped from thigh to calf and women avoided the issue by taking to pants en masse. They stayed with them for a decade. Even Beene, who refused to lengthen his daytime clothes this time around because he felt longer skirts were too restrictive and not modern, joined the pants enthusiasts. His emphasis was on the jump suit, which formed a backdrop for such wraps as a raincoat reduced to a minimum of seams and a long shaped scarf that caught the air to billow into intriguing patterns. The Beene collection continues to astonish viewers because of the designer's adventurous spirit and imagination. Over the years he has acquired the technique to make his novel ideas work. Admirers tell him he should show his clothes in Paris to elevate the standing of American design. He is beginning to give the subject some thought. In quite another vein, Ralph Lauren rattled the rafters with his special take on the men's-wear look for women. He re-created the sexiness of the Marlene Dietrich-Greta Garbo era of the 1930's when the world's most glamorous women wore men's suits. He combined these tailored suits with light memories of the turn-of-the-century Edwardian dandy represented by bowler hats, watch fobs, furled umbrellas and narrow trousers. After seasons of heightened femininity in clothes, this shift to a men's-wear sensibility is an eye-opener. Calvin Klein's layered approach to sportswear is casual and relaxed. Nothing looks constricted in his clothes. Vests are an integral part of the layering and sometimes a knitted jacket slips over the regular jacket. Donna Karan seems to have blanketed the world with her collections, which now include "intimates" (bras, lingerie and lounge wear), men's clothes, weekend wear and her signature collection. A long, lean look is dominant, with suit jackets fitted as snugly as sweaters over skinny skirts. Oscar de la Renta, who helped spur the fad for plaid last year, now put his money on checks. Enlarged houndstooth checked woolens are used for suits, coats, even dresses. The designer, who introduced his collection in Paris last month, showed it in New York last week. In both places, checks received thumbs up. The Animal Motif Traditional clothes have their place for the season, especially for evening. Arnold Scaasi offered a choice in dress lengths for day, but for gala evenings emphasized floor-length styles with big bouffant skirts -- styles women need for special events, he said. Among them were graphic dramatic zebra prints in black and white stripes, part of the animal patterns that permeate fashion. The season's shows also included a new emphasis on leather fashions (coats, jackets, skirts), the inclusion of vests as part of layering in formal and casual daytime outfits, and chalk stripes on navy or gray wool suits and dresses. Knitted clothes also received plenty of attention from designers including Bill Blass, who revitalized the twin sweater set. He gave the cardigan curved edges repeating the lines of several jackets and showed the newly shaped set with big satin skirts. What started out as a downer ended on a lively note as designers in New York showed clothes that looked fresh without being manic. Dark colors provided a sensible undertone; the fitted shapes may give women a desire to try something new.

1118-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Victory for Hoyas, Sadness for Thompson
On a day that offered him a mixture of triumph and sadness, John Thompson watched his Georgetown Hoyas earn a fourth consecutive berth in the Big East tournament semifinals with a 77-64 victory over Miami at Madison Square Garden last night. Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points and blocked 2 shots and Joey Brown added 14 points and grabbed a game-high 7 rebounds for Georgetown, which will play St. John's at 4 p.m. today. The victory over the Hurricanes came on a day that marked the 20th anniversary of Thompson's tenure as Georgetown's head coach. But instead of being filled with upbeat emotions, Thompson, who had been named the Big East coach of the year on Thursday, said he had experienced the saddest time of his career hours earlier. "The most frustrating moment of my whole 20-year career occurred at 4:30 this afternoon when Charles Smith called me from the penitentiary in my hotel room to talk to me," Thompson said. "I broke down crying like a little baby. It was the most frustrating experience that I've had in my whole life in coaching." Smith's Prison Sentence Earlier this week, Smith, who played for Georgetown from 1985 to 1989 and was the most valuable player of the 1989 Big East tournament, a member of the 1988 Olympic team and a former Boston Celtic, was convicted of vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident in the hit-and-run deaths of two Boston University students. On Thursday, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. The news surrounding Smith put a damper on the Georgetown victory in the second day of the conference tournament. The Hoyas, who trailed most of the first half, were behind by 34-33 at intermission. But Georgetown outscored Miami, 8-2, to begin the second half and took a 41-36 lead on a 3-point shot by Brown. The Hurricanes managed to stay close until Jerome Scott was called for an intentional foul with 14:30 left, and the Hoyas leading, 47-42. Miami's Run Ends Georgetown converted the two technical foul shots and Irvin Church hit a 3-pointer to give Georgetown a 52-42 lead with 13:35 left. Miami cut the lead to 65-60 with 5:33 left to play, but Georgetown scored 4 consecutive points to put the game away. The defeat represented the end of a short but impressive run in the Big East tournament for Miami. On Thursday, the Hurricanes, who won only one conference game this season, their first in the Big East, upset Pittsburgh, 83-71. "Miami reminds me of a train that is in the building and building up steam leaving the station," Thompson said. "What amazes me about them is that they have been beaten by people and still competed so hard in every game. They never say die."

1120-> Experts Dismiss Flood Threat at Proposed Nuclear Dump
A SCIENTIFIC clash over a proposed nuclear dump in Nevada intensified yesterday with the public release of two conflicting reports. After more than two years of study, a 17-member panel of the National Research Council released a report that dismissed the idea that an earthquake might drive ground water upward to flood a proposed nuclear dump inside Yucca Mountain, Nev. The dump, for the nation's most highly radioactive wastes, is under study by the United States Department of Energy. But the author of the flooding theory, Jerry S. Szymanski, a dissident Energy Department geologist on the Yucca Mountain project, made public a report to advance his claims of past water upwellings, which he says endanger the nuclear dump. His report was prefaced by a letter of support from a new ally, another Energy Department scientist at work on the Yucca Mountain project. Both reports were made public at a scientific meeting in Las Vegas. While many experts had expected the long-awaited report of the National Research Council to lay the flooding dispute to rest, new evidence and adherents seem likely to keep it alive. The Evidence: Calcium Deposits Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert, is the nation's only proposed site for storing highly radioactive nuclear waste, which consists of spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors and other radioactive debris. The depot, which would open early next century at a cost of up to $15 billion, is considered vital for the political viability of nuclear power. The repository would keep nuclear wastes isolated for 10,000 years, until radioactive decay has reduced their danger. Mr. Szymanski has argued that an earthquake could cause ground water deep under Yucca Mountain to rush upward and flood a waste facility, triggering calamity. His main evidence is cream-colored calcium deposits that dot the mountain, put there, he says, by mineral-laden water that in the geologically recent past -- 10,000 to 100,000 years ago -- welled up and turned the desolate site into an oasis. But other experts, mainly with the United States Geological Survey, hold that the deposits are the result of rainwater deposits from a time when Nevada was wetter. The National Research Council, at the request of the Energy Department, began studying the flooding thesis in early 1990 and yesterday came out strongly against it. "None of the evidence cited as proof of ground-water upwelling in and around Yucca Mountain can be reasonably attributed to that process," C. Barry Raleigh of the University of Hawaii, chairman of the panel, said in a statement. Features claimed to be linked to upwelling, he said, were actually from old volcanic eruptions or from chemicals and wind-blown dust deposited by evaporating rainwater, as other critics of the theory have suggested. The panel said an earthquake, at worst, might raise the water table 150 feet, and that geologic evidence suggested ground water has never risen to the level of the proposed dump. Dissident Is Endorsed Dismissing his critics, Mr. Szymanski in his new report says the theory is stronger than ever, pointing to detailed analyses of the minerals and rare-earth elements that have been found to lace Yucca Mountain, including gold, platinum and uranium. The mountain itself is mostly made of volcanic ash. These minerals, Mr. Szymanski contends, are often associated with calcium deposits and were deposited by the upwelling of warm waters. The flooding of a nuclear waste dump is quite possible, Mr. Szymanski warned in his report. The new report by Mr. Szymanski received a strong endorsement from Donald E. Livingston, a geochemist with the Yucca Mountain project. In a preface to the report, written on Energy Department letterhead, Dr. Livingston said he had seen no evidence that the mineralization of the mountain had occurred through rainfall deposits or other "benign" processes. In conclusion, he called Mr. Szymanski's flooding arguments "sound and compelling." Mr. Szymanski said late last year he would resign from his Energy Department post because, he says, "irresponsible science" is being practiced by the proponents of the waste dump. His resignation is expected to be effective next month. Carl P. Gertz, head of the Yucca Mountain project, said yesterday in an interview that he felt the vast majority of scientists who have studied the flooding issue have rejected it and that his team would therefore cut back on the idea's scrutiny.

1121-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Brown Basking In His New Role As a Wild Card
It was not the kind of question likely to be asked of other Presidential candidates. "Do you still sleep on the floor?" the young voter asked Edmund G. Brown Jr. "I don't sleep anymore," the former Governor of California replied. Indeed, there has been scant chance for Mr. Brown to rest since his surprise victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary in Colorado. "We have moved from the media black hole of non-existence to the status of wild card," Mr. Brown said Wednesday with the relish of a man who has survived to laugh back at his detractors. In this season of voter discontent, the Brown campaign has made a virtue of eccentricity. 'Kind of Strange' "Some people think I act kind of strange," Mr. Brown told a rally at the University of Texas here today. He recounted that during the 1970's he had declined to live in the governor's mansion, but instead had rented an apartment. (He was said to prefer sleeping on the floor.) His remarks brought roars of approval from the hundreds of young people who had crowded on the sun-dappled campus mall. In the political world according to Mr. Brown, there are few gray areas. His full-throated oratory, a mix of 60's radical and old-fashioned populist, paints a moral battle between salt-of-the-earth voters and the greedy. The only way the Democratic Party can win, he asserts, is to attract the legions of ignored and disgusted voters. 'Like You and Me' In campaign stops before college students, striking workers and heavily Hispanic audiences, Mr. Brown has cast himself as the champion of "ordinary people like you and me," as opposed to the "multimillionaries who control the other candidates. "Stand up and take back your country," Mr. Brown exhorted strikers at a casino in Las Vegas Wednesday. "You know you're being ripped off, lied to, shined on," he told a political gathering Wednesday in El Paso. At the heavily Hispanic gathering, Mr. Brown wore a button in support of the farmworkers' union. Mr. Brown has gained the endorsement of Cesar Chavez, the leader of the union. The Unlikely Outsider In many ways, Mr. Brown, a former Governor and son of a Governor, seems an unlikely outsider. He has himself raised millions of dollars as head of the California Democratic Party. And he acknowledges that the populist image might seem an odd fit "for someone who studied Greek and Latin." It was precisely what he witnessed, he says, that taught him how "disgusting" politics had become. So his campaign takes a minimalist approach, refusing donations of more than $100. He usually flies on commercial airlines, but after his victory in Colorado a friend lent the use of a small jet. 'I Believe in Him' After his appearance Wednesday in El Paso, people approached Mr. Brown and handed him personal checks. "I believe in him," said Penelope Cochran, a 69-year-old retired legal assistant, who wrote out a check. The Brown campaign has raised more than $1 million, much of it in pledges through the toll-free number. But it amounts to a pittance compared to the treasuries of other campaigns. With its small crew of volunteers, the campaign does not plan far ahead. It tentatively planned to campaign in Mississippi Friday with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. Mr. Brown has said he would consider tapping Mr. Jackson as his Vice-Presidential candidate. In his appearance at El Paso, Mr. Brown joked about his offbeat image. "Governor Moonbeam -- have you ever heard that?" he asked the crowd. The Moonbeam reference came from the Chicago newspaper columnist Mike Royko during the 1970's. In recent months, Mr. Royko, who has written favorably of Mr. Brown's campaign, has taken back the nickname. "And I once went to Africa with Linda Ronstadt," Mr. Brown said, adding that the trip was publicized in Newsweek. "When I do something, it gets into classy magazines."

1123-> COMPANY NEWS; Ames Bankruptcy Hearing Delayed
Bankruptcy Judge James A. Goodman postponed a hearing on Ames Department Stores' reorganization plan, which had been scheduled for Monday, in order to give the company and its creditors more time to reach a settlement, said a lawyer representing the company. The judge has not rescheduled the hearing, said Alecia Marinelli, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, whose firm is representing Ames. Last week the judge extended the period in which Ames may file a reorganization plan to April 27. After that date, any party may submit a plan to reorganize the Rocky Hill, Conn., retailer. Ames, which filed for bankruptcy in April 1990, submitted a reorganization plan with the court earlier this year. Creditors are disputing the plan because it calls for the company to merge its subsidiaries with the parent company in a "substantive consolidation." Under this plan, creditors would be paid from one pool of assets.

1126-> Judge Public Servants On Individual Merits
To the Editor: Does The New York Times agree with the Mayor of the City of New York and all responsible Americans who believe that individuals should be judged on their merits and not by the accident of ethnicity, race, sex -- or birth? If so, why would The Times rush to publish hearsay accusing a senile old man of possible mob connections years ago, suggesting that it is relevant because his daughter is a public servant ("Correction Head's Father Tied to Mafia," news article, April 21)? Indeed, his daughter is one of our finest public servants, judged -- as she should be -- on the merits of her own performance. What motivated The Times -- which has recently condemned our tabloids for distasteful sensationalism -- to depart so significantly from journalism's highest and best traditions? For the good of the community, I hope that it was an oversight. MARIO M. CUOMO Governor Albany, April 21, 1992

1128-> Director Admits C.I.A. Fell Short In Predicting the Soviet Collapse
Responding to criticism that the Central Intelligence Agency failed to forecast the collapse of the Soviet system, its director, Robert M. Gates, today conceded shortcomings in the agency's analysis, but defended its overall performance over the years. In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, Mr. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said that although the agency wrote many assessments describing a growing crisis in the Soviet Union, it was not until 1989 that agency analysts began "to think that the entire edifice might well collapse." Mr. Gates also acknowledged that the agency's statistical analysis portrayed a stronger and larger economy than the one that existed in reality. "From a personal standpoint," he added, "I would contend also that our quantitative analysis always considerably understated the real burden economically of the Soviet military." During his confirmation hearings last fall, Mr. Gates was widely criticized for having promoted a view of an expansionist, invulnerable Soviet Union in more than a dozen speeches and articles between 1986 and 1988, when he was a senior C.I.A. official. The agency was also faulted for exaggerating the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union. Adm. Stansfield Turner, who was Director of Central Intelligence from 1977 to 1981, complained in an article last year in the journal Foreign Affairs about "revisionist rumblings that the C.I.A. did in fact see the Soviet collapse emerging after all." "On this one," Admiral Turner added, "the corporate view missed by a mile." Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who wrote in 1979 that the Soviet Union would break up in the 1980's, has called for the dissolution of the agency. The Senate and House intelligence committees have introduced bills calling for sweeping reorganization of the entire intelligence apparatus of the Government. But Mr. Gates, citing hundreds of assessments, briefings and monographs produced over the last three decades, maintained that the C.I.A. had accurately described the weaknesses of the Soviet Union, including the economic distortion from its extraordinary investment in the military.

1129-> Dow Off By 4.15, To 3,393.84
Stock prices fell slightly yesterday after the Dow Jones industrial average twice came close to passing 3,400. The modest setback from Tuesday's record highs came as interest rates turned upward in the credit markets. The Dow, which had climbed nearly 22 points on Tuesday, gave back 4.15 yesterday to end at 3,393.84. Losers held a narrow edge on gainers for all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to an estimated 198.8 million shares, up from 189.4 million on Tuesday. Waiting Out the Fed Analysts said traders took a cautious approach as they waited for signs of whether the Federal Reserve was ready to ease its credit policy any further, given recent signs of slow, erratic growth in the economy. Yields on long-term government bonds had fallen Tuesday to their lowest levels in about three months at 7.76 percent. In yesterday's trading they reversed course. Treasury bond prices fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to around 7.8 percent. Wall Street seemed to take in stride General Motors' offering of more than $2.1 billion in new stock -- the largest sale of shares ever by an American company. G.M. was easily the most active Big Board stock, with nearly 17 million shares traded. It ended by slipping 25 cents, to $39, matching the offering price for the 55 million new shares. Salomon Buoyed by Settlement Salomon Inc. jumped $2.875, to $33.50. In its case involving last year's scandal in the Treasury securities market, Salomon reached a settlement with the Government that would permit the firm to remain a primary dealer in that business. Moreover, investigators and regulators said no criminal charges would be levied against Salomon or its Salomon Brothers subsidiary. Humana fell $2.25, to $23, in active trading, as the company estimated lower quarterly profits. British Airways gained $1.25, closing at $57. The company said it had no present plans to offer new stock, contrary to some recent speculation. AMR Down on Earnings Outlook American Airlines' parent, AMR, dropped 87.5 cents, to $65.50. Analysts said it appeared that the company's second-quarter results would be disappointing in the aftermath of airline fare changes this spring. AMR's chairman, Robert Crandall, said at the annual meeting that the company was considering dropping out of unprofitable airline markets and studying "nontraditional options" to try improving its financial health. QVC Network, traded over the counter, climbed $2.125, to $20.625. The television-shopping merchandiser reported earnings of 28 cents a share for the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, against 5 cents a share in the corresponding period a year earlier. Blue-Chip Losers Losers among the recently strong blue chips included Walt Disney, down $1.50 at $39.375; Coca-Cola, down 62.5 cents at $44.50, and Ford Motor, down 25 cents, to $44.25. McDonald's gained $1.375 to close at $46.125, a record high. The company said it knew of no fresh developments to explain the activity. The Nasdaq composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 2.24, to 580.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down 0.22 at 392.15.

The defendant is accused of using an electrical cord to kill Robert Solimine Jr., 17, on Feb. 16. Mr. Solimine was reciting the Hail Mary in his father's car when he was killed, prosecutors said.

1131-> Don't Blame L.B.J.
Abraham Lincoln was President more than a century ago, and a Republican, so the Administration couldn't blame the Emancipation Proclamation for the riots in Los Angeles. Instead, the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, and President Bush laid much of the blame on Lyndon B. Johnson and his domestic programs. Asked to identify which programs the Administration was talking about, Mr. Fitzwater snapped, "I don't have a list with me." Which could be on the Administration hit list? Surely Head Start was not one. Mr. Bush has adopted that Great Society program as one of his favorites. Since the Administration claims a devotion to having people stand on their own two feet, we can assume it was not talking about training programs like the Job Corps, the Vocational Education Act or the college work-study program, which helps the less affluent work their way through college. I doubt the man who aspires to be our Education President had in mind the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides billions of dollars to schools with concentrations of poor children; the Higher Education Act, which provides loans and scholarships to those who have the brains and will, but not the wallets, to get into college, or the adult literacy program, which he has embraced. Perhaps the Administration was talking about the Teachers Corps or Vista (Volunteers in Service to America). Those efforts were intended to get college graduates to volunteer (at $75 per month) to give the poor a hand up in education and work skills. They do sound like Gov. Bill Clinton's domestic peace corps; they also fit neatly into Mr. Bush's call for volunteerism. Maybe Mr. Fitzwater had in mind the Voting Rights Act, which opened the polls to blacks (and later Hispanics) and helped elect thousands of local and county officials aross the South and a number of big-city mayors. These voters and officeholders are overwhelmingly Democrats. Mr. Fitzwater's other targets may include the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned job discrimination against minorities and which the Administration has sought to gut and used to feed white resentment in a soft economy. Maybe he's aiming at the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which L.B.J. pressed Congress to pass as a constructive example of hope in the wake of the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King. It is unlikely Mr. Fitzwater was criticizing the National Housing Act of 1968. It created the National Housing Partnership to attract the private sector into building low- and moderate-income housing by making it profitable, privatized the Federal National Mortgage Association and offered the poor a home ownership program. That is down the center of the Reagan-Bush alley. The Aid for Dependent Children program was a 30's idea, so Mr. Fitzwater couldn't have had it in mind. President Johnson, like Mr. Bush, criticized its damage to families. L.B.J. pressed Congress in vain to drop the rule that a jobless husband must leave the house so his wife and children could get benefits. Could Mr. Fitzwater have been talking about L.B.J.'s economic policies? When President Johnson got Congress to cut taxes in 1964, he didn't serve most benefits up to the rich so they could eventually trickle down to the rest of America. He kept the tax fully graduated. He used revenues from the expanding economy to increase minimum Social Security benefits and finance Medicare (thus lifting millions out of poverty) and to finance education, job training, Medicaid and other health programs that helped halve the number of Americans living in poverty. The last 12 years have seen that proportion double. What seems most likely is that the Administration didn't know what it was talking about -- historically, ideologically or economically. L.B.J. left plenty of mistakes to learn from and successes to build on. Can't we start learning and building?

1132-> INSURERS FAULTED ON POLICY SWITCH; Steps Consumers Can Take
Insurance companies usually mail notices to customers whose policies or annuities are being transferred. But the language of the notices often makes it difficult for consumers to figure out that their policies are being switched to a new company. And they often do not say that the customer has the right to refuse. Experts advise caution. If you write a check to the new company, or do not respond to the notice within a certain period, insurance companies in most states can legally assume your consent. Here are some steps consumers can take: *Examine all mail from your insurance company carefully. If a letter mentions the name of a new company, or the phrase "assumption reinsurance," call your company immediately to find out if your policy is being transferred. Assumption reinsurance is jargon for policy transfers. *If a transfer is taking place, find out if it is just an administrative transfer (meaning another company is only taking over the paperwork) or if your company is transferring its financial obligations as well. *If it is a financial transfer, find out if you are being switched to a weaker or a stronger company. Ask one of the leading insurance rating agencies for the ratings of the two companies and compare. Among the ratings agencies are the A. M. Best Company in Oldwick, N.J. (908-439-2200 ext. 5552); Moody's Investors Services in New York City (212-553-0377), and Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Services in New York (212-208-1527). *You have the right to refuse the transfer, even if your company does not tell you so. Simply write a letter saying you do not want your policy switched. Policies or annuities that have already been transferred can, of course, be canceled but there may penalties that outweigh any advantages.

1133-> The Executive Computer; Three Different Ways to Dress Up Windows
Microsoft Windows 3.1 is often referred to as an operating system, and in some ways it is. It has its own command conventions, and it puts its own special demands on both the hardware and the software used with it, just as other operating systems do. Technically, though, Windows is just a facade, albeit a fancy one, for DOS, which remains the true, underlying operating system. Just as Windows changes the face of DOS, making the computer easier to use, several programs are available that change the face of Windows and make it easier to use: Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, New Wave 4.0 and Rooms for Windows. Each has its own strengths to match the different personal working styles of executives. Of course, "easy" is a relative term in the computer business, and all too often ease of use is a byproduct of countless hours of slogging through manuals and dense thickets of confusing commands. Each of these three programs eventually provides ease of use, but mastering that ease is not fun. Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (list price $179) is a faster and fancier version of the original Desktop for Windows. It is made by the Peter Norton Group of the Symantec Corporation, which is widely known for its backup, antivirus, security and disk maintenance tools. Faster is almost always better when it comes to computers, and that's certainly the case with Norton Desktop. Windows is no speed demon, and the first version of Norton Desktop made an already slow system even slower. Even though it requires 8 to 9 megabytes of hard disk space, the new Norton Desktop comes to life much faster than its predecessor. The Norton Desktop adds a variety of utilities to Windows 3.1, each tool displayed as an icon, or symbol. Tools can be kept out of sight in a folder until needed, or arrayed on the "desktop," a term that Norton uses to describe working space on the computer screen. One executive might prefer a messy desk, another to keep things neat, and Norton Desktop gives the user broad control over how the desktop will look. "It fits my needs because it's extremely customizable," said Thomas J. Miller, a microsystems analyst with Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. "It's also very flexible, in that it gives me multiple ways to launch applications or files." Some users, for example, might want to keep handy the tools for "smart erase," which allows users to recover inadvertantly erased files; an antivirus scanner and eradicator; an automated backup tool for making just-in-case copies of entire disks or directories, and a viewer allowing the user to peer inside files without actually loading them. On the other side of the screen are symbols depicting the computer's disk drives. To back up the hard disk, the user points the cursor at the icon representing the "C" drive, drags it over to the backup icon and drops it. Norton Desktop takes over from there, offering the user several different types of backup, ranging from full to incremental (only the files that have been changed since the last backup). Automatic unattended backups can be scheduled, too, but the version I tested did not work with a tape drive. Symantec promises to add this in the future. Other utilities include financial and scientific calculators, a simple word processor that is superior to the one in Windows, a calendar and scheduler, a screen blanker, a powerful search tool for finding misplaced or forgotten files and a batch file builder. There's also a shredder for sensitive files. Unlike the smart eraser, which allows a deleted file to be pulled back from the trash, the shredder obliterates the file. Other security features include passwords that can be attached at several different levels to keep snoopers out completely, or merely to restrict access to specific files. The Hewlett-Packard Company has revamped and repositioned New Wave 4.0 ($195) as a Windows shell aimed at making Windows easier to use, after introducing it as a powerful supercharger for Windows. The truth is that New Wave retains its powerful features, even though ease of use is now being emphasized. Unlike Norton Desktop, which knocks some rough edges off Windows but stays true to the underlying DOS structure, New Wave makes Windows 3.1 work in much the same way as Apple's vaunted Macintosh operating system. Barring some disaster, the user can probably go weeks or months without having to descend into DOS. Anyone familiar with the Mac's system of managing files and folders will adore New Wave, since it uses the same conventions. File names, for example, can be 32 characters long, instead of the DOS limit of 8. Instead of dragging a file to the A or C drives, the operator can use disk icons with no-nonsense names like "floppy disk" or "network drive." New Wave lacks Norton Desktop's disk tools and antivirus tools, but it was the first program to add drag-and-drop file management to Windows. To print a document in New Wave, for example, the user highlights the symbol for the document and drags it atop the symbol for the printer. That's it. For more advanced users, New Wave has an intriguing feature called the Agent, which can be instructed to perform special tasks automatically. On its simplest level, the Agent will keep track of mouse clicks, menu choices and keyboard strokes, store them as a single script and then perform the script whenever it is asked to do so. An executive might want the Agent to gather each morning's sales reports, grab the bottom line off each regional total, repackage the results into a single report and send the report by electronic mail to the boss, with a copy to the printer. Advanced users can write their own scripts, using New Wave's programming language. New Wave adds 7 to 10 megabytes to the already hefty demands of Windows. That slows the system noticeably, but many people may find the slower performance a small price to pay for the many advantages the program provides. The hardest of the three to explain is Rooms for Windows ($99 from XSoft, a subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation), which allows Windows users to organize their work in themes or projects, rather than in applications. It requires less disk space than the other two programs. Windows, and the other Windows managers, allow the user to switch from one application to another. Rooms does too, but in a more elegant way, creating "virtual desktops" -- electronic environments that change depending on the user's needs. If this is hard to follow, consider calendars. Some executives want to see their schedules detailed hour by hour, day by day; others want to see everything in terms of broader projects and strategic plans. Rooms for Windows takes the latter course. Likewise, an executive probably doesn't sit down to work a spreadsheet; he or she sits down to prepare a budget report. With Rooms, all the tools needed for making the budget report can be gathered in one "room" -- a spreadsheet, a word processor, a graphics program and the necessary data files. The word processor might also appear in the next room, as part of an arsenal for producing the company newsletter. Rooms are connected by "doors," and a "suite" gives the user an overview of all the rooms. It is gratifying to see a strong Windows product from Xerox, whose Palo Alto Research Center in California came up with the original idea for windowed computer systems. Microsoft and Apple, among others, saw the brilliance of Xerox's work and, depending on one's interpretation of the law, either stole the ideas or adapted them. Through its XSoft division, Xerox may finally get a return on its investment.

1135-> Voices of Hunts Point Talk of Drugs and Decay, but Rebirth Too Voices of Hunts Point Talk of Drugs and Decay, but Reality Too
On the streets of Hunts Point, young men and women, aimless and bored, hang out in front of storefronts covered with graffiti, abandoned buildings and vacant lots. Dealers brazenly sell drugs, paying children 5 cents to collect used crack vials. A guard at the McDonald's on Garrison Avenue tries to keep prostitutes from using the bathrooms as shooting galleries. On other streets, children play stickball late into the evening as their parents linger on the sidewalks and stoops to escape hot, humid apartments. A woman on Bryant Avenue grows tomatoes and peppers in her front yard. Government officials from France tour the neat rows of new town houses bearing plaques trumpeting the day they opened. These are the two worlds of Hunts Point in the Bronx -- two conflicting realities that collided early Wednesday morning in a bloody barrage of bullets on Longwood Avenue that wounded 12 people but, miraculously, killed no one. The shooting, which the police said appeared to involve rival drug gangs trying to expand their turf, underscored the competing visions of a neighborhood, like others in New York City, on the cusp of a rebirth after the urban devastation of the 1970's and 1980's. "You have stable micro-neighborhoods living next to a war zone," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "How do you resolve this is the great question." In more than two dozen interviews since the shootout, men and women, young and old, spoke of their different versions of Hunts Point, what is wrong and what would make it better. They spoke of their lives and their families, of fear and despair, of devotion to the neighborhood and hope for its future. Jose Suares Store Worker, 21 years old Michael Santiago Unemployed, 21 years old At the corner of Lafayette and Bryant Avenues, a spot that neighbors say is full of drug dealing, Jose Suares and Michael Santiago pointed proudly to a poem they helped spray-paint on the wall of a bodega: Never forget! What we may do is wrong, but it is a way of life! We are forced to survive by any means necessary! Why? Because we're just products of our environment. Created by the getto, born in the getto, also taught in the getto. All we really are is victims of the getto!!! "We've memorized it," Mr. Santiago said. "It tells it like it is." The poem was written by a friend, they said. When they first heard it, they insisted on enshrining it on the wall in an elaborate mural. Next to the poem is a brief "R.I.P." for a friend, Charlie, who was shot to death on the corner last summer. Other friends are memorialized on other blocks of Hunts Point. Mr. Suares and Mr. Santiago grew up in Hunts Point. They say that they have spent most of the summer hanging out late into the night on this and other corners. Mr. Suares said he has a job that pays $5 an hour at a clothing store. Mr. Santiago is unemployed. Both dropped out of high school. Asked about their plans for the future, both shrugged. On Thursday night, cars drove by and their passengers called out to friends and others loitering on the corner. Prostitutes sauntered past. Mr. Suares: "The shooting the other night -- that was typical. I've been here all my life, and it's always been the same." Mr. Santiago: "That's everyday life here. Stick around here a little longer and you'll hear the gun shots." Mr. Suares: "There's nothing that can be done about it. Kids grow up and they see everything going on. No one grows up and becomes a drug dealer because they were born with it. They see other people who are getting paid lots of money, and they want to get paid too." Mr. Santiago: "It's a chain of events. You come and see a 16-year-old guy driving a 300z, a Benz or a Beamer, you want one too. You go to the streets because you make your money faster. "And you do it for fame. It impresses the girls."

1136-> Ramos Is Declared New President 6 Weeks After Philippine Election
A joint session of Congress proclaimed Fidel V. Ramos President of the Philippines today after nearly a month of debate over the honesty of the country's freest presidential elections in more than 20 years. Congress set aside allegations of large-scale fraud made by Mr. Ramos's opponents and approved a report saying that although there was some evidence of cheating, it was not on a scale that would change the outcome of the voting, which took place six weeks ago. Although an unofficial count last month showed that Mr. Ramos had won, his proclamation as President was delayed by the debates in Congress and by the complex counting procedures designed to frustrate any efforts to commit the large-scale fraud that has characterized past Philippine elections. In a seven-way race, Mr. Ramos, a former armed forces Chief of Staff and Defense Minister in the Government of President Corazon C. Aquino, got only 23.5 percent of the votes, the slimmest mandate of a President in Philippine history. His margin over the second-place finisher, Miriam Defensor Santiago, was about 800,000 votes out of 23 million cast, the smallest winning margin since independence in 1946. First Protestant President When he is inaugurated on June 30, he will become the first former military officer and the first Protestant to become President of this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. Mr. Ramos, who seems acutely aware of his fragile support, has met with most of his campaign rivals and with Catholic bishops who opposed his candidacy. He has proposed peace negotiations with Communist insurgents and renegade military officers who were behind some of the six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino, thus suggesting the possibility of granting them amnesty. The conciliatory stance is intended to woo significant sectors of Philippine society that refuse to forget that during the rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, General Ramos headed the Philippine Constabulary, which arrested and sometimes tortured political dissenters. But he abandoned Mr. Marcos in 1986, heading a military rebellion that sparked the "People Power" uprising that ousted the dictator. Mr. Ramos also needs to forge a consensus in the new Congress, where his party won only a fifth of the seats. An even more daunting challenge is to repair a tattered economy that contracted by 0.5 percent last year. He has said his Government's priority will be to resolve the energy crisis that has crippled the economy and left most of the country without power for up to 10 hours every day.

1137-> Cuomo Sets Day of Decision for Court Nomination
With the names of seven people to choose from, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he planned to announce his nominee to fill a vacancy on the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, on Aug. 24. The vacancy was created when Judge Fritz W. Alexander 2d left the court this spring to serve as New York City's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety. Though legal experts say that the Governor has tended not to choose candidates on the basis of race or ideology, he is under some pressure to fill the slot with a minority candidate, because Mr. Alexander is black. The seven nominees are a diverse group, with a Hispanic woman and two black men among them. Five are currently serving on the bench: one is in private practice, one is a law professor and all but one -- Justice Howard Arnold Levine of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court -- are from New York City. The names were forwarded to the Governor two weeks ago by the State Commission on Judicial Nomination, a 12-member panel that reviewed the applications of candidates around the state. By law, the Governor must wait two weeks after receiving the nominations but must make his selection within two weeks after that. The New York State Senate then has a month to act on the Governor's nomination. A Seeming Edge Among the three minority candidates, the most frequently mentioned is George Bundy Smith, an associate justice in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court . The other two minority nominees are Justice Carmen Judith Beauchamp Ciparick of State Supreme Court, a former staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society and the Commissioner of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, and Judge Lewis L. Douglass of the Court of Claims, a former executive deputy commissioner of the New York State prison system. "If it is a minority, clearly it would be Bundy Smith," said an attorney who frequently argues before the before the Court of Appeals and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In terms of the three of them, he's an appeals judge and they're trial judges, but I think the general sense is that he also has the best qualifications." Judges on the Appeals Court serve 14-year terms but are required to retire at the end of the year in which they turn 70. One sitting judge, Stewart F. Hancock Jr., is to retire in December. Mr. Cuomo, who has been Governor since 1983, has appointed five of the six current judges and elevated the sixth, Sol Wachtler, to Chief Judge. Matters of Geography Of the six judges currently on the court, two are from New York City, one -- Judge Wachtler -- is from Long Island, and three, Judge Hancock among them, are from upstate. "The convention has been usually that it's been four downstate and three upstate, and with Hancock leaving he might want to appoint someone from upstate," one lawyer said. In addition to Justice Ciparick, Justice Bundy Smith, Judge Douglass and Justice Levine, the other three names forwarded to the Governor are those of William E. Hellerstein, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and former head of the Criminal Appeals Bureau of the Legal Aid Society; Lewis A. Kaplan, an expert in antitrust law and a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; and Joseph P. Sullivan, an associate justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court. Justice Sullivan has been named a candidate for associate justice of the Court of Appeals by the Commission on Judicial Nomination three previous times: in 1983, 1985 and 1986. In 1985, the commission named him a candidate for appointment to the office of chief judge.

1138-> RESULTS PLUS
COLLEGES Probation Imposed The Pacific-10 Conference has placed Washington State University's athletic program on two years' probation and sanctioned the men's track and field and baseball programs because of National Collegiate Athletic Association scholarship violations. The Pac-10 barred Washington State's men's track and field and baseball teams from post-season competition next season and stripped the school of the conference track and field titles it won in 1985 and 1991. Washington State's athletic director, Jim Livengood, said the sanctions would not be appealed. "Quite candidly, we were guilty," Livengood said at a news conference yesterday. (AP) BASEBALL Title to Fordham Prep John Marciano hit a three-run double in the second inning to lift Fordham Prep to its first Catholic High Schools Athletic Association baseball title since 1935 with a 5-3 victory over McClancy yesterday at Yankee Stadium. Marciano's double capped a five-run inning that erased a 3-0 lead for McClancy (20-5), which won the title last year. Garrett Petraia, who started for Fordham (25-5) surrendered a three-run homer to Tom Barbato in the second but settled down to complete the game. Petraia struck out Dan Nunez with the bases loaded to end the fourth inning and closed the sixth by forcing Mike Soto to pop up with two runners on. SOCCER Denmark Scores Upset Denmark, which earned a berth in the European soccer championships 10 days ago when Yugoslavia was banned from international competition, shocked the Netherlands with two early goals by Henryk Larsen and hung on to beat the defending champion yesterday in a penalty shootout in the semifinals of the tournament in Goteborg, Sweden. The stunning upset made for an unexpected final Friday with World Cup holder Germany, which eliminated Sweden, 3-2, on Sunday. The score yesterday was 2-2 after overtime. (AP) YACHT RACING Boomerang Is First The 81-foot maxi-yacht, Boomerang, crossed the finish line first yesterday off Bermuda in the Newport to Bermuda Race. The sailboat, owned by George Coumantaros of New York, completed the 630-mile race in 72 hours 19 minutes. The Bermuda race record still stands at 62 hours 29 minutes, a time set in 1982 by the yacht Nirvana. The finish by Boomerang yesterday marks the third time that the yacht has won line honors in the Bermuda race.

1140-> Harry Gottlieb Is Dead; W.P.A. Artist Was 98
Harry Gottlieb, a social realist painter and printmaker who depicted working people, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98 years old. He died of Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter, Amy, of Toronto. Working in the graphics division of the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, Mr. Gottlieb participated in a pilot endeavor to develop silk-screen printing as a fine-art medium. The prints he made by this process in the 1930's and 40's are among his best-known works. In 1977, Mr. Gottlieb helped organize a show of W.P.A. artists at the Parsons School of Design. In 1983 his contributions to the W.P.A. and the silk-screen method were seen in a solo exhibition at at Rutgers University. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan, Brooklyn and Whitney museums. Mr. Gottlieb was born in Romania and arrived in Minneapolis with his family in 1906. He studied at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, moved to New York in 1918, and settled in the artist's colony at Woodstock, N.Y., in 1923. He worked there for 12 years, until a Guggenheim Fellowship enabled him to study in Europe. He worked with the Federal Art Project from 1935 to 1940, became a leader and active member of the Artists Union and the Artists Congress, and joined the Communist Party, remaining a lifelong member. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a stepdaughter, Judy Tytell of New York City; a brother, Tully Gottlieb of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Eva Gottlieb of Minneapolis, and Bess Fleisher of Park Forest, Ill.

1141-> Political Eavesdropping Made Easier
When the Democratic Party gathers in Madison Square Garden to nominate its Presidential candidate next month, delegates, party officials and members of the press are expected to bring in 1,000 or more cellular telephones, making it the first political convention of the cellular age. That means people with small inexpensive radio scanners both inside and near the Garden could lock into these phone signals as easily as a motorist tunes into a station on a car radio. The questions are: How much eavesdropping will go on, and will those listening quickly fall asleep from boredom? Roger E. Schneider, the convention's director of technology, said he expected the delegates and party officials to talk mostly on the 3,000 regular telephones dedicated to their use, which are not vulnerable to radio scanners. "We don't encourage people bringing in their wireless phones," he said, "and frankly we don't expect many to bring them." In the camp of Gov. Bill Clinton, the likely nominee, only 20 or so top aides will use cellular phones at the convention, said Jeffrey L. Eller, a spokesman. "You always think about eavesdropping, but we aren't going to make a big deal out of it," he added. Jeffrey R. Ely, the convention liaison for Edmund G. Brown Jr., who is still running for the nomination, said, "We have begun to focus on it, but haven't made any decisions" about telecommunications. The Republicans, who are holding their convention in August in Houston, are banning cellular phones from the convention floor, where the delegates are. "But we're just doing that because cellular phones might interfere with TV broadcast signals," said Joseph T. Fleming, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. The Democrats and the phone installation companies, the Nynex Corporation and the Cellular One Group, profess to be unconcerned about possible eavesdropping in part because of an advance, known as microcell technology, in transmitting cellular calls. Another reason is that savvy political operatives supposedly know better than to engage in confidential conversations on cellular phones. Even so, ingenious computer enthusiasts who call themselves hackers are gleeful about the Democratic convention. "As long as it's not an encrypted signal, everything is fair game," said Eric G. Corley, editor of 2600 magazine, a quarterly publication by and about computer hackers. Encrypted signals are electronically scrambled to prevent eavesdropping; relatively expensive equipment is required to encrypt the cellular signals currently used. Mr. Corley is not predicting what he or his readers might do at the convention. The handheld scanners that can listen in on cellular conversations look like a hefty television remote control, with a telltale nubby antenna on top, and can be easily concealed in a coat pocket. So, that grim man with the dark suit and the earphone at the convention may not be a Secret Service agent at all, but a Listening Tom, scanning for juicy political tidbits for the opposition or just for fun. Portable radio scanners are easily found for prices from $300 to $550 for deluxe models at stores nationwide like Radio Shack and, in Manhattan, Barry Electronics. Even though, by law, new scanners are not supposed to be able to lock onto cellular telephone frequencies, there is a bustling gray market in devices to restore the eavesdropping capability. The best-selling scanners at Barry Electronics are the Ace Communications AR1000, costing about $400, and the Icom America IC-R1, about $500, which can scan hundreds of conversations in less than a minute. "We just can't keep up with demand," said Kenneth Mak, a Barry salesman, who added that the devices were popular with business executives, ham radio operators and computer "techno-nerds." Another Political Case While it is hard to say who might be trying to eavesdrop at the Democratic convention and for what purposes, a well-publicized recent case shows what can happen to politicians who are not careful about using cellular telephones. Last month, a former aide to Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia pleaded guilty to violating Federal wiretapping laws. His eavesdropping was part of an apparent plan to gather damaging information on Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, a political adversary of Senator Robb. One of the Governor's cellular telephone conversations disparaging the Senator was intercepted by a radio scanner and tape-recorded. Scrambling, or encrypting, the signal so that an eavesdropper would hear just noise would foil such Listening Toms. But cellular phones have not yet converted to digital transmission, which uses computer code that can easily be encrypted. Current analog signals can be encrypted but only with an elaborate model of a cellular telephone, known generically as a STU3, which costs $2,000. A spokesman for the staff of Governor Clinton said the campaign had no plans to buy that kind of phone. Listening Toms at the convention, said Philip R. Karn, who designs cellular telephone equipment but insisted on anonymity for his company as a condition for the interview, could simply rent a room at the Ramada Hotel facing Madison Square Garden across Seventh Avenue. They could point a special ultra-high-frequency antenna, even more sensitive than a radio scanner, and listen to random conversations on cellular phones. With a little advance intelligence work, the Listening Tom could have a fair idea when a certain person would be talking and therefore how to help narrow the search for the right conversation among the hundreds going on, Mr. Karn said. Cellular telephones are radio transmitters that broadcast to and receive signals from a network of "cells," or transmission towers. When a cellular user drives or walks, different cell sites capture and strengthen the cellular telephone's radio signal and then connect the phone to the regular telephone network. But such radio frequencies have difficulty penetrating thick-walled buildings. So in a building like Madison Square Garden, which is made of concrete and steel, cellular users with phones even the size of a small briefcase have a slim chance of getting a signal. Instead of broadcasting a big signal, in vain, into a thick building, cellular telephone companies have miniaturized the network and placed it inside the building. Using "microcells" with only half a watt, or one-thousandth the power of a regular macrocell, such a system provides better coverage within a building without the expense of the large system. These microcells, instead of broadcasting a signal for miles, broadcast only several hundred feet. So instead of a pocket cellular phone trying to pull a weakened signal through concrete from a macrocell several city blocks away, it will get a strong signal from 300 or so feet within the Garden. That is why Alfred F. Boschulte, president of Nynex Mobile, one of the two providers of cellular service in New York City, does not expect eavesdropping to be a problem. 160 Calls at a Time Also, he said, the four microcells that Nynex has installed provide 160 channels, enough for 160 simultaneous conversations. The microcells were installed as part of convention service, but after the convention they will remain in the Garden to improve cellular service there. (Cellular One, Nynex's rival, also plans to install two microcells in the Garden with a total of 90 channels.)

1142-> Rain Suspends Golf in Austria
Peter Fowler of Australia shot a 66 today to share the third-round lead in the Austrian Open golf tournament before torrential rains halted play. Fowler was 11 under par at 205. Peter Mitchell of England and Jean van de Velde of France also were at 11 under for the tournament when weather forced them to stop play at the 15th hole. Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden, who shared the lead with van der Velde going into the third round, was a stroke back when he was stopped at the 15th. Tournament officials, who stopped and started play several times during the day hoping to beat the stormy weather, said third-round action would continue Sunday morning. The fourth round will begin Sunday shortly after the third round is concluded.

1143-> For Children
'Botanica' Repertorio Espanol Gramercy Arts Theater 138 East 27th Street Mid-Manhattan (212) 889-2850 Recommended ages: 8 and up Sunday A botanica is a storefront where Hispanic people go to spill their problems and leave with remedies, a magical-realist dispenser of herbal concoctions and psychiatric services. The play "Botanica," by Dolores Prida, a Cuban playwright, was always intended for a broad audience. Its main character is Milagros, or Millie, a recent college graduate who has returned to Spanish Harlem, albeit temporarily. Her grandmother, Dona Geno, and her mother, Anamu, want Millie to run the botanica, but Millie is planning to live in the "real world." Little does she know, despite a summa cum laude degree, that best-laid plans don't often work out. Dona Geno becomes ill, leaving Millie in charge of the botanica. Instead of dispensing aloe vera and a prayer to St. Lazarus, the patron saint of the sick, Millie suggests to customers that they learn English, get better jobs, change their beehive hairdos. She also installs a computer and becomes sick herself: lovesick over Ruben, who is content to live simultaneously in the Hispanic and Anglo worlds. In the end, Millie learns that the real world is anyplace she wants it to be. The play lasts 90 minutes, including a 15-minute intermission. New York City schoolchildren have been attending special matinees since the play opened in February 1991. (It has been performed on and off since then.) Older children identify with the generational conflict and find the botanica scenes, with women complaining about no-good boyfriends, worth snickering about. They also get to see that women can run businesses and successfully raise children on their own. (Millie's father left the family early on.) The performance begins at 3 P.M. Tickets are $15 for adults, $10 for students and the elderly, and $7 for children 12 and under. Clown Theater Day Fountain Plaza Lincoln Center Manhattan (212) 875-5400 Recommended for all ages Tomorrow Four clown acts, billed as New Vaudevillians, are to perform hilarious, outrageous and ridiculous stunts as part of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival this month. Starting at 1 P.M., the Waldo Woodhead Show, with four clowns, will present original music with their comedy routine and circus techniques. Serious Foolishness, at 2 P.M., is described as a cross between Buster Keaton and Bugs Bunny. The group wears traditional clown clothes but has highbrow thoughts (and skits). At 3 P.M., Clown Shorts, a trio of comedians, uses props, mime, macho personas and "poetic narratives" to keep things rolling. Mr. Fish follows that act. He sings, throws knives and is adept with bubbles. At 4 P.M., the Dikki and Vovic Show will offer more slapstick comedy, magic and music. The performances are free. Seating will be available. The rain date is Sunday. '1492' 'Two Worlds of Science' New York Hall of Science 47-01 111th Street Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Queens (718) 699-0005 Recommended ages: 4 and up Through Aug. 30 In this year of Columbus, the New York Hall of Science has taken an appreciative scientific approach, giving children a technical understanding of the man and his mission. The exhibition is in the Great Hall on the third floor and on the roof, where visitors explore a maze looking for symbols of the Columbus voyage, like astrolabes. In the Great Hall, visitors work interactive video displays, which turn a potentially desultory exhibition into a high-tech panorama. In the "Native American Medicine Chest" display, visitors sit at color video screens and are asked questions like how American Indians made canoes: with oak trees or tule reeds? One 10-year-old boy, whose mother was just as mesmerized as he was, discovered what a mesa was and told his mother not to bother him because he was "playing a game." The exhibition includes foods of the time and navigation. "Did These Foods Come From the Americas?" is more challenging than you'd think. Potatoes were indigenous; asparagus was not. A re-created, full-scale deck of the Nina is the center of activity as children clang a bell, handle a sand clock, stand on a platform that rises and falls with the motion of simulated waves, see how a lodestone remagnetizes a compass needle and sight the North Star with a quadrant. These programs focus on Columbus's voyage; how, for example, did Columbus get his ships and crew together? Ancillary displays concentrate on types of knots, navigational instruments and more food; children may sniff spices (ginger made one boy teary; allspice made another "sick") and run their fingers through grains like teff, from an African cereal grass. Other displays feature the Mediterranean world in the 15th century. Children make maps, examine a replica of a 1492 globe and ponder who was right: Eratosthenes, an ancient Greek astronomer who believed that the world's circumference was 24,650 miles, or Columbus, who determined that it was 18,800 miles? (Eratosthenes was closer; it's 24,900.) The museum is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for children, $3.50 for adults (free on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2 to 5 P.M.). Parking is $4 a car. The No. 7 train stops about six blocks away, at 111th Street.

1147-> Market Place; A Battered Stock Follows the Fads
WHEN an initial public offering goes wrong, a company can find itself left with few friends. Such is the case with Salton-Maxim Housewares Inc., a maker of assorted housewares as diverse as shower radios and yogurt makers. It sold stock to the public at $12 a share in October. The public got in just in time for the bad news to arrive. The company's hot product of late 1990 and early 1991, a sandwich maker, quickly cooled. "All of a sudden, in October," retailers decided they had enough of the machines, Salton's president and chief executive, Leonhard Dreimann, recalled. Salton shares fell when the problem was disclosed in November and have declined steadily since then. Yesterday, they fell to a new low of $2.625, before ending the day at $2.75, off 25 cents. "The expectations of the institutional shareholders are such that you have to be a good-weather company at all times," Mr. Dreimann said. "Any disappointing news makes people go elsewhere." Salton now trades well below its book value of about $4.11 a share. But that book value is largely a result of the cash that the stock offering brought in, and since the offering the Mount Prospect, Ill., company has not shown it can make money. As it happens, Salton thinks it has a hot product again, this one a juicer that enables cooks to separate juice from pulp in all types of fruits and vegetables. Books extolling the health benefits of such juices are on the best-seller lists, and stores are scrambling for the machines. Sales should start to surge this summer, but the results will not be clear until Christmas approaches. Like most housewares companies, Salton depends on Christmas for up to half its sales. When Salton went public, investors were lured by its rapid growth. Sales in the fiscal year ended last June were $52.7 million, more than twice the level of the preceding year, and the company was turning a small profit. The prospectus conceded that sales would not rise at that rate in the current fiscal year. In fact, they have recently been much lower, and profits have vanished. Sandwich makers were a fast-growing fad. The machines heat the bread and seal it, thus enclosing whatever the cook desires. A year ago, stores could not get anything like their full orders, so they put in exaggerated orders with several makers, Mr. Dreimann said. Then, manufacturing caught up with demand, and suddenly stores began to cancel orders. Moreover, many stores found reasons to return makers they had previously bought, wiping out sales that had already been reported. "A backlog," he said, "can vanish as fast as it grows." Also, some new products did not catch on as rapidly as had been hoped, among them waffle makers and hair dryers designed to look like Snoopy, the cartoon dog. The adequacy of disclosures in the prospectus when Salton went public is the subject of numerous shareholder suits, but one thing that was clear in the prospectus was that the company was going public in part because it needed the money. It was behind in interest payments on one debt, and some of the proceeds of the offering went to pay that bill. The largest use was to repay money owed to Westinghouse Financial and to repurchase a warrant that gave Westinghouse a right to a 10 percent stake in the company. Effectively, Westinghouse got out at the top, something no insider was able to do. Salton makes relatively few of the products it sells, buying most from various foreign makers. Over the years, it has gained a reputation of being able to move relatively quickly to seize fads, as it did with the sandwich makers. But if Salton is too optimistic, as it was with the sandwich makers, it can be stuck with product for which it agreed to pay the makers too high a price.That is one reason that in the most recent quarter, ended March 28, the company reported a loss of $1.5 million, or the equivalent of 30 cents a share, on revenues of $8.8 million. A year earlier, it had almost broken even in the same quarter, on revenues of $11.3 million. If the demand for juicers proves to be as good as the company hopes, and if it does not fade away as rapidly as did the demand for sandwich makers, then the company could surprise investors with better-than-expected results. But for now, brokers have other stocks to push, and it appears that Salton has fallen by the wayside. "I don't think people are interested," said Katherine M. Stultz, who recently resigned as the Dean Witter analyst covering Salton, one of its less successful underwriting clients. "It's small and it got off to a very bad start." Many companies, confronted with that kind of reaction, would decide to repurchase their own stock. Mr. Dreimann said he wanted to do that, but the company's lawyers warned that if the company did so, it might just provoke more shareholder suits. So the company is sitting tight, and its shares are continuing to slide.

1149-> Update; Mystery Illnesses in Albany Still Under Investigation
The mysterious ailments that began plaguing workers in State Office Building Eight in Albany two years ago, striking with particular force last February, have abated in recent months, officials say, and there have been few reports of new sicknesses. But investigators are still trying to figure out exactly what caused all the problems, which sent hundreds of people to the hospital on complaints ranging from dizziness and nausea to partial paralysis. The National Institute of Safety and Health is still analyzing data from the building, said Thom Tubbs, a spokesman for the State Office of General Services. He said that the state had spent more than $3 million to improve the ventilation system, remove malfunctioning machinery and replacing aging equipment, among other things. "The illnesses came as a result of a combination of things, and certainly we never did rule out the possibility that when people are around other people who are sick, it is not unlikely that they would start feeling bad, too," Mr. Tubbs said. And Dan Campbell, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents many of the several thousand workers in the building, agreed that things seemed to have settled down, although he bristled at the notion that any of the illnesses were psychosomatic. "Our members can finally go to work without becoming ill," he said. "We've taken it very slow, and the building seems to be responding."

1150-> Art in Review
'Contemporary Surfaces' Pamela Auchincloss Gallery 558 Broadway (between Prince and Spring Streets) SoHo Through Aug. 14 Elegance is a tricky quality in art. In judicious amounts, it enhances nearly everything it touches; overdone, or as an end in itself, there is almost nothing more enervating. This group show of paintings and sculpture (organized by Rick Ward) demonstrates both possibilities. Several of the small abstract paintings here seem to be largely about preciosity of manufacture. David Ortins's black lozenge on ivory ground is notable for its thick beeswax surface; Daniel Levine's "Soon" offers subtle, fabriclike modulations in texture from top to bottom; Robert Fosdick's "Not Never" is as sleek as a pair of sunglasses with its square of tinted glass set beside one of reflective steel; John Zinsser's "Absorbing the World" manipulates a monochromatic ground with glazes and rubbed highlights to produce a kind of wan numinous abstraction. Since all of these painters specialize in creating work with a self-conscious formal allure, any of them would probably do better in a one-person show. Lined up on a wall like this, they suggest a class of striving students with highly developed manual and design skills but barely a distinguishing idea among them. Other work in the show supplies some welcome variety. Joan Snyder, even when reined in as she is here by the small horizontal format of "The Search, Searching Everywhere," turns painterly energy into emotional energy convincingly. The same may be said of Cora Cohen in her delicate but rambunctious "Tropological Painting," a melange of bright fruit-colored pigment and scraps of odd applied materials (a toothpick, some masking tape) on a sheet of unmounted Mylar. It is the sculpture, however, that adds the decisive combination of polish and piquancy. Maureen Connor's sheer black bodysuit, stretched on a metal frame as if on a rack, suggests slenderizing exercise as a form of torture, and Janine Antoni's "Gnaw," a smooth foot-high mound of chocolate with chisel marks all around its top, is the perfect down-to-earth alternative to the Spartan and overrefined fare offered elsewhere in this show.

A spokeswoman for the nurses' union, the New York State Nurses Association, said pension-fund contributions and work rules are the main issues.

1152-> Europe Proposes Taxes on Fuels Tied to Warming
Sharpening its differences with the United States on environmental policies, the European Community proposed today that a high energy tax be imposed on all forms of fuel to limit pollution and global warming. The proposal, which is one of the community's most ambitious fiscal and environmental moves so far, appears to be intended as the calling card the 12-nation group will present at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro next month. So far, the step takes the form of a recommendation by the community's Brussels-based executive commission and will require approval by the 12 community member nations as well as the European Parliament before it becomes law. But, suggesting that the proposal may also be used as a bargaining position at the Earth Summit, the commission proposed that the new tax only be adopted if Western Europe's major trading partners -- the United States and Japan -- adopt a similar measure. Under the proposal, European governments would levy a tax on fossil fuels -- coal, oil and gas -- and all other forms of energy except that produced by sun, waves or wind. It would be introduced in 1993 at the rate of $3 per barrel of oil, or its equivalent in other fuels, with the tax rising by $1 per year to reach $10 in the year 2000. By driving up fuel costs, the plan aims to force users to become more efficient and save energy, one of the main objectives of the current European rethinking of its economic and industrial policies. Community studies argue that with existing technology, energy efficiency can be increased at little extra cost by 25 percent. The proposed taxes will be highest for the dirtiest form of energy, coal, followed by oil. Taxes on natural gas would be the lowest and biomass fuel would be exempted. The proposal, which has been studied and debated for more than two years, forms the basis of the community's strategy to slow pollution and global warming. The group has committed itself to keeping emissions of gases tied to global warming at 1990 levels. The United States has balked at setting such targets, which has caused a longstanding deadlock between American and European negotiators preparing a treaty to slow global warming. If the European Community takes no measures, experts say that its emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, would be 12 percent higher by the year 2000. It hopes to achieve half of the needed cutback through the proposed "energy taxes" and the rest through other measures. The community is responsible for 13 percent of of global carbon dioxide emissions. But the plan, formally announced in Strasbourg today, was unlikely to satisfy everyone. There has been bitter opposition from industrialists who assert that such additional taxes will hamper their competitiveness. That was the main reason why the community executive today said the tax would not be levied until major trading partners took the same step. Officials said that would increase pressure on the United States, Japan and others to accept concrete measures to limit their emissions. But privately, officials said environmental ministers and politicians would press hard for the European Community to adopt their plan even if others did not make such moves.

1153-> William Maxwell McCord, 61, Author and Sociology Professor
Dr. William Maxwell McCord, an author on social and urban issues and a sociology professor at City College of New York, died on Monday at Yale University Health Services Center in New Haven. He was 61 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn. His family said yesterday that he had died of injuries sustained in a car crash in Guilford on July 9. Dr. McCord, a native of St. Louis, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University and earned a doctorate in social science at Harvard in 1955. That year he began his teaching career as a Harvard instructor in social psychology. He returned to Stanford to join the sociology department in 1958 and gained tenure at the age of 28. He spent six years teaching at Rice University in Houston and Syracuse University before moving to City College in 1971. He served as sociology department chairman for 10 years, until 1983, and lectured widely overseas at universities from Dublin to Cairo to Singapore. Dr. McCord was a co-author of books and monographs on delinquency and crime and later ranged over economic development, international politics and urban affairs. His credits grew to 17 books and nearly 100 articles. Among his works were "The Springtime of Freedom: Evolution of Developing Societies" (Oxford University Press, 1965), "Mississippi: The Long, Hot Summer" (W. W. Norton, 1965), and, more recently, "Paths to Progress" (Norton, 1986), written with his wife, Arline McCord. Researching the Mississippi book, Dr. McCord joined the Freedom Riders in their drive against racial segregation. In addition to his wife, the former Arline Fujii, Dr. McCord is survived by five sons, Geoffrey, of Durham, N.C., Robert, of Narberth, Pa., Maxwell, of White Plains, and William of Guilford; a daughter, Elinor Mary McCord, also of Guilford; a stepdaughter, Dr. Karen Sakuma of Seattle; two stepsons, Theodore Sakuma of Orangeburg, N.Y., and Michael Sakuma, of Stony Brook, L.I., and six grandchildren.

1154-> Florio Aides Prepare for Thousands of Layoffs
The Democratic administration is preparing for thousands of layoffs in state government, saying it is impossible as well as unconstitutional to take only the steps Republican legislators spelled out in the budget they passed over Gov. Jim Florio's veto. With some big state departments still to weigh in, proposed and potential layoffs already total more than 3,000, compared with the 1,400 that the Republican-controlled Legislature predicted would be necessary under its $14.6 billion budget for the next year. When other departments bring in their layoff proposals this week, the number will be higher. The Republicans have said that the $1 billion in cuts they made from the budget proposed by Mr. Florio would require layoffs that should be largely confined to middle managers who make over $50,000 a year, and should not exceed about 1,400 people. But the administration contends that much broader layoffs will be needed, involving 6,000 to 7,000 state workers. Plans for Layoffs Moreover, administration officials say that Republican admonitions in the budget not to cut certain services or lay off certain categories of workers are not only fiscally impossible but constitutionally unenforceable. Proposed layoffs submitted to the Department of Personnel, which are subject to review and revision, totaled more 1,700 by today, ranging from 627 jobs in the Department of Human Services to 9 jobs in the Banking Department. Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo, who has not yet submitted a layoff proposal for the Department of Law and Public Safety, estimated earlier that he would have to lay off about 500 people, and the Corrections Department, also yet to report, says it will have to cut 850, bringing the total to more than 3,000. Other departments drawing up layoff plans include Insurance, Labor and Treasury, all of which had their budgets cut.

1155-> COMPANY NEWS; Citicorp Stock Deal For Holders
Citicorp, in an effort to strengthen its financial condition more quickly than its own profits will allow, is offering its 70,000 shareholders a chance to buy additional company shares at 2.5 percent less than the price of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The offering is similar to those of other companies that issue new stock to shareholders willing to invest their dividends or make additional cash payments. Citicorp has paid no common stock dividend since late 1991, and shareholders must invest more cash to obtain additional shares. Citicorp officials declined to say how much they expected to raise from shareholders, but other banks have found it to be a significant source of new capital. The Chase Manhattan Corporation, for example, raised $92 million in the first half of this year offering a 3 percent discount on new shares purchased with additional cash investments. Chase raised $31 million more from shareholders who invested their dividends in new shares at a 5 percent discount. Monthly Investments The Citicorp plan allows monthly cash investments of a minimum of $100 and a maximum of 25 cents a share owned up to $25,000. Investments of more than $25,000 are possible with the company's permission. Stock will be issued to shareholders at 2.5 percent less than the average price during the first 12 trading days of each month. The offer to Citicorp shareholders comes when the company's profits are improving, and the stock price has rebounded to $20.25, unchanged yesterday, from a low of $8.50 on Dec. 20. But despite that improvement, analysts say that Citicorp will need to issue new shares if it wants to meet the goal set in early 1991 by its chairman, John S. Reed, of making Citicorp "a strongly capitalized company" by raising $4 billion to $5 billion of additional capital by the end of 1992. Since then, Citicorp has added about $2.8 billion of capital from profits, the sale of subsidiaries and new issues of preferred stock. Wall Street financiers, who asked not to be identified because of their business relationship with Citicorp, expect a public offering later this year of about $500 million. If Citicorp sells new shares, it is likely to pay Wall Street firms a fee equal to about 3 percent of the stock price, or about the same as paid by the Chemical Banking Corporation earlier this year. At that price, selling new shares directly to investors at a 2.5 percent discount looks like a bargain for Citicorp.

1157-> CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Issues Continue to Rise
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher again yesterday and interest rates, including long-term bond yields, moved lower. Traders said that after several days of selling failed to push prices appreciably lower, investors were returning to the Treasury market. "There was a lot of profit taking on Friday and more on Monday and Tuesday," one government securities trader said. "Those people are all out of the way, and bids are coming in from all sorts of accounts." Once again, much of the demand centered on shorter-term notes and bills. But as the spread between short-term and long-term issues continued to widen, some investors were beginning to buy bonds. "Over the last couple of days retail customers have been looking to buy short-term securities when their prices fell," said Jay Goldinger, a principal in Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. "But the short end hasn't dipped, so now investors are starting to reach for yield out the curve because they are frustrated by the strength in the short end." In addition, analysts said bond prices were bolstered by rumors from Chicago that Argentina would need to purchase bonds in the open market as part of its debt refinancing plan. They added that economic reports this week have been favorable for the bond market. "Most of the reports have either been in line with expectations or a bit better," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The weight of that evidence convinced some portfolio managers that it was time to extend positions further out the yield curve." The three-tenths of a percent drop in industrial production reported for June by the Federal Reserve yesterday was largely in line with market expectations. Analysts had been expecting a decline after the Labor Department released extremely weak employment numbers earlier this month. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 14/32, up 26/32, to yield 7.61 percent, compared with 7.68 percent late Tuesday. Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 15/32, up 21/32, to yield 6.86 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 16/32, up 5/32, to yield 4.19 percent. Rates on short-term Treasury bills continued to fall, as expectations grew that continued weakness in the economy will force the Federal Reserve Board to cut short-term interest rates yet again. Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.16 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by six basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.20 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by nine basis points, to a late rate of 3.31 percent. The rally in the Government market came on a day when corporate bond issuance picked up after a couple of slack sessions. Among the issuers yesterday were the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company, which sold $1 billion worth of Eurobonds in London, and in New York the Long Island Lighting Company, which priced more than $800 million worth of debt securities. In addition to those offerings, Bloomberg Business News reported that Goldman Sachs Group LP, parent company of Goldman, Sachs & Co., priced $400 million worth of 10-year noncallable notes. The debt offering is highly unusual for Goldman, Wall Street's last remaining private partnership. The 7.80 percent notes were priced at $99.80, to yield 7.829 percent, 93 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities were sold as a private placement because the Goldman is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a public company. Demand for the issue was so strong that it was increased in size from $250 million. The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Earlier, an official of Continental Airlines Holdings, the airline's parent, defended the proposed sale as the only offer that was received after a two-year search. Continental shareholders and two creditors, the American General Corporation and I.B.M., have objected to the bid. Under the deal, Maxxam, in conjunction with investment bankers Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Kidder, Peabody , would pay $25 million cash and $325 million in junk bonds for 72 percent of the airline. Maxxam, a real estate and steel group, is based in Houston, as is Continental.

BEN VEREEN went home from the hospital yesterday, six weeks after he was critically hurt when he was hit by a truck as he walked along the center of a darkened highway. Mr. Vereen, 45 years old, will have to rehabilitation at an undisclosed location on the East Coast, according to a statement released by his publicist, Paul Baker. "Although his doctors feel he will make an excellent recovery, it is too early to determine when, or to what degree, he will be able to resume performing," the statement said. The Tony award-winning actor and dancer was brought to U.C.L.A. Medical Center on June 9 after he was struck by a small truck as he walked in the middle of Pacific Coast Highway near his Malibu home. He suffered head and internal injuries and a broken leg in the predawn accident. The driver of the truck, David Foster, the Grammy-winning composer, did all he could to avoid hitting Mr. Vereen, the police said. Mr. Vereen portrayed Chicken George in the TV miniseries "Roots" and won a Tony for his role in "Pippin."

1160-> QUESTION BOX
Interstate N.C.A.A. Finals Q. When Pepperdine of Malibu, Calif., beat Cal State-Fullerton in the final of the College World Series on June 6, it was the first time two schools from the same state met in the N.C.A.A. Division I baseball championship game. Has it ever happened in the Division I basketball final? A. Only twice in 54 finals, and each time it not only was the same state but also the same teams with the same winner, and in successive years to boot. The N.C.A.A. interstate showdowns took place in 1961 and 1962, which were good years to be rooting for the University of Cincinnati, even though Oscar Robertson had just left for the National Basketball Association. Without him, such players as Paul Hogue, Tom Thacker, Tony Yates and Ron Bonham stepped up and Coach Ed Jucker's Bearcats twice knocked off their Ohio rivals from Columbus, the Ohio State Buckeyes. The scores were 70-65 in overtime and 71-59, respectively, and the sites were Kansas City, Mo., and Louisville, Ky. Considering how good those Ohio State teams were, Cincinnati certainly earned more than state bragging rights. Coach Fred Taylor's Buckeyes -- led by John Havlicek, Jerry Lucas, Larry Siegfried, Mel Nowell and Bobby Knight -- won the 1960 national title before falling short in 1961 and 1962. Their three-year record was 78-6, and in the two seasons they lost finals to Cincinnati, their record was 53-3. Russell Not One of a Kind Q. Is Bill Russell, with the Boston Celtics in 1968 and 1969, the only person who has been both a player and head coach on the same team in the years it won N.B.A. championships? A. There's one other, but you've got to turn back the 24-second clock to the set-shot days of the league to find him. In 1948, when the Baltimore Bullets knocked off the Philadelphia Warriors, 4 games to 2, in the first championship round series for the newly named National Basketball Association, the Bullets were coached by Harry (Buddy) Jeannette. He also was the league's sharpest shooter that season (34.9 percent) and his team's third-leading scorer, averaging 10.7 points a game for a Baltimore team that went 28-20 and finished second in the West before going 8-3 in the playoffs and dethroning the Warriors. Jeannette remained a player-coach the next two seasons in Baltimore but never won another title. His playing days ended before the 1950-51 season, and his coaching days with those Bullets ended 37 games into that season. The next four seasons, Jeannette coached at Georgetown University, but he returned to Baltimore to coach another Bullets franchise for the 1964-65 season and part of the 1966-67 season. One of the forces Jeannette had to reckon with in his second shot with the Bullets as coach was Russell, who was still the hub of the Boston game. And by the time Jeannette's N.B.A. coaching career had ended after an interim stint during the 1966-67 season, Russell was already calling the shots as well as rebounding them for the Celtics, one season away from joining Jeannette in the N.B.A. record book as the only player-coaches of a championship team. Ripken vs. Gehrig Q. Suppose that in 1995, when Cal Ripken is supposed to surpass Lou Gehrig's hallowed mark of 2,130 consecutive games, the schedule calls for Ripken's team, presumably still the Orioles, to play the record-tying and record-breaking games in Oakland and not before the hometown fans in Baltimore. Can the Orioles make a "gentleman's agreement" to delay Ripken's milestone appearance or to switch the site so that Ripken can do it in his home stadium? A. Don't bet on it, even if sports gambling is legalized by then. For if baseball agreed to such monkeying around, that might be as startling as Gehrig's longevity. Under current rules, if Ripken misses a game that the Orioles win, lose or tie, his streak is over. And chances are baseball would not act too gentlemanly toward moving a game or a series from one coast to another. Of course, there's always the chance the schedule-maker could solve the problem in 1994 by designing the 1995 American League season so that the Orioles are at home on the projected date of Ripken's passing of Gehrig.

1162-> Police Arrest Co-Worker In Slaying Of Woman
A former maintenance worker at a Gap store in mid-Manhattan has been charged in the murder of a 22-year-old assistant manager at the store in January, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said yesterday. The defendant, 20-year-old Anwar Abdul, was arrested three days after the slaying on Jan. 25, but he was released a day later for lack of evidence. Mr. Abdul, who surrendered to the police in Texas on Friday, is expected to arrive in New York on Wednesday. He stands accused of killing Lisa Steinberg shortly before she opened the Gap Kids store at 250 West 57th Street on that Saturday morning. He has also been charged with stealing $3,500 from the store's safe. Matching a Shoe Print Though the initial effort to link Mr. Abdul to the slaying failed, the police said that they later succeeded in accumulating more evidence, including a bloody shoe print found at the scene that was later matched to a shoe that they said Mr. Abdul wore on the day of the killing. A five-month investigation resulted in Mr. Abdul's indictment last week, and prosecutors immediately telephoned his lawyer, Christopher Renfrowe, who arranged for Mr. Abdul to surrender on Friday to the police in Fort Worth, where he was staying with his father. A report by the Chief New York City Medical Examiner said Ms. Steinberg had died from one gunshot wound to the head. The report also said she suffered several stab wounds to the neck, which the police believe were inflicted by a Phillips screwdriver. According to the police, Ms. Steinberg entered the store with the manager at 8:15 A.M. While the manager went downstairs to complete a construction job with two workers, Ms. Steinberg went to her office in the rear of the first floor to prepare for the store's opening at 10 A.M. Bleeding From the Head When the manager returned a few minutes before 10 A.M., he found Ms. Steinberg bleeding from head and neck wounds on the floor near an open safe. The police said later that Ms. Steinberg's arms had been secured behind her with duct tape. The police said Mr. Abdul had no record of previous arrests except for evading a subway fare. Steven Boyle, an assistant manager at the store, declined to answer any questions or say when Mr. Abdul had been hired. Prosecutors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Abdul, who lived at 729 Greene Avenue in Brooklyn, had worked in the store on Friday and was scheduled to be off on Saturday. But they said he hid in the store Friday night and confronted Ms. Steinberg after she entered her office alone. In a statement, Mr. Morgenthau said Mr. Abdul stabbed Ms. Steinberg in the neck and shot her once in the head. Mr. Morgenthau said Mr. Abdul then took about $3,500 from the opened safe and escaped unnoticed. After Mr. Abdul was arrested and then released, the police said he traveled to Fort Worth to live with his father. Detectives left yesterday to take him into custody and are expected to return with him on Wednesday so he can face arraignment.

1163-> Coalition Files Suit in Incinerator Dispute
A coalition of Bronx community groups filed suit yesterday, charging that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection directed Bronx-Lebanon Hospital to file false information about its ownership of a new medical-waste incinerator. The three-story incinerator, built and operated by the Remtech Corporation, was designed to burn 48 tons of waste from surgical and infectious-disease procedures a day. The Bronx Clean Air Coalition, which filed the suit, said that the incinerator, in Port Morris, would pollute the South Bronx. The coalition said the environmental agencies directed the hospital, which says it owns the incinerator, and Remtech, which the coalition believes to be the owner, "to refile permit applications containing false information that mischaracterized ownership arrangements of the project." Under city law, by next January only the city or a medical organization will be allowed to operate or build a new incinerator.

Dillon, Read & Company said it had tentatively priced a $350 million revenue bond issue by the New York Thruway Authority yesterday with a maximum yield of 6.022 percent for a 5.5 percent bond due in 2023. Shorter-maturity serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.75 percent for an issue due in 1994 to 4.7 percent in 1997, 5.5 percent in 2002, and 6 percent in 2007. Other longer-term bonds included a yield of 6.08 percent for an issue due in 2012 and 6.13 percent for another due in 2019. The bonds are backed by the revenue generated by the toll road system and are rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's, except for the term bond due in 2023, which is covered by a policy from the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company protecting interest and principal payments, giving the issue an AAA rating from both rating services.

1166-> ON BASEBALL; Again, Maddox Gets Himself in Position
Bill White, the National League president who will leave office March 31, has never been at ease with his crown. Maybe that's because White is in a job he thought he had to take, for the cause, if you will, on behalf of all the minorities he figured would be shut out if he, the first black to be offered so lofty a position, had said no. Since saying yes, though, White admittedly has not been comfortable working in a bureaucracy. He has chafed at authority and in relations with journalists, making for three and a half years of obvious disillusionment. The man who has frankly stated that the league wanted a black president now states a desire that the job be given to someone else, choosing not to seek a second term. The league and White should learn a lesson from this disheartening experience. The owners and the incumbent should advise any would-be successor that the candidate should truly want the job, not take it because of a noble obligation to assume the role. For the frustrations built into the often thankless and somewhat nebulous position demand of its holder a greater capacity and tolerance than the reluctant should be asked to give. How many viable candidates the league and its search committee have has not been revealed. Two names have, however, surfaced. Bob Watson, the former major league first baseman and now an accomplished assistant general manager with the Houston Astros, is a man that White has publicly championed as a possible successor. Watson has recently stated, however, that he wants to continue preparing to be a general manager. But, Watson has also said, if he were called upon by owners to succeed White, he would do it. Then there is Garry Maddox, the former Gold Glove winner who was known as the Secretary of Defense for his prowess in center field and who is now a successful Philadelphia businessman. Maddox, a former San Francisco Giant and Philadelphia Phillie, is not waiting to be drafted. He very much wants to be the president of the league and has publicly said so. Maddox has consulted with both a past league president (Chub Feeney) and a man familiar with the position (Bill Giles, son of the former league president Warren Giles as well as owner of the Phillies and Maddox's former employer). So far, Maddox says, there is nothing in the parameters described by those men that he believes would disqualify him. "Bill says that the main thing they're interested in is having the National League president be an ambassador, someone who will promote the game, the league and its interests," Maddox said. "They also want someone who is capable of receiving instructions from the owners and go about carrying out the decisions made." Maddox, who will turn 43 in September, says he has the energy, the time and the desire to do all of that, and more. Can he run an organization? "I started a company -- World Wide Concessions -- the year before I retired and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business," Maddox asserted. "That teaches you a lot about responsibility, especially in these times. People's livelihoods depend on you." Can he survive the politics of major league baseball or, more important, brace for questions of race and the accompanying inference that he will be given special consideration because he is black? "The way I see it, you can spend your time butting heads or you can do your job and make some progress," Maddox said. Maddox need only point to his own history to show that he has had that special focus to get the job done. He served in Vietnam but wasn't broken by the experience. Rather, he returned to the United States and rebuilt a career that was derailed by war. And he built a reputation for being a leader on the field, a distinguished force in the clubhouse and in his community. So he looks past questions designed to trip him up, concentrating on the positive, envisioning how to approach problems much the way he envisioned how to approach the line drives that somehow never dropped in the territory he patrolled. His first focus, Maddox said, would be in an area that seems dear to a growing number of baseball executives: how to cultivate new fans in what many now acknowledge to be the forgotten regions of the country, the inner cities. Maddox believes he has the wherewithal to pull together coalitions with corporations to make inroads into these communities. Maddox knows he would have to be a presence in other areas. For a league president also serves as a judge in player-umpire disputes and participates in labor negotiations, not only with his league's umpires but with players. "I am aware of the issues confronting baseball; I know the owners and the players and know where the lines are drawn," said Maddox, who joined in negotiations during the acrimonious 50-day strike in 1981 and, ironically, sat across the table from Feeney. Maddox said that, as president, he would make a strong push to be invited by the owners to participate in the process. Will he be given a chance? Well, history shows that no Secretary of Defense has ever gone on to become President of the United States. President of the National League? Perhaps, if Maddox keeps the focus, and the faith that someone who really wants the job will be deemed capable of doing it well.

1167-> TRAVEL ADVISORY; Aztec Show Heads West
Visitors to the Denver Museum of Natural History this fall and winter will walk through a re-creation of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the city founded in the central valley of Mexico in the 14th century. An exhibit opening Sept. 22, "Aztec: The World of Moctezuma," will present daily life from the agricultural outskirts to the great marketplace and the heart of the city, the Great Temple. Museum officials say that it will be the most comprehensive show ever presented outside Mexico on the Aztec people and that it will include nearly 300 national treasures from Mexico illustrating life in Tenochtitlan just before the arrival of the Spanish explorer Hernan Cortes in 1519. The 40,000-square-foot exhibit will include artifacts ranging from simple ceramic vessels and tools used by farmers to magnificent stone carvings. Admission to the Aztec exhibit, which will continue until Feb. 21, 1993, is included in the museum's admission fee: $7.50, $5.50 for children aged 4 to 12 and people 65 and over. Reservations for the exhibit are recommended and can be made, from July 1, by calling (800) 944-2245 or (303) 370-8333.

1168-> Newark Police Start Plan With Safe Streets the Goal
Struggling to take back the streets from unruly young people, the Newark Police Department has announced a summer program to put more officers on neighborhood foot patrol and break up clusters of idle teen-agers, many of whom are arrested repeatedly in stolen cars. The start of the program today comes two days after the latest cops-and-robbers auto-theft showdown in Essex County, where Newark and other communities are experiencing an epidemic of car theft. Four Newark teen-agers led West Orange police officers on a three-mile chase Saturday night that ended when one patrolman fired five times at the car's engine and tires, the West Orange police said. The officer fired after the driver of the stolen car rammed a police cruiser three times, then turned the car toward the officer and tried to run him down, said Deputy Chief Robert Spina. The officer suffered a sprained ankle but no one else was hurt. Newark's crime-prevention program will focus on "quality-of-life problems" like noise and "hanging out" as well as the dangerous antics of joy riders and the trafficking of low-level drug dealers. The commander of the task force, Capt. Richard J. Fanning, said the idea was simply "to clear the corners and make the streets safer." Reinforcing Borders He said the program, called Saturation and Visibility Enforcement, or Save, would take 64 officers from other details and assign them to patrol on foot, scooter, Jeep or horseback in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program, which will continue until Sept. 11, will be coordinated with a reconstituted 22-member vice squad, which was disbanded about a year-and-a-half ago because of staffing shortages and budget cuts, Captain Fanning said. To aid in the crackdown, Newark officers will walk beats along the city's borders with officers of the adjoining communities, Irvington, East Orange and Elizabeth. "Usually when they're being followed, they just jump across the border," Captain Fanning said, describing the jurisdictional problems the towns have encountered in capturing suspects. "Now, we hope to cut down on those who slip by." Perhaps the most difficult issue for the police in Newark has been the increasing number of cars stolen by teen-agers, who often taunt officers, ram patrol cars or drive erratically at high speed hoping to provoke a chase. In the last few years, stolen vehicles have figured in several fatal accidents involving bystanders and uninvolved motorists, as well as police officers and the young thieves. Shooting of Newark Youth Two weeks ago, a car theft suspect, Howard Caesar, 17, of Newark, was shot and critically wounded after emerging from a car that was being watched by the police. Six officers were suspended after admitting that they failed to file complete or truthful reports regarding the incident. One officer admitted firing warning shots, in violation of departmental guidelines. It is still not clear who shot Mr. Caesar, who remains hospitalized in critical condition. In West Orange, the actions of Officer Rocco Montesano, who fired five shots on Saturday at the stolen 1991 Honda, are subject to review by the West Orange Police Department and by the Essex County Prosecutor, under state guidelines. But Deputy Chief Spina said the department was satisfied that Officer Montesano had acted within state guidelines for the use of force because he felt his life was threatened when the youths drove the car toward him. Deputy Chief Spina said the four teen-agers were being held at the Essex County Youth House pending hearings in Family Court. They are charged as juveniles with attempted murder and conspiracy in the possession of stolen property, aggravated assault and resisting arrest. The 13-year-old driver had been arrested twice before in West Orange on stolen-car charges, Chief Spina said, and one of the passengers had been arrested once before on similar charges.

1169-> Plan Gains for Outdoor Cafe At Site in Union Square Park
Union Square Park would get a 200-seat, tablecloth-and-umbrella outdoor cafe, perhaps as early as this summer, under a plan that cleared several critical hurdles last week. The cafe would occupy a sunken plaza at the northern end of the park, in front of an elegant, dilapidated pavilion that was built 60 years ago as a bandstand but that is now used for a park office and restrooms. Open five or six months a year, weather permitting, the cafe would be run by the proprietors of the Coffee Shop, a popular restaurant at Union Square West and 16th Street. Approvals were voted by the New York City Art Commission on Monday, by the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation on Thursday morning and by Community Board 5 on Thursday night. 'A Great Improvement' "It's definitely a great improvement," said Betsy Gotbaum, the city's Parks Commissioner. "It looks very pretty, it's something the public will love and it's certainly a nice example of how you can do a public-private partnership." One of the restaurateurs, Eric Petterson, said, "We felt you could do something magical in Union Square, something European." He described the pricing as "moderate," adding that the restaurant would also work in tandem with the nearby greenmarket. Besides the 200 seats for paying customers, there would be 40 or 50 seats and tables for the public, set apart from the dining area by planters. The public tables would not have tablecloths or umbrellas. Two new structures, each one 24 by 10 feet, would be built on either side of the staircase leading to the central arch in the pavilion. One would be a cappuccino or soda bar while the other would be a kitchen. The architect is F. Eric Goshow of Goshow Associates. The pavilion could not be used because it is too deteriorated, Mr. Goshow said. The new structures are not meant as permanent buildings, he added, but as an interim measure before the pavilion itself is restored. An Eight-Year Lease Mr. Petterson and his partners, Carolyn Effer-Benitez and Charles Milite, would have an eight-year lease from the Parks and Recreation Department and pay the greater of a fixed rent or a percentage of the gross. The rent would rise from $25,000 to $35,000 over the term of the lease and the take of the gross from 3.5 percent to 6 percent. Perhaps the most critical issue in discussions of the project was that of "privatizing" the park. Indeed, a condition of the community board's approval was that the "applicant give further consideration to the seating to allow much more availability and capacity for the public without a necessary purchase." But Mr. Petterson said 200 seats were needed for the enterprise to make economic sense, given the limited season in which it would operate and the fact that "in an outdoor cafe, people love to sit and sit and sit." Ms. Gotbaum said she was not troubled by the size of the privately controlled area because "there is enough public space" elsewhere around the park. She said there were about 15 to 20 large food concessions in parks citywide, in addition to many small stands and pushcarts. The Art Commission, which approves works of art and architecture on city property, supported the project unanimously. "We think it is a very nice treatment and we're looking forward to it," said Vincent Millicent Warfield, the executive director.

1170-> CONSUMER RATES; Money Funds' Yields Down, Hurt by the Fed's Rate Cut
Money market fund yields dropped in the latest week, according to IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Analysts said the Federal Reserve's cut in short-term interest rates two weeks ago continued to put pressure on fund yields. Tax-exempt money funds suffered another sharp drop in yields. A number of investors who suddenly redeemed their municipal-bond holdings because of lower interest rates rushed to park that fresh cash in money-market funds. This forced yields down as the supply of short-term tax-exempt paper tightened. In taxable funds, yields are down more as a direct result of the recent Fed easing on other short-term investments like Treasury bills, Federal funds and commercial paper. 'Out There on the Yield Curve' The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 16 basis points, to 2.09 percent, while the simple yield eased 17 basis points, to 2.06 percent. Over the course of 30 days the compounded and simple average yields each fell 12 basis basis points, to 2.34 percent and 2.31 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Donoghue's said assets of tax-exempt money funds rose by $4.4 billion, to a total of $97.3 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios fell 1, to 63, which analysts still called a long stretch. "That the portfolio managers are out there on the yield curve for this long a period of time also indicates that they are not fearful of interest rates suddenly going back up and taking them for a loss," said Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist. For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 2.9 percent, while the equivalent for those investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.02 percent. In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market funds, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson in Milwaukee, gave the best return for the fourth straight week, at 2.99 percent. Yields in taxable money-market funds fell again, as assets rose $4.5 billion, to a total of $493.3 billion. Donoghue's analysts said it was right in line with how the gain was broken down. Institutional assets accounted for all the gain as they moved into money-market funds from other investments to the tune of $5.3 billion, for a total of $172.5 billion. Retail Assets Decline On the other hand, the public pulled out $800 million from the so-called retail money-fund assets to seek higher yields elsewhere, perhaps in bond funds, analysts said. Retail assets thus fell to a total of $320.8 billion. The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.29 percent, down 12 basis points, while the simple yield fell 11 basis points, to 3.24 percent. Over a 30-day period the compounded average yield is down 5 basis points, to 3.42 percent, and the simple is down 4 basis points, to 3.37 percent. Analysts said the average days to maturity of securities in portfolios rose one day, to 63. Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation in Detroit, again turned in the best yield for the week, at 4.12 percent, down 15 basis points from a week ago. The fund absorbs expenses and reflects it by offering a higher yield. For the purpose of comparison, the average yield of a bank money-market account, the prime competitor of money funds, dropped 6 basis points, to 3.18 percent.

1171-> COMPANY NEWS; SUNRISE TECHNOLOGIES GETS A U.S. CLEARANCE FOR LASER
Sunrise Technologies shares gained 20 percent on the news that the Food and Drug Administration had cleared the Fremont, Calif., company to sell its laser system to treat patients with glaucoma in doctors' offices. The Slase 210 Holmium Laser System is already approved for general, orthopedic and spine surgery. For glaucoma, it is used to create a duct to dispel abnormal pressure in the eye. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sunrise jumped $1.625, to $9.625. Analysts noted that Sunrise and American Dental Laser were in arbitration over a contract under which Sunrise makes a dental laser using ADL technology. ADL, of Troy, Mich., sells the device worldwide. The companies disagree on the number of lasers ADL must order in 1992.

1172-> SPORTS PEOPLE: BASKETBALL; Sanderson: From the Paint to Preserving
WIMP SANDERSON, the former basketball coach at Alabama, has a new job with Great Southern Wood Preserving, a producer of pressure-treated wood products based in Abbeville, Ala. JIMMY RANE, president of Great Southern, announced Sanderson's appointment to the company's public relations department in a news release yesterday. Sanderson recently began assisting in the development of new corporate accounts and working with Great Southern's dealer relations program. Sanderson quit the coaching job at Alabama on May 18 after reports surfaced that he had struck a female administrative assistant, NANCY WATTS.

1173-> Sebokeng Journal; Bullied by Its Own Young, the Township Festers
Dr. Josiah Musundwa practices family medicine in a sector of this black township popularly known as Beirut. These days he finds the name alarmingly apt. It is not just the teen-age revolutionary poseurs who rule the neighborhoods, hijacking and burning cars, digging anti-tank trenches, turning away ambulances and terrorizing local residents. It is not just the mountain of uncollected garbage that festers outside his waiting room, or the broken sewer pipes that spew rivers of human filth into the streets because the authorities refuse to send in repair crews. Worse than that, the doctor said, is the sense, new in these last few months, that this black township and others in the industrial heartland called the Vaal Triangle, are deteriorating into a state near anarchy. 'Are We Mad?' "It's almost a free-for-all now," the doctor mused, between examinations of the few patients still willing to brave the streets. "You don't know whether it's political or the thugs or whatever. It almost has created an element of insanity where you find all the basic structures in the community are collapsing. "You even ask yourself, are we mad to be surviving in an area like this one?" This morning township residents stared mutely at a cavalcade of yellow armored transports, part of a contingent of 5,000 policemen and soldiers ordered into Sebokeng and 13 other black townships in what the authorities called a "peace offensive" aimed at quelling violence and restoring basic services. The settlement seemed to be of two minds about the security forces: the majority who regard them with suspicion, and assume their arrival heralds fresh conflict, and the rest who regard them with secret, guarded relief, but know the violence will resume as soon as they leave. In an alternative approach to the deterioration of order here, white authorities and black civic leaders agreed this week to send a joint task force of local residents and "low-profile" police with sanitation workers in an effort to repair sewers before a threatened outbreak of cholera. Sanitation workers say workmen have been stoned and vehicles burned in recent months. Revolt of the Teen-Agers But some participants questioned whether the black leaders had any better hope of stabilizing the township disorder than the police. This time the chaos, which residents and officials say is the worst to hit the Vaal Triangle since 1984, is not the perennial eruption of black protest, or the more recent rivalry among black political factions. It is, many believe, a kind of wild mutiny of a lost generation raised to adolescence without prospects or discipline. "There is a serious concern, even if one reached an agreement with the parents, whether the kids will listen to them," said S. Nigel Mandy, an urban planner retained by the Transvaal Provincial Administration, which subsidizes services to black townships. "We're talking today about a crisis of ungovernability." Black political leaders here insist that white authorities have exaggerated the disorder to excuse their own neglect of black neighborhoods and to justify a heavier police presence. The townships of the Vaal Triangle have a long history of unrest. In 1984 residents of Sebokeng, which has a population of about 350,000, and three other townships began a boycott of rent and utility payments that lasted seven years. Many of the garbage heaps date back to this strike. Then last year fighting broke out here between African National Congress backers and those of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party. Residents say things took a wrenching turn for the worse last month, after a massacre in nearby Boipatong township. Local youths took to the streets in a frenzied defense that soon degenerated into opportunistic violence. Leaders of the Sebokeng branch of the African National Congress insist the street barricades and teen-age "defense units" represent not anarchy but a precaution against assassins from rival groups and the police. Local residents, however, are not so sure. They refer to their self-appointed defenders as "com-tsotsi," a wry combination of "comrade," the township badge of militancy, and "tsotsi," the township slang for thug. "It's really losing the political direction," said Alec Shabalala, chairman of the African National Congress in the Vaal Triangle region. "After Boipatong, it has just spilled over. Now you have people who exploit the situation to do their personal things. You have these youths who take a car, drive around, and when the fuel is finished they burn it." The Bills Aren't Paid A less obvious symptom of the anarchy, the local authorities say, is that people have again stopped paying their utility bills; only one in five township households now pays for electricity, water and sewers, Mr. Mandy said, although the formal boycott ended more than a year ago. Some Sebokeng residents said this wildcat boycott was forced on them by the "com-tsotsis," who went house to house threatening those who paid their utility bills. In the long term, the Government and black leaders agree that the only hope for making such townships liveable is to merge them with white municipalities, which have the tax base to underwrite better services. But the white cities want nothing to do with black settlements that refuse to pay their taxes, not to mention burning the city's repair trucks. "Nobody expected the process to be easy," said Mr. Mandy, who has been trying to negotiate mergers of white and black areas. "But perhaps we didn't expect it to be quite so self-destructive."

1174-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 3 Men's Magazines Seek Higher Profiles
Three magazines aimed at men are introducing campaigns seeking to burnish their images with advertisers. A campaign for Field & Stream and Outdoor Life, two Times Mirror magazines that compete in the men's outdoor market, acknowledges that agency media buyers might disdain their readers. Print advertisements, created by Earle Palmer Brown/Bergelt Litchfield in New York, carry the headlines "Men you love to hate and why you should support them" and "When they make you mad as hell how can they be so attractive?" The answers? In both cases, "They're just the men you're looking for." The magazines' readers "don't spend their time wearing camouflage and hiding in trees," said Brendan Banaham, publisher of both titles. And M, the Fairchild Publications magazine that competes in the men's fashion and life-style market, will introduce a print campaign that portrays its readers as "modern men." Howard Chalk, president and creative director of Chalk & Partners Ltd. in New York, the magazine's agency, said the campaign was intended to help bring mainstream advertisers into M's pages. The ads will appear in trade publications and on telephone kiosks in Manhattan. The initial ad, featuring the August issue with John F. Kennedy Jr. on the cover, carries the theme "The sensibilities of M magazine. What modern men respond to."

1175-> TRAINING CAMP REPORT
Atlanta Falcons The Falcons came to terms with their second first-round draft choice, running back Tony Smith of Southern Mississippi, leaving their first choice, offensive lineman Bob Whitfield of Stanford (No. 8 over all) still without a contract. Smith (No. 19) signed a three-year deal, but the terms weren't disclosed. Indianapolis Colts The negotiations were described as close, but backup quarterback Jack Trudeau remained unsigned yesterday, as did second-round draft pick Ashley Ambrose, a defensive back from Mississippi Valley State. Coach Ted Marchibroda seemed unconcerned about either absence, partly because Ambrose was not expected to make an immediate impact anyway; partly because starting quarterback Jeff George has been coming along nicely under the tutelage of the head coach, a quarterback specialist, and partly because Marchibroda has two other backup quarterbacks in camp, Mark Herrmann, and Tom Tupa, a Plan B acquisition from Phoenix. Los Angeles Rams Call him an innovative traditionalist, but it didn't take long for the Rams' new coach, Chuck Knox, to come up with a bright idea for improving the offensive line. He switched Tom Newberry from center to guard and Bern Brostek from guard to center. "We just think Brostek is a center and Newberry is a guard," Knox explained. Neither player has argued with the switch, perhaps because until former Coach John Robinson switched them last year, Brostek had spent five years as a center, including four college years at Washington, and Newberry had been an All-Pro guard in two of his six pro seasons. Cincinnati Bengals With the departure of Ickey Woods (released because of knee injuries) and James Brooks (gone to Cleveland on Plan B), the running back position has been up for grabs, and if quarterback Boomer Esiason knows his stuff, Derrick Fenner, a Plan B acquisition from Seattle, has a firm grip on it. "He looks super out there on the field," Esiason said. "And the nice thing about him is he pays attention to detail. You have to wonder what he was doing on Plan B." A mediocre season with the Seahawks (267 yards on 91 carries) may have been a factor, even though Fenner insists 1991 was an aberration after his big, 15-touchdown season in 1990. "It just seemed like from the first week of camp things didn't click last year," he said. This year things seem to be clicking for Fenner, but with a total of six running backs to choose from, it is Coach Dave Shula who will make the decision, and Shula seems just a bit more cautious than Esiason. "So far he's picked things up pretty well," Shula said, "but there's still a lot of water under the bridge." Shula's major worry yesterday wasn't multiple running backs but a single wide receiver, Eddie Brown, who was lost for the season with a neck injury. Brown, a seven-year veteran who led the team with 59 catches for 827 yards last year, will undergo surgery next week to repair a ruptured cervical disk. Houston Oilers If you make it a point to change channels when they turn to sports on the evening news so you can watch the taped coverage of the Olympics with a measure of suspense, you might want to skip this item. For it seems that the outcome of Sunday's Oilers-Cowboys game in Japan is a forgone conclusion, at least to Oiler Coach Jack Pardee. "You can expect a high-scoring game," he said, suggesting that the Oilers would do the bulk of the scoring. "I suppose the Cowboys will probably score, too," he added, "but we're going to kill them on Sunday." Dallas Cowboys And what does Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson have to say about that? "I'll let you decide on Sunday whether Jack Pardee is a liar or someone who can make great predictions," he said. Well hush your puppies, but based on some early indicators, the Oilers may in fact have an edge, at least in a quarterback-to-quarterback matchup in adventurous eating. Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who played (and lost) in Japan in a 1988 College All-Star Game, doesn't have the stomach for raw fish. "Sorry," he said, "until they fry it, I won't eat sushi." By contrast, Houston quarterback Warren Moon, who made a promptional visit to Japan last spring, has an international palate and doesn't care who knows it. "I like sushi," he said. "In fact, I'm having sushi for dinner tonight."

1177-> Man Trapped in Car by Body on Roof
A North Arlington man was trapped in his car for 20 minutes after another man fell to his death from a Garden State Parkway overpass landing on the roof of his car, the state police said today. Joseph Frajkor, 45 years old, was trapped inside his 1987 Dodge after an unidentified man in his 20's crushed his car roof about 5:25 P.M. Saturday, Trooper Larry Reboli said. Mr. Frajkor was treated for minor cuts and bruises at University Hospital in Newark. His wife, Georgianne, 44, who was driving the car, was not seriously injured. The state police were not able to identify the male victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

1178-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; AC&R Is Hoping Creativity Can Stimulate Its Recovery
DID AC&R Advertising hire Paul Cappelli to provide a next generation of leadership for the turmoil-racked agency, or was it to spur provocative debate on pressing industry issues among its top executives? A recent visit to AC&R's office in midtown Manhattan suggested that the answer, to paraphrase the old Certs commercials, is: Stop! They're both right. As Mr. Cappelli joined Alvin Chereskin, chairman and chief executive, and Harry J. Koenig, vice chairman and chief operating officer, for a wide-ranging interview, they often seemed to forget that a visitor was present as they frankly discussed advertising topics, from creativity to the care and feeding of clients. It was their first interview since April, when Mr. Cappelli, 36 years old, who had been senior vice president and deputy creative director on the flagship Coca-Cola account at McCann-Erickson New York, announced that he would join AC&R as executive vice president and executive creative director. "The one thing that brought me here," Mr. Cappelli said, "is that this is one of the very few places still run by a creative guy." He was referring to Mr. Chereskin, who has spent 42 years in advertising. "If you're not going to sell creatively, why spend the money?" asked Mr. Cappelli, whose cadences and inflections are evocative of the comedian Jackie Mason. "Send up a blimp; it'd be more cost-effective." Mr. Chereskin expressed a qualm: Once the word "creative" is uttered by agency executives, "it usually means to clients 'more expensive.' " But Mr. Cappelli jumped in, saying that while clients are more sophisticated these days, consumers are even more sophisticated. "Thirty seconds after watching the biggest whiz-bang visual feast ever seen," he said, "they want to see something better." AC&R handles glossy accounts like Estee Lauder cosmetics, Seiko watches and Aruba tourism, as well as more prosaic ones like the Foot Locker shoe store chain. In the past couple of years, the agency, founded as Alvin Chereskin & Rose in 1965, has had some severe jolts; when Mr. Chereskin talked of how America was "going through a bad, bad patch," he might have been talking about his agency. AC&R was damaged by the departure of executives like Stephen Rose, formerly chairman, and Patrick King, formerly president; the closing of its entertainment division in Los Angeles, and the loss of several large accounts that forced layoffs and sent billings plunging to $150 million, from $360 million. Last fall, when AC&R's long-running efforts to buy itself back from its British parent, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., failed, the agency was merged with another New York-based Saatchi shop, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. But AC&R operates as an autonomous unit, maintaining a separate office and competing with Backer's American operations. "We're alive and well," Mr. Chereskin said, to which Mr. Koenig interjected, "and happy." Billings have risen to about $185 million, Mr. Koenig said, thanks to recent new accounts like the Howard Johnson lodging chain and new campaigns for clients like the Filtered Water Service Corporation, a New York water-supply outfit being renamed Snowbird. And AC&R is "back to being profitable," he added. Mr. Cappelli, like many executives at scaled-back agencies, tried making a virtue out of necessity, describing AC&R as "a lean shop" and adding, "The fewer people you have in the decision-making process, the better the work can be." He praised Mr. Chereskin and Mr. Koenig "for allowing me to reshape and re-create the creative work at AC&R and take it into the future." To illustrate, he played a reel of new television commercials that were, indeed, fresh and distinctive. For Foot Locker, a campaign aimed at large regional markets features fast-paced spots filled with colorful local references; for Texas, an armadillo appears, while for New York, King Kong is glimpsed atop the Empire State Building. And for Lorus, a Seiko watch line, commercials spoof overly complicated timepieces by depicting wacky watches like one with a tiny vial of breath spray attached. The smarmy announcer's unctuous pitch: "Quartz accuracy never tasted this good!" The same might soon be said for AC&R's creativity.

1179-> Car Dealer's Projects Face Challenges
A group of environmental lawyers and a state legislator, frustrated by the Brookhaven Town Board's approval of projects proposed by John McNamara during the last decade, plans to challenge those approvals in light of Mr. McNamara's admission last week that he bribed town officials for their support. Mr. McNamara, a car dealer and developer, has also admitted swindling General Motors out of $436 million by borrowing money for vehicles that did not exist. He is cooperating in a sweeping Federal investigation of corruption in Brookhaven. Lawsuit Not Ruled Out "We feel that all those permits that McNamara was involved with should be null and void, or at least opened up for examination again," said Joel R. Kupferman of the Huntington-based Environmental Law Project. Mr. Kupferman said he would not rule out asking the courts to review the Town Board's decisions, but would prefer to avoid a lawsuit. He said that the group would challenge the zoning decisions under Article 78 of the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules, which allows for judicial review of governmental or administrative decisions. Denise Molia, the Brookhaven Town Attorney, did not return a reporter's call today. But James M. Catterson, the Suffolk County District Attorney, called Article 78 "a proper remedy to correct poor judgment. "If I indicted someone and convicted them for taking a bribe, that could be a basis for a set-aside of the zoning under Article 78," he said. The challenge of the zoning approvals for Mr. McNamara raises questions about the mechanisms of oversight for local officials. Some critics of Brookhaven government are wondering whether the State Legislature should play a role in overseeing local government, or adopt legislation allowing for citizens to initiate investigations of governmental misdeeds. Mr. McNamara has already forfeited virtually all his holdings to the Federal Government. But if the challenge of his zoning approvals is successful, it could significantly reduce the value of those holdings and put the Federal Government in the position of arguing to retain variances of questionable merit. Dominic DiNapoli, the special trustee appointed by the Federal Government to handle the liquidation of Mr. McNamara's assets, said, "Certainly, if zonings were challenged and then changed, it would hurt the values of the properties." But he added that he had not yet learned of any possible reviews of Mr. McNamara's properties. The precise number of Mr. McNamara's holdings in Brookhaven was not available today; a web of 70 corporations he owns is believed to hold roughly 100 properties around the world. Assemblyman Steven Engelbright, a Democrat from Brookhaven, said one of the major parcels to be challenged would be Rocky Point Meadows, a parcel bounded on three sides by state forests, and now zoned for condominiums. Mr. Engelbright, a member of the State Legislature's Commission on Water Resource Needs for Long Island, said that many of Mr. McNamara's Long Island properties were in the Pine Barrens, areas protected under a recent court ruling that barred development pending study of the impact of construction on the Island's water supply. He called the Town Board's approval of Rocky Point Meadows development "an extremely controversial decision, which involved a tremendous amount of resistance from the community." "I don't know for sure which properties he has linked in his confessions to specific town officials," Mr. Engelbright said, "but I believe that the commission has an interest on behalf of all the people to press for the legal set-aside of any decision that was influenced by his bribes." Arthur Kunz, director of the Suffolk County Planning Department, noted that in roughly three out of four cases, his department had objected to zoning variances and other exceptions Mr. McNamara had sought for his properties. In one instance, county planners rejected a proposal to build a 795-unit apartment complex sandwiched between a fireworks factory and a county landfill in Yaphank. The Brookhaven Town Board overrode the Planning Department and approved the zoning, as it did every time Mr. McNamara appeared before it. "I just wondered where he was getting the backing, how he was getting all this land," Mr. Kunz recalled. "We all wondered somewhat." The planner said he favored a review of the approvals granted against his office's recommendations. The challenges do not all involve properties Mr. McNamara has already built. In many instances, Mr. Kupferman said, Mr. McNamara purchased properties, won changes in zoning for commercial development and resold the properties at enormous profit. The Yaphank apartment complex, for example, grew entangled in Mr. McNamara's financial difficulties, and was never built. Mr. Catterson, who worked closely with Mr. McNamara on the campaign of Mr. Engelbright's opponent in the last election, defended his record. He said overseeing zoning was "primarily an obligation of the town and not of the District Attorney." "When we receive a complaint, we move," Mr. Catterson said. His office had begun an investigation of Mr. McNamara late last year, and had announced no wrongdoing by the time Federal investigators began their own work.

1180-> WHERE TO FIND IT; Gaining a Perspective on Binoculars
BINOCULARS played a leading role in the Alfred Hitchcock movie "Rear Window," in which a convalescing photographer spies on a neighbor whom he suspects of murder. Most people use them for more conventional pursuits, like looking at birds, football games and even stars. "You can actually see nebulae with binoculars if you know how to use them," said Lloyd Malsin, the owner of Clairmont-Nichols Inc., a New York opticians' firm specializing in binocular and telescope repairs. But you will not see much of anything if your binoculars are misaligned or in need of a cleaning, two of the biggest problems that owners can have with binoculars. Binoculars usually lose their collimation -- the alignment of the lenses -- when they are dropped. "Binoculars have two sets of optics," Mr. Malsin explained. "The brain needs to receive an image equal in size and height through each eye." If the binoculars' interior prisms are disturbed, misalignment occurs. Cleaning is necessary for a variety of reasons. Dust and moisture can seep into binoculars. Even fungus thrives. "We see binoculars with seeds and spores growing inside," Mr. Malsin said. You can often spot dust and fungus by looking into the binoculars the wrong way. Clairmont-Nichols, opened by Mr. Malsin's great-grandfather in 1885, replaces and realigns prisms, grinds lenses and cleans binoculars. The company also replaces or repairs binocular accessories. Cleanings start at $30; recollimation costs $40 to $60. Telescopes present a different and costlier set of problems. The worst that can happen is for the front objective lens to break, which usually occurs when the telescope is dropped. Mechanical defects can also hamper the focusing mechanism. Telescope repairs start at around $80. Sometimes the problem is with the viewer. "It takes the average person between three and six months to learn to use a telescope," said Mr. Malsin, a member of the Amateur Astronomers Association. He suggested that new stargazers invest in a modest telescope before getting a top-flight model. Avoiding the Oven "People tend to be overprotective of their binoculars," said Carl Mayher, the owner of Charles Mayher & Son, a binocular-repair business in Cary, Ill., since 1921. It is best to wear binoculars around the neck, he said. Many binoculars sent to Mr. Mayher for repairs had got wet in the rain or had been dropped in water, a big problem even for waterproof models. "If water builds up around the lenses, it can seep in and create fogging," Mr. Mayher said. Though fog eventually clears up, binoculars will not have their original clarity without a cleaning. If binoculars get wet, it is best to keep them moist in a zip-lock bag while awaiting repair. "A lot of damage occurs after they dry out," Mr. Mayher said. The worst thing to do is dry them in an oven. "People do that occasionally," he chuckled. "It's a disaster." A viewer should be able to use a pair of binoculars with good optics for eight or nine hours without eye fatigue, Mr. Mayher said. "But you can't do that with the kind that cost $29.95," he said. Binocular repairs start at $30; a complete cleaning ranges from $56 to $100. Mr. Mayher also repairs opera glasses. Ties to Galileo Binoculars and modern telescopes descended from Galileo's telescope. Most of the older binoculars that come in for repairs at the F. C. Meichsner Company, a 76-year-old binocular- and telescope-repair company in Boston, usually date from around World War I. "They won't perform as well as contemporary instruments, but they still work," said Syd Smith, a salesman. Older telescopes also tend to be more troublesome, often because they have been incorrectly repaired in the past. Mr. Smith recently dealt with a 40-year-old British telescope that had been soldered in the wrong place during a previous modification. Binocular repairs and alignments start at $35; telescope repairs, at $50. Here's Where CLAIRMONT-NICHOLS INC. 1016 First Avenue at East 56th Street, New York 10022; (212) 758-2346.

At least 10 people have died in flash floods that drenched the Philippine capital, causing mudslides, flooding streets and snarling traffic, officials said today. The rains struck at the height of the evening rush hour Tuesday and continued through the night. In suburban Quezon City, the rains washed away a wall at a golf course, unleashing a torrent of mud and debris that crashed down on squatter shanties on a hill near a creek.

1183-> 1.1% Growth in World Economy Seen
After experiencing no growth last year, the world economy will expand only 1.1 percent this year and accelerate to a merely respectable 3 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund predicted today. But even that 3 percent means that the recovery will be weaker than most other postwar rebounds, the fund added in its semiannual economic forecast, making clear that the global economy would largely parallel the ups and downs of the United States, which accounts for 25 percent of world output. "Notwithstanding signs of recovery in the industrial countries, the expansion continues to be slow and uneven, and the balance of risks remains on the downside," the report said. Debt Burdens Pose Risks Those risks include depressed consumer confidence and the large debt burdens that have discouraged many households and businesses in the wealthy nations from increasing spending. These factors helped push the monetary fund to revise downward the estimates for world growth it made in May. At that time, the I.M.F. said the world economy would expand by 1.4 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 1993. The report, called the World Economic Outlook, said the United States economy was being spurred by low interest rates and would grow by 1.9 percent this year over last year, and by 3.1 percent next year. Because of stronger than expected growth in the first quarter, the fund raised its estimate for American growth this year from the 1.6 percent estimate it made in May. The fund said inflation in the United States would be 2.7 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, down from 4.1 percent last year. The fund forecasts a 16.8 percent plunge in output in the countries of the former Soviet bloc this year, a big factor depressing world growth. The fund said growth in several of these countries would soon start to pick up, and it foresees a 4.5 percent drop in output for them next year. The brightest news in the report was the strong growth anticipated for the developing world, which the fund said would grow by 6.2 percent this year and the same next year, compared with 3.3 percent last year. That compares with a forecast of 1.7 percent growth in the industrialized world this year, and 2.9 percent next year. Growth in Developing Nations Developing nations have grown strongly, despite the weak international environment, because many have adopted successful reforms like reducing inflation, privatizing state industry and creating incentives for private investment. "During the recent period of sluggish global growth, the successful reformers have registered sustained and relatively rapid increases in output," said report. "They key to their performance has been determined efforts to reduce fiscal deficts and to control inflation." Those countries have also been helped by agreements that have reduced their debt burdens and by lower short-term interest rates that have lightened their debt service. Pointing to the link between economic reform and growth, the report said Latin American countries that had made widespread changes -- many of which had been prescribed by the monetary fund -- would grow by 4.4 percent this year, while those that had not were expected to grow by 1.8 percent. In Africa, countries that have pursued reforms are expected to grow by 4.1 percent, while those that have not will grow by 1.7 percent, the fund said. "There are very great regional differences in the performance of developing countries," Michael Mussa, the fund's chief economist, said at a news conference today. Developing countries in Asia are expected to grow by 6.6 percent, those in Africa by 3.3 percent. In blunt language, the report urged the United States to slash its $320 billion budget deficit, which it said was undermining growth by sapping consumer and business confidence and pushing up long-term interest rates in America and beyond. The report called on Washington not just to cut spending to reduce the deficit, but also to raise taxes. The deficit "is a factor that is limiting investment and growth in the U.S. economy and is having similar effect on the world economy," Mr. Mussa said.

1184-> Wall Street; Politics Aside, Some Bet Their Convictions
Gerry Dodson, money manager at the Parnassus Fund, says he has no idea what the Presidential candidates mean by the popular phrase "family values." But his socially conscious mutual fund buys companies with "human values," said Mr. Dodson, including nontraditional life styles. Mr. Dodson owns shares of Baldor Electric, an electric motor company that began a literacy program rather than fire workers when computerization demanded better reading skills. Another Parnassus holding: Cummins Engine, which paid for architects to spiff up public buildings in its hometown, Columbus, Ind. Richard Perkins, a money manager in Wysetta, Minn., added that "education is part of this whole family-values thing." Even before all the rhetoric, he owned shares of Education Alternatives, which manages schools. Jim Williams, a thinktank operator in Longmeadow, Mass., said that even as the number of families falls, "the number of children is increasing." He suggests a look at Hasbro and Disney.

1185-> Ex-Players Attend Biasone Funeral
Danny Biasone, a founding member of the National Basketball Association and the man credited with introducing the 24-second shot clock into pro basketball, was buried today in Assumption Cemetery Mausoleum. He died Monday at age 83 after undergoing treatment for liver cancer. His funeral at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church was a reunion for several members of the Syracuse Nationals team Biasone formed in 1946 and owned until it moved to Philadelphia in 1963. Pallbearers included Larry Costello, Paul Seymour, Billy Gabor, Billy Kenville and Dolph Schayes. Also in attendance were Alex Hannum, a former Nationals coach; Satch Sanders, the N.B.A.'s vice president of player programs, and Matt Winick, the league's director of operations, who brought a flower arrangement molded into the shape of a shot clock.

1186-> Cultural Groups Plead With City For More Funds
In an effort to have the $19.7 million recently cut from New York city's culture budget restored, representatives of the 31 cultural institutions that occupy city-owned buildings presented a slide show to members of the City Council yesterday. The presentation included a "Recovery Plan" that showed how the money would be used by cultural groups if the city's financial support were restored to the 1991 level. For example, library hours and programs for children and teen-age mothers would be resumed at the Brooklyn Children's Museum; the fire and safety system at the Studio Museum in Harlem would be repaired and brought into compliance with city codes, and the American Museum of Natural History would rehire 25 "vitally needed" guards and maintenance people. "With this support, we can insure that New York's cultural institutions will continue to stimulate the city's economic revival and to educate and enlighten its citizens," said Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group and president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The City Council is scheduled to vote on the 1993 budget next month.

1187-> Limits Are Urged on Insurers After Storm
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader and J. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, today called for Federal and state action to stop any unwarranted insurance-rate rises. They are seeking to head off any effort by insurers to use the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew as justification for higher rates. Mr. Nader and Mr. Hunter were reacting to an internal memorandum from Jeffrey W. Greenberg, executive vice president of the American International Group, the big insurer, to his company presidents. In the memo, dated Aug. 24, the day the hurricane hit southern Florida, Mr. Greenberg described the storm as "an opportunity to get price increases now." In the memo, copies of which the consumer advocates released today, Mr. Greenberg urged his executives to tell their underwriters to begin preparing clients for an increase. "We must be first, and it begins by establishing the psychology with our own people," he said. "Please get it moving today." Mr. Hunter said he had received a copy of the memo from an executive at another insurance company. Attempts to reach Mr. Greenberg by telephone were unsuccessful today, but American International executives have not disputed the authenticity of the memo. Mr. Greenberg is the son of American International's chairman and chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, who has long advocated an increase in commercial rates, a sector in which prices have been weak for years. Over the weekend, The Washington Post reported that Maurice Greenberg had said the memo conveyed his sentiments completely. American International is a worldwide property and liability insurer, mostly for businesses, and is the No. 5 property and casualty insurer in the United States. Mr. Hunter, the former head of the Federal Insurance Administration under Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, said the insurance industry was overcapitalized now and could well absorb the losses from Hurricane Andrew, with claims as high as $8 billion. He called on the states to "act to head off this outrageous attempt by A.I.G. to increase its already bloated profits." He and Mr. Nader also urged action on a House bill that would further regulate the industry.

1188-> BASEBALL; Bonilla Promises to Come Out Swinging at the Plate and at Attacks
Bobby Bonilla autographed some baseball cards last night in the clubhouse, and considered once again the price of fame in New York City. It was steep, he decided. "I always knew it would be, with this $29 million bull's-eye on my back," Bonilla said before last night's game. The Mets' outfielder was not in uniform, or bull's-eye, at Shea Stadium. He was lounging near his locker. His season -- with its modest .249 batting average, 19 homers and 70 runs batted in -- was a tepid memory. He faced arthroscopic surgery by the team physician, David Altchek, on his right shoulder this morning at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. He was nervous about that. "I'm going into the unknown," he said. "Of course, I'm scared." Bonilla was much bolder when he talked about next season, about his return to the limelight and about the lessons he had learned. He will not be kicked around anymore, he said. Not by the city, or by the news media. 'A Lot of Distractions' "A lot of people expected me to do something that the back of my baseball card never said I could do," Bonilla said. "I felt that. This town is a 24-hour sports center, and there are a lot of distractions." Bonilla said he had been victimized by columnists who rarely came to games and by radio analysts who knew basketball, not baseball. "I've been through it all now," he said. There was that first incident, the telephone call, the one that alienated him from many of the reporters who covered the team. Bonilla called the press box to dispute an official scorer's decision on an error. He told writers and broadcasters later that was not why he called. Bonilla said he would have handled that incident much differently, if he could do it again. He would not have twisted the facts. But he would not have made a post-game confession, either. "I don't have to tell New York City why Bobby Bonilla was on the telephone," he said. "If that happened again, I'd tell the reporters to drop dead. I wouldn't beat around the bush. Then, what could they write?" Bonilla hit just .213 at Shea Stadium this season. He suffered a broken rib back on Aug. 2. Broken down again with his ailing shoulder on the Mets' most recent road trip, Bonilla batted .205 with just two runs batted in. Earlier on in the season, he wore earplugs to drown out the jeers from fans. But he insisted last night that his popularity remained at a high level within the minority community of New York City. He said that he was still a New Yorker, a kid from the hard-edged streets in the Bronx, and that no one was going to bring down his esteem in some parts of the city. "I am embraced by the black and Latin communities," he said. "Just to say I'm playing with this team, it's important to some people. I played at Lehman High School, at 149th Street, at St. Mary's Park, at Throgs Neck. That means a great deal to a lot of New York fans. "I don't second-guess anything I did," he said. "Not the contract, either. Anywhere I would have gone, they would have made me the highest-paid player in the game." Nothing Is Wrong Bonilla said there was nothing mechanically wrong with his game or his swing, other than what the injuries did to his season. Maybe, the grass field took some time to grow on him. That was about it. Bonilla will turn 30 years old in the off season. He will have had this shoulder surgery, the operation that scares him more than the news media. "I can promise you," he said, looking ahead, "Bobby Bonilla will be prepared."

1189-> Mother Who Abandoned Newborn Twins Is Found
In the Brooklyn hospital where they were born, they were being called Baby A and Baby B. That is because 18 hours after their birth on Monday, their mother walked out of the Brooklyn Hospital Center without leaving either child so much as a name. But some of the mystery was solved yesterday afternoon, when the woman apparently turned herself in to the police. By late last night, she had been questioned and released, said Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney's office. Mr. Clark said the authorities would decide whether charges would be filed after further investigation. A law-enforcement official who asked not to be named said the woman came into the 88th Precinct station house voluntarily for questioning about 4 p.m. The source said the woman was 31 years old, from Brooklyn and "extremely distraught." The police "don't know why she left the child behind," Sgt. Edelle James, a police spokeswoman, said last night. "That's what they're trying to find out." She added that the woman had not been charged. During the day, detectives were canvassing the neighborhood and the area around the hospital, hoping to get a lead on the mother's whereabouts. The police went to the address she had given to the hospital, but no one in the building had heard of her. Missing in the Night "I don't think we've ever had a case like this one, where the mother ever just disappeared," said Penny Campanella, the associate director of public affairs for the hospital. The twins, a boy and a girl, were doing fine, she said. "In fact, they're doing very well," she said. "Big babies, nice-size twins, full term." The mystery of Baby A and Baby B began to unfold shortly before 2 A.M. Monday, when a woman calling herself Michelle Cobb entered the Caledonia campus of the hospital in labor. Ten minutes later, she delivered a girl, Baby A, at 5 pounds, 3 ounces. Twenty-one minutes later, at 2:25 A.M., Baby B was born, a boy, 6 pounds, 10 ounces. The woman and her children were transferred to the downtown campus of the hospital. At 11 P.M., a nurse making her rounds there saw that the woman was missing from her bed. Hospital officials eventually realized Ms. Cobb was gone and at 1:20 A.M. called the 88th Precinct. "She never notified the hospital in any way that she was leaving, that she was even considering leaving," Ms. Campanella said. A police spokesman, Detective Ralph Saint Just, said the mother had left about 8 P.M., saying she "wanted to talk to her boyfriend."

1191-> Musical Chairs in New Jersey State Agencies
Yesterday, Libertad Matos's job was investigating citizens' complaints against the state government. Today her job was behind the locked doors of Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, checking to see that patients are not wrongly committed. Shocks like that were felt all over New Jersey today as some 5,000 state employees adjusted to jobs they were "bumped" into by more senior workers during a wave of layoffs. Many have suffered disastrous pay cuts. But many of these people consider themselves the lucky ones despite demotions, the loss of familiar workmates and surroundings and the assignment to strange new tasks. After all, while today was their first day on new, perhaps less desirable jobs, it was also the first day without any jobs at all for the 1,510 workers who were cleared for layoff yesterday when the New Jersey Supreme Court lifted a temporary injunction barring their dismissal. Mrs. Matos is one of 87 employees of the Department of the Public Advocate who were forced to accept demotions or lateral job transfers when the spots they had occupied were eliminated or claimed by more senior people. In addition, 27 people were laid off in the Public Advocate's office, and the state expects to save $582,000 annually because of the changes. New Faces, New Tasks The transferred workers saw their fates differently. Ada Figueroa, who moved to the headquarters office here, missed the company of her friends -- Joanie, Andrea and Shirl -- at her former office in the Department's Mercer County unit. Jennifer Conti, a single parent struggling with parochial-school tuition at Holy Angels here in Trenton, will feel a tighter financial pinch because of her demotion. Mrs. Matos is having to get used to working with severely troubled people, and she may be learning unintended lessons from the experience. "Before, I worked with people who had everyday problems," she said, "a woman who was having trouble getting her Supplemental Social Security or someone who couldn't find day care. Now I'm working with people who are so much sadder, people whose lives are so disorganized, that my woes suddenly seem so unimportant to me." Mrs. Matos has six years with the state and lives with her husband, Cesar, a Trenton High School teacher, and their three children. As a college-trained professional, she earns $37,500 a year after taking a $1,400 pay cut when her Citizens' Complaint section was abolished. Her pay and that of her husband make possible a comfortable life, she said. But still, the cuts will put one dream, a single-family house in the suburbs, farther out of reach. For Brenda Davis, however, the $1,800 cut out of a former salary of $29,000 is harder to bear. She is a single parent with three children, including one daughter in college and another who is also a single parent and often needs some help. 'My First Demotion' "Losing the money hurts," said Ms. Davis, who has worked for the state for 15 years. "I've had to move around before, but I always got a promotion every four or five years. This is my first demotion. It's hard to go backwards when you're used to getting ahead." Ms. Davis had to move up just one floor at the Department of the Public Advocate, and down one grade, from Secretarial Assistant 3 to Secretarial Assistant 2. She says she will manage. "Some people are unhappy because they had to move to places they didn't want to be, some people are just O.K., and some people got positions they had wanted to all along and are fine," she said. "I'm O.K. I have some adjustments to make financially, but I'll be fine." All of the demotions, transfers and layoffs moved across the tidy desk of Kathleen Immordino, the director of personnel for the Department of the Public Advocate. Many of those who stayed found lateral moves that involved no sacrifice, others had a Hobson's choice of a difficult new commute to an unfamiliar job site or no job at all, and some took crushing financial setbacks, Ms. Immordino said. "Those are such difficult choices," Ms. Immordino said. "There were tears, a lot of tears. Some people became hysterical, and we had to stop our interviews until they could get to the point where they could make rational decisions. People got angry, and we had to be patient and not react back at them." Mrs. Figueroa sat behind the elaborate brass desk lamp that denoted her as the Commissioner's receptionist, and she worried. She moved from the same headquarters to the Mercer County unit three years ago in hopes of being insulated from the budget upheavals. But now she is back, having taken a $1,300 pay cut that put her back to $20,000 a year. Her husband, Carlos, she said, faces a possible layoff later this year at the Trane air-conditioning factory. "I really went into depression," she said. "I was hoping for a promotion, and instead I went down. We just purchased a new home, and we were counting on my old salary. It is very anguishing."

1192-> 7.1% Rate for Jobless Unchanged
In a report undermining recent signs of economic revival, the Government said today that business payrolls shrank by 91,000 in January and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 7.1 percent only because of a surge in part-time jobs. The report on labor market conditions was the first comprehensive gauge of economic performance in 1992 and, in an election year, the most politically sensitive of reports. It caused disappointment among private analysts and was seized upon by Congressional Democrats to point up what they saw as Administration failings. The figures also increased the chances, economists said, that the Federal Reserve would shortly decide on another round of interest-rate cuts. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said earlier this week that further rate cuts might be necessary "insurance" for economic recovery. Dismay in Markets The Fed's failure to ease in the immediate wake of the report, however, dismayed the stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.19 points, to close at 3,225.40, and the benchmark 30-year bond, which had risen on the report in apparent hopes of a rate cut, later fell back when none occurred. [ Page 38. ] While today's unemployment report was not unrelievedly bleak, it reflected pronounced weakness last month, prompting some analysts to lower already meager expectations for the immediate future. "The consensus has to move now to a real change in gross domestic product that's down rather than up" for the first quarter, said Walter M. Cadette, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. While Morgan has been more pessimistic than many forecasters of late, other analysts also found little ground for optimism. "These are weak numbers," Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said. "They point to continued stagnation and downside risk for the economy." 'On Thin Ice' On Capitol Hill, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the January job figures portrayed an economy "skating on thin ice" and estimated that the odds of renewed contraction this year had risen to 50-50. Saying prompt action was required to turn the economy around, Senator Bentsen announced that his committee would begin consideration Feb. 25 of growth measures that he said "will help put Americans back to work and our economy back in the race." President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, told the House Budget Committee today that he did not believe the new numbers indicated a renewed downturn. But, he conceded, "it is unlikely there will be an instant turnaround in the economy in the next month or two." Today President Bush signed legislation extending unemployment benefits for a second time, this time by 13 weeks. It has been an issue with great political appeal in this election year and was approved overwhelmingly by Congress on Tuesday. Among the grim numbers, the jobless report today did show a 389,000 rise in jobs, as measured by the Labor Department's survey of households, which reversed a three-month decline. Some analysts dismissed this as a statistical aberration at odds with the 91,000 job decline picked up in the separate payroll survey, but others regarded the development as a bright spot in the report. Where It Would Start Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank, for example, said that even though the increase was entirely in part-time jobs, that is where any improvement in the market would show up first. Hiring part-timers amounts to "testing the waters," he said, adding that if the latest reading is correct "it is possible to see an upward revision to the January payroll data or a catch-up jump in February." The unemployment rate itself is considered a "lagging" indicator since it frequently continues to rise even after recovery is well under way. This is because improved business activity induces many workers who dropped out of the job market to begin to look again, thereby restoring them statistically to the work force. Not all of them, however, are immediately successful in finding new jobs. Today's payroll survey also showed service-job gains of 8,000 in finance and 17,000 in transportation. But there were many more negatives in the report, including a drop of 52,000 in factory payrolls, an unexpected drop of 51,000 in retail trade and an unusually big decline of 39,000 in business services. Job growth in health services, which during 1991 gained an average of almost 40,000 a month, slowed in January to 17,000. Workweek Loses Minutes In addition, the length of the average workweek fell significantly, by 12 minutes for private payrolls as a whole, to 34.3 hours, and by 18 minutes for factories. And the household survey, on which the official unemployment rate is based, also showed a rise of three-tenths of a point, to 6.9 percent, in the jobless rate for adult men. The rate for Hispanic and black workers also rose sharply, to 11.3 percent from 9.7 for Hispanic workers, and to 13.7 percent from 12.7 percent for black workers. The rate for black men, at 13.4 percent, was the highest level since the recession began in July 1990, William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said. Still other weakness was reflected in the lengthening of jobless spells, with the number of people out of work for 15 weeks or more rising by 216,000, to 3,059,000. The average duration of joblessness climbed to 16.4 weeks from 15.3, while the median duration climbed to 8.1 weeks from 7.8. Some recent figures and anecdotal evidence since the January employment survey was conducted three weeks ago suggest that the economy might finally have begun to rebound. Sales of chain stores have risen (although from depressed levels a year earlier), exports remain strong and many automobile dealers and real estate agents are reporting sizable increases in both buyers and "lookers." No Sign of Pickup But while uncertainty remained, today's figures tended to cast doubt on near-term improvement. Maria Ramirez, head of a capital-market consulting firm, said she found no sign of a pickup and was discouraged by the continuing stream of companies announcing layoffs. Forecasters had generally expected a modest rise in payroll jobs last month instead of the 91,000 drop. And a revision in the December figure slashed an initially reported 31,000 gain to just 3,000. Before adjustment for recurring seasonal variation, payrolls fell a thumping 2,337,000. Among the 11 biggest states, Florida posted the biggest change in its jobless rate, which rose 1.2 points, to 8.7 percent. The rate for Illinois fell nine-tenths of a point. For New York, the rate rose to 8.4 percent from 8 percent, but New Jersey saw a decline of the same amount -- to 6.8 percent from 7.2. In New York City, the jobless rate was 10.4 percent last month, up from 9.3 percent in December and 10.2 percent in November, according to the Department's Middle Atlantic regional office. State and local figures gyrate far more than national ones because of smaller samples, officials say. Regionally, unadjusted figures show the jobless rate rose 1.3 points in the South, 1.1 points in the West, 1 point in the Northeast and nine-tenths of a point in the Midwest. Retail Is Disappointment A chief disappointment in the national figures was retail trade, where low holiday-season hiring meant there were relatively few people to leave temporary jobs in January. But the report still showed a big decline, which brought the total number of lost jobs in retailing to about 550,000 since the recession began. Two-thirds of the decline in business payrolls was in just two industries, transportation equipment and industrial machinery, the figures also showed. The index of aggregate weekly hours fell a point, to 120.9, following two straght increases, indicating that industrial output would show a decline for the month when this figure is reported next Friday. The percentage of all industries reporting increases in hiring edged up to 45.1 last month but for manufacturing this percentage fell to 38.8 from 43.2. The labor force rose by 427,000 last month, with 389,000 of these finding jobs of some sort -- one needs to work just one hour a week to be considered employed -- and 38,000 joined the ranks of the jobless. A total of 8,929,000 Americans are now out of work, 2 1/2 million more than when the recession began and the most since 1984.

1196-> COMPANY NEWS; Banks Reject Sole Canary Wharf Bid
Lenders to Olympia & York's Canary Wharf project here have rejected the only firm bid for the troubled real estate development, further clouding the project's future, bankers said today. An executive at one of the banks said that the project's 11 largest creditors, meeting in New York on Monday, had voted 7 to 4 to turn down the bid. The bid had been made this summer by a group including Paul Reichmann, the head of Olympia & York Developments Ltd.; Laurence Tisch, the chairman of CBS Inc. and the Loews Corporation; Lewis Ranieri, the Wall Street investor, and Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the Primerica Corporation. The banks, which are owed $:575 million, or about $980 million, have been divided about the bid since the group put it on the table. The banks opposing it have cited particularly concerns about provisions that would allow the group to get its money back before the banks. The banks were also concerned about making a deal with Mr. Reichmann, who conceived of the project and is widely blamed by the lenders for its problems. Offer Was Lowered The group had lowered its offer a month ago to $:235 million as it became clear that the project was having difficulty finding big-name corporate tenants for its complex of skyscrapers in the London docklands. The group had originally offered to invest as much as $:350 million to help complete the buildings and a planned subway line into the project. The rejection of the bid was first reported today by The Financial Times. Officials of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm appointed by a British court to oversee Canary Wharf after it entered bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, said last month that 10 other potential bidders had expressed some interest in the project. Bankers said today that some of those potential bidders might make serious offers now that the proposal from Mr. Reichmann's group had been rejected. They declined to identify any of the possible bidders. Ernst & Young and the bank group, which is led by Lloyds Bank P.L.C. and Barclays Bank P.L.C., have been hoping to find a buyer or investor to allow the project to be completed. The alternative is to liquidate the project by selling it piecemeal, a strategy that the banks believe would lead to extremely high losses for them at a time when the London commercial real estate market is extremely depressed.

1198-> China's New Turn; Easing of Economic Hard Line Aims At Providing Not Liberty, but Money
Deng Xiaoping is a master strategist in politics, military campaigns and even the game of bridge -- and the recent calls in the official Chinese press for more rapid change seem to reflect his view that the Communist Party needs a new strategy for the future. The new strategy that he and many younger party leaders favor is to worry less about ideological correctness and more about cultivating public support by making people richer, giving them such a stake in the system that they will not challenge it. Of course, if they still do try to take on the Communist Party, there is no doubt that the regime is still prepared to imprison, torture and perhaps kill its enemies. Still, the strategy pushed by Mr. Deng, who at 87 remains the nation's paramount leader, does imply a significant easing of the ideological straitjacket that for more than two years has curbed economic experimentation and paralyzed intellectual and cultural life. Mr. Deng presumably does not intend to give citizens meaningful votes, but rather meaningful stocks and bonds. His goal is not to free the press, but to make the controlled press more realistic and interesting. At issue is the fundamental question of how a Communist state can best survive. Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave power to the people of the Soviet Union, without giving them better sausage, and the people used the power to overthrow him. Mr. Deng, impressed by the lesson, now seems to believe that the greatest threat to Communist rule is not foreign subversion but internal economic frustrations. Call for 'Bolder Reforms' The calls for change continued today with a front-page editorial in People's Daily, also printed in other major papers, headlined, "Be bolder in reforms." "In the course of reform and opening up, we'll come across some problems," today's editorial declared. "We can't rely only on past solutions to resolve these difficulties; we need to boldly delve for new methods. More than ever, this means liberating our thinking, daring to rush forward, daring to act, daring to do what no one else has done before." An even more remarkable article appeared on the front page of Sunday's People's Daily, calling for China to borrow useful elements of capitalism. The Sunday article also suggested that China need not fear Western cultural subversion, but should encourage more exchanges to "enrich our culture." A central part of Mr. Deng's strategy is to shift power to moderates and ease out the hard-liners who have dominated policy in the two-and-a-half years since the Tiananmen crackdown, in which hundreds of pro-democracy protesters were killed. This shift, if it is put into full effect, will have implications for political and cultural policies as well as economics, for the moderates in general seem more squeamish about suppressing dissidents -- although they will do it if they feel a crunch. One Rising Star One such moderate and rising star, for instance, is Zhu Rongji, a hard-driving former Mayor of Shanghai who is now in charge of revitalizing state industry. Mr. Zhu did not use troops to fire on Shanghai student protesters in June 1989, as did the leaders in Beijing, and the subsequent purges in Shanghai were far milder than in Beijing. But Mr. Zhu is no patsy: He showed no compunction about death sentences for democracy protesters who used violence. The problem for the Government is that at this point it is not clear that it can afford to ease the repression. Like Iran in the 1970's or East Germany in the 1980's, the Government has alienated so many people that any new tolerance is likely to be met not by applause and gratitude but by independence protests in Tibet, by demands for the rehabilitation of those who died in the Tiananmen crackdown, and by renewed street demonstrations for democracy or against corruption in Beijing and Shanghai. All this means that while the calls for greater openness can lead to real changes, which would be welcomed by most Chinese, there are fundamental limits as well. The Communist Party is changing strategies for reasons of self-preservation, and it is unlikely to plot its own extinction. Effect on Lower Levels The significance of the calls for change also lies in their effect on officials throughout the nation, particularly in low-level offices where cadres sip tea and glance at the People's Daily and plot self-preservation. Their prime concern is not capitalism or socialism, but simply avoiding trouble. If the present wave of reform consciousness continues, they will pivot. Local economic officials may spend less time trying to gouge extra taxes out of private business people and more time trying to attract foreign investment. Communist Party secretaries at factories may be more enthusiastic about stock issues, dismissals of workers, subcontracting arrangements with private enterprises, even bankruptcies.

1199-> Results Plus TENNIS Washington Beats Connors MaliVai Washington moved within a step of his first professional title when he ended Jimmy Connors's run in the Federal Express International in Memphis with a 6-2, 7-5 semifinal victory. Washington, who is ranked 38th in the world and turned pro in 1989, was to play the winner of last night's match between No. 7 Wayne Ferreira and unseeded Amos Mansdorf. The 14th-seeded Washington, who reached his first career final earlier this year in New Zealand, broke service in the opening game when Conners lobbed long from the baseline and then went on to an easy first set. Connors, seeded 16th and ranked 46th, broke serve to tie the second second set at 5-5, but Washington broke back and served out the match. (AP)
Courier and Becker in Final: Jim Courier and Boris Becker reached the final of the Donnay Indoor championship in Brussels yesterday. Courier, seeded second, advanced with a 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 victory over No. 5 Guy Forget. Becker defeated top-seeded Stefan Edberg, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, and his victory assured Courier of retaining the No. 1 ranking. There was little to choose between No. 3 Becker and Edberg in the first two sets, but the German's serve-and-volley game was too much for Edberg in the third set. (AP) AUTO RACING Earnhardt Wins Goody's Dale Earnhardt, among the favorites for the Daytona 500 today, dominated another crash-filled Goody's 300 yesterday, earning his third victory in as many days. Earnhardt, the career leader in races won at Daytona International Speedway in Florida, drove his Chevrolet to victory by two car lengths over Ernie Irvan, the defending Daytona 500 champion. Earnhardt He has 16 victories on the 2.5-mile track, including five in Grand National competition, and tied Darrell Waltrip's record in the 34-year-old event. Earnhardt was a winner Thursday in a qualifying event and Friday in an IROC race. (AP) GOLF Hart Alone in First Dudley Hart has a one-shot lead after three rounds of the Northern Telecom Open in Tucson, Ariz., but "there are so many guys within striking distance, you blink your eyes and four of them will go by you," the 23-year-old Hart said yesterday. Hart, in his second season on the PGA Tour, moved in front alone with a seven-under-par 65. He goes into the final round of the chase for a $198,000 first prize with nine others within two strokes of his lead. Mike Hulbert, the veteran Ken Green and Bruce Fleisher were a single stroke off the pace, while Curtis Strange led a group of six others at 205. Hart began his run to the top of the leader board with a 5-iron shot that set up a 3-foot putt for eagle-3 on the second hole. He birdied the next hole from 10 feet and reached the turn in 32. He birdied the 10th from about 20 feet, and made a pair of 15-footers on the 14th and 17th holes. (AP) Annoyed Norman Leads: Greg Norman, the six-time champion, was distracted by a noisy gallery, but held onto a one-shot lead at the Australian Masters in Melbourne yesterday and moved closer to his first tournament victory in 20 months. Norman's 71 gave him a three-round total of 210, nine under, but was only a stroke ahead of Peter Senior, the defending champion, and Bradley Hughes.

1200-> An Auto Backup Light That Beeps, Too
Mark Gottlieb, a product design engineer, knows about driveway danger. As a child, he was backed over by his father. "It isn't something you forget," said Mr. Gottlieb, who was not seriously hurt. Now he has designed Back-Up Alert, a replacement automobile backup light that contains a loud beeper. Each year more than 200 people are killed, several thousand are injured and untold numbers of pets are hit by cars backing up. Mr. Gottlieb said his Back-Up Alert is loud enough to warn a child or a pet, but not loud enough to wake the neighbors on a Saturday morning. The device can be installed in 2 to 15 minutes, he said; only one backup light is affected. Mr. Gottlieb invented the alarm after a friend complained about the extensive hard wiring required to rig an audible alarm to a car's reverse gear. Back-Up Alert fits all foreign-made cars and 90 percent of American-made cars, including those with bulbs numbered 1156, 1073, 1076 and 1141. The bulb number can be found in the car manual. Only some Ford and General Motors models are incompatible. A bill introduced in Congress by Representative Joe Kolter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, would make such devices standard equipment on all passenger cars and vans sold in the United States. It is pending in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "Countless deaths in this country have been attributed to vehicles which are in reverse," said Representative Kolter, who drafted the bill after a neighbor backed over and killed his own 4-year-old daughter. "So many lives could be saved if people could only hear that the car is backing up." The Back-Up Alert costs $29.95 and is available in New York at Hammacher Schlemmer, 147 East 57th Street, (212) 421-9000; from the manufacturer, Designtech International, 7401 Fullerton Road, Springfield, Va. 22153, (703) 866-2000, or from the Solutions catalogue, (800) 821-1279).

1201-> Court Upholds New York Ban On Double Subsidy for Heat Cost
A Federal appeals court panel yesterday upheld New York State's ban on providing home heating allowances for poor people living in Government-subsidized housing where heating costs are already paid for as part of the rent. In reversing a lower court ruling, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that to force the state to pay the heating costs of poor people whose monthly rent already covers such costs would be a strain on an already overburdened system. "The question is whether in light of the limited Federal funds available, may aid be given to those the state deems most in need, even though this results in others also in need not being provided for?" Judge Richard J. Cardamone asked in his decision for the court. The answer, he said, was yes. The appeals court decision reversed a ruling by Judge Vincent L. Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Judge Broderick ruled in 1990 that the state could not deny the heating allowances to poor people simply because they lived in Government-subsidized housing. In making his ruling, Judge Broderick said state cuts that eliminated thousands of families from its Home Energy Assistance Program in 1988 violated the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. He said the act required the state, which received the allowances from the Federal Government, to provide heating allowances for every eligible family, including those in subsidized housing. A spokesman for the State Department of Social Services, Terrence McGrath, which regulates the heating subsidies, said the cutback prevented some families from being doubly subsidized for their heat -- first through their rent and then through a direct payment. He said the appeals court's decision affects about 45,000 of the 790,000 families statewide who receive Federal heat subsidies. The subsidies, which range from $150 to $200 a year, totaled $187 million last winter. Michael Hampden, a lawyer for Westchester-Putnam Legal Services, one of the groups that filed the suit, said his organization would have no comment until it had studied the ruling.

1204-> Art Slips on Thin Ice
The chainsaws were buzzing, the planers were planing away the rough spots, the measuring tapes were measuring. Finally, a week late, 35 Chinese ice sculptors were stacking and shaping their giant see-through bricks into two giant melting phoenixes. Creating a pair of birds like the one in ancient Egyptian mythology that consumed itself in fire only to rise from its own ashes, was somehow the right metaphor for a group of artists whose uncertain path to Central Park had been paved with a series of "if onlys": If only the import-export company in New York that promised to pay their way had not gone out of business. If only their tools had not been impounded by customs agents at Kennedy International Airport. And if only it hadn't been so unbearably warm yesterday in Central Park. So maybe this is a story about global warming. Then again, maybe not. One man carrying cross-country skis looked across the Great Lawn yesterday and suggested that the too-warm sculptors should simply peel off a layer of underwear. "In our hometown," responded Anna Wong, a three-year ice-sculpting veteran of the group from Harbin, an industrial city and river port about 800 miles northeast of Beijing, "the temperature is 20 below, Fahrenheit. No, centigrade. No, Fahrenheit." Whatever. It has not been a bleak midwinter in New York. To borrow a line or two from the poet Christina G. Rossetti, there hasn't been much frosty wind moaning. The earth hasn't been as hard as iron, and the water hasn't been like a stone. "Danger -- thin ice," read the sign at the edge of the pond below Belvedere Castle, a few steps from where the ice sculptors were at work. But even in the see-your-breath cold of a 34-degree afternoon, the sculptors had that frustrated look. There they were, masters of an ephemeral medium, carvers who can transform ice into structures with the near-permanence and perfection lacking in a front-lawn Frosty the Snowman. They are keepers of fanciful creatures and snowy flowers, pavilions and frozen tableaus from Chinese legends, strutting peacocks and erupting volcanos. And there they were, shedding their jackets while New Yorkers shivered. Pagodas and Towers of Ice Miss Wong pulled out photographs of pagodas they had built in Canada and towers they had built in Hong Kong. The elaborate architecture was enough to trigger a reader's long memory into summoning up the belle in an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story who kept repeating this rhyme: "It was a miracle of rare device, a sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice." Looking across the landscape, out beyond the nearly barren expanse of the Great Lawn, Miss Wong said it would be a snap to build that kind of pleasure dome, an ice palace as tall as the San Remo, the apartment building with the twin towers at Central Park West and 73d Street. But it was too warm for a building that tall, and there were other problems. "No fork lift," she said. "No scaffold." The group's improbable journey from northern China to Manhattan began when the trading company called the Parks Department, which was planning a winter festival, and offered to pay for their trip. Chris Wangro, a Parks Department official planning the festival, said a figure of $50,000 was mentioned. He asked if the trading company intended to donate that in a way that would cover the sculptors' expenses. "They said, 'No, $50,000 for your personal account.' " End of conversation, he said. And end of the ice escapade until a couple of weeks ago, when the official heard that the sculptors were in New York after all and that the trading company had gone out of business. He started lining up corporate sponsors. What with weather that, even by New York standards, was warm last week, he sent them to a place that felt more like home and where a week in a hotel was cheaper: Platkill, N.Y., near Newburgh. Then, after returning to Manhattan yesterday, Miss Wong discovered another if only: If only people came to Central Park at night. "We put lights into the sculpture," she said. "They say no visitors come to Central Park at night, so we canceled the light. But I think pure light from the moon is better."

1205-> Japan Seeks Ways to Tame Stock Market
Financial industry executives and officials, alarmed about the Japanese stock markets entering its its third year of a deep slump, are contemplating emergency measures that could reverse several years of liberalization and make it harder for foreign brokers to do business in Japan. The measures under discussion range from introducing new restrictions on trading in stock index futures -- the principal source of profits for many foreign brokers in Japan -- to forming a huge fund with contributions from banks and securities houses to inflate share prices with concerted buying, a method last attempted tried here in the 1960's. In a host of speeches, press conferences and leaks to the news media, officials of securities houses, industry associations and the authorities of the stock exchanges have made it clear in recent weeks that they do not intend simply to let market forces take their course. Behind their discussions lies a fundamental question about whether Japan can turn back the clock and intervene to manage its financial markets in an era when capital flows around the globe with increasing freedom. There is also a much quieter concern over the growing profitability of foreign brokerage houses here. They are gaining ground against their much larger but scandal-battered Japanese rivals, the so-called Big Four -- Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi. In the first half of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 6 of the 10 most- profitable firms here were foreign. Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, which reap a substantial portion of their profits through program trading that involves stock index futures, occupied the third and fourth places. The Nikkei index future, representing the value of 225 leading Japanese stocks, permits investors to bet on the market's general direction. In trading, American firms have used their technical advantages to earn tens of millions of dollars in Japan through computer-assisted trading strategies, including program trading. Most traders and brokerage executives say that creation of a stock-buying fund to bolster prices would certainly fail because the market is simply too big to be propped up in this way. Nonetheless, a report on Wednesday by the Mainichi newspaper that such a plan had been discussed contributed to a sharp rebound in share prices. The Nikkei stock index rose 675.82 points on Wednesday, to 21,534.12. Today, the Nikkei was up 46.60 points, a little more than two-tenths of 1 percent, to 21,580.72. Adding urgency is a decline that has brought the Nikkei from a peak of 38,915.87, on the last trading day of 1989, down almost to 20,000. Prices haved slid steadily this year. Many here believe that if the market falls through the 20,000 barrier, it will begin to damage the Japanese economy and perhaps cause panic selling. Most industry executives are betting that the authorities will rein in trading in stock index futures, which some blame for the market's troubles. Thus far, the American firms have been trying to work behind the scenes to block restrictions on their key business here. The possibility of new restrictions in the financial markets comes after President Bush tried to open other Japanese markets to American businesses. Protection for Investors The foreign firms say that futures trading merely reflects and helps investors protect against volatility and that restrictions are unwarranted. "It's shooting the messenger," said Richard Greer, head of the Tokyo office of Baring Securities. "I don't think it would have much effect to restrict the futures market, and in fact, some of the recent measures to restrict it seem to have increased volatility." Mr. Greer added that some trading had simply been driven to Singapore, where another version of the Nikkei stock index futures contract is traded. Tomoko Aikawa, a spokeswoman for Nomura, confirmed reports that representatives of the Big Four held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss market-bolstering measures. Index futures trading, Ms. Aikawa said, "was a very important topic." Creating a fund to mop up stocks was discussed, but was not a serious possibility, she added. "The end result was that they decided to form a working group to take up proposals for regulations and administrative things that could be changed to make it more convenient for the market and for investors," Ms. Aikawa said. The Osaka Stock Exchange, where the key Nikkei futures are traded, has already made it more difficult and expensive to trade stock index futures. The margin, or downpayment, that an investor must make has risen from 9 percent in September 1988, to 30 percent as of last month. The margin rate was increased three times last year. In addition, the exchanges have slowed down the pace at which prices can change, a practice that effectively suspends the stock index futures market when the underlying stock market is volatile. In the rally on Wednesday, traders said, the stock index futures market was suspended more than it was open. Japanese Rush to Sell Many experts insist that some of the measures could do more harm than good by making it more difficult for investors to move in and out of the market. They also say that what ails the Japanese stock market is not some technical problem with stock index futures but the Japanese themselves dumping shares with abandon. According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, institutional investors here were net sellers of 1.78 trillion yen, about $14.35 billion at current exchange rates, worth of stocks in 1991. Investment trusts, the Japanese equivalents of mutual funds, sold a net 1.52 trillion yen of stocks, while nonfinancial corporations sold 1.86 trillion yen worth and individuals sold a net 2.53 trillion yen in stocks. The only big buyers are foreigner investors, who were net purchasers buyers of 5.62 trillion yen of Japanese shares last year.

1206-> BankAmerica Proposal Upsets Washington State
Expressing concern that a combination of the two largest banks in the West would hurt consumers, a legislative committee in Washington state passed a bill today aimed at blocking BankAmerica's acquisition of Security Pacific. "We've got significant concerns about competition, and we're going to be part of the process instead of an observer," said Michael Heavey, a Democrat from West Seattle who is chairman of the House Commerce and Labor Committee, which passed the bill by an 11-to-0 vote. It is unclear what chance the bill has of becoming law and what effect it may have on the merger if it does. Still, the vote is another sign of the antitrust concerns that both state and Federal regulators appear to be having with the $4 billion acquisition, which would create a banking behemoth that would dwarf other Western banks. The transaction, announced in August, is still awaiting approval by the Federal Reserve Board and the Justice Department. In response to such antitrust concerns, the BankAmerica Corporation said last month that it would increase to $7 billion from $4 billion the amount of deposits it would divest itself of after the merger was completed. But if the action in Washington is any indication, the increased divestitures have not mollified all concerns. The Washington bill states that any bank acquisition that results in more than 30 percent of bank deposits being held by a single company would be presumed to violate the state's consumer protection law. BankAmerica, whose acquisition would result in such a market share, would, however, have some opportunity to prove that such a acquisition would not be anti-competitive. The bill would still have to be passed by the entire House and the State Senate. The Senate has so far refused even to consider the bill, but today's action could spur the Senate to act, said Janice Niemi, a Democratic State Senator who is the sponsor of the bill. She said the chances of the bill's passing "have gone from 5 percent to 50 percent." Senator Niemi said the state was convinced that it had the power to block the merger of the banks' operations in Washington, though not in other states. But H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking expert with the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York, said he did not think a state could veto the merger, although that issue had not been tested in court. Mr. Cohen, who is not involved in the BankAmerica acquisition, said Congress, in passing a 1956 banking law, opted against giving states a veto in favor of giving them input into the decision made by the Fed. A BankAmerica spokesman at the banking company's San Francisco headquarters said today that the bank would not speculate on the effect passage of such a bill would have on its plans. It merely said it was confident that it could work things out in negotiations it was now having with the Fed, the Justice Department and with state antitrust regulators. The Associated Press, however, reported that a BankAmerica lobbyist, Joe Brennan, had told the Washington House committee that "this whole merger could fall apart" if the bill became law. Acquisitions in the State BankAmerica and Security Pacific came to dominate banking in Washington state through their purchases in the 1980's of Seafirst, the state's largest bank, and Rainier, the second largest. Together, the two banks control about 49 percent of banking deposits in the state and more than 60 percent in Kings County, which encompasses Seattle, Senator Niemi said. BankAmerica has said it will divest itself of 69 branches with $2.5 billion of deposits in Washington, an amount it said was equal to about 40 percent of Security Pacific's branches and deposits in that state. Opposition has also arisen in Arizona, where the two banks control more than 40 percent of deposits. United States Senator Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat from that state, urged the Federal Reserve last month to reject the merger, saying it would result in "even less pressure on the existing banks to compete for deposits and lend to small businesses." BankAmerica and Security are also, respectively, the largest and second-largest banks in California. But there seems to be less opposition here, in part because there are other large banks in the state. The stocks of both companies slipped a bit today, with BankAmerica losing 25 cents, to $40.375, and Security Pacific falling 62.5 cents, to $33.875.

1208-> HORSE RACING; Long Shots Are Good Bets at Aqueduct
Race tracks aren't famous for omens, but Aqueduct opened its fall season yesterday with a rush of success for long shots, including the 16-1 Wallenda in the Cowdin, the first of the 33 stakes races booked at the track in the next two months. Wallenda outran a smart bunch of nine other 2-year-old colts to win a race that has been won in the past by late-blooming juveniles or by untested ones taking their first strides on the road to the big leagues, like Easy Goer in 1988. But he also extended a winning streak for outsiders that began in the opening race when Nymphist paid $23.80 for a $2 bet to win and that continued in the third race when Miss Tahiti won at $39.80 and that reached a peak in the sixth when Clever Knave scored at $49.80. So, in the temper of the times, Wallenda came along in the eighth race and won at $34.80, enriching both his backers and his barn, Cot Campbell's Dogwood Stable, which went home with $74,160 of the season's first stakes. It was the second victory in seven starts for Wallenda, a son of Gulch trained by Frank Alexander and ridden by Herb McCauley. All those upsets were watched on a gray and chilly afternoon by a modest opening-day audience of 7,887, a couple of thousand short of the daily average reported at Belmont Park during its autumn meeting, which ended Monday. But most of the big horses in the business were already headed for Florida, where the $10 million Breeders' Cup series of seven races will be held Oct. 31 at Gulfstream Park. The Cowdin was embroiled at the start when the December Hill Farm's colt Dr. Alfoos stumbled and pitched Eddie Maple head over heels. Maple, who is 43 years old and one of the senior riding stars, was taken to Long Island Jewish Hospital for X-rays but was walking later and apparently not severely hurt. The spill caused some jamming, but it did not involve the even-money favorite, Wild Zone, who shot into the lead and held it for most of the distance. He was chased by Boodgie Boy and Wallenda, but in the homestretch it turned into a two-horse race that Wallenda won in the final yards by half a length over Wild Zone, with seven lengths of daylight between them and Darien Deacon. Alexander said later that his colt had a wayward past but a promising future. He won't run in the Breeders' Cup, but he will make the Remsen Stakes on Nov. 14, and who knows where he will be next spring at Kentucky Derby time? "It took a while to get him to where he was paying attention in races," the trainer said. "I think he'll be a better horse the farther they go." -------------------- Arazi Enters 2 Breeders' Races Arazi, the toast of two continents at this time last year, was among 112 horses pre-entered in the seven Breeders' Cup races. In fact, he was booked for two of them: the Mile race on the grass, which is his cup of tea, and the Classic at a mile and a quarter on the dirt, which might not be. The decision must be made when horses are formally entered next Wednesday. His co-owner, Allen Paulson, said the decision would be made by Francois Boutin, the colt's trainer, after Arazi worked out at Gulfstream next Wednesday. "I think he'd be a shoo-in for the Mile on our terms," Paulson said. "But I'll leave it to Francois. We might go for the mile and a quarter on dirt to prove to the world that he can do it." The highest price to enter the Breeders' Cup was paid by Verne Winchell of California, who shelled out $360,000 as the supplemental fee for Sea Cadet, winner of the Meadowlands Cup last Friday. The horse was not nominated for the Breeders' Cup at birth, so his owner had to pay 12 percent of the $3 million purse for the Classic to run him against Pleasant Tap, A.P. Indy, Strike the Gold and possibly Arazi.

1209-> Dow Up 4.70 In Resuming Its Advance
After a one-day pause, the stock market resumed its daily record-setting yesterday, as investors, unable to find better returns elsewhere, continued to beat a path to equities. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.70 points, to 3,204.83, its seventh record in eight sessions. Don Hays, director of investment strategy for Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, said he was amazed at the amount of money pouring out of bank certificates of deposit and money market funds that has found its way into this market. "There are people who have never invested in stocks before, sticking their toes in," he said. Action on the New York Stock Exchange was choppy and the volume heavy, as 252.8 million shares were traded, up from 251.2 million on Monday. Gaining issues narrowly outpaced losers, 916 to 881. Small Issues Lead the Way For the most part, lower interest rates and belief that the economy will recover continue to buoy the market, with smaller issues leading the march. Other indexes achieving highs included the Nasdaq composite, which rose 4.39 points to close at 602.29, and the American Stock Exchange composite, up 2.44 points, to 401.71. The Russell 2,000, another barometer of small stocks, also finished at a high of 195.77, up 1.40 points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell short yesterday and slipped 0.56 point to end the session at 417.40. While Monday's downside close on the Dow, its first since mid-December, and weak stock performances in the London and Japanese markets injected a note of caution at the beginning of yesterday's session, the stock market managed to erase its early losses by late morning. For most of day the market gained, then lost, then gained again in a late flurry to carry it to new highs. Mr. Hays called the market very fragmented. "If you were in the right stocks, you made money, but some stocks have already started their correction. Technical factors in the market tell us that we may have from a one-to-10-week correction taking place." While there is indeed a lot of money coming in from small investors, Mr. Hays said there was another side to the coin. Many investors who made large profits last year and cashed in, large investors nervous over corporate earnings and a still-weak economy are pulling at the market from the other direction. Analysts expect some investors to move to the sidelines ahead of economic news expected out later this week. On Thursday the December Producer Price Index figures will be released, and on Friday, employment numbers. Elsewhere in the market, Dow Chemical, which fell in Monday trading after the Food and Drug Administration urged a moratorium on the use and shipments of silicone breast implants, rebounded smartly yesterday, moving up 2 3/4, to 54 5/8, as James H. Wilbur, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham, repeated a buy recommendation based on the stock's price decline following the F.D.A.'s announcement. Dow Chemical and Corning Inc. jointly own Dow Corning Wright, which makes implants. Retailing Is Weak Among the actively traded issues was the Gap, which is one of the few retailers that analysts have recommended. The stock fell 2 1/4, to 56 3/4, and served as a reminder of the weakness in the retail sector, traders said. DNA Plant Technology nearly doubled, rising 4, to 8 1/2, after it announced that its joint venture with Du Pont, Intermountain Canola, was producing a brand of canola oil with only 6 percent saturated fat. Cooking oils represent a $3 billion market. Borland InternationalBORL.O fell 1 3/4, to 78 1/4, as Christopher Mortenson, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, lowered his third- and fourth-quarter earnings estimates for the computer software products manufacturer. Traders, however, said he had reiterated his buy recommendation. I.B.M., one of the bluest of the blue- chip issues, was up 2 1/4, to 94 5/8, yesterday. Many analysts noted that the stock had been overly beaten up at the end of last year, and that the price might have dropped low enough to become attractive.

1210-> I.R.S. Details Withholding On Retirement Withdrawals
Workers who take early withdrawals from employer-sponsored retirement plans will be subject to tax withholding even if the money is needed for an emergency, the Internal Revenue Service has ruled. The I.R.S. said Congress had given it no authority to allow a hardship exclusion, even though many pre-retirement withdrawals are made to pay medical costs and meet other emergencies. Other workers take an early withdrawal when they change jobs. The announcement was made on Tuesday as the I.R.S. proposed regulations spelling out how a new law imposing 20 percent withholding on lump-sum pension distributions from 401(k), profit-sharing and other retirement plans would be administered. The law was passed in July to help finance an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, but they could be amended after an I.R.S. hearing scheduled for Jan. 15. 20% to Be Withheld The new law requires employers to withhold for taxes 20 percent of lump-sum distributions unless the money is shifted directly into a new pension or an individual retirement account. Under the old law, a person could take a lump-sum distribution once a year and incur no immediate tax liability or penalty so long as the money was rolled over into another I.R.A. or pension account within 60 days. Any money not rolled over is subject to immediate taxation, plus a 10 percent penalty if the withdrawal is by a person under 59 1/2 years of age. Some tax experts expressed surprise that the I.R.S. did not allow special treatment of hardship withdrawals. But Andy Zuckerman of the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Washington said the real problem is the new law, not the I.R.S. regulation. "If you withdraw, have 20 percent withheld and later decide to put the money into an I.R.A. or into a plan of another employer, you'd only have 80 percent to roll over and you'd have to write a check for the remainder," Mr. Zuckerman said today. On the other hand, he said, "it probably will cause people to leave the money in their retirement plan longer." "If you consider taking the money to buy that Corvette or take that vacation," he said, "this will force you to realize you are losing 20 percent right off the bat unless you roll it over."

1214-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview; Bush Pulls Close in Poll, but Not With Women
The Republican National Convention propelled President Bush into a competitive position with Gov. Bill Clinton today, but the newly renominated Mr. Bush also confronted the sudden re-emergence of a split between men and women in support of his ticket, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. The poll, taken overnight among 500 registered voters, seemed to put the Presidential race in a virtual dead heat, although the results were considered somewhat less reliable than most polls that question more people and last several days. As the race ended the nominating phase and moved into a head-to-head contest that will include as many as three Presidential debates, Mr. Bush left Houston today for a three-day Southern campaign swing sounding combative. "They say Clinton has a good reaction squad," he shouted at a final rally here before heading off to Mississippi to resume his attack on Mr. Clinton and the Democrats in Congress. "We're going to give them plenty to react to, every single minute." [ Page 8. ] Mr. Bush clearly got some of what he had wanted from his convention. The new poll showed Mr. Clinton ahead of Mr. Bush by 45 percent to 42 percent, compared with his lead of 52 percent to 35 percent before the convention. The margin of sampling error in the nationwide telephone poll last night was plus or minus five percentage points. At 14 points, Mr. Bush's post-convention surge, significantly smaller than Mr. Clinton's own 24-point boost after his convention, was about average for a Presidential candidate, according to a historical analysis provided by the Gallup Organization. Gender Gap Growing Both sides said that the results of polls like this one, conducted immediately after a dramatic event, can be fleeting. And there were several warning signs for the President's re-election team that tempered the results. One that suddenly re-emerged after disappearing following the Democratic convention in July was the gap between men and women voters: women favored Mr. Clinton over Mr. Bush by a significant margin, while men were shifting to Mr. Bush by a smaller margin. Although Mr. Bush's all-but-inevitable post-convention bounce was somewhat larger than had been expected, his low job-performance ratings remained virtually unchanged. His overall image was somewhat improved, but on balance, voters still said they had an unfavorable opinion of him. No Impact on Congress After four days in which the Republicans suggested that working mothers made the wrong choice, demanded a ban on abortion and launched a strong personal attack on Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the number of Americans who said Mr. Bush was mostly on the attack and not explaining his positions increased. And despite the heavy focus on attacking Congress at the Republican convention, voters did not indicate any change in whom they planned to vote for, with the Democrats slightly favored. When asked whom they would vote for in their House district, without reference to names on any ballot, 43 percent said they would vote for the Democratic candidate; 37 percent said they would vote for the Republican. But the poll also showed that voters' views of Mr. Clinton had shifted from positive to slightly negative. After four days of Mr. Clinton's punching back at Mr. Bush from outside the convention, the number who thought Mr. Clinton was doing more attacking than talking about his own positions had risen slightly, although most still said he was primarily promoting his own ideas. Mr. Bush made clear in a farewell talk to party leaders here today that he did not intend to slow his assault on Mr. Clinton. In an unusually blunt preview of his fall campaign strategy, Mr. Bush announced that he also planned to step up his assault on Congress by traveling to Congressional districts and attacking individual lawmakers. That strategy, used by Harry S. Truman in 1948 and by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, carries the risk of making Mr. Bush appear even more negative in his campaigning. Campaign strategists said that Mr. Bush's targets would include Democratic leaders and the 12 Democrats who had co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, which Mr. Bush supports, and then voted against the measure on the House floor this summer. Guilt by Association Mr. Bush said his goal would be to link Mr. Clinton with Congress in voters' minds and to tar the Democrat with the scandals and mismanagement on Capitol Hill. "Let them try to sever that umbilical cord," Mr. Bush said, chopping at the air with his hands. The President's campaign strategists were heartened by the polls and by his decision to include economic proposals, however vague, in his acceptance speech after months of indecision and inaction at the White House. "That gives us something to run on the rest of the way that provides the most dramatic contrast with Clinton," Charles Black, a senior campaign strategist, said as the Bush team headed back to Washington to prepare for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to take over the White House staff and the campaign operation on Monday. "It's clear we seized momentum at this convention and that we've made this a competitive race," Mr. Black said. But he tried to temper his enthusiasm, given the expectation in the Bush and Clinton camps that Mr. Bush may slip back in the polls a bit, perhaps as early as this weekend, as the glow of the convention fades. In 1980, when President Jimmy Carter's handling of the economy had the same low approval among voters as Mr. Bush's performance, the race between Mr. Carter and Ronald Reagan also was in a dead heat after the incumbent Democrat's convention. "The convention reminds people of the differences between Republicans and Democrats, and what they like about having Republicans in the White House, and what makes them hesitant about having Democrats in the White House," Mr. Black said. "But the personal numbers are something entirely different." The Clinton campaign's internal polling also reflected Mr. Bush's surge from the convention, Clinton aides said. But the Democrats took heart from other findings that suggested, as the New York Times/CBS News poll did, that voters still give Mr. Bush's performance poor reviews. Only 40 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush had handled his job, essentially unchanged from 38 percent who held that opinion in a poll taken before the convention. "Bush may have helped himself in the short run, but he's left himself with a lot of long-term vulnerabilities," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "His job-performance rating is still low." In the last three Presidential elections, the Republican candidate has won despite having considerably less support among women than among men. But this is the year of family values, and Republican and Democratic strategists alike suggested that Mr. Bush was feeling the effects of the convention's offensive on that front. At times, that offensive turned into a biting assault on the lives led by Mr. Clinton and his wife, who did not give up her legal career when she had a child. Throughout the campaign, there has been no consistent difference in support for Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton among men and women. After the Democratic convention in July, public opinion polls showed no split between the sexes. But the new poll showed that men now say they favor Mr. Bush over Mr. Clinton by 47 percent to 40 percent, while women favor Mr. Clinton by 49 percent to 37 percent. The re-emergence of a gap between men and women was due almost entirely to a shift by men toward Mr. Bush. Before the Republican convention, men gave Mr. Clinton a 19-point margin of support, while women similarly gave him a 15-point margin. But in Thursday's polling men had shifted to give Mr. Bush a 7-point margin, while women had remained with Mr. Clinton by a 12-point margin. Although attacks on homosexuals emerged as a central part of the family-values theme at the convention, the poll results suggest that the Republicans may have a hard time using that in the campaign. While 50 percent of adults said homosexuality should not be considered an acceptable way of life, 79 percent said in a separate question that homosexuals should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities. On to the Debates Two other national polls that included interviewing on Thursday also showed a tightening contest, although to a lesser degree. An ABC News poll of 469 likely voters surveyed on Thursday showed a 9-point Clinton lead. A Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today taken Wednesday and Thursday, based on 801 registered voters, showed a 12-point Clinton advantage. Each result was narrower than the respective polling organization's pre-convention sounding. With the conventions behind them, the next major milestone the candidates are facing is the debates. Mr. Bush has accepted Mr. Clinton's challenge for the traditional debates, but he has not formally agreed to dates or conditions for the encounters. The Commission on Presidential Debates, an unofficial bipartisan group that sponsored the 1988 campaign debates, has proposed three 90-minute, nationally televised Presidential debates and one Vice-Presidential debate this year. The group wants to replace the familiar panel of journalists with one moderator to encourage give-and-take between the candidates. How the Poll Was Conducted The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday evening with 656 adults around the United States, exclud ing Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 500 said they were registered voters. The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its popu lation. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers werethen screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relat ing to region, race, sex, age and educa tion. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than five percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all regis tered voters in the country. The potential sampling error for small er subgroups is larger. For example, for results based on men it is plus or minus seven percentage points, while for wom en it is six percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the prac tical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. And polls conducted in just one night can be subject to further error because of the limited time available to call back respondents who are difficult to reach.

1218-> ALBERTVILLE; I.O.C. May Recognize Former Soviet Republics
Twelve republics of the former Soviet Union are likely to be able to field their own Olympic teams in Games beginning after Jan. 1, 1993, the president of the International Olympic Committee said today. For the republics to qualify, the I.O.C. must first officially recognize the national Olympic committees of the republics, said the I.O.C. leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch. This could happen as soon as early March, when Olympic officials are scheduled to meet representatives of the national Olympic committees in Lausanne, Switzerland. In addition, the republics must agree to participate in international competitions this year as a "Unified Team," as five former republics of the Soviet Union are doing at the Albertville Winter Games that begin Saturday, Samaranch said. The plan offers something to everyone. Olympic Ranks Swelling For the republics, it allows them more time to organize their committees and teams before they have to face the international spotlight alone. For the I.O.C., there is more time to work out how to handle the swelling number of potential Olympic participants; besides the 12 republics of the former Soviet Union, the committee has added Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Slovenia and Croatia, which have broken from Yugoslavia. At a news conference today, Samaranch noted that the ranks of national Olympic committees could approach 200 by the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996. He reiterated that he wanted to keep the number of athletes below 10,500 in the Summer Games. As a result, he said, it could be necessary to restrict the number of participants in track and field and swimming, meaning some smaller countries will have to drop out of competition. But making it more difficult to play in the Olympics is not so bad, Samaranch suggested. Improved competition could reduce the occasions where athletes straggle in "five laps after the last finisher." Three Big Topics In the wide-ranging news conference, Samaranch addressed most of the hottest topics facing the committee: *South Africa will participate fully in the Barcelona Summer Games. *No blood testing of athletes to detect banned substances will occur in Albertville. *I.O.C. members are "worrying" about terrorist attacks in Spain but Samaranch has "every confidence" in the ability of the Spanish Government to take adequate security measures. Samaranch also said the I.O.C. would investigate an exhibit in a museum in Banyoles outside of Barcelona, the site of the summer rowing competition. The exhibit includes the stuffed body of an African tribesman and has proven offensive to many Africans and black Americans. Inquiry on Spying ALBERTVILLE, France, Feb. 7 (Reuters) -- German bobsledder Harald Czudaj has admitted he spied for the East German secret police and will be quizzed by German Olympic officials at the Winter Games, the delegation leader, Willi Daume, said today. Czudaj, one of the favorites to win the gold medal in the four-man bobsled, admitted in a confidential letter that he had reported on teammates to the Stasi secret police, Daume told a news conference. But Daume said no disciplinary action would be taken against Czudaj, who is still training in Germany, until he was given the chance to explain himself. He said this might be done by telephone or after Czudaj arrived in France for the Games, probably Feb. 15.

1220-> POSTINGS: 'Millionaire's Row'; A Campus Castle for Sale
King's College in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., is selling its campus, including the three stately homes that lie along its "Millionaire's Row." The sale of a 15-bedroom stone castle on 11 acres, an imposing, six-bedroom white-frame colonial on 13 acres and a smaller colonial on 1.75 acres are among the steps in the college's move to Warwick, N.Y., in the summer of 1993. For 40 years, the 83-acre campus has been in Briarcliff Manor, which was created at the turn of the century as one of the nation's first planned communities and a playground for the wealthy. The 19,640-square-foot castle, which includes a 2,000-square-foot ballroom, was the home of Walter Law, the town's founder. Most recently used as a dormitory, its offering price is $2.5 million. The large colonial, with 10,000 square feet, is called Braeview and is the King's College president's home. It is priced at $3.5 million. The small one, with 4,000 square feet, is called the Gronauer House and is priced at $475,000. It now is used for administrative offices. It also has an operating room, which was installed during World War II by a doctor who planned to treat casualties that might have occurred had New York been attacked. The three properties are being offered by the Briarcliff Manor office of Houlihan/Lawrence. The rest of the campus, with eight buildings, is being offered for sale at $33.5 million.

1221-> OUR TOWNS; Students' Lives, Improvised on Stage
THE students gathered in the auditorium for 75 morning minutes of chemistry experiments. But these two periods had nothing to do with Bunsen burners, breakable beakers and sulfurous smells. The basic elements were 85 middle school pupils -- seventh and eighth graders -- mixed with 16 high school juniors and seniors. The catalyst was Barry Halpin, a former comedian and joke writer turned social worker using improvised drama. It looked like fun. It sounded like fun. It certainly couldn't be a palatable setup for learning. Here's the problem: While all kinds of American families remain skilled at making babies, parents seem less adept at or interested in raising them. The distractions are many, from an obsession with the accouterments of affluence to an obsession with drugs and alcohol, from the crumbling of the traditional nuclear family to the demands of time, emotion and finances in two-career or single-parent households, with and without jobs. Lynda Hautala, principal of Dolan Middle School up on Toms Road here, estimates that fewer than half of her 800 pupils live in two-parent households. A fair number of these 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds go home after school to care for preschool siblings and to start dinner. "This age is very impressionable," the school veteran said. "They're dealing with issues from the usual teen problems -- Should I phone that boy? Does she really like me? -- to heavy-duty predicaments -- Should I have sex, should I try drugs, what about AIDS and who's caring for me?" Any void of values in these children, who may not yet have the most penetrating analytical skills, is filled by the cool factor, what they see older peers doing or, perhaps, during a teacher-free school assembly. Enter, stage left, Mr. Halpin and his merry band of actors. About 50 times a year this troupe of Stamford High drama students visits schools in the area, performing skits and songs that appear totally impromptu. The youths seem engagingly giddy, frequently clever and sometimes adolescently silly. There's a guitarist and a pianist and a panoply of those immense speakers that sprout wherever teen-agers assemble. There's the big but slightly dim football player who thinks a major national problem is the need for better sports gear. There's the cheerleader who's just the perkiest, happiest girl you've ever seen. One cringing boy seems terminally shy around girls. There's somebody's sensible sister and a boy and girl who act like parents, meaning they lay down the laws they didn't follow when they were young. One thing there isn't is an adult lecturing. Even Barry, who at 41 is a certified grown-up, has no last name here. He's on and off the stage in his faded jeans just to help, obviously. He suggests music to start, which is acceptable to everyone. "O.K.," he says to the audience, which is assembly-apprehensive, "let's try to stump these high school kids. How many of you have problems talking with your parents?" Funny how Barry phrases that; it's not, "Do you have problems?" Most hands go up. Barry doesn't count them. "Gimme some problems." They come, slowly at first, then faster. Parent complains about too much television. Too early a curfew or bedtime. "So whaddya do?" Barry asks. "Stall? Of course." No dating allowed. Insufficient allowance. The list is long. Then Barry seeks types of music. "Rap!" someone shouts. "Good," replies Barry, who also seems to hear rock, country, blues, opera, elevator and heavy metal called out. The troupe must then sing about the youths' problems in those musical styles. Rock draws chuckles. So does opera. Heavy metal, which involves some chair throwing, brings the house down. Another act features an angry confrontation between a defiant girl and her worried parents. At the height of the shouting Barry interrupts. "How could they resolve these problems?" he asks the audience. "Smack her!" "No," says Barry, "our family doesn't smack each other." "Get a divorce!" Teachers cringe. Barry seems ready: "There's a lot of that. Maybe there's another way." Guess what? After calm thinking, another solution emerges. The family members discuss their mutual fears. Each one listens carefully. Then they compromise. The girl gets some trial freedoms. She needn't run away to the city, boys or drugs. Loud applause. Return to class, still lecture-free. Later, a teacher, Mary Jo Pittoni, wonders if some Dolan pupils would like to form a values drama group like the one these cool high school kids have. The new group would perform in elementary schools. Mrs. Pittoni hoped for 20 volunteers. She got 56.

1223-> Paper Will Stop Using Indian Names of Teams
This city's daily newspaper has decided to stop publishing Indian-related names of sports teams. The paper, The Oregonian, which has a circulation of more than 317,000 daily and more than 431,000 on Sundays, reported the new policy in a statement to its staff on Friday. The statement said that the paper would drop references to nicknames that might be offensive to ethnic or religious groups; that specifically the names "Braves," "Redskins," "Indians" and "Redmen" -- used by St. John's University in Queens -- would be dropped starting on Sunday, and that other names may be added to the list later. The statement, issued by the paper's editor, William A. Hilliard, said such names "tend to perpetuate stereotypes that damage the dignity and self-respect of many people in our society and that this harm far transcends any innocent entertainment or promotional value these names may have." It added, "The Oregonian is sensitive to the feelings of those in our society who are rightly offended today by names and nicknames that came into being when a majority in this country was insensitive to minority concerns." Mr. Hilliard and other editors at The Oregonian declined to comment on the new policy, which is to be announced to readers in the Sunday issue. Presumably, teams that have such nicknames will be referred to only by the names of their home cities, colleges or schools. Praise From Indian Group The decision was praised by Clyde Bellecourt, a founder of the Minneapolis-based American Indian Movement and a spokesman for the newly formed National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media. "It's going to take things like this to keep this rolling," he said. "I'm really excited about something like this happening." Bob DiBiasio, a spokesman for the Cleveland Indians baseball team, called the move an "interesting idea." But he said his team's name had "historical significance." The manual that the Indians distribute to reporters and broadcasters covering the team says that the name was chosen in a 1914 newspaper contest and that it referred to a former member of the club, Louis F. Sockalexis, a Penobscot Indian from Maine. Sockalexis, the first American Indian in major league baseball, played for Cleveland from 1897 to 1899. He died in 1913. The paper's decision follows protests by American Indians against Indian-related sports names. The issue has lingered for years but has drawn new notice because of the Washington Redskins' appearance in the Super Bowl last month and the Atlanta Braves' World Series appearance in October.

1224-> Samuel Marx Is Dead; Hollywood Writer, 90
Samuel Marx, a writer, film producer and story editor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, died on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 90 years old. He died of congestive heart failure, said his son, Richard, of Los Angeles. Mr. Marx's long career in the film industry is reflected in his books about Hollywood, among them "A Gaudy Spree: The Literary Life of Hollywood in the 1930's" and "Mayer and Thalberg: The Make-Believe Saints." He was also a consultant on a documentary film, "M-G-M: When the Lion Roars," to be broadcast by TNT cable television March 22 to 24. Mr. Marx attended the Columbia School of Journalism and wrote for newspapers and trade journals. In 1930, he moved to Hollywood to become a story editor for M-G-M, supervising a group of writers that included William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Moss Hart. While at the studio, he produced 13 movies for the studio, including the 1943 "Lassie Come Home." He was a story editor at Columbia Pictures for a year and during the 1950's produced several television series, including four "General Electric Hour" shows and "Northwest Passage." Among the books he co-wrote are "Rodgers and Hart: Bewitched, Bothered and Bedeviled" (1977), with Jan Clayton, and "Deadly Illusions" (1990), with Joyce Vanderveen. In addition to his son, he is survived by his second wife, Sara; another son, Kenneth, of St. Paul, Ark.; two grandsons, and a granddaughter.

1225-> CHRONICLE
JOHN SIMON, the often acerbic theater critic for New York magazine and film critic for the National Review, and PATRICIA HOAG, a singer who teaches musical theater at Marymount Manhattan College, were married Thursday at their home in Manhattan. The wedding was performed by Judge Roger B. Hunting of Bronx County Civil Court. Among the 22 guests on hand to witness the ceremony and celebrate afterward were BEN BAGLEY, the record producer, PHILIP BOSCO, the actor, and GINGER PRINCE, an actress who served as maid of honor. "She was last seen as the stripper in 'Gyspy,' " Mr. Simon said yesterday. "However, for this she was fully clothed." Both the bridegroom, who is 66 years old, and Ms. Hoag, 41, have been married before. They have known each other for five years. Mr. Simon declined to comment on the state of matrimony after only one day. "I tend not to review plays after the first scene, so I won't review marriage yet," he said. Still, he does seem to have mellowed a bit. At a symposium at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., last Saturday he recanted some of his harsher reviews of musicals by Stephen Sondheim, and he attributed the softening of his views to Ms. Hoag. Isn't love grand?

1227-> Preaching Love Thy Competitor
Four years ago, Novell Inc. was little more than a pesky fly on the rump of a giant computer software elephant named Microsoft. Novell, a small, obscure company situated here in the shadow of Utah's Wasatch Range, produced software to hook desktop computers together so they could share peripheral devices, such things as printers and hard disks. The Microsoft Corporation, in Redmond, Wash., was large, rich and famous for its MS-DOS operating system, which had become the standard operating system software installed in millions of personal computers. Then computing underwent a sea change. The price of desktop computers fell sharply. Computer makers started marketing them like a commodity. Corporations began hooking them into large networks. And Novell, in one of those instances of serendipity and visionary thinking that are the stuff of personal computer legend, found itself in the right place at the right time. Its Netware program to hook computers together became a best seller. Though Microsoft appeared with its own network software, it was too late. Today, Novell is a powerhouse with 65 percent of the market for network operating systems, and networking is the fastest-growing part of the computer industry. Though Novell is only a third the size of Microsoft, some industry analysts have begun to say what would have brought derisive laughter from their colleagues just a few years ago: Novell, once the fly, is now positioned to become a dominant force in business computing in the 1990's and, perhaps, the equal of Microsoft. "It's not that Novell particularly wants to own the entire world. They just want to control it," said Wayne Rash, a contributing editor at Byteweek, an industry newsletter. "They have completely taken control of network operating systems worldwide." Not a Whiz Kid In an industry largely built by precocious 20- and 30-year-olds, the credit for Novell's success goes to Ray Noorda, a laconic, "aw shucks" 68-year-old electrical engineer who was born and raised in Utah. Those who have worked with him inside and outside Novell say he is an autocrat, a technological visionary and a charismatic leader rolled into one and that he has created a company less inclined to boast about its technology and marketing prowess than to stress the need to cooperate with all comers -- even competitors -- to make the networking industry grow. Mr. Noorda runs Novell from a tiny, windowless office here, drives a pickup truck to work and makes a point of always flying coach and taking advantage of senior citizen discounts. He calls Novell's business philosophy "co-opetition." Mr. Noorda is avuncular, even grandfatherly in manner. "What he preaches is what you always wanted to hear from your father -- love, sharing -- and he uses those words," said Darrell L. Miller, a Novell executive vice president. "Ray presents himself as a very down-home, fatherly, 'can I have a bite of your apple' kind of guy, but he's very smart, a true visionary," said Casey Powell, chief executive of Sequent Computer Systems, which recently entered a joint software development agreement with Novell. Mr. Noorda has also used his Mormon faith to instill what one business associate calls "the Mormon work ethic" at Novell. "One of the things I'm concerned about is who replaces Ray Noorda when he retires. Will we see the same Mormon work ethic?" said Stephen L. Parsley, director of management information systems at Litton Industrial Automation Systems Inc. in Hebron, Ky., a major Novell customer. "When you see somebody who is as charismatic as Noorda, you have to wonder, will things change?" Indeed, if Novell is to become a dominant force in the 90's it will not only have to surmount the succession question but also repel what is expected to be a ferocious assault by Microsoft next year when it releases Windows NT, a version of the popular Windows software tailored to desktop computers in networks. When asked about succession, Mr. Noorda just smiles, makes a show of checking his pulse and avoids a direct answer. He speaks instead about the coming confrontation with Microsoft. "They'll make us work harder and avoid that dominant mentality, which I hate," Mr. Noorda said in an interview. "It simply will make us better. Believe me, we're working harder since they said they would do that." While Microsoft and Novell are equally dominant in their respective markets and are both highly profitable, fast-growing companies, they could not be more different in nearly every other way. "Almost everybody's friend versus almost everybody's enemy," is how Marc G. Shulman, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York compares them. Microsoft is brash and outspoken, seeks to own markets it competes in and is increasingly the software company other companies, like the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer Inc., are united against. Acquire and Share Novell is humble and reserved and shares with all. Its strategy has been to accelerate growth of the networking industry, assuming its own share would grow with it. When Novell identifies a capability it lacks, it looks outside, to a joint venture or acquisition, and it has done more of both than any other software maker. It has made more than a dozen such arrangements. Despite its accommodating nature, Novell, like Microsoft, has begun preparing for the coming battle over networking software. In December it acquired Digital Research Inc., producer of DR-DOS, the only viable competitor to Microsoft's MS-DOS. Earlier in the year Novell bought a minority stake in Unix System Laboratories, an American Telephone and Telegraph spinoff, and later formed a joint venture with it, called Univel. It will produce an easy-to-use version of the Unix operating system, which is often preferred by engineers and scientists using desktop work stations. The strategy is clearly to make Unix widely available as an option on networks using Netware. "Because the company stayed focused and because of a fairly unusual, almost altruistic goal, they have over the years wooed an incredible amount of support from would-be competitors," said Janet Hyland, director of network strategy research at Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting firm. To some extent Novell's cooperation with rivals is pragmatic, because a network operating system must work with other companies' software and hardware. "There's no way you can not be partner with a whole lot of people," said Mr. Noorda. "Rather than wait for that to happen, we decided we would partner with anybody and everybody that made sense." The strategy has paid off. Novell earned $162.5 million on sales of $640.1 million in fiscal 1991. The company expects revenues in the $900 million range this year. In comparison, Microsoft earned $462.7 million on sales of $1.84 billion in its last fiscal year, which ended June 30. That Novell might grow with such stunning rapidity seemed highly unlikely in 1983 when Mr. Noorda pulled Novell from the ashes of Novell Data Systems, a bankrupt personal computer maker. He saw that the one item of value was an operating system. Unlike Microsoft's MS-DOS, the Novell software allowed PC's to share peripheral devices on a local area network, or LAN. "It was great that our hardware was so lousy because that gave us the idea that hardware wasn't really where the value was," said Drew Major, one of the original programmers and now Novell's chief scientist. "We were in the position at the right time to see a couple of things," he said. "It was a vision beyond 'let's share a disk or a printer.' " Whether it was a vision or serendipity, by concentrating on software Novell wrestled the lead in networking away from the 3Com Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif., whose founder, Robert Metcalfe, had all but invented the technology while a scientist at the Xerox Corporation's PARC research center in Palo Alto, Calif. Software for sharing disks and printers drove Novell's growth for most of the 80's. Then PC's became standardized and commodity-like and it became clear the real value lay in software to link them. And corporate customers began demanding more. They wanted to tie clusters of PC's linked with Netware into the minicomputers that ran business departments and the mainframes where data bases resided. But there was one problem: bought at different times, from different makers, the hardware used different software programming languages and communications protocols. Novell's brilliant stroke came in 1989 when it unveiled Netware 386. Earlier versions were limited to use with I.B.M.-compatible hardware, but 386 could also accommodate Apple's Macintosh and Unix, which had become a standard for work stations. "They had the right product in the right year," said Mr. Metcalfe, now publisher of Infoworld, a trade magazine. Although there are now alternatives to Netware, customers have "little motivation for changing because there is nothing significantly better around," he said. The beauty of Netware 386, or the current version, Netware 3.11, is that it allows users access to data in any computer on the network. "We look like a Macintosh to Apple people, a Unix server to Sun users," said Kanwal Rekhi, a Novell executive vice president. "It requires tons of software to unite all those disparate environments, and that's the value Novell brings to the market." But timing might have counted for little if Novell had not hit on another key idea: using as broad a distribution channel as possible. Rather than maintain a costly sales force, it sold Netware through more than 13,000 independent distributors called value-added resellers, or VAR's. From mass-market discounters like CompUSA and Egghead Software to sophisticated systems integrators like Electronic Data Systems and Andersen Consulting, VAR's provide network installation, maintenance and education, all at no cost to Novell. "How do you get a sales force as large as I.B.M.'s when you're a tiny company? You have to use a leveraged mentality," said Mr. Miller. Initially, Novell trained these resellers in the intricacies of networked computing. Now it franchises Novell Authorized Education Centers, for a fee. Netware Evangelists "They've done a wonderful job of farming distribution out," said Robert H. Gill, an analyst with the Gartner Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn. "They train people who go out and train other people, and every time somebody gets trained, they get another Netware bigot, and make another dollar. They are getting paid to have people go out and be evangelists." Mr. Miller said Novell also deliberately left holes in its own product line so others could fill them -- and market Netware by extension as they marketed their add-on product. It was this broad base of independent companies dependent on Netware that saved Novell when Microsoft teamed up with I.B.M. to introduce a competing product, LAN Manager, three years ago. "When Microsoft and I.B.M. decided to participate in 1989, they didn't understand this infrastructure we had built," Mr. Miller said. "The mistake Microsoft made was they came at us with technology, and technology was just a tiny part of what we had built," he said. "Their technology wasn't bad." In fact, analysts say that Microsoft's technology in LAN Manager was in some respects superior to Netware. But it was tied to an unpopular new desktop computer operating system from I.B.M., OS/2, and has had only modest sales. The experience chastened Microsoft, which now makes products designed to be used with Netware. "We continue to sell aggressively against Novell," said Steve Ballmer, who has led Microsoft's efforts to compete with Novell. "On the other hand, it's clear to Novell and Microsoft that having Windows run well on Netware is something both our customers are going to insist on. It's not as much either/or as perhaps we thought two years ago." Nevertheless, Microsoft is hard at work preparing its next assault on Novell's fortress. It has hired James Allchin, the architect of the Vines networking program, marketed by Banyan Systems Inc., a Novell competitor based in Westboro, Mass., and David Kutler, a networking specialist from the Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard, Mass., which also has a product that competes with Netware. They have been given the specific goal of unseating Novell. David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, estimates that Microsoft invested $45 million and added 450 new employees in network support and development in fiscal 1991, plus $15 million to $20 million in training programs. He expects Microsoft to invest an additional $50 million in networking during the current fiscal year. While Windows NT is not likely to sway customers heavily committed to Netware, it will be a significant challenge with new customers. "Novell generally responds rather than leads," said Mr. Ballmer. "That is not a formula for failure, but it does mean that if you can shoot far enough in front of them, there are opportunities to gain market share." Looming over Novell's success and coming showdown with Microsoft is the Ray Noorda retirement question, a subject of frequent rumors in the trade press. While Mr. Noorda has set up a unit structure that gives the five executive vice presidents more responsibilities, he does not talk like a man planning to retire soon. "I think about it a lot." he said. "I try to make sure that if anything should happen there is at least a format for running the company." He ticked off the names of his executive vice presidents, and said, "The board could look inside or outside and the company could run quite well." Ms. Hyland of Forrester Research looks at it this way: "There is no heir apparent in the crew there now. The good news is that Ray seems to be a pretty young 68." RIGHT MAN AT THE RIGHT TIME Ray Noorda became a part of Novell almost by accident. In 1982 the personal-computer maker was on the brink of collapse, though a team of freelance programmers was still at work on a network operating system. "There was a succession of presidents as the company went down," recalled Drew Major, one of the programmers and now Novell's chief scientist. Things were so tight there was not money for a booth at Comdex, the industry's big trade show in Las Vegas. So Mr. Major and his crew rented a hotel room to show off their prototype software. Ray Noorda wandered in, liked what he saw, and before long signed on as yet another president. One of Mr. Noorda's first moves was to kill the hardware division. "We always realized that the only differential value we had was in the software," Mr. Noorda said. "To begin with, our aim was Netware somewhere; just get it sold. Then it was Netware everywhere, distribute it broadly. Then we said it has to be Netware anywhere, so we'll sell it through a lot of O.E.M.'s," he said, referring to original equipment manufacturers, who resell products under their own names. "Now we say it has to be almost invisible, so people buy it out of necessity -- Netware underwear." Competitors say Mr. Noorda's folksy, low-key manner belies a core of steel. "Ray Noorda is a very smart, tough-minded businessman; turn-around situations are not where guys who aren't tough succeed," said Steve Ballmer, a member of the office of the president at Microsoft. Mr. Noorda's decision to stop by Novell's hotel room a decade ago has paid off handsomely. He owns 11 percent of the company's stock, which closed Friday at $57.25, making his stake worth about $920 million. WHEN IN JAPAN . . . Novell's emphasis on partnering has served it well in the international market, which accounted for 51 percent of sales in the quarter ended Jan. 30. When Novell entered the Japanese market two years ago, it first created a new Japanese subsidiary in which the five largest Japanese computer companies each took an equity stake. "We thought our best bet for succeeding there was to look like, feel like and be like a Japanese company as much as possible," said Jeffrey Wade, a former Novell executive. "That meant Japanese employees, Japanese partners and a Japanese product." Novell's Japanese partners -- NEC, Toshiba, Fujitsu, Canon and Sony -- gave Novell instant credibility, Mr. Wade said. Novell kept a 54 percent stake in Novell Japan and its partners' donations of engineering time and money paid for the company's entry into the country. In Japan, less than 2 percent of personal computers are networked, compared with 35 percent in the United States and 22 percent in Europe, so potential sales are tremendous. Novell expects Japan to be its largest overseas market within four years. Novell's "leveraged" approach to distribution has also traveled well abroad. In Europe, Asia and South America, Novell sells through authorized distributors, who in turn sell through resellers to users. As in the United States, training is provided by franchised Novell education centers. The model is even at work in Eastern Europe, where Novell has 22 distributors and 150 resellers. Eastern Europe "is a remarkable piece of our business," said Mary Burnside, an executive vice president. "Major businesses, government-owned and private, are looking at this technology and actually buying," she said.

1229-> Metro-North Asks Rise in Connecticut Fares
The Metro-North Commuter Railroad yesterday proposed a $464 million operating budget for 1993 that includes a 4.9 percent fare increase in Connecticut on the New Haven line. The increase, which would go into effect at Connecticut stations starting Jan. 1, 1993, would bring in roughly $3 million, said Donna Evans, a railroad spokeswoman. No fare increase is proposed for New York commuters, she said. Metro-North is jointly financed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Today, the Metro-North president, Donald Nelson, presented the railroad's 1993 budget plan to the M.T.A.'s Metro-North committee. The budget will go before the M.T.A. on Dec. 18. Under the proposed budget, Metro-North's operating expenses would rise 1.3 percent over the 1992 budget to $463.9 million, according to the railroad. The budget plan lists operating revenue of $255.8 million, including the Connecticut fare increase, and subsidies of $211 million, with $169.6 million to be paid for by the M.T.A. and $41.4 million from Connecticut's transportation department.

1231-> Are Your Income Tax Deductions Typical? It May Not Matter
Taxpayers often want to know whether the itemized deductions on their returns look reasonable, and some take comfort if their own deductions are more or less in line with national averages. Indeed, these average figures, released by the Internal Revenue Service, are incorporated into the two leading consumer tax software programs for use on personal computers, Turbotax by Chipsoft and Andrew Tobias's Taxcut 1040. When users select "audit" from the programs' menus to have the programs check the returns they have prepared, they are told how much their own deductions deviate from the national averages for their income group. But many tax professionals caution against reading too much into such comparisons. The advise people to take every deduction to which they are legally entitled -- no more, no less -- and to be prepared to substantiate their claims, if necessary. "There's no such thing as the average person," said David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young, the national accounting firm, in Washington. "Those figures can lull someone into a false sense of security. Take what you are legally entitled to take." State Taxes Vary Residents of New York, Massachusetts and California, for example, which have high state income taxes, should not feel intimidated because their deductions for state taxes are above national averages. Furthermore, Mr. Berenson said, changes in the economy and in Federal and some state tax laws distort comparisons between 1991 returns now being prepared and filed and 1989 figures, the latest year for which the average figures are available from the I.R.S. Interest deductions may be lower, he said. Rates have fallen, leading many people to refinance home mortgages, the biggest source of interest deductions. Also, in 1989 people could deduct 20 percent of their consumer interest -- on credit cards and car loans, for example -- but these deductions cannot be taken for 1991. Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., and former special agent for the I.R.S.'s criminal investigation division, said, "Those statistics are widely interpreted as what the traffic will bear, and that's not so at all." Nevertheless, he included the figures in his book, "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies for the $40,000-Plus Household," (Prima Publishing , 1992; $14.95). Why? "You have to assume your chances for an audit are greater if you're claiming unexpectedly high deductions," Mr. Block said, "and if you recognize that, you may be able to head it off if you attach an explanatory note or statement." He recalled being assigned to investigate a man of modest means who claimed charitable deductions in excess of what most people with several times his income were reporting. It turned out the man was deeply religious; he tithed 10 percent of his pretax income, and then gave some more to his church, a fact that was substantiated by church records. Perhaps if he had attached a note to his return there would have been no audit, Mr. Block said, but the number was big enough "to cause the I.R.S. computers to go bananas." The computers do not read notes, but after a computer flags a return, a person looks at it to decide whether an audit is warranted, and he or she might have accepted the explanation in the note, depending on other aspects of the return. "If you attach anything, it should be brief, not a dossier," he said. Taxpayers should hold on to their original documents in case of an audit. Daniel Caine, who wrote of Andrew Tobias's Taxcut 1040 computer program for Meca Software, said that he included the I.R.S. averages because "people want to know." He added that if a number is out of line, the user may have made a typographical error -- entering $30 instead of $300 for charitable donations, for example -- and by pointing out the variance from the norm, the program will help the user find the error. "If it's correct, whether it's bigger or smaller shouldn't matter," Mr. Caine said. The program's interview feature helps users find all the deductions to which they are entitled. The most common deductions on regular tax returns are for state and local income taxes, real-estate taxes, interest on home mortgages or home-equity loans, and contributions to charities, including churches, synagogues, schools and hospitals. Medical expenses are deductable only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, so few people can take them. Similarly, casualty loss deductions (for property loss or damage) may be taken only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the adjusted gross income, plus $100 per occurrence, and miscellaneous itemized deductions (like business entertaining or union or professional dues) only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. At Chipsoft Inc., which produces Turbotax, Albert W. Noyes, vice president of marketing, described the program's use of the averages as "an additional data point," not something intended as advice about deductions. "Theoretically, if you're out of line, it might raise a red flag," he said, "so when you file your tax return, you should be prepared for an audit with all the backup material." Taxpayers should keep canceled checks, medical bills, statements from banks and other lenders, receipts from charities and any other documentation for deductions, he said. Keep It Real "You should file based on reality," he added, regardless of how it compares with the averages. The program allows taxpayers to attach statements or notes of the sort Mr. Block recommended to returns. Mr. Noyes said that the I.R.S. uses the averages in what he termed their "mysterious calculations" for developing taxpayer profiles to decide whom to audit. But other factors are also considered. Deductions for home offices are widely regarded as an audit flag, because the I.R.S. contends they are an area of abuse. Mr. Berenson said moving expenses could also flag a return, as could business travel and entertainment expenses. Herbert Paul, a New York tax lawyer, certified public accountant and professor of taxation at New York University, said: "I explain it to my students this way: "We really have a system of self-assessment in the United States. We report what our income is and list the deductions we think we are entitled to. Uncle Sam has a right to say, 'Show me.' "

1232-> POP/JAZZ; Art Taylor: Improviser, Instructor, Inspiration
Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Dexter Gordon, Bud Powell, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Jackie McLean: these are some of the people the drummer Art Taylor has cajoled, pushed, powered and sweet-talked, on record and in performance. A quick look at the discographies of the Blue Note and Prestige labels has Mr. Taylor, who is performing this weekend at the Village Vanguard in one of the jazz events of the season, playing in nearly 100 recording sessions in the 1950's alone. There's a reason for all of this. Mr. Taylor is one of the great drummers to come out of the fertile Harlem be-bop scene, someone who helped define, along with Philly Joe Jones and Art Blakey, the sound of jazz made in the 1950's. On brushes, he's extraordinary, creating a seamless hissing sound that propels a band. And Mr. Taylor is as interactive as any drummer alive; his performance is the desire to communicate, written in music. But in 1963 Mr. Taylor left the United States to work in Paris. He ended up staying in Europe for the next 17 years, robbing American audiences of a chance to hear how profoundly thoughtful his playing could be. And it deprived a whole generation of younger musicians of the opportunity to apprentice in his band. Innovations a la Mode Things have changed. Mr. Taylor moved back to the United States in 1980, and since then jazz has undergone a renaissance, producing groups of young musicians interested in the innovations Mr. Taylor and his cadre of musicians introduced to the world. Two years ago, Mr. Taylor put together a band called Taylor's Wailers (named after a band he led in New York in the 1950's) and it has become one of the great bands working in jazz today, a group that mixes inspired improvisations with tight and precise arrangements. Mr. Taylor, who prods and pokes his young musicians into greatness, is clearly working as a schoolteacher on the bandstand. The band -- Abraham Burton Jr. on alto saxophone, Willie Weeks on tenor saxophone, Jacky Terrasson on piano and Tyler Mitchell on bass -- offers an audience a great chance to hear some of the best young musicians working in New York. "Arthur Taylor, he's teaching me an ensemble view that will direct me to a more full, rounded style of playing," said Mr. Burton. "It's important to study the history, if you want to do something well. A lot of young musicians are just playing without ever having played with someone great from an older generation. It's important, very important to take the time out to study with somebody who has done all this way before you. People spent a lot of time figuring out how to play this music, what to do with it, and it's beautiful." Mr. Burton, 20 years old, is a good example of what Mr. Taylor is trying to do with the group. A student of Jackie McLean's at the University of Hartford's Hartt College of Music, Mr. Burton is an enormously promising improviser who can swing as if it comes to him naturally; there's real effusion in his playing, and he can get an audience shouting encouragement. He and Mr. McLean and Mr. Taylor decided that instead of playing with all sorts of pick-up groups, he should concentrate on school and the lessons learned in Mr. Taylor's group. It's an experience meant to build discipline, since Mr. Taylor's standards, and his arrangements, are as tough as almost any in jazz. "He likes his musicians on time and dressed well," said Mr. Burton. "I enjoy it now; it shows self-respect and respect for the music. And the rehearsal can become intense, going over and over things until we get them right. The outcome is good, because everybody becomes so comfortable with the music we can play instead of worrying about the arrangements, which are really complicated." Setting Up for Drama A performance by the band is usually exhilarating in its power and imagination. On Tuesday night, Mr. Taylor opened the set by playing a duet with Mr. Terrasson on "Un Poco Loco"; they slid into "Impressions," and the saxophonists, starting their solos from the back of the room, walked up to the bandstand playing. Tunes segued from one into another -- Mr. Taylor and Mr. Mitchell performed "Manteca" together for a minute -- and everything was set up for drama. The crowd went wild, espcially after solos by Mr. Weeks, who has become one of today's finest young tenor saxophonists, and Mr. Burton. And Mr. Taylor, snapping his snare drum or accenting with his bass drum or driving the group with his precise cymbal work, was always magnificent. Mr. Taylor's language has been changing since the 1950's, and he's a better drummer than he used to be, harder swinging and more careful with his ideas. "I'm feeling better than I ever have," Mr. Taylor said. "I'm healthy, and have a great band. They're such lovely people and play so great, so why shouldn't I feel better than ever? I've played with great musicians but I was always moving around; I didn't stay with bands very long. At this point, I find I like the communal aspect of people working together, being friends, helping each other musically. That's rewarding, and all of our playing has been getting better." Constant Change The band does a series of classic hard-bop tunes, including "Nica's Dream," "Soul Eyes" and "Little Melonae," tunes that bridge a whole period in Mr. Taylor's career. And Mr. Taylor has arranged them all with internal rhythms or stop-time sections or rhythmic change-ups. Riffs and segues break things up, and not all the band members solo on every tune. Nothing stays the same for long. For Mr. Taylor, who saw jazz blossom in the 50's, the current resurgence in jazz activity is particulary heartening; it's his music that's come back. "Jackie McLean and I were saying the other day that these guys are the guys for the year 2000," said Mr. Taylor. "With the background they're getting, the training and the experience of playing with a guy like me, it's quite an experience. Somebody like Abraham has tremendous potential in this field of music. He has the tools and the intelligence. And he's a nice person. If you're not nice you won't play that nice. People forget things like that." Shows at the Village Vanguard, Seventh Avenue South near 11th Street in Manhattan, are at 9:30 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M. tonight and tomorrow; 9:30 and 11 P.M. on Sunday. Tickets are $15 tonight and tomorrow; $12 on Sunday. There is a $7.50 minimum all weekend. Information: (212) 255-4037.

1233-> N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT: WEST; DePaul Tripped by Giant Killers
New Mexico State taught DePaul this afternoon that bigger is not always better. The smaller Aggies tripped DePaul, 81-73, in a West Regional opening-round game at the Arizona State University Activity Center and once again emphasized that no matter how many big men a team employs, it needs a point guard to dish and dance on the perimeter and keep the traffic flow in check. New Mexico State featured the perfect traffic cop in 5-foot-8-inch, 155-pound Sam Crawford. His numbers read 21 points, 11 assists, 4 steals and even 3 rebounds. Causing Trouble In nearly 38 minutes of play, however, Crawford did much more, drawing the DePaul defense toward him all afternoon, then spinning free to draw fouls or create chaos in the Blue Demons' defense. When DePaul began using two and three guards to defend him late in the second half, it was too late: New Mexico State (24-7) would gain its first tournament victory since 1970, when the Aggies reached the Final Four. By losing to the 12th-seeded Aggies, fifth-seeded DePaul finished its season at 20-9. The second game of the afternoon session followed suit as 13th-seeded Southwestern Louisiana beat fourth-seeded Oklahoma, 87-83. Tonight, Louisville crushed Wake Forest, 81-58. On Sunday, the improbable matchup will feature the No. 12 Aggies vs. No. 13 Southwestern Louisiana in one game, and No. 8 Louisville vs. No. 1 U.C.L.A., which rolled over No. 16 Robert Morris, 73-53. Crawford, meanwhile, was the talk of the games here today. "He did a good job of jumping in the air and getting inside our defense," DePaul Coach Joey Meyer said of Crawford. "We thought we could get charges on him, but I don't remember us getting one. Crawford makes things happen." He did from the start, helping the Aggies take a 41-34 lead at halftime. Less than five minutes into the second half, the Aggies led, 52-38. Tall Order From Outside For much of the game, DePaul went with a front line that stood 6-10 (forward Steven Howard), 6-11 (center Jeff Stern) and 6-7 (forward David Booth). New Mexico State's tallest player is only 6-9. And yet, rather than the big guys taking most of the shots and hammering the middle, DePaul took 23 3-point shots and made only 7. New Mexico State made 4 of 8. Crawford's moves drew fouls and got New Mexico State to the free-throw line, where the Aggies made 29 of 37. DePaul went to the line only 14 times, making just 6. "Our game plan was to get the ball down low," Meyer said. "Sometimes our kids get a little anxious. They've had a tendency all year when they get behind to shoot the ball a little more quickly." With four minutes to play, DePaul trailed, 66-63, but that was as close as the Blue Demons would get for the rest of the game. Aggies forward Cliff Reed scored 16 points, and Booth led DePaul with 19 points. Crawford, though, was the smallest man in the game -- and also the biggest. "I got tired out there, but that's when I knew I had to work the hardest," Crawford said. "I was down there with all of those big guys, swarming around their knees. We played hard the whole game." SW Louisiana 87, Oklahoma 83 Southwestern Louisiana matched and then surpassed Oklahoma's uptempo style in the Ragin' Cajuns rousing victory. Southwestern Louisiana (21-10) was led by lanky, 6-5 guard Byron Starks, who scored 21 points. Oklahoma (21-9) had five players who reached double figures but as a team shot only 44.4 percent. "U.S.L. did a good job," Sooners Coach Billy Tubbs said. "I'm not shocked or surprised at the way they played. We fought hard, the game just went to the better team." Louisville 81, Wake Forest 58 Louisville (19-10) led, 35-25, at halftime and never looked back, shooting 56 percent for the game and 63.2 percent in the second half. Wake Forest made only 22 of 60 shots (36.7 percent), even though Demon Deacons forward Rodney Rogers led all scorers with 21 points. Louisville enjoyed a 19-9 edge at the free-throw line and forced 14 Wake Forest turnovers. Forward Dwayne Morton led Louisville with 20 points. U.C.L.A. 73, Robert Morris 53 The Bruins (26-4) were lulled into a lackluster first-half and led the Colonials (19-12) by just 26-22 at halftime. But their size, strength and superior defense led to a dominating second half during which they shot 68.2 percent from the floor. Don MacLean made only 1 of 5 field-goal attempts but sank 15 of 17 free throws and grabbed 11 rebounds for U.C.L.A. Tracy Murray led the Bruins with 20 points.

1234-> 'Smog Exchange' Approved
A "smog exchange" for Southern California in which polluting companies would buy credits from clean ones won preliminary approval tonight. The 2,800-company exchange is intended to give businesses financial incentives to meet clean-air goals rather than to order them to comply through specific regulations. The ultimate goal: to help clean the nation's dirtiest air. "There's gold in that brown haze," Henry W. Wedaa, chairman of the Air Quality Management District, said before the board voted 8-1 to order its staff to spend a year designing the program. The board later will have to give the final go-ahead. The proposed Regional Clean Air Incentives Market would include big polluters in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Of the total number of companies covered, 2,000 emit 85 percent of smog-forming hydrocarbons, 700 release 95 percent of all polluting nitrogen oxide emissions, and 100 emit nearly all of the sulfur oxides. The plan calls for issuing companies permits that have a certain value like shares of stock -- not in dollars but in pounds of pollutants. The permits would be for hydrocarbons or oxides of nitrogen, the primary components of smog. Each year, the stock "value" would shrink, forcing companies to reduce emissions. Businesses that exceed clean-air goals could sell their leftover pollution credits to dirtier companies. The plan calls for eliminating about 40 existing or proposed clean-air rules. These rules require companies to use certain kinds of equipment or methods to cut down emissions. One board member, Larry Berg, voted against the plan. He said too many questions were unresolved, including whether the cost of smog shares would drive smaller businesses out of Southern California. Businesses and environmentalists generally have supported the concept of a "smog exchange," but both groups say a number of bugs have to be worked out.

1236-> Poland Again Saddles Up the Steed of Reform
After riding to power on growing public opposition to Poland's economic reform program, the new Government is reluctantly embracing the main tenets of its predecessors. An economic program to be announced Monday promises a loosening of the money supply and a bit of help for the ailing state sector. But Premier Jan Olszewski's Government is insisting that the total deficit will be held to 5 to 6 percent of the gross national product, slightly more than 1991. The big question, however, is whether the package will meet the budget austerity requirements of the International Monetary Fund. Forgiveness of half of Poland's $45 billion foreign debt, tentatively agreed upon last year, depends on receiving the Fund's imprimatur. A senior Polish official warned that the plan to be announced Monday may not satisfy the fund. The I.M.F. suspended a three-year agreement with Poland last year after targets for money supply growth and budget deficits vastly exceeded projections. Fund representatives told Polish economic planners this week that Poland must live within its means. Such restraint was lacking in the past year, when real wages rose 3 percent -- about $200 monthly -- even as productivity fell sharply. "I wonder if the I.M.F. realizes how difficult is the social and political situation of this country," said the senior official. "We need to have a sensible budget, but we need to preserve democratic processes, and one need has to be balanced against the other." During the campaign, Mr. Olszewski called for renegotiation of Poland's deal with the I.M.F. Now he is boxed in by a budget deficit, faces growing opposition within his own Parliament, and has found little room to maneuver. Once the poster-child of post-Communist economics for its bold program of "shock therapy," Poland has lately been the focus of anxious concern in the West. The private sector has boomed since the program began on Jan. 1, 1990, while state businesses, particularly companies dependent on trade with the Soviet Union, have collapsed. A majority of the winning candidates in last year's parliamentary elections ran against the reform plan. Public opinion polls document a steady drop in the public's support for faster privatization, and Government forecasters predict that unemployment, now at 11 percent, will reach between 17 and 19 percent by the end of the year. Recently, President Lech Walesa delivered a ringing speech at the Council of Europe in which he blamed Western Europe for flooding the Polish market with goods while failing to invest. Immediately after the speech, he called in Western reporters to assure them that the comments were not aimed at the United States and that the country had no intention of seriously deviating from its economic reforms. Zdzislaw Najder, chief adviser to Mr. Olszewski, insisted the new Government is proposing important changes in emphasis, particularly in the area of protecting potentially profitable state-run industries. But he also acknowledged that the rhetoric of last year's Parliamentary campaign has long since collided with the realities on Poland's national balance sheet. When the Olszewski Government took office, Mr. Olszewski immediately called the budget deficit of more than $1.6 billion "catastrophic" and said that it would take two months for his Government to come up with a plan. Those results are to be unveiled next week. Drafts of the proposal call for faster privatization, lower interest rates and the printing of additional money to revive failing state-run enterprises. The state companies would be protected both by more direct intervention from the central Government and such anti-import measures as required labeling in the Polish language. The key vote will come on a proposed budget within a month. "This Government can propose a budget that is very austere," said Piotr Nowina-Konopka, senior member of the Democratic Union party, which holds 14 percent of the seats in the Parliament and is drawn from the center left wing of the Solidarity movement. "And if it's a non-austere budget, we won't vote for it, and Olszewski will be brought down."

1237-> CREDIT MARKETS; Companies Rush to Sell Debt Issues
A torrent of new corporate debt securities flooded the credit markets yesterday, as companies began to react to the drop in interest rates since Dec. 20. Analysts and investment bankers have been expecting a surge ever since the Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate by a full percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent, and lowered its target on the overnight Federal funds rate by half a point, to 4 percent. Those rate cuts have prompted rates in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the benchmarks used for pricing corporate issues, to fall by more than one-quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, over the last few weeks. Analysts said that decline had forced corporate treasurers to amend their financing strategies for 1992. Well over $2 billion worth of new corporate debt was priced yesterday, including 30-year bond offerings from both A.T.& T. and Du Pont. It is the first time that Du Pont has sold 30-year securities since 1986. A.T.& T. sold an offering of 40-year debentures late last year. Despite the heavy supply of new corporate issues, prices of Treasury notes and bonds continued to rally. The rise came as a welcome surprise to market analysts who had worried that a heavy supply of new debt securities would push rates up. Short-term Treasury bill rates fell for the second straight session, as money market funds continue to replace maturing commercial paper with bills. But traders emphasized that demand has not been confined to shorter-term maturities. Demand Across the Spectrum "Essentially, there has been good demand for securities across the spectrum," one trader said. Dealers said further weakness in key industrial commodity prices, as well as a drop in oil prices and in the price of gold, helped to generate buying. "Exacerbated weakness in industrial commodity prices is a good sign of continued economic weakness," the trader said. Traders said the market was also bolstered by rumors that a report expected from the Labor Department on Friday would show that employment conditions were much worse in December than most analysts forecast. Rumors circulated that non-farm payroll employment may have declined by as much as 300,000 last month. Most Wall Street economists are projecting a decline of around 75,000. A.T.& T. led the way in the investment-grade corporate bond market, offering a total of $1 billion worth of new 10-year notes and 30-year debentures. The 8 1/8 percent debentures, which mature Jan. 15, 2022, were priced at $98.292 to yield 8.28 percent, 85 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing. The bonds are noncallable for 10 years. The remaining $500 million of the issue consists of 7 1/8 percent 10-year notes maturing Jan. 15, 2002. The securities were priced at $98.912 to yield 7.28 percent, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. After the securities were priced, A.T.& T. said it was considering using the proceeds from the financing to retire a total of $800 million worth of securities issued when interest rates were much higher. Refinancings and outright retirement of outstanding debt are seen by analysts and Government officials as a critical element in the repair of overleveraged corporate balance sheets. Du Pont offered $400 million worth of 8 1/4 percent debentures through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation. The securities, which are noncallable for 10 years, were priced at $99.636 to yield 8.284 percent, 85 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021. The securities, which mature Jan. 15, 2022, are rated Aa-2 by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's. The flood of new issues did not dissuade investors from buying Treasury securities. By late in the day, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1079/32 , up 14/32 to yield 7.39 percent, compared with 7.43 percent late Monday. Among note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10511/32 , up 11/32 , to yield 6.74 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 10021/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 4.64 percent. In advance of today's auction of $9.5 billion worth of new seven-year Treasury notes, the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.40 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower, fueled by purchases by money market funds. Three-month bills were offered in late trading at a discount rate of 3.74 percent, down 9 basis points. Six-month bill rates dipped by 6 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.78 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.82 percent. In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, traders said that prices of most actively traded issues rose by one-eighth of a point to one-quarter of a point. The performance of the $14.2 billion worth of New York State debt securities that suffered a ratings downgrade by Moody's on Monday was an exception to that general trend, traders said.

1238-> U.N. AGAIN WARNS IRAQ ON CEASE-FIRE
The United Nations Security Council today rejected Iraq's assertion that it is cooperating with the terms of the Persian Gulf cease-fire, telling Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz he must comply "fully and unconditionally" with its orders. Nevertheless, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq appeared to have won a brief postponement of the major new confrontation looming between Baghdad and the Security Council. Whether Baghdad is really changing its position may be disclosed at talks that Mr. Aziz and a team of 14 experts will hold with the United Nations this weekend on United Nations plans for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and other issues. Another test could come next week when the special commission charged with eliminating these weapons plans to send a new inspection team to Baghdad. It may seek to destroy Scud missile-building equipment that Iraq wants to convert to civilian use. Iraq's refusal to destroy this equipment has already provoked a quarrel with the Council. Today Rolf Ekeus, who heads the commission, said he remained determined to see the equipment destroyed, adding, "The Iraqis will find a dual use for everything." The Security Council is seeking Iraq's compliance with orders it drew up at the end of the gulf war that would strip Baghdad of its most dangerous weapons, tie up its oil revenues for years in compensation payments for the invasion of Kuwait and subject its military industries to long-term monitoring. The United States, Britain and France have said that unless Iraq starts complying with the orders, they cannot rule out a resumption of military action, including possible air strikes against weapons plants and nuclear sites. In a statement issued after two days of talks with Mr. Aziz, the Council said Iraq had still not complied "fully and unconditionally" with its obligations under the peace plan, adding that it "must do so and must immediately take appropriate actions in this regard." 'A Good-Will Mission' The Council said it hoped "the good will expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister would be matched by deeds." Mr. Aziz said he had come to New York on "a good-will mission." In an address Wednesday and again today when he answered questions from Council members, Mr. Aziz offered few tangible concessions. But by repeatedly saying Iraq wanted to cooperate with the Council on the cease-fire plan and was ready to discuss outstanding problems with the United Nations, he forced the Council to give him a chance to show how far Iraq is willing to go. America's representative, Thomas R. Pickering, was openly skeptical about Iraq's purported change of heart. He said some members thought Mr. Aziz's statements today showed a new interest in complying with the Security Council's demands, but added, "We have our doubts." Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, expressed disappointment that Mr. Aziz "was not more forthcoming." But he said the clear message from the Council was that it now wanted "deeds not words." Today, Mr. Aziz said Iraq was ready to make "a full, complete and comprehensive declaration" about its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, as the special commission wants. But he said Iraq first wanted to discuss these disclosures with the commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's nuclear program. And he said the disclosure must not violate Iraqi sovereignty. Similarly, Mr. Aziz said Iraq was ready for "a constructive dialogue" with the special commission on long-term monitoring of its military industries. But he said such monitoring must not serve "either political or intelligence purposes." As a result, many diplomats suspect Iraq still thinks it can renegotiate the obligations that the Council wants to impose. "Mirrors and smoke" was how Mr. Pickering described the Iraqi position today. A clear difference of emphasis also emerged over the Security Council's plan to destroy equipment used in the manufacture of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, with Mr. Aziz saying Baghdad wanted to preserve everything that could be converted to civilian use. Plant's Destuction Demanded On Wednesday, the United States called for the immediate destruction of the al-Atheer nuclear weapons plant, which escaped attack during the gulf war. Today, Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was working on plans for its destruction and would send a team to inspect it in April. Asked whether any of this complex could be saved for civilian use, Mr. Blix suggested the cafeteria. Mr. Aziz said he was willing to reopen talks broken off a month ago with the United Nations Secretariat over the Security Council's proposal that Baghdad sell oil to buy needed humanitarian goods, compensate Kuwait and pay for United Nations operations in Iraq. But he said the Council's original plan involved an unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty and must be changed in ways he did not specify. He also said Iraq could not accept the special body the Council had set up in Geneva to adjudicate compensation claims against Baghdad because it had no Iraqi representation. Mr. Aziz asserted that Iraq was now ready to give the International Red Cross access to its prisons to look for missing Kuwaitis and was already publishing their names in newspapers in the hope of learning where they were. But he did not say whether the Red Cross access would be unlimited. Familiar Answer on Kurds The Deputy Prime Minister repeated Baghdad's familiar answer to the Security Council's demand that it lift its blockade against dissident Kurds in the north and end its oppression of Shiite Muslims in the south. Baghdad cannot send food to the north or pay salaries and pensions there, Mr. Aziz said, because the rebellious Kurds have sabotaged the Government's administrative presence. Army checkpoints are "precautionary measures" intended to stop stolen property being smuggled into Turkey and Iran, he said. The military operations in the country's southern marshes are a matter of self-protection and are aimed at armed dissidents being sent into the country from neighboring Iran to destabilize the Iraqi Government, Mr. Aziz said.

1240-> Bridge
In most tournament competition, with team play by imps the exception, overtricks are crucial. One of the best overtricks of the year so far came on the diagramed deal, played on Feb. 28 at the Long Island Regional Championships in Smithtown, L.I. South was Mel Colchamiro of Bellmore, L.I., who has long been one of Long Island's best players. His partner was Lynn Frey of Kings Point, L.I., who has bridge in her blood. Her father, Alan C. Greenberg, is a former national champion as well as chairman of Bear, Stearns & Company, the brokerage. The opening heart lead was won by dummy's queen and the top clubs were cashed. A club was surrendered to West, who shifted to a spade. South captured the jack with the ace and cashed dummy's two club winners. East had already given up two diamonds and gave up another diamond and a spade. The sequel proved this to be a subtle error, for after South cashed his A-K of diamonds the position was this: [ DIAGRAM ] When the diamond four was led to the queen West was in trouble. He could not spare a heart, and he could see that a discard of the spade eight would allow South to lead that suit for an endplay. He did the best he could by throwing the spade king, but Colchamiro was ready for that. He led to the heart ace and played the spade nine, scoring dummy's ten at the finish. This gave him 11 tricks and a fine score because almost all the other declarers made just 10. In Thursday's bridge column, South's key play of the club ten should have been described as "hoping that the singleton was not the jack." The Grand National Swiss Team Championship, for teams qualified from New York City and Long Island, will be played over four sessions at the Landmark Education Center, 425 Fifth Avenue near 38th Street, Manhattan. Play begins today at 1 P.M. and tomorrow at 12:30 P.M.

1241-> Review/Film; Corruption And Racial Strife Take Their Toll
"Gladiator" is a totally familiar new film involving boxing, gangs, high school kids, first love, corrupt businessmen, racial harmony and the importance of loyalty among friends. The mixture may be slightly unexpected, but it still manages to be predictable all the way. Only the film's resolution has any spirit or novelty, and even that goes all the way back to the Roman Colosseum. Quicker than you can say "Spartacus," two fighters figure out that their real enemy is outside the ring. "Gladiator" begins with the arrival of new-kid-in-school Tommy Riley (James Marshall). Tommy, who is either the strong silent type or just plain silent, encounters the usual troubles with local bullies. ("You're in my seat, boy," etc.) He has a teacher who encourages him to learn (Francesca P. Roberts). He also has a father with serious gambling debts (John Heard). And he has a talent for boxing, which is discovered by an unscrupulous talent promoter (Robert Loggia) who turns him over to a wise old trainer (Ossie Davis) and also to an even more unscrupulous promoter of illicit, underground bouts (Brian Dennehy). Somewhere along the line, there is a nice girl (Cara Buono) who loves Tommy enough to try to keep him from becoming brain-dead. The film eventually pits Tommy, who is white, against Lincoln (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who is black, even though they have developed a friendship outside the ring. The story's ending, which brings strife between these two, also reveals a newly slimmed-down Mr. Dennehy to be a wild man when he's fighting. And Mr. Dennehy has the chance to say the following: "You know why people get so excited at fights? It's the presence of death." "Gladiator" is occasionally on the gory side, but most of its really painful moments are on the page. The screenplay, by Lyle Kessler and Robert Mark Kamen, is filled with dialogue that could have been written in anyone's sleep. (Nice girl: "I can't figure you out." Tommy: "Neither can I.") The direction by Rowdy Herrington ("Jack's Back") is only slightly better, and it, too, has little life of its own. The best things about the film are Tak Fujimoto's crisp cinematography, a couple of the supporting performances (Mr. Davis and Ms. Roberts are both good) and the possibility that both Mr. Marshall ("Twin Peaks") and Mr. Gooding ("Boyz N the Hood") might fare better under other circumstances. Unlike anything else about "Gladiator," they are at least relatively unknown quantities. "Gladiator" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and violence.

1242-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chairman of Opel Unit Is Promoted by G.M.
The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that Louis R. Hughes, chairman and managing director of its Adam Opel A.G. subsidiary in Europe, had been named one of 35 corporate vice presidents. G.M. said in a statement that the auto maker was rewarding Mr. Hughes, 43 years old, for the success of the Opel organization. Opel's sales in Europe rose 26 percent in 1991 from 1990, to 719,000 vehicles, a gain attributed in part to the unification of East and West Germany. Strong sales in Europe helped the car company offset record losses in the United States last year. The new title for Mr. Hughes will not alter his responsibilities, but the announcement's timing was noteworthy. Mr. Hughes is one of several executives reporting directly to G.M.'s chief of European operations, Robert J. Eaton, who said this week that he had talked on two occasions with the chairman of Chrysler, Lee A. Iacocca, about moving to a top position at the No. 3 auto maker. Mr. Hughes's new title raised the possibility that G.M. was preparing for a possible departure by Mr. Eaton. A G.M. spokesman, Jack R. Harned, said there was no connection. "It was a coincidence, nothing more than that," he said, adding that the decision was made at a board meeting on March 2, before the speculation about Mr. Eaton. Mr. Hughes was not available for comment. Mr. Hughes's previous positions with the auto maker included a number of posts in the G.M. treasurer's office. In 1982, he was promoted to assistant treasurer in charge of international activities involving financing and new business ventures. In 1985, he was transferred to G.M. of Canada as vice president for finance. Two years later, he moved to Switzerland as vice president for finance for G.M. Europe. He was promoted to chairman of Opel in 1989. Mr. Hughes has a M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School, as well as a mechanical engineering degree from the General Motors Institute. He joined the auto maker as a student at the institute in 1966.

1243-> New York Water Tunnel Work Increased
In a move that is expected to create 200 new jobs, the city's Department of Environmental Protection plans to speed construction of the city's third water tunnel by awarding $250 million in additional contracts for the project in 1993, city officials said yesterday. Officials of the environmental agency said they planned to increase the amount of water tunnel contracts scheduled to be let next year to $350 million from $100 million to help stimulate the region's sagging economy and to save money on construction costs, which are now extremely low because of the weak economy. The city's water-supply system, which consists of two huge tunnels running down the Catskill Mountains, is more than 100 years old. The third tunnel will allow the city to shut down the first two, inspect and repair them. The third tunnel, which is being built in four stages at a total cost of $5 billion, will carry water from the Kenisco Reservoir in Valhalla, N.Y., to points through the city.

1245-> To Protect More of the Montana Wilderness; What Constituency?
To the Editor: Oh you holier-than-thou politicians -- in this case, United States senators -- who condemn those who have caused African grasslands to become deserts and those who have filled wetlands for building or poisoned them with chemicals. You decry the slash-and-burn destruction of tropical forests and jungles. Yet in your own backyard, as Robert Weir describes (Op-Ed, March 4), you collude quietly with the Forest Service to destroy our country's largest remaining old forest. Just what constituency are you serving? It's wonderful re-election fodder when you can please greedy industries, guaranteeing jobs for their workers. But if the Montana national forest management bill is passed, when the forests are barren and the depleted mines stand empty, will the loggers and miners pressure you for more of our irreplaceable land? Magnificent forests in a fragile environment will be destroyed, and the vast, ruinous changes that follow will prevent duplicating the eco-bio system that you have so hastily planned to eliminate. Millions of Americans have stood in awe of the stunning beauty in western Montana, hoping one day to share this visual delight with their children and future generations. The Montana forest bill reeks of dishonesty and environmental-political cupidity. What joy it would bring if you politicians didn't define your constituency as those who will grease your palms.

1246-> COMPANY NEWS; Salomon to Sell 42% Stake In Parent of Grand Union
Salomon Brothers Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its 42 percent stake in the parent of the Grand Union Company, a move that would enable the owners of the supermarket chain to try to establish a more durable financial structure after its leveraged buyout in 1989. The sale would end a significant foray into merchant banking by Salomon. The firm, which is trying to shed interests outside the securities industry, was part of the investor group that bought Grand Union in 1989 from the financier Sir James Goldsmith for $1.2 billion. Salomon had provided a bridge loan for the original buyout, but wound up with a larger debt position in the company than it had intended after the junk-bond market turned volatile. Sale to Big Stockholder If Salomon's proposed sale is completed to GAC Holdings -- the other large shareholder in the supermarket's parent company, the GND Holdings Corporation -- the deal would result in GAC Holdings and the chain's managers controlling more than 50 percent of Grand Union, the nation's 15th-largest supermarket chain. GAC Holdings plans to raise money and complete the recapitalization by mid-June. Between the fiscal years 1989 and 1991, Grand Union's sales rose by 10.2 percent, to $2.99 billion, while gross profits increased by 15 percent, to $784 million. The chain, based in Wayne, N.J., has 21,000 employees working in 304 stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, Georgia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Michael J. Zimmerman, a Salomon managing director, declined to say what Salomon would be paid for its stake. "Salomon will realize an attractive return on its investment," he said. Gary D. Hirsch, the chairman of GND Holdings, said Salomon's stake would be bought by GAC Holdings, with the help of a partner that has not been named. Too Few Details Analysts said yesterday that too few details were available to comment on the proposed deal or speculate on its price. After the transaction is completed, GND plans to increase investments in its Grand Union outlets. But Mr. Hirsch said little else would change about the chain's strategy. "With our new capital structure, we will be able to increase the rate of reinvestment in our stories, distribution infrastructure and technology," he said. Mr. Hirsch is also the managing general partner of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company, which also owns a large stake in the Penn Traffic supermarket chain, roughly similar in size to Grand Union. The recapitalization of the company would include repaying about $460 million of senior increasing rate notes issued by GND Holdings, and paying back $430 million in bank debt.

Fidenas Investment Ltd. has asked a New Jersey court to order the Emerson Radio Corporation to hold an annual stockholders meeting on June 16. The Swiss investment company also plans to propose a slate of directors for the North Bergen, N.J., consumer electronics company. Fidenas is Emerson Radio's biggest stockholder, with a 20.2 percent stake. Earlier this month, an offer that would have raised Fidenas's stake to 36.5 percent expired without a response from Emerson. The investment company said Emerson had not held a stockholder meeting since Sept. 7, 1989, despite a New Jersey law requiring one every year.

1249-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; President Is Retiring At Computer Associates
Computer Associates International Inc. said yesterday that Anthony W. Wang was retiring as president and chief operating officer. He will remain on the Islandia, L.I., company's board. Mr. Wang (pronounced Wong), 49, will be succeeded by his brother, Charles B. Wang, 47, who is chairman and chief executive officer of Computer Associates, which he founded in 1976. THe company said it did not plan a search for a replacement as president. Anthony Wang said in a telephone interview that he had long planned to retire early. "I didn't want to wait until I'm old and decrepit, having amassed a great forutne and not enjoyed life," he said. "Computer Associates is one of those all-consuming places; either you're in it 100 percent or you're not." He said he planned to pursue a number of personal interests. After a rocky two years, Computer Associates reported record results in its third quarter, ended Dec. 31, and expects to report strong revenues and earnings in its fourth quarter. "Now the company is strong," Mr. Wang said. "I feel quite confident we're on a nice track here," he said. "I know that C.A. is well positioned for a great future and that we have developed a management team which is fully capable of absorbing my responsibilities." Because it primarily supplies software for mainframe computers, Computer Associates is not well known to consumers. But, through canny acquisitions and strong marketing, it has grown to $1.4 billion in sales, which makes it second only to the Microsoft Corporation in software. Among its better-known products are Supercalc 5, a spreadsheet; Accpac, an accounting program; and Superproject, a project management program. Mr. Wang was born in Shanghai and grew up in Queens. Before joining Computer Associates in 1979, he was a partner with a Manhattan-based law firm. He is a 1968 graduate of Cornell Law School and received his B.S. degree from Yale University in 1965. He and his wife, Lulu, have one grown son.

1250-> COMPANY NEWS; 6 Vice Presidents Taking Early Pensions at Digital
It was a week of goodbye lunches at the Digital Equipment Corporation. The financially troubled computer maker is losing at least six vice presidents today as part of an early retirement program aimed at reducing the head count in the $14 billion corporation. More executives are expected to accept the severance plan. Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., expects up to 7,000 of its 116,000 employees to take early retirement, which is aimed at those over 50 years old. All those leaving are longtime Digital employees who played roles in the company's tremendous growth in the 1970's and 80's. A company insider said the list included George A. Chamberlain 3d, vice president for marketing and finance; Henry J. Crouse, vice president, strategic relations; James G. Cudmore, vice president, operations staff; William J. Heffner, vice president for image, voice and video; Robert C. Hughes, vice president, United States sales, and Domenic J. Lacava, vice president, Unix-based software and systems. None of the vice presidents were available for comment. Mr. Hughes has already accepted a position with Bachman Information Systems Inc. in Burlington, Mass. Mr. Lacava was the most visible of the officers to take the package. For four years he has been influential in developing Digital's open systems and Unix work station strategies, often speaking at Digital product announcements. Mr. Lacava lost his position in a recent reorganization and was expected to leave. In 1983 and 1984, 16 vice presidents left after a broad reorganization. Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said there were parallels with that time, noting that the company was undergoing a stressful strategic shift in difficult economic times. "The joke back then was losing those people was the best thing that ever happened to Digital," Mr. Schulman said. "There's no guarantee it will be the same this time. It certainly is more difficult now." Digital has suffered back-to-back losing quarters amid difficult economic conditions for the computer industry. The company is expecting to take a restructuring charge of up to $1 billion starting on July 1, when its new fiscal year begins, to cover the costs of further staff cuts. Dallas Kirk, a Digital spokesman, said the company would have no comment until Monday on those taking the severance package. He noted that employees had until the end of business today to change their minds.

1251-> COMPANY NEWS; SOUTHWEST AIR TO SPLIT STOCK AND RAISE DIVIDEND
Southwest Airlines, after expanding rapidly in California and Chicago as weaker carriers retreated in the last year, said yesterday that it would split its common shares 2 for 1 and raise its dividend by 12 percent. The number of outstanding shares will double to more than 93 million on July 15, and the yearly dividend after the split will be 5.6 cents a share. The price of Southwest's shares, which reached a record high of $44.50 last week, gained 87.5 cents, to $43.625, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Southwest, based in Dallas, is one of a few large airlines to earn a profit in each of the last two years. It achieved big traffic gains by acquiring several routes abandoned a year ago by USAir in California and at Midway Airport in Chicago, where Midway Airlines closed last year. American Airlines also said yesterday that it might cut back flights in California because of Southwest's lower fares.

1252-> CHRONICLE
Buckingham Palace could surely use a laugh or two: the latest word from the royal marital front comes from PRINCESS ANNE, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II. Yesterday she filed for an uncontested divorce from her husband of 18 years, MARK PHILLIPS. The couple have two children, Peter, 14 years old, and Zara, 10. They separated more than two and a half years ago. According to the Associated Press, a Buckingham Palace spokesman who made the announcement would not comment on whether the 41-year-old Princess, who is eighth in the line of succession, would remarry. The British tabloids have speculated recently that she wants to marry Commander TIMOTHY LAURENCE of the Royal Navy, a former aide to the Queen. He wrote letters to the Princess that were stolen and sent to a newspaper in 1989. They were not printed, but they caused a furor anyway.

He met in Albany with Sonny Hall, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. Union leaders and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed on a tentative contract in January with raises of 4.5 percent this year and 2 percent next year. But the union's members rejected the pact in March.

1256-> U.S. to Stop Making Arms-Grade Uranium
The Energy Department said today that it would no longer produce highly enriched uranium for the building of nuclear weapons. The step, which Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said would bring an immediate saving of $84 million, means the permanent shutdown of two nuclear processing plants whose task was to produce the uranium by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. One is at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.; the other is at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls. The permanent shutdown of the two processing plants had been expected since last September, when President Bush announced that the United States would unilaterally remove thousands of weapons from its nuclear arsenal. The shutdown of the Idaho processing plant, which has been closed since 1989 for environmental and safety reasons, will mean the loss of about 1,000 jobs; some employees will remain there to continue working on the cleanup of nuclear waste. The South Carolina shutdown's effect on jobs was unclear today. Although the United States has not manufactured a new nuclear warhead since 1990, Mr. Watkins is still intent on temporarily reopening one old nuclear reactor at the South Carolina complex to produce tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used in nuclear warheads.

1257-> Bush Ordered Iraqis Plied With Aid
A secret policy directive on the Persian Gulf region signed by President Bush in October 1989 said the United States should offer economic and political incentives to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a way of moderating his behavior and increasing American influence in his country. The directive, part of which was made available to The New York Times today, also stated that Iraq should be told that the United States would impose economic and political sanctions and urge its allies to do so if Baghdad resumed its use of chemical weapons, used biological weapons or tried to develop a nuclear weapon in violation of international accords. The Presidential order stipulated that Washington remained committed to defend its vital interests in the region, with military force if necessary, if they were threatened by the Soviet Union or another regional power. The directive served as the operative guide for American policy until Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. It has become the focus of a strenuous debate over whether the United States ignored increasing signs in the late 1980's after the Iran-Iraq war that Iraq was preparing to use its military might to intimidate its neighbors. Policy Clear, Order Secret A part of the directive was recently declassified by the White House after a request by Representative Sam Gejdenson, the Connecticut Democrat, who said today he would present it to a Congressional hearing on United States policy toward Iraq on Friday. In light of Mr. Gejdenson's plan, a Government official today made the declassified section available to The New York Times. The section on Iran and other countries in the Persian Gulf remains classified, and it is not known whether additional material on Iraq also remains classified. The general direction of American policy before the invasion of Kuwait has been clear for some time, but the directive has remained secret. According to the excerpts of the document, known as National Security Decision Directive 26, Mr. Bush also stated that the United States should consider selling forms of assistance like training courses and medical exchanges on a case-by-case basis as a "means of developing access to and influence with" the Iraqi military. Iraq as Regional Threat "Normal relations between the U.S. and Iraq would serve our longer-term interests and promote stability in both the gulf and the Middle East," said the document. "The U.S. Government should propose economic and political incentives for Iraq to moderate its behavior and to increase our influence with Iraq." At the time, Iraq had emerged from the Iran-Iraq war as the clear victor with the most formidable military power in the Persian Gulf, while Iran was devastated and seemed intent on reconstructing its economy. Although some analysts inside and outside of Government were warning at the time that the new Administration should craft a more balanced policy that recognized Iraq, not Iran, as the primary regional threat, the directive seemed to assume that Mr. Hussein would respond favorably to rewards by Washington. Administration officials have said that the policy was also based on the assumption that Iran and Iraq were so exhausted by their eight-year war that neither would seek outside adventures in the short term. That assessment was also articulated in an estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister intelligence agencies in October 1989 that stated that Iraq was not expected to turn aggressive toward its neighbors for two to three years, according to recent Congressional testimony by Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence. Wider Economic Ties The document, at least in its unclassified version, does not describe Iraq's nuclear-weapons program or its use of chemical weapons against Iran and against Kurdish civilians in Iraq. But the directive said that Iraq would be punished if it used chemical or biological weapons or sought to develop a nucler weapon. The Reagan and Bush Administrations had strongly opposed every initiative in the Congress to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for its use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish population in August 1988. The policy, as articulated in the directive, was also based on an expansion of economic ties between the two counties. It also said that "normal relations between the U.S. and Iraq would serve our longer term interests and promote stability in both the gulf and the Middle East." The directive also stated the long-held policy that "access to Persian Gulf oil and the security of key friendly states in the area are vital to us national security." It continued, "The U.S. remains committed to defend its vital interests in the region, if necessary, and appropriate, through the use of us military force, against the Soviet Union or any other regional power with interests inimical to our own."

1258-> Character vs. Caricature; Can Bill Clinton Be Trusted?
In 1988, he nominated Michael Dukakis with a speech voicing anguish over America's lack of concern for children. But no one remembers that; the 19-page address brought groans from a Democratic Convention that had barely five pages of patience. It was, someone gibed, either the longest nominating speech or the shortest Presidential candidacy in history. This time around, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has shrewdly and tirelessly persevered to win the nomination. Tonight, following Gov. Mario Cuomo's stirring nomination last night, he goes before the 1992 Democratic Convention to make another speech, to rally the public to his own candidacy. But if he is to succeed he'll need more than wit and energy. He'll have to confront a bigger, simpler subject: trust. Even in ordinary times, it's hard for unknowns like Jimmy Carter or Michael Dukakis to establish themselves as Presidential timber. It's even more difficult in this era when the public mistrusts all politicians. It's harder still for Bill Clinton. He had hardly presented his fresh face to New Hampshire primary voters before it was defaced with one mud pie after another -- accusations of adultery, ducking the draft, fudging about marijuana, improving on the truth. The medieval trial by fire has become today's media trial by electronic fire; and he survived. Even so, fairly or not, the doubts persist and Americans are left to ask, Can the public trust his character? Tonight he has the opportunity to transcend the caricatures. Instead of being judged by isolated incidents and hostile allegations, he can define himself in terms of lifetime values, preached and practiced. How well he does that will help answer the related question, Can the public trust his leadership? Governor Clinton has so far done a laudable job of telling where he would lead. He argues persuasively that the only way to compete in the new global economy is to invest in people -- in their education, training and productivity. It's a cogent plan. Productivity surely is the key to economic growth. But investment requires money, and so far Mr. Clinton has barely begun to tell where to find it. He calls for dismayingly small cuts in defense and no large tax increases, and exaggerates administrative savings, especially in health care. The failure to capture the peace dividend alone is enough to raise worries about how well he would stand up to Congress. There have, however, been some hopeful signs of candor at the convention. The keynoter Barbara Jordan, for instance, solemnly pronounced the need for "Equity of sacrifice. That idea says that we will sacrifice for growth, but that everybody must join in the sacrifice, not just a few." It would be reassuring to hear words like that from the nominee. There must be room, somewhere between empty oratory and suicidal candor, to express a commitment to sharing the burden. Sharing the burden: That could also be a motto for America's relations with the world. Can the public trust his global leadership? With the end of the cold war, the President may no longer be The Leader of the Free World. But he remains the most important one. Mr. Clinton talks sense about a list of foreign issues, but it's still a list. He would make a stronger case with a larger vision. What, for example, does he think should be the relationship of the New World to the New World Order? Finally, Can the public trust his leadership on political integrity? Money and politics is no longer the passion of a few good-government goo-goos. Voters everywhere say they are disgusted. It's small wonder, as political action committees pour millions into the campaigns of legislators who then vote for billions in benefits. Governor Clinton's record on this subject is exemplary -- as reassuring as President Bush's surrender is repellent. Mr. Clinton has had to struggle for campaign funds in part because he refuses to take any PAC money. He supports limits on campaign spending. He supports ending the flow of underground sewer money to candidates. He favors easier voter registration. These are all reforms the President has just vetoed. There is one puzzle. Politicians often say the right thing and duck when the time comes to do it. That's one reason for what Bill Clinton describes as the "wall of cynicism" he faces from voters. But here's an area in which he demonstrably does the right thing; what's puzzling is why he doesn't say more about it. This is one subject on which he already has earned the treasure of trust.

1260-> COMPANY NEWS; HUGHES AND VICTOR COMPANY OF JAPAN FORM VENTURE
The Hughes Aircraft Company and the Victor Company of Japan said they would form a joint venture to make video projectors, to be offered in the coming market for advanced television systems. The new California-based company, to be called the Hughes-JVC Technology Corporation, will start this fall marketing a professional model of a projection television set, which projects a video image on a large flat screen on a wall. Additional models will follow next year, with a consumer version due in 1994. JVC and Hughes Aircraft will together invest a total of $62.5 million into the company. JVC will own 40 percent and have an option to buy 10 percent more. It expects to employ 200 people by the end of 1993. Hughes-JVC Technology expects to increase production to 20,000 units annually within two or three years. Officials said the first professional models would be priced from $8,000 to around $500,000. The projectors are based on liquid-crystal light-valve technology developed by Hughes Aircraft, a division of the General Motors Corporation's GM Hughes Electronics unit.

1262-> COMPANY NEWS; CSX Taking Charge to Buy Small-Crew Premium Fund
The CSX Corporation said today that it would take a second-quarter after-tax charge of $450 million to buy out funds that pay union members premiums for working on trains with smaller crews. The charge will also cover severance packages for employees who leave as crews are reduced to two members from three. Crews had four workers until the 1980's. CSX is negotiating with the United Transportation Union to buy out productivity and "short crew" allowance funds, a move it expects to generate substantial cash savings. It did not estimate an amount. The productivity fund pays workers on a three-member crew an additional $4,500 a year, reflecting the railroad's savings from the crew reduction. The "short crew" allowance is an additional $3,000 a year for trips that are made with one fewer crew member. As CSX moves to reduce train crews to two members, crew members can opt to leave and accept lump-sum severance payments or stay and receive a portion of the buyout amount now and the remainder when they leave, said a company spokeswoman, Suzanne Walston. 30-Year Spread Expected CSX, which expects to spread the payments out over 30 years, estimates that about 45 percent of the payments will be made during the next year. Negotiations on a crew-reduction plan are under way between CSX and union members on the former Louisville & Nashville Railroad, the company said. Employees of the former Seaboard Coast Line Railroad approved CSX's offer in April, paving the way for crew reductions on that railroad. If the L. & N. workers also approve the agreement, about half of the CSX rail system will be operated by two-member crews. CSX will report second-quarter earnings July 23. Officials today did not know how much the charge will reduce earnings per share. The corporation, which operates a variety of transportation services as well as railroads in the Eastern United States, reported second-quarter 1991 earnings of $115 million, or $1.15 a share. CSX took a charge of $490 million after tax, or $4.88 a share, for 1991, primarily for train-crew reductions. The amount covered severance programs, but assumed no buyout of the "short crew" allowance and only a partial buyout of the productivity funds, CSX said. CSX shares today closed up 5/8 at 63 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

1264-> Broadway Puts On a Free Show for the Democrats
Broadway threw a mammoth, confetti-rich theater party in Times Square yesterday for the Democratic National Convention. At a time when the nation's eyes were on New York City, the event sought to dazzle the delegates with the city's generosity -- and to exploit convention hoopla as a means of drawing attention to the Broadway theater which, even after a stellar season, is struggling to fill empty seats. "Just in case the delegates' schedules are too tight, we've brought Broadway to you," said Mayor David N. Dinkins, kicking off the free theatrical extravaganza, "Broadway on Broadway." Trumpeted as the largest collaborative performance in Broadway history, the 90-minute show featured excerpts from 13 current Broadway productions accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra. Although the event comes at the end of a season that generated several hits and record ticket revenues, most Broadway shows are suffering from a classic case of summer slump, with only "Guys and Dolls," "Crazy for You" and "The Phantom of the Opera" doing sellout business. Times Square was closed to traffic during the performance, which ran from 11:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. Standing on an impromptu stage on the traffic island at Broadway between 43d Street and 44th Street, the Mayor addressed a crowd that stretched all the way to 49th Street and whose size was, in fine theatrical tradition, itself a matter of some dramatic hyperbole. Judd Hirsch, the star of "Conversations With My Father," took the stage to congratulate the assembled multitude as being "part of a crowd of 150,000," he said to enthusiastic applause. Pre-Performance Performances But Detective Patrick Early of the New York Police Department, who has estimated crowd sizes at New Year's Eve celebrations for the last five years, put the figure at "about 50,000 or so," adding, "This isn't exactly a small crowd." Among the other headliners on the stage yesterday were Alan Alda of "Jake's Women," Donal Donnelly of "Dancing at Lughnasa," Larry Fishburne of "Two Trains Running," Jodi Benson and Harry Groener of "Crazy for You," Stephen Bogardus and Michael Rupert of "Falsettos," Mac Davis of "The Will Rogers Follies," Freddie Roman of "Catskills on Broadway" and Lucie Arnaz of "Lost in Yonkers." The performers managed to slurp up a case of cold canned sodas as they raced to the stage and performed in shimmering heat and high humidity, many of them mindful that they had to be back at their theaters to play a matinee performance. Nevertheless it was with high spirits that they belted out musical numbers from shows including "Guys and Dolls," "The Most Happy Fella," "Jelly's Last Jam," "Man of La Mancha," "Miss Saigon," "Les Miserables," "Cats," "Falsettos," "The Phantom of the Opera," "The Secret Garden" and "Five Guys Named Moe." If the event's title was "Broadway on Broadway," it might have been called "Broadway Markets Broadway," befitting a production that was sponsored by the League of American Theaters and Producers and the Times Square Business Improvement District. Many of the performers exuberantly plugged their own shows, and the large crowd kept cheering them enthusiastically for it. "All of you might want to go over to the Lunt-Fontanne, where we have room for just a few of you," said Freddie Roman, one of the four comic stars of "Catskills on Broadway." Mr. Alda commented: "We're trying to use this visit by thousands of people to New York City as a way to celebrate what Broadway is. Even in this season, which is the best in years on Broadway, the theater sure needs some help." Not a General Impact So far the conventioneers haven't responded by buying overwhelming numbers of tickets, and some shows have felt the impact of the convention more than others. "I can't say that the convention has generated much business so far," said Robert E. Wankel, vice president of finance for the Shubert Organization. "But the delegates are pretty busy these nights. We expect to see a lot of them this weekend after the convention is over." Conventioneers' families, however, have been able to attend. Paul Libin, producing director of Jujamcyn Theaters, said that Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore and their children took in yesterday's matinee performance of "The Secret Garden." He said that so far convention-related ticket-buying had been a "positive presence" in the box offices of the theater chain's five shows. Indeed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York organized -- months in advance -- a party for 200 conventiongoers at yesterday's matinee of "Guys and Dolls." Backstage Greeting The families of other delegates have got the red-carpet treatment while their relatives were hard at work at the convention. John Lewis, a Georgia Congressman, arranged for his wife, Louise, and three family members to meet Gregory Hines backstage at "Jelly's Last Jam" on Tuesday night. And one Nederlander Organization show, "The Will Rogers Follies," scored a ticket bonanza yesterday when 201 members of the Oklahoma delegation and their families bought tickets to yesterday's matinee performance. Some sat in full convention regalia of hats, buttons and delegate credentials, and one even brought a placard to the show proclaiming, "Oklahoma No. 1." "We're here because Will Rogers is our favorite son," said Carolyn White, a Clinton delegate from Idabel, Okla., a rural metropolis of 8,500. "We didn't have to play hooky, because the convention doesn't start till the evening. It's not my first Broadway show: I saw 'Jake's Women' last weekend." Also in the audience were Senator David Boren, Gov. David Walters of Oklahoma, and the 1964 Miss America (an Oklahoman), Donna Axum Whitworth. At the end of "Broadway on Broadway," confetti rained from office buildings overlooking Times Square, and the assembled players launched into a spirited rendition of -- what else? -- "Give My Regards to Broadway." Then they took pictures of one another, toweled off, and hurried away to their 2 o'clock curtains.

1265-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER; Cruises: Do Travel Agents Steer Clients Straight?
TRAVEL AGENTS love to sell cruise tickets. The whole business -- lodging, meals, transportation -- is wrapped into one reservation, and the commission on the sale will come in one check. "I can spend a hour putting together a trip to Orlando," said Lillian Griffith, an agent at Rich World Wide Travel in Pearl River, N.Y. "But I can be all done with a good cruise package in half an hour." Like most other travel agents, Ms. Griffith derives her whole income from commissions. She may never receive the 8 percent commission for the Orlando hotel reservations because hotels are known to pay agents' commissions sporadically, and she will get no commission at all on the meals her clients eat out or on other things they buy, like taxi rides. She will get 10 percent on the Orlando airline ticket although she may have to rewrite it a couple of times if her clients change their plans. But cruises are the gravy, she concurs: On her clients' cruise, everything is commissionable, and the minimum commission is 10 percent. However, commissions can go much higher, as high as 25 percent, but these so-called overrides -- commissions higher than the minimum -- do not go to everyone. They are awarded, on a stepped scale, to travel agents who do a lot of business for the cruise line. Or, in a more complex setup, high commissions are given to agencies that buy memberships in a nationwide consortium that has a contract with a cruise line that is expected to produce a minimum number of cruises in the coming year; in such cases, the higher commission may be paid on the first sale of the year, rather than the 100th. One former cruise executive said: "If you manufacture soda, you have a case price for the grocer. That's the way business is done." 'Preferred Suppliers' A recent article in Tour & Travel News, a trade weekly, reported on a telephone survey of at least 100 agents showing that 85 percent of travel agents who sold five or more cruises a week had one of these special contracts, either directly or through a consortium, providing for higher commissions from certain cruise lines. According to the article, the agents said that in return for these commissions, 75 percent or more of their sales were for the lines with whom they held direct or indirect "preferred supplier" contracts. James Santo, author of the article, said in an interview that from the standpoint of customers, one question was whether the agencies should post a sign listing their preferred suppliers, just as an electronics store will have a sign saying "we feature Sony and other fine products," which tells sophisticated shoppers that the identified brands are providing bigger commissions. Larry Fishkin, the head of the Cruise Line discount agency in Miami, said that he considered his commission structure his business, but his agency brochure carries ads from nine lines that might be inferred to be his preferred suppliers. But he and others in the travel agency and cruise industry agreed that as long as the total number of buyers was fewer than the spaces on cruises, no buyer with a choice in mind is going to be denied a desired vessel, regardless of what line the agent favors; clients will go to other agents if need be. On the other hand, someone with no plan in mind is probably going to end up with one of the agent's preferred suppliers. This may not be terribly restricting: the four most popular preferred suppliers operate more than half the capacity of cruises sold in North America. Robert Dickinson, senior vice president for sales and marketing for Carnival Cruise Lines, the biggest in the industry, supports the override system, and his companies, Carnival, Seabourne, Holland America and Windstar, are major players in it. "If an agency has a thousand brochures on the wall," he said in an interview, "it is just going to be an order-taker." According to the Tour & Travel News survey, the four companies with most of the preferred supplier contracts are Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Princess Cruises and Kloster Cruise. Most travel agents with override agreements have them with more than one company; five is average. But Mr. Dickinson is unhappy when a consortium holds more than one preferred supplier agreement. Last year, Carnival canceled agreements with four consortiums that he believed were linked to too many lines. Rebates From Commissions But even if you already know what cruise you want, the override agreement may affect what you pay. When an override is big enough, the agents will rebate some of the commission to the client, cutting the cruise cost below any discount that may already be offered. This practice violates the override agreement but "they all do it," according to a former cruise marketing official in Florida who moved into another field but agreed with his former employer not to speak about the industry for attribution. Mr. Fishkin, of the Cruise Line agency, said in reply to a question about rebating: "We will do whatever it takes to be competitive in the marketplace." Mr. Fishkin's company, one of the biggest all-cruise agencies in North America, has a reserved block of thousands of berths to sell from, something a small agency cannot do. Mr. Fishkin said that his commission overrides might go to 26 percent from some of his preferred suppliers. In 1992, he expects to send 14,000 people on cruise vacations, almost all sold by telephone. Ms. Griffith in Pearl River, who said she had a solid clientele derived from people who work in the big building where her office is, said she would have problems with her clients if she sold a cruise not fitted to them: "I see them all the time," she said. Through the consortium her company belongs to, she gets "small" overrides from nine cruise companies. But nonetheless she said sadly that after she tells clients about a ship she likes, she sometimes loses them to a discount agency that can offer a better price on the same cruise. An unhappy side to the cruise business was brought to light recently by Thomas A. Dickerson of New York, the author of "Travel Law," (Law Journal Seminars-Press, updated through April 1992) who has made a specialty of suing travel operators and agencies in behalf of clients who got less or more than they bargained for. Consumer law in the maritime industry is in the dark ages, Mr. Dickerson told a conference on Mediterranean cruises in Barcelona in March. He said that Congress and the courts should re-evaluate a law whose basis was the protection of cruise lines from what he called "proper passenger claims." Mr. Dickerson pointed out that the small type on cruise contracts often specifies where any claim must be litigated, rather than allowing it to be tried anyplace the company does business, where the passenger bought the ticket, for instance. Courts have upheld a cruise line's insistence on shifting a physical injury case to Florida and another case to Naples, Italy. Equally dismaying, Mr. Dickerson said, the time limits imposed in cruise contracts are tighter than in other sorts of injury cases. If something happens to you on a cruise and you want to sue, the cruise contract states you must notify the line in writing within six months of the event and the lawsuit must begin within a year. Ned C. Lofton of Wakefield, Mass., was the lawyer for a woman who took legal action on the ground that she was raped in 1986 by two crew members on the Bermuda Star, suing Bermuda Star Line in Federal Court on grounds of breach of contract. When the jury was impaneled in Boston last year, the victim won a settlement in an amount Mr. Lofton would not disclose. The lawyer said that the most onerous part of the case was persuading the court that the six-month notification requirement had been impossible to meet because the victim was so traumatized she could not speak of the matter within the deadline. Both lawyers had practical advice for people taking cruises: If something happens to you in which negligence or breach of contract or some other legal failure seems likely, report the event to all concerned -- the ship's doctor, the purser, the cruise director or the captain -- and be sure that they write it down. Keep a copy or a note of what you have done and whom you have talked to. Read the contract to note the deadlines. As soon as you get ashore, call your lawyer to report. If you are overseas, call home and have your family contact a lawyer.

1266-> COMPANY NEWS; TV Venture Is Criticized For Promises to Investors
In promoting what it calls a revolutionary technology to provide interactive television, TV Answer Inc. has not been wasting time on subtlety. "The force that created a million fortunes is about to do it again," proclaimed a headline in recent full-page newspaper advertisements. The ads, which ran in The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today, also touted "the business opportunity of your lifetime" and the "biggest business opportunity since cellular" telephone licenses were awarded in the early 1980's. But industry and Government experts say the company is going too far by implicitly promising overnight wealth to relatively unsophisticated investors. While the technology undoubtedly works, advertising experts say its profit potential is unclear. "There are lots and lots of questions about this system," said Gary Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., consultant on interactive television. "The biggest question I get is, 'Are they for real?' When you think about it, a lot of the pieces don't fit together perfectly." License Lottery Planned In its ads, the company, based in Reston, Va., urges readers to apply for special Federal radio licenses to provide interactive television service to local areas. The licenses will be awarded through a lottery planned later this year by the Federal Communications Commission. Ervin S. Duggan, an F.C.C. commissioner, says he is worried that TV Answer's promotion may end up costing naive investors. "I want to encourage interactive television," he said. "I do not want to encourage ads that lure the unwary with get-rich-quick temptations." F.C.C. officials say they intend to issue a consumer alert warning people about the inherent risks of taking part in the lottery. Founded by a Mexican entrepreneur, Fernando Morales, TV Answer has developed a system that uses local radio frequencies to send data to and from people's television sets. Once the system is operational, the company says, viewers will be able to take part in game shows, order jewelry that is advertised and perhaps even take college classes -- all by pressing a pistol-shaped remote control device in response to cues displayed on their television screens. The company is trying to sign up local licensees for its technology and link them by satellite in a nationwide network controlled from Reston. The local systems are expected to cost from $100,000 to $3 million each to set up, depending on the size of the city. One big obstacle to popular acceptance is that the system requires viewers to pay as much as $700 for a controller to sit atop their television sets, while the transactions are expected to cost either advertisers or customers about $2 apiece, which will be split by TV Answer and the licensees. Even if the price of the controller drops by half, as many presume that it will, consumers may still be reluctant to pay for what amounts largely to a new form of advertising. Beyond that, advertising executives say other technologies can deliver similar services over phone lines, and cable television companies are preparing to introduce interactive features over coaxial cables. Consumers can already respond to many television commercials through the familiar if slower method of dialing toll-free "800" numbers. "I would say there are substantial opportunities in interactive television," said Michael Mascioni of Alexander & Associates, a New York consulting firm specializing in entertainment marketing. But, he added, "I have my doubts about TV Answer." But the company is supported by several former top officials in the Reagan Administration; Mark Fowler, who served as chairman of the F.C.C., has lobbied to persuade the commission to allocate frequencies, and George A. Keyworth, a former White House science adviser, is on the board of directors. Its chief operating officer, Richard R. Miller, is a public relations practitioner who became a minor figure in the Iran-contra scandal. In 1987, Mr. Miller pleaded guilty with a conservative fund-raiser, Carl Channell, to raising money illegally for the Nicaraguan contras. Mr. Miller said he stood by TV Answer's claims. "We have invested $60 million into this already and anticipate investing a total of $200 million by the time there's a product in the marketplace, and that's a way to calibrate what we think the business opportunity is," he said. But advertising experts said it was too early to know if TV Answer would succeed. "The question is whether the value of the service is commensurate with the price people will have to pay," said Martin Nisenholtz, head of the Interactive Marketing Group at Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising agency. "I'm skeptical, quite frankly, but it's not a foregone conclusion."

1267-> Talking: Divorce; Coming To Terms On a Home
EQUITABLY dividing a couple's assets during a divorce is getting more difficult as their home -- normally their prime asset -- -- falls in value in a weakened real estate market. "The bad market has made all our problems even harder to settle," said Malcolm Petrook, executive vice president of the Bromley Group, a Manhattan financial services publicity firm. Mr. Petrook, who had a home in Briarcliff Manor, was divorced last year. Lawyers says that ways have to be found to reopen old divorce settlements that were based on a high anticipated sale price of a couple's home because the proceeds may have been intended for alimony payments. In current divorce negotiations, the weaker market has prompted the development of new language about what constitutes a reasonable asking price for a home, especially since expectations may have to be lowered. In addition, the longer time it can now take to sell a home raises such issues as responsibility for mortgage or maintenance payments. Even when a home is not sold but remains the residence of one of the spouses, lenders have been reluctant to let the departing spouse off the hook for payments on the mortgage regardless of any voluntary agreement between the parties. The old settlements most affected are those reached during the height of the real estate boom of the 80's, especially if a date was set for the sale of the home based on the youngest child's reaching adulthood. This date may now have arrived. But the proceeds of a sale may have been so diminished that if the remaining spouse -- usually the wife -- is obliged to give half to her former husband she may feel totally wiped out. "It's become a real disaster for some of my clients," said Richard A. Amster, a matrimonial lawyer in Roseland, N.J. Sarah D. Eldrich, a matrimonial lawyer in New Haven, said the best solution is to try to reopen the settlement. Most states do not permit a modification except when changing circumstances have materially affected alimony or child support or when there is mutual agreement on a reopening of the terms. But it may be worth trying to get that done, Ms. Eldrich said, if the decline in home values has affected the anticipated source of future alimony or income. Mr. Amster said the courts in New Jersey have begun to accept that rationale. But Amy Reiss, a matrimonial lawyer in Manhattan, insists the New York courts are not yet showing the same indulgence. A spirit of compromise is essential. Say, for example, the former wife needs all the diminished proceeds the couple had agreed to share. "She might offer to trade off other things," said Ms. Eldrich, such as redividing the responsibility for a child's college tuition. Where current agreements are concerned, lawyers say far more detailed language is needed on sales conditions. Ms. Reiss, the New York lawyer, said that in the old days both parties would readily agree to a quick sale but now, she finds, they argue over the timing. The solution, she said, is to set the latest possible deadline for when the home can be put up for sale. To reach a reasonable asking price -- so one does not think the other is "giving the home away" -- she likes to stipulate that each choose a broker and get an opinion. If the two brokers cannot agree, they seek an evaluation from a third broker. The asking price then becomes the average of the three estimates. Ms. Reiss recently negotiated a settlement specifying a reduction of 7.5 percent in the asking price every 90 days. The husband agreed to pay for the mortgage and other carrying costs on the couple's three-bedroom East Side co-op until its sale. After it is sold, he will get a credit of 50 percent of his outlay, payable from his former wife's share of the proceeds. BECAUSE most mortgages now make both spouses equally responsible for the entire debt, decisions must be made concerning the division of this debt if the mortgage is higher than the current value. Another way out is to persuade the bank to take the "deed in lieu" -- take immediate title to the property instead of dragging everyone through a time-consuming and costly foreclosure to get full payment of the debt. Ms. Reiss cautioned against jointly holding a vacation home pending a market turnaround -- even if a careful schedule has been set up for occupancy by each party. Such arrangements can lead to friction, she said, recalling a couple with a Columbia County house where the ex-husband would leave "the place a mess and all the lights on." If the primary home is not being sold, the lender may not relieve the departing spouse of responsibility for payments on the mortgage.That spouse could then face problems getting additional credit. Lenders do this because they say they need as many people as possible obligated during an era of falling values and a rising personal bankruptcies. "We're taking a tough look before we're willing to release anyone under any circumstances," said Robert C. Moriggia, vice president for real estate lending at Marine Midland Bank of New York. One way out, he suggested, would be for the remaining spouse to find a replacement guarantor. Since the person remaining in the home is usually the wife, he said, the typical replacement becomes a parent or a sibling. If the loan is fairly light -- representing 60 percent or less of the current value of the home -- that, too, could help persuade most bankers to let the departing spouse off the hook. Another factor would be a strong income and top-notch credit history for the remaining borrower. But Mr. Moriggia said that it usually takes at least two of these offsetting situations to turn a banker around. WILLIAM SELSBERG, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., warned divorcing couples that they may get less for their home than another owner would for a comparable property. A lot of today's buyers are bottom-fishers, he noted, who really go in for the kill when they learn a divorce is in progress. They do this, said Mr. Selsberg, by nit-picking at the inspection report and requiring concessions for every minor defect. And the divorcing couple -- who can't agree at this point on almost anything -- are usually in no position to fend them off. Mr. Petrook, the financial-services publicist, and his former wife found this out and had to accept 25 percent less for their home than they expected. That is why Mr. Amster prefers settlements that distribute the proceeds of home sales on a variable basis, say 50-50 if it sells for $300,000 but 35-65 if it fetches only $200,00. This helps keep the overall distribution of assets in balance, he said.

1268-> Deep Doubts About a Death
Unless a court or Gov. Douglas Wilder intervenes, Roger Coleman of Grundy, Va., will be executed next Wednesday night despite deep doubts about his murder conviction. Indeed, an unusually strong case can be made, if the courts will hear it, that Virginia is trying to execute the wrong man for a brutal 1981 rape-murder. That's the risk of extreme injustice a state runs when it demands the irreversible penalty for murder. The risk was compounded in the Coleman case last year when the Supreme Court denied him a hearing because his lawyer had appealed a day late. The high court, determined to facilitate executions and excessively deferential to dubious state court rulings, said respect for state justice required penalizing the defendant for the apparent mistake of his lawyer. Even so, Mr. Coleman's defense team, aided by Jim McCloskey, a Presbyterian lay minister who has saved several innocent death row inmates, keeps coming up with potentially exonerating evidence. Mr. Coleman was convicted of murdering his sister-in-law, Wanda McCoy, on a string of circumstantial evidence. Since then the defense team has cast doubt on the adequacy of the state's investigation and proof, greatly strengthened the accused's accounts of his whereabouts at the time of the crime and strongly implicated another resident of the town where the crime occurred. Despite procedural roadblocks created by Supreme Court decisions, the defense continues to battle for another day in court. Federal Judge Glen Williams in Roanoke dismissed a petition Tuesday. He said the new evidence "at best" only attacked the credibility of the prosecution and failed to clinch Mr. Coleman's innocence. His analysis demands a smoking gun to prove innocence. If further appeals fail, it will be up to Governor Wilder to rescue the state's reputation for justice. Mr. Coleman has asked for executive clemency and agreed to waive any rights and stand trial a second time. The Governor, who favors the death penalty, has said he needs reasonable doubt before blocking an execution. Here the doubts are deep and worrisome. The death penalty is a barbaric practice that is losing favor in most countries that call themselves civilized. Even in cases of clear guilt, it can be cruel and unusual. It is never more cruel than when serious doubts persist.

1269-> TRUCE COLLAPSING IN YUGOSLAV AREA
Almost a week after Western pressure produced a new cease-fire agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, heavy fighting is continuing in the former Yugoslav republic, dimming hopes that Serbia and the Serbian guerrillas it supports in Bosnia will honor pledges to allow Bosnia's future to be settled in newly resumed negotiations under European Community sponsorship. Across Bosnia today, there was fighting in at least five different towns in a wide arc across the republic's northern, eastern and southern regions, as well as a major battle in the center of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, that began after dusk and featured artillery, mortar and rifle fire, some of it by the Serb-led Yugoslav Army. In another big battle, at the southern town of Mostar, Serbian gunners and Yugoslav Army units continued to pour artillery, mortar and rocket fire into the center of the predominantly Muslim Slav and Croat town, killing at least three people and heavily damaging a hospital. The cease-fire accord was accompanied by a pledge by the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serbian, Muslim Slav and Croat population groups to resume negotiations on their future in Lisbon, where European Community officials are seeking an agreement on a constitution for Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state with ethnic cantons for the three population groups. But when the talks began today, two days late, it was only after the European Community intervened to persuade Serbia, which has used the Yugoslav Air Force to control Bosnian airspace, to lift its refusal to grant a European Community aircraft permission to fly into Sarajevo to pick up Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim Slav who is president of Bosnia. Further worsening tensions, Gen. Blagoje Adzic, the Bosnian Serb who is acting defense minister of Yugoslavia, sent a blunt letter today to Mr. Izetbegovic refusing Bosnia and Herzegovina's demand for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army's 35,000 to 100,000 troops. General Adzic, in his letter, described the demand as "a rushed move" that would worsen the fighting. He also noted that "more than 80 percent" of the Yugoslav troops in Bosnia were Bosnian Serbs, a fact the army has cited previously as grounds for keeping them there. Later, the territorial defense force of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued orders to its troops to halt any attempt by the Yugoslav Army to move equipment in the republic, a move that could lead to new fighting if the predominantly Croat and Muslim Slav territorial units try to blockade army barracks and halt road convoys. Officials there have said they fear that the army will move its forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina into areas now controlled by Serbs, and later turn the troops and equipment over to the control of Serbian leaders. 'There Is No Cease-Fire' For the moment, attention focused on the cease-fire breaches. "There is no cease-fire," a Western diplomat in Belgrade said after reviewing first-hand reports from Sarajevo, Mostar and other contested areas of Bosnia by military observer teams from the United Nations and the European Community, which announced today that it is withdrawing its observers from several towns in northern Bosnia because of the dangers involved in the fighting. The diplomat said that the most that could be said, six days after the cease-fire was negotiated by a European Community peace mission, was that there had been a "partial cease-fire" for a few days in Sarajevo. Although independent reports have indicated that Muslim Slav and Croat fighters have played their part in breaching the cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Western embassies in Belgrade say there is little doubt that the most aggressive role is being played by Serbian guerrillas, with the Yugoslav army supporting them at important objectives like Mostar, a town of 100,000 people on the Neretva River about 50 miles southwest of Sarajevo. -------------------- U.N. Sending Envoy UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United Nations is sending a senior official to Bosnia and Herzegovina to examine the feasibility of sending a peacekeeping force there. France and Germany have asked the Security Council to extend the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina to prevent the civil war from spreading. But officials say Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told President Francois Mitterrand of France in Paris this week that the Bush Administration is reluctant to ask Congress for any more peacekeeping funds this year and that the Europeans must find the financing themselves if they want a new force deployed there.

1273-> CHRONICLE
"SUSAN CROSLAND has been described as 'the thinking reader's Jackie Collins,' but to me she is the mirror image of BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD," HAROLD EVANS, the president and publisher of the Random House adult trade division, said Tuesday evening at the book party for Ms. Crosland's novel "Dangerous Games" at Le Cirque. Right now, Mr. Evans is counting on Ms. Crosland to resemble Ms. Bradford as a mega-successful writer of steamy novels dealing with romance and chicanery in high places. After she finishes one more book for Random House, Ms. Bradford is jumping ship to HarperCollins, where she is said to have signed a contract worth more than $20 million. Both women were at the book party, along with another author in the same genre, IVANA TRUMP, who dashed off after 15 minutes of posing for photographers, explaining that she was giving a party in her apartment. As Ms. Crosland greeted some 100 guests, many of them with such droppable names as Barbara Walters, Paula Zahn, Barry Diller, Diane Von Furstenberg and Arthur Schlesigner, she seemed not the slightest bit perturbed that she might build a somewhat different literary reputation in this country. In England, she was known for serious journalism and profiles. American born with Mayflower lineage, she is the widow of Anthony Crosland, the Labor politician and British Foreign Secretary. "I am happy to be described as the thinking reader's Jackie Collins, the next Judith Krantz or Barbara Taylor Bradford," she said as she and Ms. Bradford complimented each other on their respective books. In return, Ms. Bradford smiled and said, "It's wonderful if she is touted as the new Barbara Taylor Bradford -- as long as they spell my name right when they write about her."

1274-> COMPANY NEWS; Sega Links With Sony to Make CD Video Games
Sega of America has signed up a potent partner, Sony Electronic Publishing, to help develop a new generation of movie-like video games. The games, featuring high-quality sound and realistic, rather than animated, characters will be an important weapon in the battle by the smaller Sega against the Nintendo Company, the market leader. The broad alliance announced yesterday calls for Sony to tap its full stable of recording artists, actors and movies to create games for the new Sega machines, which will use compact disk technology. The games will be played on a disk player that Sega will introduce in November, sooner than Nintendo intends. The CD accessory for 16-bit video players will give machines considerably more computing power, enabling software developers to design more lifelike games. Nintendo, which is the leader in the less powerful video games and machines, plans to follow next year with its own CD player. Links With Sega and Nintendo Sony is also planning to introduce its own Play Station CD game system, which will be available next year. The competing Sony system will be able to run Nintendo games but it is unclear whether it will be compatible with Sega. The Sega CD system, which is actually an accessory for the existing Sega Genesis System, will cost $299, about $100 more than the one Nintendo plans to release. Sony already develops games for Nintendo as a licensee, and the company plans to develop software for the Sega and Nintendo systems, which will not be compatible. Sony's ties with Sega will be closer, however. Sony will distribute Sega games through its diverse distribution channels for its home-video and music releases, for example. And Sega will be able to license Sony contract entertainers like Michael Jackson, an arrangement Sony does not have with Nintendo. Olaf Olafsson, president of Sony Electronic Publishing, said it might strike similar deals with Nintendo. Industry analysts said Sony was trying to insure its links with the two companies that are vying for dominance of a $6 billion market. "They have the ability and resources to throw a lot of things in the air and see which stays up," said Andrew J. Kessler, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. While the introduction of more realistic motion-picture quality games will be an important milestone for the industry, Mr. Kessler and others noted that high-technology combined with popular actors and musicians would not be enough to make the video games a sure hit. Software developers will have to bring the same imagination to incorporating the new technology as they did with existing, hugely popular games like Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. "If you take creativity and add video to that, it gets very, very intriguing," Mr. Kessler said. New Games Planned If the games are a hit with consumers, investors and movie companies may start pouring money into the business and snowballing its growth and sophistication, said Peter Black, president of Xiphias in West Los Angeles, which publishes an array of multimedia, CD-ROM video games. "The fire is building on this stuff," he said. To stoke the fire, Sega will introduce a slate of new games this fall and early next year. Thomas J. Kalinske, president and chief executive of Sega of America, said that one game in production, "Night Trap," features actors and movie sets for a game involving a vampire character. Another game being developed will enable players to edit a music video using footage of popular musicians. To help produce the games, Sega built a multimedia studio in Redwood City, Calif. It will be used to create video games based on the Batman and Indiana Jones characters.

1278-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Gucci's Current Campaign: Recovering Its Elite Image
HOW do you get Palm Beach patricians and Hollywood tycoons back into Gucci loafers after their secretaries start carrying Gucci handbags? That was the challenge facing Dawn Mello, the former president of Bergdorf Goodman who was given the mandate to revamp the Gucci image in 1990. It has not been easy. In the early 1980's, Gucci went mass market, distributing its products not only in its 36 United States stores but through 600 retail outlets as well. That strategy ultimately tarnished Gucci's image and sales of its costlier items. Then in 1989 Maurizio Gucci decided to close the 600 outlets, which cut the company's sales in half, to about $200 million, industry experts estimate. His goal: to focus on a line of costlier products developed by Ms. Mello at a time when consumers were being hurt by a recession and spending in general had slowed. After joining Gucci as executive vice president, Ms. Mello immediately changed its $10 million international advertising campaign. In the late 1980's, the print campaign had been handled by McCann Erickson, but Ms. Mello hired Maria Scottsa, who had been with McCann in Milan, to work directly for the company. The older print ads featured models dressed in Gucci clothes, posed in elegant locations. The focus, in Ms. Mello's view, was too much on atmosphere and too little on product. In the new campaign, Gucci did not even use models. "We had no image, so we could not use people to represent it," Ms. Mello said in a telephone interview from Milan. "We wanted a clean, uncluttered format. At first we stayed with that look. We were still settling on our image. We did not use any models until the 1991 season. And even now, there are no props. It is strictly a feeling of warmth or cold. In the winter we shot in Brittany and in the springtime in the California desert. The background becomes a frame. The fall campaign is shot with snow. It has a blue cast." Gucci's goal is to reach the shopper between ages 16 and 60, which means buying space in publications including Vogue, Architectural Digest, Conde Nast Traveler, The New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and GQ. While Gucci's $10 million budget makes it "a player," as one retailing executive put it, it cannot compete with larger rivals like Louis Vuitton, another manufacturer of costly leather goods, which spends an estimated $30 million on print advertising worldwide. Ms. Mello said Gucci had bought space in all the major life-style and travel magazines. She said she had learned from her days at Bergdorf Goodman that "it takes three years before you feel the effect of an advertising campaign." "The third season is when you feel it," she said. "That is why you should not change media midstream. I remembered that and took it into consideration." Is the new marketing approach working? Many industry experts say Ms. Mello's products and her advertising campaign have given the company a new look. But an executive at a rival leather goods retailer said: "I don't know of a premium brand that has traded down and been successful at repositioning. They have gone outside the original core of what made their business in the first place. Can they bring back the exclusive nature and character of their trademark after selling to everyone, their neighbor and the maid?" Because Gucci is now owned by Investcorp, a Bahrain-based partnership of Arab investors that does not make its results public, there is no certain way to evaluate its performance. Edwin Rice, executive director of Landor Associates, consultants who specialize in building brand identities, said he thought Gucci was having difficulty because high-end fashion labels were less in vogue than they had been. "People are putting their Rolex watches in the closet," he said. "High-end fashion does not seem to be in step with the 1990's." Some retailers say that while a handful of products are selling nicely, including the loafers and the traditional Gucci handbag, over all there is no rush to buy the Gucci status symbols that once filled closets from Southampton to Bel Air.

1280-> COMPANY NEWS; Morgan Stanley Stalks Olympia Assets
The struggle by financially troubled Olympia & York Ltd. to keep creditors at bay appeared to be under further strain today, when it became known that Morgan Stanley had begun searching for Olympia assets it might seize to settle a legal dispute. Morgan Stanley, the American investment bank, and Olympia, the Canadian real estate giant, have been battling over a contract involving 25 Cabot Square. The building is a completed structure at Canary Wharf, the vast office development Olympia is constructing in East London. Under the contract, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay for the building's construction and Olympia agreed to buy it for $240 million and then lease about two-thirds of the building's 500,000 square feet back to Morgan Stanley. The investment bank contends that the payment should have been made on Dec. 12. The cash-short Olympia argues that the money is not due until June 30. Last Thursday, hours before Olympia filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in Canada and the United States, a British appeals court upheld a previous court ruling in Morgan Stanley's favor. After a follow-up hearing today in the British court, Olympia said in a statement that it was still considering another appeal. In the statement after today's closed hearing, Olympia said it "understands that no steps are currently being taken to enforce the order" and that Morgan Stanley leaders "are considering their position." But a person familiar with Morgan Stanley's intentions said the reason the firm had not asked the court to enforce the ruling was that the American company first wanted to try to find unencumbered Olympia assets. "They intend to press ahead to locate assets that can be used to satisfy the obligation," said the person, who insisted on anonymity. This suggests that Morgan Stanley plans to test the bankruptcy protection granted last week to Olympia by Canadian and American courts. At least on the surface, the money owed to Morgan Stanley would seem to fall under the Canadian filing: the entity that signed the contract with Morgan Stanley, Rochemoor Ltd., is a special-purpose company set up by the Canadian parent company and has no other involvement in Canary Wharf. At least for the moment, the Canary Wharf operation is not in bankruptcy proceedings. Its 11 construction lenders, whose more than $1 billion in loans are backed by other buildings in the development, have given the project enough money to keep construction going until the end of the month. Canary Wharf now consists of nine completed or nearly finished office buildings, a completed retail complex and a small office building for which the steel structure has been erected. If Morgan Stanley could make a claim on other Canary Wharf assets -- and it is not clear that it could -- the development could be forced into bankruptcy administration or receivership in Britain.

1281-> COMPANY NEWS; JUDGE GIVES ZALE 2 MORE MONTHS TO REORGANIZE
A Federal bankruptcy judge has given Zale Corporation officials two more months to develop their own plan for reorganizing the bankrupt Texas-based jewelry retailer. Judge Steven Felsenthal of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Dallas extended the time the company had to resolve its debts without competition from other parties' plans. But the judge left the door open for competing proposals, saying he would allow creditors to request permission to file their own reorganization plans. Officials for Barre & Company, the Dallas investment banking firm that forced Zale into bankruptcy at the beginning of the year, said they would have a reorganization plan by June 1. Zale, the nation's largest jewelry store chain, operates under the names Zale's; Gordon's; Corrigan's; Sweeney's, and Bailey, Banks & Biddle.

1282-> COMPANY NEWS; EUROPEAN BLOC IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR P.&G.-FINAF DEAL
A European joint venture between the Procter & Gamble Company and Finaf S.p.A. of Italy will be approved by the European Community commission because the companies agreed to exclude Finaf's diaper operations from the deal. The commission, the executive panel of the European Community, indicated in Brussels yesterday that it would clear the deal. It initially objected to the venture because the combination would have given the group up to 58 percent of the community's diaper market. The companies agreed to withdraw Finaf's diaper business from the venture and sell it to a third party, said Peter Guilford, a commission spokesman. If Finaf's diaper operations cannot be sold before an undisclosed deadline, the companies agreed to operate their diaper operations separately. The joint venture also includes feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products, which did not raise competition worries.

1283-> METRO MATTERS; Dan Quayle, Malcolm X and American Values
BLACKS realize increasingly that physically, politically, economically, and even to some degree socially, the aroused black man can create a turmoil in white America's vitals -- not to mention America's international image. Spike Lee was dismissive. Betty Shabazz was hopeful. Robert Little was skeptical. All three -- the film-maker, who is completing his production of "X," and Malcolm X's widow and brother -- were incredulous at Vice President Dan Quayle's revelation last week that he was mining the slain black nationalist's autobiography for clues to racial conflict and to its mitigation, reported in The Wall Street Journal. Four months ago, Mr. Quayle addressed the Economic Club in Manhattan, where he bashed the city's bureaucracy and laid the groundwork for his critique of New York as the welfare state incarnate. Today, Mr. Quayle is due back to preach American values to another thoughtful choir, the Manhattan Institute, and, according to his spokesman, David Beckwith, "more of what's wrong with New York." Which might suggest that, if today's speech is inspired by Malcolm's views, such as those quoted here, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Human rights! Respect as human beings! That's what America's black masses want. "It's a joke," Mr. Lee said last week of the Vice President's move. "Every time Malcolm X talked about 'blue-eyed devils' Quayle should think he's talking about him. How does he see himself having a role in reversing racial conflict? He doesn't have any blacks or Hispanics or Asian-Americans among his senior staff." Mr. Lee added, "He says teach a person how to fish rather than give a person a fish, but the people who've got the fish, they're all white males." Why was it that when Negroes did start revolting across America, virtually all of white America was caught up in surprise and even shock? I would hate to be general of an army as badly informed as the American white man has been about the Negro in this country. "He talks about traditional values," said Dr. Shabazz, an official at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. "Is he saying that only certain people have values and other people don't? "What I think is very sad is some people feel that white people should have as their agenda only Caucasians. And that if black people don't have white people as their agenda they're considered hatemongers." And, she said, "If New York is the welfare state, it is because we have helped everyone else but ourselves." One thing the white man never can give the black man is self-respect!. . . The black man in America has to lift up his own sense of values. "I don't know what would make the Vice President more sensitive, given the ideology he espouses," said Mr. Little, who heads New York City's Child Welfare Administration. "States, unfortunately, are having to make up for Federal disinvestment," he said. "Are poor people receiving enough dollars to adequately survive? No. Being on welfare in and of itself limits your income to a substandard level." It takes no one to stir up the sociological dynamite that stems from the unemployment, bad housing, and inferior education already in the ghettos. This explosively criminal condition has existed for so long; it fuses itself; it spontaneously combusts from within itself. Mr. Quayle was referred to Malcolm's autobiography by Digger Phelps, the former Notre Dame basketball coach since recruited to the Government's anti-drug crusade. Five years ago, Mr. Phelps presciently sensed the national mood when, asked about mandatory drug testing of players, he replied: "Somebody's got to do something. I'm going to give up some Constitutional rights." If Mr. Quayle is reading the autobiography nearly 30 years after it was first published, he deserves two points for his own belated cultural outreach and his embrace of Muslim self-discipline as one vehicle for instilling them. (After all, Malcolm was a convert, too.) Beyond suspending alternate-side parking rules on Moslem holidays, though, it's uncertain how Mr. Quayle would have government promote the religion's agenda. Whenever something white men disliked happened in the black community, typically white public attention was directed not at the cause, but at a selected scapegoat. Listening to Dr. Shabazz and to Mr. Little would provide another dimension to Mr. Quayle's postgraduate education. An unforgiving Mr. Lee says, though, that he would not even invite the Vice President to a screening of his new film next fall. "He should pay $7.50 like everyone else." Billboards are already promoting the film. Beneath a huge "X" is the word November, which is when the film opens and when Americans vote. The X is for Malcolm. But it also means the unknown -- whether the rest of America is persuaded that New York epitomizes the failed welfare state and that Mr. Quayle would do a better job of helping the poor help themselves.

1285-> FUJIMORI WEAKENS AS TOP AIDES QUIT
The Government of President Alberto K. Fujimori began to show signs of serious erosion today as officials responsible for vital economic recovery programs and the maintenance of relations with the United States resigned. At the same time, the Congress, which Mr. Fujimori dissolved by edict 16 days ago, swore in the First Vice President, Maximo San Roman, as constitutional President. The ceremony took place in a building surrounded by the tanks and soldiers of an army that is backing Mr. Fujimori, but the troops made no effort to block the essentially impotent Legislature from installing Mr. San Roman as a "constitutional," but at the moment powerless, President in a largely symbolic act. In a national address late tonight, Mr. Fujimori spelled out a one-year timetable for creating "a new nation." As he spoke, he continued to try to give a sense of legitimacy to his actions and convince the world that he was committed to a return to democracy. The steps include a national referendum on July 5 seeking approval of his seizure of power, the publication on Aug. 31 of proposed amendments to the Constitution and a referendum on Nov. 8 on the amendments. An End to Privilege Elections of a new Parliament, he said, would be held on Feb. 28, 1993, and the new Congress would be sworn in on April 5, one year after he dissolved Congress and assumed greater powers. Repeatedly pointing to polls that show public support for him at high levels, he said, "My intention obviously is not to end the political class. My intention is to end its privileges. We need to break with the past and establish here and now a new nation." Mr. Fujimori did not spell out the degree of freedom he would give political opponents during the process, but said he would permit a "national debate on the changes to the Constitution." Political emotions, which have run high, were further charged by the arrival of delegates from the Organization of American States, who have been sent to try to restore democracy to the country. Mr. Fujimori met with them before his address tonight. 'Early Warning Signal' As the meaning of the resignations from the President's inner circle began to sink in, one local political commentator noted, "This was not a good day for Fujimori." The man, who insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution, added, "These are early warning signals." The biggest purely domestic blow was the news that Carlos Bolona, Minister of Economy and Finance, had resigned. Mr. Bolona spent last week in the United States trying to persuade the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, as well as a group of industrialized countries that had earlier pledged to contribute $1.4 billion in aid to Peru, to continue working with the Fujimori Government. After Mr. Bolona was reportedly told that new funds would be scarce until Peru restored democracy, he returned and resigned over the weekend, said Government officials who insisted on anonymity. Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller confirmed Mr. Bolona's resignation this afternoon. Government officials also said that a number of Mr. Bolona's colleagues at the Economy Ministry have also resigned. In addition, the Peruvian Ambassador to the United States, Roberto Maclean, submitted his resignation, as did Peru's superintendent of banks and insurance, Hugo Garcia Salvatecci. A Refusal to Resign A different approach was taken by Jorge Chavez, head of the Peruvian Central Bank, who is considered a strong Fujimori loyalist. In an effort to keep the bank independent, he met on Monday with Mr. San Roman. When asked by Mr. Fujimori for his resignation, Mr. Chavez refused. Most important to Mr. Fujimori would be the loss of Mr. Bolona and Mr. Maclean, both highly regarded internationally and considered the members of the Administration best able to understand the reactions of the United States and Europe. Mr. Bolona's departure will set back any hopes of reviving the struggling economy soon and is likely to lead to even greater isolation of Peru. However, the personnel problems do not mean President Fujimori is about to fall. On Monday, all four parts of the Armed Forces signed a statement supporting Mr. Fujimori as the only legitimate head of state. On the same day, State Department officials confirmed that the United States still considered Mr. Fujimori Peru's head of state. Today, some 30 teachers union members gathered outside the College of Lawyers, shouting, "Democracy, yes. Dictatorship, no," and "Listen O.A.S., this is tyranny," while about 200 obviously sympathetic but less vocal supporters of the dissolved Congress looked on. For members of Congress meeting for the swearing-in of Mr. San Roman, a businessman from the Andean city of Cuzco, it was perhaps the first day they felt they were gaining on the man they now call a dictator. Lawmakers said that, although installing Mr. San Roman was mostly ceremonial, it was part of a long-term strategy of slowly gaining strength. "We're not saying San Roman will have absolute power beginning today," said Senator Enrique Bernales. "We're in a big chess game. And Fujimori is the one losing the pawns."

1287-> CONSUMER RATES; Tax-Exempt Yields Decline In Reverse of 3-Week Trend
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down in the latest week, with tax-exempt yields falling for the first time in a month. In the week ended Monday, the yields on tax-exempt money funds were down after rising steadily the last three weeks. Analysts at Donoghue's said greater demand for fixed-income securities had lowered interest rates throughout the market, driving prices there higher and yields lower. Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said the demand for tax-exempt securities could be seen in the flow of $1.2 billion into the funds, pushing total assets up to $94.8 billion. The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell by 12 basis points, to 3.12 percent, while the simple yield dropped a like amount to 3.07 percent. In the same period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield and simple yield, both increased by 7 basis points, to 3.08 percent and 3.04 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios had increased by one, to 53. For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 4.33 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.52 percent. In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Calvert Tax-Free Reserves/Money Market Portfolio offered the best return, at 4.01 percent. The fund's distributor is the Calvert Group of Bethesda, Md. Taxable Funds In tracking taxable money market funds for the week ended Tuesday, Donoghue's reported that assets were up $340 million, to $491.4 billion. As institutional assets grew by $2.3 billion, to $164.1 billion, retail assets declined by $2 billion. Analysts said the narrow yield spread between taxable funds and tax-exempt funds had favored the tax-exempts. The average seven-day taxable compounded yield fell 5 basis points, to 3.57 percent, and the simple yield dropped 4 basis points, to 3.51 percent. For the 30-day compounded average, the yield was 3.63 percent, down 5 basis points, with the simple yield down a similar amount to 3.57 percent. The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series repeated as the best performer, with a return of 4.35 percent, down 3 basis points from its best yield last week. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit. By comparsion, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of the money funds, stands at 3.46 percent.

1288-> Beer Dispute Flares Up Between U.S. and Ontario
Ontario brewers are preparing for a new beer battle with the United States after learning that the Bush Administration's interagency Trade Policy Review Group has recommended a 50 percent import duty on Ontario beer. The action is subject to approval by the Cabinet, and Canadians say they will retaliate in kind. Kathy Lydon, the assistant United States trade representative for public affairs, said no final decision had been reached but said the trade representative's office was preparing to make an announcement on Friday. The dispute over beer, after a peace accord "in principle" was reached in April, underscores the unusually high political sensitivity over trade issues that both Governments are wrestling with, as they combat economic sluggishness, prepare for elections and try to reach a free trade agreement with Mexico. One of Many Disputes Beer is just one of a number of trade sectors, including steel, magnesium, lumber and pork, where the United States and Canada have clashed in recent months. Both Canada and the United States have complained that the other was applying protectionist policies to maintain domestic beer production and employment and hinder cross-border shipments. Trade arbiters in Geneva under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade have upheld the respective cases. Canada agreed to steps to open its market in April, but as the two Governments sought to put the final details in place, the provincial government of Ontario, which has a fair amount of autonomy, introduced a 10-cent-a-can levy on beer cans, which enraged exporters from the United States, most of whose beer enters Canada in cans. Canadian brewers sell mostly in bottles. In addition, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario has set a $2.53-a-case warehouse charge, which Canadian brewers do not pay. Ontario is Canada's largest province, where about 40 percent of all Canadians live. Leading the fight for retaliation in the United States are the G. Heileman Brewing Company and the Stroh Brewery Company. The three largest American brewers -- the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Coors Brewing Company and the Miller Brewing subsidiary of the Philip Morris Companies -- have longstanding licensing arrangements with the Canadian brewers under which their major brands are produced in Canada. The projected new American levy, which would amount to about $3 on a case of 24 bottles, would hit Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd., the Labatt Brewing Company, Sleeman Brewing and Upper Canada Breweries.

1289-> COMPANY NEWS; Apple to Give the Public Its First Look at Newton
On Friday, Apple Computer Inc. will take the wraps off its first entry into what its chairman, John Sculley, predicts will be a $3.5 trillion industry combining entertainment, communications and computing with digital technology. Dubbed Newton, the pocket-size, pen-based computer is the first completely new product introduced by Apple since the Macintosh in 1984, and the first created since the departure of Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder. Newton combines electronic calendar, card index, note-taking and telecommunications functions and will be the first in a line of "personal digital assistants" from a new business unit at Apple, called "personal interactive electronics," or Apple PIE. No Prototype to Show Yet But people who go to the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where Apple will make its announcement, will not see a finished product, or even a working prototype. Apple will show a videotape about Newton and demonstrate the new device's software running on a Macintosh. At a press briefing earlier this week, Apple also showed a nonworking black plastic mock-up described as a "concept model of a class of device that might be made using Newton technology." Paul Saffo, an industry consultant with the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., said, "This is a gutsy move into unexplored territory." Analysts who have seen Newton like it, and welcome Apple's entry in a new business, but they also question the size of the potential market for a personal organizer priced close to $1,000. If Newton remains little more than a more elegant version of Sharp's Wizard pocket organizer, the market will be small, they say. On the other hand, if Newton can harness digital technology for nonusers of computers, the potential market is huge. "Apple has an opportunity to play a leadership role, but there's no shortage of competition out there," said Richard Shaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter. Apple executives said Newton would be shipped within nine months. The delay insures that the new device will face ample competition. On Wednesday, the Tandy Corporation and the Casio Computer Corporation of Tokyo, said they would collaborate on a line of personal information systems. And the Hewlett-Packard Company, which has already sold 100,000 pocket-sized keyboard computers, has said it will make a pen-based device, which it could ship next year. To be built by Sharp in Japan, Newton uses a clip-on pen to issue commands and enter data, which can be either text or graphics. Newton's software provides handwriting recognition -- of printed letters but not cursive writing so far -- and can also straighten lines in drawn images. Newton also uses a software concept known as "smart agents," or "intelligent assistance" in Apple lingo, which organizes any entered information without being told to do so. For example, a scrawled note to remember a lunch date with a client is automatically entered in the calendar at the appropriate time. Apple developed its own pen-based operating system software for Newton. Newton packs a lot of power in a package just 6 inches by 8 inches through the use of RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, technology, which speeds computing by relegating more tasks to software. Newton's brain is a RISC microprocessor developed by Apple, VLSI Technology of San Jose and Acorn Computer of Britain. Apple said Newton products would all sell for under $1,000. SRI International, a consulting company based in Menlo Park, predicts that the market for personal digital assistants will grow from about 1.8 million last year to 17.6 million a year by 1995. Sounding a more conservative note, Charles Wolf, an analyst with First Boston, predicted that Apple could sell 250,000 Newtons in 1993.

1291-> By Design; A Comeback for Hats?
Will the hat really come back? As the American collections for next fall swept down the runways on Seventh Avenue last week, the hats the models wore were impossible to ignore. At Perry Ellis and Anna Sui, floppy overscale caps sprouted long, tickly feathers anchored with costume-jewelry brooches just above their brims. They were enchanting, conjuring up nostalgic images of 1960's hippies. Calvin Klein's hats were trim, no-nonsense berets, made luxurious by their sleek fabrics patterned to resemble leopard and zebra skins. At Ralph Lauren, there were men's bowlers that looked like they had been imported from a haberdashery on London's Jermyn Street. Donna Karan's big-brimmed, velvety hats shadowed the models' eyes, suggesting high daytime drama. There were even hat fripperies for evening, notably Gemma Kahng's whimsical concoctions of tulle and mesh veiling. All of these and countless other hats made for delightful runway watching. But the question remains: Come fall, will women seriously get into the habit of wearing hats again? Maybe, just maybe, the moment is arriving when this bit of dressing addendum will once again become fashionably important. As long as a hat is as easy to pull on and as appealing as those seen last week, its chance to stage a comeback may be here.

1292-> Bridge
The Greater New York Bridge Association, which successfully introduced a major event with cash prizes two months ago, continues to break new ground. Its Summer Regional Championship, beginning tomorrow at the Vista International Hotel, 3 World Trade Center, Manhattan, will feature a two-day Swiss Pairs, scored by match points, the first time such a competition has been played in North America. The full schedule is: tomorrow, Imp Pairs and Stratified Open Pairs, 1:30 and 7:30 P.M.; Bracketed Knockout (first session), 7:30 P.M.; Knockout Teams (one session), midnight; Saturday, Matchpoint Swiss Pairs, noon and 8 P.M.; Flighted Open Pairs, noon and 6 P.M.; Sunday, Matchpoint Swiss Pairs (final), Open Swiss Teams and Stratified Swiss Teams, 12:30 and 7:30 P.M. Single-session Stratified Novice Pairs throughout. One of the biggest swings of the Eastern Regionals, played seven weeks ago, came right at the end, in the final of the Reisinger Knockout Teams. It can be seen that seven no-trump and seven hearts are both lay-down contracts for North-South, and the latter was reached efficiently by George Tornay and Saul Bronstein. Their teammates, with the East-West cards, were Phillip Martin and Debbie Zuckerberg, who bid impertinently to three spades in spite of being vulnerable. They could have been doubled for a penalty of 800, but that would have been a small price to pay when North-South can make a vulnerable grand slam. As a result of this barrage, North-South failed to reach the grand slam and played their small slam in clubs instead of choosing hearts or no-trump. In six clubs South faced problems after the lead of the spade jack. Unsure about the location of the spade king, South put up the ace in dummy. He planned to dispose of his spade loser on dummy's diamonds, and if he had attempted that immediately the slam would have succeeded. Not unnaturally, however, he cashed two high trumps before playing diamonds and that had unfortunate consequences. East ruffed the third diamond with a low trump and was overtrumped. South crossed to dummy with a heart lead and played a fourth diamond, but East administered the coup de grace by discarding his remaining heart. South was able to dispose of his spade queen, but could not now deal with East's remaining small trump. On the fifth diamond East threw a spade, and South was left with the choice of permitting a heart ruff or ruffing a spade and losing control. Either way the club seven gave the defense the upper hand. Martin and his teammates gained 20 imps on the deal, a winning battle in what proved to be a losing war.

1293-> BASKETBALL; Oakley Takes Issue With Offer to Grant
The Knicks had set up the news conference as an image-polishing event, but Charles Oakley, the designated spokesman, used the opportunity to tarnish the wisdom of the club's recent attempt to acquire Harvey Grant. Oakley was expected to confine his remarks to his work with the Creative Arts Workshop, the club's high-school mentor program, but he wandered from the game plan by venturing into the Knicks' frontcourt and front office. The power forward wondered aloud why the Knicks didn't sign Gerald Wilkins and Xavier McDaniel last season and questioned their tendering a multiyear, multimillion-dollar offer sheet to Grant, of the Washington Bullets. The Bullets eventually matched the offer and kept Grant. "X is an All-Star," said Oakley of McDaniel. "He proved himself in the playoffs. He got the ball a lot more than in the season. When X scores, other things happen. Grant can't take the punishment like X can, or give it out. If I were X, I'd be questioning the Knicks after a move like that. I mean, you'd think the team's got to pay X more than Harvey. Might Have Been Traded If the Knicks had secured Grant and signed McDaniel, Oakley believed that a certain other Knick -- Charles Oakley -- would have become superfluous enough to be traded. "Which is O.K.," said Oakley. "It gives me a chance to show my talent elsewhere." Oakley endorsed the acquisition of shooting guard Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks with a curt, "He can score," but he saw the Knicks' refusal to settle with McDaniel and Wilkins as a tack that might have damaged team harmony last season. "If the Knicks really cared about those guys, they'd have signed them last year," said Oakley. Oakley's critique was voiced with a bit of roguish pleasure, and seen in a smile that indicated there was no malice accompanying his opinions, just an attempt to conjure a headline. He smiled and told reporters seated around a table with him: "Make me look good. I gave you all that information." Kid From the 'Neighborhood' Preceding Oakley's extracurricular remarks, he announced that 16-year-old Randy Harper, a high school student raised in New York and now living in White Plains, had been chosen to work this summer in the Knicks' office as the winner of the club's high-school mentorship program. Harper had come out of the workshop, a city project with which Oakley has been associated. At an East Side restaurant Oakley spoke of his work with the program, which, he said, helps children in the city build self-esteem through visual and performing arts. He also spoke of the scholarships he seeks from corporations so that disadvantaged youngsters can attend basketball camps he runs in Ohio, Alabama and Virginia. "I try to create things for the community," said Oakley. "I go back to the neighborhood. A lot of people talk about it but don't do it. They're too big. They forget where they come from."

1295-> COMPANY NEWS; RESEARCH CENTER WILL BE OPENED IN MOSCOW BY BOEING
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it would establish a research center in the Moscow area, gaining a foothold in Russia's long-closed aerospace industry. An agreement covering the center was signed in Moscow, Boeing said. "There is a tremendous amount of technology there," said Larry Clarkson, Boeing vice president for planning and international development. "This will help us get in on the ground floor and establish business ties with that country." The center, to open early next year, will operate under the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. It will employ as many as 30 Russian engineers and scientists and a few engineers from Boeing, which is based in Seattle.

1296-> CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS; U.S. Journalist Is Killed in Convoy to Sarajevo Talks
Snipers opened fire today on a convoy taking Prime Minister Milan Panic of Yugoslavia into Sarajevo for peace talks, and an ABC television producer was killed in the attack. Mr. Panic and the ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, who were in an armored personnel carrier provided by United Nations peacekeepers, were unhurt. But the ABC News producer, David Kaplan, who was in an accompanying vehicle, was hit in the back and died at United Nations headquarters. Mr. Kaplan, 45 years old, was not wearing a flak jacket. He is believed to be the first American killed in Sarajevo and the latest in a string of journalists to die in the civil war in former Yugoslavia. Mr. Panic, clearly distressed by Mr. Kaplan's death, told reporters: "Criminals killed him. Terrorists killed him. These are crippled people mentally." Doctors said Mr. Kaplan had been shot in the back and died on the operating table at the headquarters of United Nations peacekeepers in the besieged Bosnian capital. In New York, an ABC spokesman said that Mr. Kaplan had been hit by a bullet that severed an artery and that doctors had been unable to stop the bleeding. Mr. Kaplan was part of a "Prime Time Live" crew accompanying Mr. Donaldson to prepare a report on the fighting in Bosnia for broadcast tonight. As a producer for ABC, Mr. Kaplan was responsible for helping to choose subjects and plan reporting trips, as well as arranging logistics for the correspondent and film crew, collaborating on what and how to film, working on the script with the correspondent, editing the segment and arranging for it to be sent to the news broadcast. "No one knows who did the shooting," Mr. Donaldson said, speaking by telephone on the ABC program "Good Morning America." "I guess it was just a random shot." He said Mr. Kaplan had been riding in a vehicle that did not have armor plating and that he was not wearing a flak jacket for the trip by the convoy on a stretch of road known to be a center of sniper activity. 30 Journalists Have Died At least 30 journalists are estimated to have died in little more than a year in the former Yugoslav republics. American Embassy officials in Belgrade said they believed that Mr. Kaplan was the first American to die in Sarajevo since fighting began there four months ago. Apparently quoting from a confidential report, Mr. Panic said, "Do you know, to kill one journalist they get paid 500 bucks.?" He said he knew of 70 snipers who had been jailed, adding: "Unfortunately, they were Serbs. I thought they were Muslims. They were Serbs." Mr. Panic had flown into Sarajevo for talks with Bosnia's Serbian and Croatian leaders in the former Yugoslav republic. An aide told the Yugoslav news agency Tanyug that because of Mr. Kaplan's death, Mr. Panic had managed only a 20-minute phone call with the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic. The Serbian-born Mr. Panic, a self-made Los Angeles millionaire who became Prime Minister last month, said Wednesday that he would recognize Bosnian independence within its present borders and that Yugoslavia had no territorial claims upon it. Bosnian Serbs have captured 70 percent of Bosnian territory since fighting began in April. In Washington, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Mr. Kaplan, who covered the White House for several years, "was an honest, fair, talented and creative journalist." "So his death today is a very sad and personal loss for all of us who've worked with David for the last decade in this very room, and we send our sympathies to his wife, Sally, his mother and father and to the other members of his family," Mr. Fitzwater added in a statement. In New York, the president of ABC News, Roone Arledge, said Mr. Kaplan had "devoted his life to news and to this organization." "David's approach to his profession was one of intense dedication to the accuracy and speed that makes a successful news producer," Mr. Arledge said. "Perhaps of equal importance, David was a man of humor and imagination, and yes, of courage." Mr. Kaplan's body was put onto Mr. Panic's plane to be taken to Belgrade. Last month, a Cable News Network camerawoman, Margaret Moth, was shot and severely wounded by sniper fire in Sarajevo. She is recovering after several operations at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. -------------------- 300 Refugees Reach Port SPLIT, Croatia, Aug. 13 (AP) -- Five buses carrying about 300 women and children from the besieged city of Sarajevo arrived in this port today under an agreement between Bosnia's warring factions to guarantee them safe passage. Struggling with the few bags and toys they brought along on the bus ride through western Bosnia, the refugees immediately boarded a ferry for an overnight ride to Rijeka, farther up the Croatian coast. From Rijeka, the women and children are to disperse to Denmark, Austria, Germany and other countries, adding to the largest flow of refugees in Europe since World War II. Enver Malagic, an official of the Sarajevo-based charity that sponsored the evacuation, said the buses had crossed 100 barricades on the 30-hour journey without incident. Serbian forces have besieged Sarajevo for months. The evacuees were the first to depart from the Bosnian capital since Aug. 1, when a bus carrying 50 children from an orphanage was sprayed with gunfire by Serbian snipers. Two children were killed.

1297-> COMPANY NEWS; GALOOB TOYS IS AWARDED $15 MILLION IN NINTENDO SUIT
Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. said it had been awarded a $15 million judgment against the Nintendo of America Inc. unit of Japan's Nintendo Company. The award is related to profits that Galoob, based in South San Francisco, lost between June 1990 and July 1991 after an infringement lawsuit Nintendo had brought prevented Galoob from selling its Game Genie Video Game Enhancer for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The judgment, awarded by Federal Judge Fren M. Smith, follows her ruling in July 1991 that Galoob was wrongfully enjoined from selling the video game. The ruling was upheld in May by the United States Court of Appeals. Nintendo plans to appeal the award.

1298-> Asian Nations Hope to Settle Dispute Over Islands Peacefully
Foreign ministers from across Southeast Asia, reflecting a growing fear of China's military intentions in the region, called today for a peaceful resolution of disputes over a chain of tiny islands in the South China Sea coveted by Beijing and thought to be rich in oil. Earlier this year China claimed sovereignty over the entire chain of the Spratly Islands, which it calls Nansha, and in June Beijing announced it had contracted with the Crestone Energy Corporation, of Denver, to explore for oil and gas in the area. The Chinese move angered and alarmed the other five nations that claim all or part of the Spratlys: Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Call for Restraint In a joint declaration issued here today at the annual meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the officials urged that the dispute be resolved "by peaceful means, without resort to force." The association's members are the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The message was clearly meant for China, which has been willing to battle over the Spratlys in the past: In 1988 its forces sank two Vietnamese warships in the Spratlys, killing more than 70 Vietnamese, and Chinese soldiers were stationed on several of the islands. The unspoken fear is that China, capitalizing on Washington's pullout from its military bases in the Philippines, will use the Spratlys to assert military supremacy in the region. An Added Sense of Urgency The Philippine President, Fidel V. Ramos, warned during the conference that a diplomatic failure could lead to "perilous developments." The Spratlys, tiny uninhabited islands and reefs spread across several hundred square miles of the South China Sea, are the subject of an old dispute. But China's recent moves have added a sense of urgency, and they threaten to undo the recent detente between China and its traditional adversary in Hanoi. Vietnam, which resumed normal relations with China last year after years of tension, has said that Beijing's oil-exploration plans in the Spratlys are threatening the stability of the region. Vietnam also claims sovereignty over all the islands and once awarded oil-exporation rights there.

1299-> COMPANY NEWS; Triton Energy Announces New Lineup of Top Officials
The Triton Energy Corporation, an independent oil and gas exploration company, announced today that two of its top officers had resigned. William Lee said he would step down as chief executive as of Dec. 31. David Gore, the company's president, said he would retire immediately. Thomas Finck, who formed the American Energy Group in 1991, was named to replace Mr. Lee. on Jan. 1. Mr. Finck will also replace Mr. Gore as president and chief operating officer. He was also named to the company's board. The executive shuffle comes weeks after the settlement of a lawsuit filed by a former executive against Triton, an independent oil company that became a Wall Street darling amid speculation about a huge oil discovery in Colombia. Industry analysts predicted the move would be welcomed on Wall Street, where Triton's reserves were lauded but its management was viewed with skepticism. But at first glance investors did not react positively today. Triton's stock declined 50 cents to close at $34.50. "Lee's been talking about doing this for a number of years," said Bruce Lazier, an analyst with San Jacinto Securities in Dallas. "He probably should have done it before now. Effectively, they're bringing in an outside guy, which will be good." Dismissal Is Disputed Although he controls less than 3 percent of the stock, Mr. Lee's wishes have rarely been questioned. In one of the few instances where they were, he dismissed Jimmy Janacek as controller in 1989. Mr. Janacek had objected to some of the company's disclosure statements to shareholders. He sued the company and was awarded $124 million in damages by a jury in May. The company settled the case for a fraction of the award, but has since been entangled in a squabble with its insurance company over who should pay for part of the settlement. Triton has agreed to pay Mr. Janacek $9.5 million, but the actual settlement could be as much as $25 million, analysts said. Mr. Lazier said the company had been unable to find a new insurer with Mr. Lee still at the helm. Also, Triton's board is facing several class-action lawsuits from shareholders that were filed after the Janacek verdict, and directors want the company adequately insured, he said. Two years ago, Triton was a troubled company. Its stock price collapsed, assets were put up for sale and the board adopted anti-takeover provisions to fend off an apparent threat from a leading shareholder. But word of the Cusiana discovery in Colombia, potentially the largest oil find in the Western Hemisphere, turned the stock around. "They've gone from the dark side of the moon to touching the edge of the sun in terms of people's perceptions," said Mick Midkiff, an independent analyst in Stamford, Conn. Triton holds 20 percent of the Cusiana venture, with British Petroleum holding 40 percent and Total S.A. of France having the other 40 percent.

1300-> TRAVEL ADVISORY; Arab Countries On Jewish Tour
The American Jewish Congress is offering a 21-day tour called a Jewish Heritage Expedition that will take travelers to places prominent in the life of Maimonides, the Hebrew scholar who was born in Cordoba, Spain, in 1135, and spent most of his life in Morocco, Israel and Egypt. The trip, starting Dec. 17, visits all four countries. It's the first time in many years, said an A.J.C. official, that one of the organization's tours has included two Arab countries, although Egypt has figured in its itineraries for several years. The tour begins in Granada and visits other Spanish cities, Marrakesh and Rabat and other places in Morocco, plus Cairo, Alexandria, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Participants will be accompanied by Jane Gerber, director of the Institute for Sephardic Studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The cost of $5,895 a person, in double occupancy, includes flights from New York to Malaga, Spain; Casablanca to Cairo; Cairo to Tel Aviv, and Tel Aviv back to New York. Also included: hotels, 41 meals, a touring program and entrance fees. Information: American Jewish Congress, 15 East 84th Street, New York, N.Y. 10028; (212) 879-4588 or (800) 221-4694.

1301-> Talking; Small Co-ops Sharing The Tasks Equally
SCATTERED around New York City are dozens of brownstones and other small buildings that since the late 1970's have been converted into co-op and condominiums. These buildings have special problems and one of the most difficult is getting resident-owners to carry their fair share of management and maintenance work. Because they do not have the income and resources to afford a full-time superintendent or professional management, the chores tend to fall directly on the residents' shoulders. And with only a handful of people available for such work, a lack of cooperation by even one or two can lead to burn-out on by those who have assumed a disproportionate share of the burden. "At the beginning you're usually delighted to help," recalled Eleanor St. Germain, who spent 10 years as treasurer of a co-op that comprised a cluster of four four-unit buildings in the West Village. "But if you're not careful, you begin to feel dumped on." How, then, to attract and hold onto the needed assistance and make sure those who assume the burden are not overwhelmed? Officers who have struggled through the problem insist that nothing will work for long unless it is made clear to incoming owners from the outset that they are expected to make an outlay of time and energy. "Whenever we interview a prospective shareholder we tell them right out that we're self-managed," said Steven Allen, vice president of a nine-unit co-op at 413 East 85th Street. The intention, he said, is to discourage those who don't want to bothered. "It sets the tone," he added, suggesting that it also creates a self-selection process that lessens the likelihood that the co-op will be stuck with too many bench-sitters and too few players. For the last eight years Marie Costello has been president of a co-op at 458-460 West 23d Street that combines 11 units in two adjacent buildings. The best way to insure an ongoing flow of willing labor, she maintained, is to find out at the admissions interview the areas of expertise of a newcomer that might be tapped -- and then tap in fast. Arrival time is the optimum moment, she insists. "They are still anxious to be accepted," she said. "They are gung-ho. Some also see it as a way to meet their neighbors. And most people really do want to become part of a community." Taking over a job right from the start, she noted, also integrates such service into the emerging rhythm of the shareholder's new life. If they are left alone for a year or more, she warned, it becomes tough to win even a minimal amount of cooperation. Carolyn Hahn, president of an eight-unit co-op on East 26th Street, further recommends assigning a specific task along with a time limit. "If I make my request too general, nothing ever gets done," she said. But what about shareholders who were there before the conversion and never intended to get involved? Or those who have either sublet or taken on work that precludes continued service? One solution is to require a cash payment in lieu of services and let the shareholder make the choice. Such a policy is currently in force at theeight-unit co-op at 149 West 85th Street. After holding the position of president for about six years and feeling exploited because he seemed to be doing "all of the work by myself," Harvey Owen decided a few years ago to look for ways to motivate his neighbors to do more. The compromise was that each shareholder was required to give at least 12 hours of work to the co-op each year or pay $40 for every hour that fell short of the minimum. The $40 payment was chosen because it was what the officers estimated they would probably have to pay to get the job done professionally. The jobs assigned were chosen to make it fairly easy to tell how much time each would take up. They included tasks like collecting bids for painting the common areas, looking after the street planter or shoveling snow. MR. OWEN, who resigned this year because he was moving, insists the system has worked well. "We've never had a problem getting people to pay if they didn't put in their time," he said. Those who handle the work, he said, feel less exploited. Moreover, he estimates that the policy adds about $1,000 a year to the co-op's coffers. Some small buildings also compromise by farming out certain tasks that can be better handled by a professional for a relatively modest sum. For example, collecting monthly maintenance fees and paying bills is a special service offered to small co-ops by Data Strat of 237 Park Avenue. Its minimum fee is $75 a month per building. In the smallest buildings -- say, those with only four or five units -- it may be necessary to rotate officers. Robert Snyder is vice president of a four-unit co-op in Brooklyn Heights where such a system has been in place for a decade. "We continually switch slots," he said. THE shareholders, he said, are assigned a role for the year, such as president, vice president, treasurer or secretary. They are given designated tasks at each meeting, with the jobs geared to their knowledge and availability. Intangible benefits are important, too, to help keep up morale. Ms. St. Germain insisted that "lots and lots of praise" remains one of the best ways to motivate volunteers. "It's those small messages left on your answering machine that make all the difference," she said. "Or the handwritten notes." However, she warns anyone who lives in a small co-op and works at home not to fall into the trap of being too available -- as she did. She said she eventually felt both burned-out and resentful. Networking with other small co-ops can also lighten the burden. The Council of New York Cooperatives has established the Small Building Support Group, whose members meet four times a year and exchange tips and ideas. For details, call the council at 496-7400. "I find it interesting to see how another co-op responded to a similar problem," said Edward Morgan, president of a 10-unit co-op in Murray Hill who regularly attends. There is also the 2-10 Unit Association, a group of some 1,500 co-op buildings established to fight for more equitable taxation for buildings with 10 or fewer units. It can be reached at 513-0981.

1302-> TRAVEL ADVISORY; A Settlement Is Proposed On Car Rentals
Two car-rental companies have agreed to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that they failed to disclose certain charges and restrictions when quoting prices to consumers. The F.T.C. says the cases -- against Dollar Rent-a-Car Systems and Value Rent-a-Car -- are the first in which it challenged what it calls the companies' failure to disclose mandatory charges on computerized reservations systems used by travel agents. The two rental agencies, the F.T.C. alleges, also avoided mentioning charges on toll-free telephone reservation lines and in advertising. Proposed agreements to settle the allegations require Dollar and Value to disclose all rental-related charges that cannot reasonably be avoided by drivers. The two companies were alleged to have failed to disclose various charges in one or more of the three mediums -- computer systems, phones and advertising. The F.T.C.'s New York regional office brought the cases. Value was accused of failing to disclose surcharges at some airports, a charge for drivers under 25 and restrictions on unlimited mileage.Dollar was accused of the same, plus failure to disclose a mandatory fuel charge and added charges for additional drivers. The proposed agreements, announced this month, are to appear in the Federal Register and will be subject to public comment for 60 days, after which the commission will decide whether to make them final. A copy of the F.T.C.'s "Car Rental Guide" for consumers is available free by writing to the Public Reference Branch, Room 130, Federal Trade Commission, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.

1303-> The Mall That Ate Minnesota
Victor Gruen has been all but lost to history, his name ridiculed when it is remembered. As the designer of Southdale, the world's first fully enclosed shopping mall, Mr. Gruen languishes in the rogues' gallery reserved for those pioneers of plastic consumerism who gave America everything from aerosol cheese to Astroturf. Yet, Mr. Gruen was thinking more of civics than shopping when he opened Southdale in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina in 1956. To Mr. Gruen, the mall was to have been America's new Main Street, a town common to bring together citizens increasingly displaced from each other by the burgeoning postwar sprawl of freeways and suburbs. This new town square was to have churches and hospitals. One day, he had hoped, the mall would serve as an all-purpose, cross-cultural destination for the new global village. He was wrong. And today, civic pride being what it is, visitors to the Twin Cities are not taken to see Victor Gruen's still-standing landmark, but to the coffeehouse where Bobby Zimmerman alchemized into Bob Dylan, the purple house where Prince once pranced and the boardinghouse where F. Scott Fitzgerald pounded out "This Side of Paradise." Then, this month, the Twin Cities were struck with Victor Gruen's Revenge. "Now," said Emily Goldberg, a local film maker, "people visiting me get off the plane and demand to go right to the megamall. The megamall ? This is what we're going to be remembered for?" Perhaps. For this $650 million fully enclosed shopping center is not only the most grandiose mall in American history. Nor is the complex, known officially as the Mall of America, just a pumped-up Paramus-on-the-Prairie, one more cookie-cutter amalgam of stores, frozen-yogurt stands and packs of free-range adolescents in Guess jeans. It is also a 78-acre full-sensory smorgasbord of consumerism whose indoor vistas, its builders hope, will redeem Mr. Gruen's misbegotten dream. As such, its consortium of developers projects that the megamall, as it is known colloquially, will draw more customers a year by 1996 than Walt Disney World or the Grand Canyon. Perhaps. Many industry analysts, however, question the sanity of launching a monster mall in the middle of a recession, at a time when studies suggest that Americans would rather do almost anything with their leisure time other than shop. According to surveys conducted by Chicago's M.A.S. Marketing, the time spent monthly in malls by the average shopper dropped from 12 hours in 1980 to four hours in 1990. And sales per square foot of retail space in malls nationwide have dropped 17 percent since the peak year of 1978, according to studies by Management Horizons of Chicago. STILL, as they say in Minnesota, the bait seems fresh. Inside the mall, its 4.2 million square feet have been diced into almost 400 specialty stores anchored by huge renditions of rare-to-the-Midwest delicacies like Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and Macy's. Sears, Roebuck fills the last of the corner anchors of the megamall, which, when everything is counted, takes up the equivalent of 88 football fields' worth of space on four floors. Only 41 of those fields are used for retailing; still, it takes almost an hour to briskly cruise the mall, with no timeouts for shopping. At first sight, the megamall's sheer footage is so intimidating that some local grumps now refer to the shopping center as "megadeath." Yet, vast sums have been spent here to reduce the number of consumers stricken with shopping-mall anomie. To beat back claustrophobia, the mall's innards have been remade wherever possible to make shoppers feel as if they were outside. The most notable of these efforts is the mall's seven-acre Camp Snoopy. It sits in a central courtyard and rises from ground level to the fourth floor, stocked with 400 trees, 30,000 plants, a mountain and a four-story waterfall. Upstairs, around the height of the highest peak on Camp Snoopy's roller coaster, are dozens of restaurants, both fast and fancy, as well as an assortment of nightclubs and a 14-screen movie house. When visitors depart, they exit what may be the world's largest parking structure, containing 13,000 free spaces within 300 feet of the mall. Can it possibly work? "They'll come," said Michael Dorsey, a mall spokesman. "They're coming." In the years since the first shopping mall, it became clear that Mr. Gruen's new Main Street was not that far removed from the old one in the days of Sinclair Lewis. In Lewis's novel "Main Street," the heroine finds that on her town's central drag: "It was not only the uninspiring, unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her. It was the planlessness, the flimsy temporariness of the buildings." Today, this description of downtown Gopher Prairie sounds frighteningly like the blueprint for the malls that America grew up on, where drive-in shoppers browsed in charmless boxes to the accompaniment of Muzak. Still, mall business remained solid through the 70's. The industry peaked in 1978, when sales per square foot of retail space averaged $197 a year, according to Management Horizons. Then came the downturn, as consumers, experts said, turned off to the shopping monoliths that in time seemed as soulless and over-baroque as a Las Vegas casino. Today, that yield is $163 a square foot. The fall cannot be attributed solely to the recession. Over the last 10 years, shopping habits have changed. The days of aimless browsing through malls may have passed, as huge department stores are increasingly replaced by one-stop Wal-Mart-like discount chains and mini strip malls. People are increasingly shopping by television and catalogue but, studies show, rarely for pleasure. And that, said the developers, is where they come in. Looking back to the long-lost vision of Mr. Gruen, they have tried to create a space that can make the megamall a destination, an idealized community, fun. T HE easy part of that job is simple mall science, knowing, for example, to allow 4.5 parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of leasable area inside. The hard part is selling the fantasy. That fantasy is best expressed in the mall's theme song, written by Robin Batteau, New York's famed "Tarzan of the Jingle," whose resume includes lines like Chevrolet's "The heartbeat of America" and Coca-Cola's "Can't beat the feeling." For the mall, he came up with a wickedly memorable hook line played under the words: "There's a place for fun in your life, the Mall of America. You've got to see it to believe it. Who told you you can't have it all?" To make that magic, the developers had to configure the mall's foreboding caverns to seem somehow inviting. So the complex was chopped into four winding corridors, each with a different theme. Matching their mood to a corridor, shoppers can start, say, in the gazebo- and wooden trellis-lined North Garden, the hallway billed as Main Street U.S.A. The mix is critical. Because the megamall needs to appeal to the largest cross section of the population, its planners have planted the place with bonbons for every demographic. For each Abercrombie & Fitch, there seems to be a counterbalancing Filene's Basement. Even shopping music has been democratized. Enlisting 3M, Muzak's arch-competitor, the mall has opted away from elevator music in favor of less somnolent stylings. Light FM, a radio service heavily inflected with Billy Joel and James Taylor, is piped into the mall's common areas, while current rock hits are heard in stores catering to 12- to 25-year-olds. More than a million people huffed through the mall in the first week after Ray Charles was paid $50,000 to sing "America" during a grand-opening gala on Aug. 10. Other stars also came out. Larry Gatlin, who with his singing brothers owns a country-music show bar in the mall, was so moved by the spectacle that he could not stop repeating his mantra for business success: "Let's move some meatloaf!" he said to all who would listen. Then there was pizza-pushing Wolfgang Puck, who went to the Mall of America to open his first restaurant outside California. The chef was chastised by an unimpressed woman from suburban Minneapolis who liked the food but was upset that Mr. Puck was eating as he served. "I don't care who he is," she said. "It's gross !" As the bodies ebbed, flowed and banged up against each other during opening week, shopping proved a near-hallucinatory experience. From the epicenter near Camp Snoopy, it felt like an ecstatic mall rave, the staccato ka-ching of thousands of cash registers serving as the high-frequency techno-beat for hundreds of thousands of Midwest shoppers. The mood over the megamall was not always so jovial. Ever since plans were first announced in 1985, developers have had to bull past vehement local naysayers. To bolster their case, the builders utilized an inspirational strategy of if-we-build-it-they-will-come. But the mall's first development script appeared to have been taken not from "Field of Dreams" but "The Music Man," with Nader Ghermezian, an Iranian rug merchant turned mall developer, playing Prof. Harold Hill, the silvery-tongued out-of-towner with a bright idea for civic improvement. "You will have all the shoppers from New York, Rome, Los Angeles and Paris coming here," Mr. Ghermezian told Minnesota doubters at a 1986 news conference. "I bring you the moon and you don't want it?" Maybe, said Minneapolis civic leaders as they pondered the models, then hauled up to Canada to see what Mr. Ghermezian and his three brothers, doing business as the Triple Five Corporation, had already done. What they found was the $1.1 billion West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, with 5.2 million square feet, still the world's biggest. Nader Ghermezian called his Canadian creation, which opened in 1981, "the Eighth Wonder of the World" -- and Minnesota decided it wanted the ninth. Land was acquired in 1985 10 miles from Minneapolis in suburban Bloomington, on a site formerly occupied by Metropolitan Stadium, the demolished, much-beloved home of the Minnesota Twins. The Ghermezians originally planned on a mall even bigger than Canada's, but faced with some opposition and with having to refinance the project, they lured the Indianapolis-based mall kings Melvin and Herbert Simon to join the project in 1987, and the plans were scaled back. On Aug. 11, the doors finally opened. And they came, in hordes nearing 150,000, to see what the developers said was the largest number of retailers ever to open on one day in one place. The Simon brothers, who own shares in the mall with the Ghermezians and several other silent partners, predict that by 1996 the Mall of America will draw 40 million customers a year, a third of them from more than 150 miles away. BUT the doubters remain unmoved. For in the years since Mr. Ghermezian first pulled into Minneapolis, American shopping habits have changed. "I hate to say this, but I think it is doomed to fail," said Therese Byrne, a Salomon Brothers real estate analyst. "I think everyone is shocked that the mall's backers actually went through with this. But I guess you can't back off when you're half-pregnant." What the developers hope they are on to is the good-willed frenzy that seemed to vibrate through the floors of the megamall during its opening week. Those mobs -- as seen from above in a Camp Snoopy roller-coaster car on a weekday afternoon -- seemed as happy, brisk and surreally well choreographed as the June Taylor dancers. Down below, however, is a suggestion that the mall may be cursed by the ghost of the major-league ball park that used to sit there. Metropolitan Stadium looms in the Midwest imagination the way Ebbets Field is recalled in Brooklyn, and Camp Snoopy sits directly above where home plate used to be. "Metropolitan Stadium was one of the most pastoral ball parks ever," said Art Simon, a Minnesota native who teaches film theory at New York University and who not related to the Simons. "To pave that paradise is like building on an Indian burial ground: you tempt the gods." But mall spokesmen seem unworried by the threat of old ball-park voodoo. To other doomsayers, the Mall of America need only point to its opening figures. In the first week of business, during those scarce gorgeous Minnesota summer days, more than a million people, it is estimated, went inside the mall, and 13,000 pounds of chicken were consumed at Camp Snoopy. At BareBones, a medical-supply store, 20,000 purchases were made, 432 screaming fly swatters were sold, and the line of people waiting to go inside often numbered 200. Only three cars were stolen from the parking area, and nobody died anywhere in the megamall. And what if it all goes bust, if fancy stores go vacant and little stores unbrowsed? Then, experts in shopping-mall sociology say, the mix of tenants will get even wilder. A church, a car dealership, a casino or a hospital might move in, perhaps finally validating in failure Victor Gruen's prophesy of the shopping mall as America's new Main Street. But right now there will be no talk of that at America's most grandiose shopping center. "The people will come," said Mr. Dorsey, the mall spokesman, repeating his own mantra: "They're coming."

1304-> Review/Film -- Gas Food Lodging; Rueful Women, Rootless Men In a Dreary Western Town
THE Film Forum has brought more excitement to moviegoing in the past two weeks than Hollywood has delivered all summer. The theater's second fine sleeper in a row, after Carl Franklin's "One False Move," is Allison Anders's debut feature "Gas Food Lodging," a look at three vibrant, restless women in a dusty Western town. Imagine "The Last Picture Show" shot in color and shaped by a rueful feminine perspective, in a place where women are hopelessly anchored while the men drift through like tumbleweed. The becalmed town of Laramie, N.M., is the setting in which Nora (Brooke Adams), a hard-working waitress with a knowing, generous grin, has tried to bring up her two unruly daughters. The older one, Trudi (Ione Skye), has turned defiantly trampy by the time the film begins, trying hard to hurt her mother while inflicting even greater pain upon herself. The younger and more hopeful girl, Shade (Fairuza Balk), loses herself in campy Mexican movie romances that tell her something about noble, long-suffering women in a cruel world. The father in this family is long gone, and the mother and daughters spend too much time in indirect efforts to replace him. Trudi, an angry bombshell played with enormous delicacy and openness by Ms. Skye, fails miserably at drowning her sorrows with the town's loutish teen-age boys. Nora has had her own share of dead-end encounters, enough to prompt one of her daughters to shout "I think you just hate men," though that is clearly not the whole story. Shade, thinking that finding a mate for her mother may offer some sort of family panacea, actually arranges a blind date (in an extremely funny dinner scene staged in the family's cramped mobile home) between Nora and a man with whom she has already had a long, deflating affair. Each of the three principals has learned the hard way that Laramie is a small town. Although the self-sufficiency of its heroines is always apparent, "Gas Food Lodging" pivots upon the arrival of various male strangers on this desolate scene. Although Ms. Anders (whose screenplay is based on a novel by Richard Peck) has to rely twice on introducing characters when one finds another crying, the meetings are felicitous and the tears very easy to understand. But "Gas Food Lodging" takes a wry, upbeat view of its principals, despite the enormous obstacles that face them and despite the absurdity of their plight. The fact that Shade is sweet on a boy who wishes she were more like Olivia Newton-John, or that Nora can stagger out of her trailer at dawn and bump into a possible Mr. Right, only heightens these women's justly whimsical view of the world. Ms. Anders keeps her film expertly balanced between quiet despair and a sense of the miraculous, as manifested by the big, open skies and glorious sunrises and sunsets (with cinematography by Dean Lent) that punctuate the story. When Trudi experiences a transforming romance with a sincere English geologist (Robert Knepper) who is passing through town, the consummation of the affair is staged unforgettably in a cave shimmering with eerie blue light. Shade's burgeoning friendship with a shy Mexican boy (Jacob Vargas) takes an unexpected turn when his mother, who is deaf, motions for the couple to join her in an impromptu modern dance. At that particular moment the film overworks its sense of wonder, but most of the time Ms. Anders's instincts are uncannily right. "Gas Food Lodging" is a big film in a small setting, a keenly observed character study of women who don't know their own strength. The film shows how they find that strength and heal old wounds, discovering great reserves of grace and hope in the process. There is nothing traditionally uplifting here, nor any cause for getting out one's handkerchief (at least until the story's closing moments); Ms. Anders directs in a spare, laconic style that keeps the material from degenerating into soap opera. But there are subtly etched characters, effortlessly fine performances, and a moving story that is not easily forgotten. Also in "Gas Food Lodging," playing a small but crucial role, is James Brolin, who perfectly embodies the kinds of hopes and disappointments this story is all about. Donovan Leitch, Ms. Skye's brother, appears as one of the landmarks in Shade's life, a window dresser with a taste for peculiar pop artifacts. A pair of psychedelic platform shoes that turn up prominently in a couple of scenes could easily have belonged to Mr. Leitch's namesake and father. "Gas Food Lodging" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, mild profanity and sexual situations. Gas Food Lodging Written and directed by Allison Anders, based on the novel "Don't Look and It Won't Hurt," by Richard Peck; director of photography, Dean Lent; edited by Tracy S. Granger; produced by Daniel Hassid, Seth M. Willenson and William Ewart; released by IRS Releasing Corporation. At Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, SoHo. Running time: 102 minutes.

1305-> BASEBALL; Going 2 Out of 3 Isn't Bad (Unless You're a Yankee)
There were three games, two victories and a certain sense of rejuvenation to the Yankees, but it was still not enough to satisfy Manager Buck Showalter. He wanted a sweep. Instead, on a bright and warm afternoon, the Yankees wasted a four-run lead and lost to the Oakland Athletics, 8-5, today, leaving afterward for Seattle and the final stage of their three-city trip. They may have gained a new feeling about themselves here, but by the end of the day, the Yankees were left empty. They had 1-0 and 5-1 complete-game victories by Shawn Hillegas and Melido Perez over the A's behind them, and they had a 4-0 lead in the second inning today. Then, it was gone. Hitting a Sour Note It would have been easy to express some satisfaction, but their rookie manager couldn't. "I'd like to say yes," Showalter said, "but not really. We came here hoping to win all three. I don't feel like we're leaving on a positive note." The Yankees lost their lead in the fifth inning, tied the game in the sixth and then let it slip away again in the eighth when Rickey Henderson's line drive escaped the reach of a diving Danny Tartabull in right field for a run-scoring triple. Carney Lansford followed with a home run. Asked later if he had any chance to catch the ball, Tartabull smiled and said, "Maybe if I had Carl Lewis's legs." But he tried. "Every ball that's hit out there, you should have it in your mind that you're going to get it," Tartabull said. "You go full tilt and try to catch it. I dove for it, trying to knock it down." Getting Things Started The Yankees had taken their lead off starter Bob Welch, whose walk to Tartabull in the second got the Yankees started. A single by the struggling Charlie Hayes later brought in Tartabull from second, and Matt Nokes added a three-run homer. "Even when we were up, 4-0, we knew we'd have a battle," Showalter said. "That's why they're a successful team. They hung around, tied the game and got the big hit from Rickey." Scott Sanderson, without a victory in his last three starts, wavered through the third, walking one batter, hitting another and surrendering a two-run single to designated hitter Harold Baines, the first unearned run in 27 innings allowed by the Yankees. Sanderson got Terry Steinbach to hit a grounder to first that should have been a double play to end the inning, but Don Mattingly had to wait for shortstop Andy Stankiewicz to cover the bag, and by the time the throw came back, Steinbach was safe and Mark McGwire had scored, cutting the Yankees' lead to 4-3. In the fifth, Jose Canseco hit a one-out double and came home on a single to right by Baines. Tartabull had virtually no chance to get Canseco, but he threw home anyway, allowing Baines to take second. Baines then scored on a double by Steinbach that hit the third-base bag and rolled into left. Fundamental, My Dear Tartabull Showalter called Tartabull's throw one of several "fundamental mistakes through aggression." Tartabull said: "I'm going after it. I've got to try and get him." The Yankees tied the game in the sixth on alert base-running by Roberto Kelly, who led off with a double, took third on a grounder to the right side and dashed for home after tagging up on a pop fly to shallow center by Hayes that was caught by the backpedaling second baseman Mike Bordick, who should have been called off by the incoming center fielder Willie Wilson. The A's had the infield pulled in on the play, making it more difficult for Bordick to get to the ball. But the tie only remained until the eighth when Oakland scored the deciding runs off John Habyan (3-4). Sanderson couldn't find fault with himself over his inability to hold the lead. "Some things happened that made it kind of odd," he said. "Hits I gave up were either in front of outfielders or to the side of infielders. That's going to happen." INSIDE PITCH The Yankees' managing general partner, JOE MOLLOY, said he was likely to complete a contract extension for Manager BUCK SHOWALTER while he is in town. He wouldn't comment specifically on it, but when asked if he intended to talk with Showalter, who has been rumored as a potential candidate with the expansion Florida Marlins, about Showalter's future with the Yankees, Molloy said, "Yes." . . . DENNIS ECKERSLEY pitched the ninth for Oakland, striking out the three batters he faced and collecting his 31st save of the season in 31 opportunities.

1306-> COMPANY NEWS; MCDONNELL AGREES TO SELL A CHECK-VERIFICATION UNIT
The First Financial Management Corporation agreed to buy Telecheck Services Inc., a check-verification company, from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the St. Louis aerospace company. Atlanta-based First Financial, which offers data-processing and credit-information services, also bought Telecheck's main franchisee, the Payment Services Company-U.S., Houston. In the deal, First Financial will pay $116 million cash plus $14 million of stock; it also will assume and retire $29 million of debt at Payment Services. Officials at First Financial Management and McDonnell Douglas declined to specify how much the aerospace company would receive from the purchase. McDonnell acquired Telecheck in 1984 when it purchased Tymshare; Telecheck accounted for $58.5 million of McDonnell Douglas's $18.4 billion in 1991 revenue.

1307-> An Investigator Is Held in Plot To Get a Bribe
A staff member of an agency that provides background information about defendants was charged yesterday with posing as a police officer who could fix cases and receiving $15,000 in bribes from a defendant's family. The authorities said the man, Rafael Lanzot, was arrested shortly after he took $5,000 of the payoff in marked money in his office in Queens Criminal Court. Mr. Lanzot was hired two years ago by the private New York Criminal Justice Agency even though, law-enforcement officials said, he had served more than 12 years in prison for attempting to murder two New York City fire marshals whom he severely wounded in a 1975 shootout. The Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown, asserted that the agency hired Mr. Lanzot without a thorough background check. The agency is a nonprofit group that works under contract to the city to provide background information on newly arrested defendants. The information is used to help Criminal Court judges throughout the city determine at arraignments whether to set bail for defendants, hold them pending further court action, or release them without bail. Yesterday, Mr. Lanzot stood as a defendant himself in the same courtroom where the background material he had prepared on others had been used, just 15 feet from the office where he is accused of taking the bribe on Tuesday. At the arraignment, Mr. Lanzot's lawyer declared his client had been framed by the family of a drug defendant. Mr. Lanzot, a 42-year-old Bronx resident, was ordered held in $250,000 bail by Judge Martin Schulman, pending a hearing on Monday. The executive director of the Criminal Justice Agency, Jerome E. McElroy, acknowledged that the 15-year-old agency had never fingerprinted prospective employees or checked for criminal histories. He said this policy would now be reviewed.

1308-> Officer Took Drug Payoffs, U.S. Charges
Michael Dowd, the former New York City police officer whose arrest on cocaine trafficking charges spurred four separate investigations of corruption in the New York City Police Department, was arrested yesterday on Federal charges that he received huge weekly cash payments from drug gangs over a three-year period. In exchange, prosecutors said, he provided the gangs with protection against police raids as well as with stashes of guns and police badges. Mr. Dowd was arrested in May by the Suffolk County police along with four other active officers and one retired officer on charges that they bought and sold cocaine, sometimes through their beats in Brooklyn. Mr. Dowd was arrested again yesterday at his home on Long Island following an investigation by United States Attorney Otto G. Obermaier. He had been out on bail and was dismissed from the department earlier this month. Integral Part of Drug World Although there had previously been suspicions and allegations that Mr. Dowd might be cooperating with drug gangs, his arrest yesterday represents the first time he was charged with actually assisting and protecting drug dealers. While Mr. Dowd and the five other officers had been considered rogue officers operating almost as private entrepreneurs, the new charges paint a broader picture of an officer who was an integral part of the drug world. Prosecutors also said informants had told them that other officers had also been receiving payoffs. With the Police Department already under fire for its failure to detect and root out Mr. Dowd, who has been labeled by law enforcement officials as the mastermind among the arrested officers, the new charges are likely to raise yet more questions about the department's own internal safeguards against corruption. It also raises questions about why Federal authorities did not decide to prosecute Mr. Dowd sooner. While their investigation began in earnest following Mr. Dowd's arrest, much of the evidence against him was learned by the United States Attorney's office as far back as 1988, when Mr. Dowd was an officer at the 75th Precinct in the East New York section of Brooklyn. He was later transferred to the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint, where prosecutors said he embarked on another drug scheme. The Dowd case has come to symbolize the new focus on police corruption. In addition to the Federal investigation, Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed a special commission to investigate corruption, the first panel of its kind in New York City in 20 years. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes is investigating the case, and Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, who has been conducting his own inquiry, has ordered changes in tactics used by the department's Internal Affairs Division. U.S. Names a Middleman Federal prosecutors said that they also arrested another man yesterday, Borrent Perez, whom they labeled as a middleman in the payment of money to Mr. Dowd. Mr. Perez was not named or implicated in the previous charges against Mr. Dowd. The prosecutors said that much of the evidence against Mr. Dowd in the Federal case was learned through members of a Dominican drug gang known as the Company, who were arrested in March 1991, in addition to information learned through members of other drug gangs who said they did business with Mr. Dowd. One of the gang members told investigators that Mr. Dowd was paid between $5,000 and $10,000 in an envelope that he picked up from Mr. Perez at Auto Sound City, an automobile stereo store on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The informant told investigators that Mr. Dowd provided advance warning on drug raids. Shown a picture of Mr. Dowd in 1991, long before the arrest of Mr. Dowd, the informant identified him as "Michael," the officer whom he believed was getting money from Mr. Perez. Prosecutors said the informant was also able to identify Mr. Dowd's partner at the time, whom he said often accompanied Mr. Dowd to the stereo store. Another member of the Company said that Mr. Dowd provided guns and badges and police radios to the gang. He also identified a photograph of Mr. Dowd in 1991 and said he was known as "Mike the cop." Prosecutors said that members of another major gang, whose head, Adam Diaz, has been convicted for drug conspiracy, told them that Mr. Dowd also worked with Mr. Diaz's gang. One informant told investigators that Mr. Dowd "regularly received several thousand dollars" at a bodega run by Mr. Diaz at 2788 Atlantic Avenue in East New York, where other officers from the 75th Precinct also received payoffs. And, prosecutors said, another member of Mr. Diaz's gang paid Mr. Dowd $4,000 weekly from the bodega. This gang member told investigators Mr. Dowd would signal an associate of Mr. Diaz's with a beeper that Federal agents were in the area and that they should stop dealing drugs for the moment. At some point, prosecutors said, Mr. Dowd was supplied with an ounce of cocaine a week by Mr. Diaz. Asked why Mr. Dowd was not arrested earlier on Federal charges and why Mr. Dowd's partner was not also arrested, assistant United States Attorney David B. Fein said that he was not permitted to comment. Calls to Mr. Obermaier were not returned. Mr. Dowd's attorney, Marvin Hirsch, said that given recent newspaper articles about Mr. Dowd's possible involvement with drug gangs, he was "not shocked" by the new charges. But he said he was already thinking about a classic defense, designed to attack the credibility of the witnesses. "I don't know who it is who is testifying againt him," Mr. Hirsch said. "We could have a couple of guys who are in jail, doing 800 years to life, that are looking to better their situation. I'm curious to see how the Government intends to corroborate the statements of these kinds of people."

1309-> Reviews/Film; An Indiscretion Among the French Bourgeoisie
In its first half-hour, "En Toute Innocence" ("In All Innocence") promises to be one of those delicious bittersweet comedies about extramarital hanky-panky among the bourgeoisie for which the French have long been celebrated. But halfway along, the film, which was directed by Alain Jessua and stars Michel Serrault and Nathalie Baye, begins to toy uncomfortably with the idea of becoming a thriller. In the last half-hour, it finally makes the leap from sophisticated comedy into Alfred Hitchcock-style suspense, and then fizzles out in a flurry of plot developments that are as preposterous as they are hastily introduced. "En Toute Innocence," which opens today at Cinema Village, is set mostly at a sumptuous estate near Saint-Emilion, looks at the prosperous Duchesne family, whose members run a successful architectural firm. All is well until Paul (Mr. Serrault), the firm's founder and paterfamilias, accidentally catches his daughter-in-law, Catherine (Miss Baye), in flagrante delicto with Didier (Bernard Fresson), the firm's brilliant young assistant. Paul drives off in a fury and minutes later has a nearly fatal accident that leaves him in a wheelchair and temporarily unable to speak. While recovering at home, Paul is lovingly attended by his son, Thomas (Francois Dunoyer), and his housekeeper, Clemence (Suzanne Flon), while being warily observed by Catherine. When Catherine makes a reconciliatory overture, he rebuffs her angrily, and she declares war. Their relationship becomes an increasingly sinister cat-and-mouse game after Paul is nearly drowned when his motorized wheelchair mysteriously accelerates and plunges him into a river. After he becomes violently ill from some tainted food Catherine has served, Paul becomes convinced that she is trying to kill him. One of his weapons is silence. Even after regaining his speech, he feigns muteness to everyone except his housekeeper. With its sensuous atmosphere of sunlight and flowers, and its smart, attractive characters dining luxuriously on the lawn of the estate, "En Toute Innocence" seduces the audience into thinking it is a lot more intelligent than the film turns out be. Enhancing this aura of smartness is the Duchesnes' mania for gadgets. They are constantly toying with all things mechanical, from lawn sprinklers to lighting fixtures, and the firm's latest triumph is a model for a revolving solar-heated mansion. Paul is such an avid mountain climber that while still unable to walk, he practices scaling heights with a rig that lifts and lowers him from his wheelchair. As dramatized by Mr. Serrault and Miss Baye, Paul and Catherine's psychological duel is a sustained and delightful tease. Has the sulky, glaring Paul succumbed to a case of post-traumatic paranoia? Or are his suspicions justified? The mercurial Catherine is the sort of juicy role that Jeanne Moreau might have played in the 1960's, and Miss Baye carries it off with relish and subtlety. One minute, she seems the smiling embodiment of familial solicitude; the next, she is eyeing Paul with a cold, hawkish scrutiny that chills the blood. Even though the film sees the world through Paul's eyes, "En Toute Innocence" belongs entirely to Miss Baye. En Toute Innocence Directed by Alain Jessua; written (in French with English subtitles) by D. Roulet, L. Beraud and A. Jessua; director of photography, Jean Rabier; edited by Helene Plemiannikov; music by Michel Portal; produced by Mr. Jessua; released by Cine Qua Non.

1311-> Andersen Manuscripts Stolen From Museum
"The Little Mermaid," "The Emperor's New Clothes" and two other original manuscripts by Hans Christian Andersen were stolen from a Danish museum, officials said today. "They are priceless, unique and in principle irreplaceable," said Niels Oxenvad, the manager of the Andersen Museum in Odense, which housed the manuscripts. "It's a national tragedy." Some of Andersen's drawings and pages from two of his travel journals were also taken, officials said. The stolen manuscripts were among the most famous of Andersen's 160 fairy tales and poems. Mr. Oxenvad estimated the value of the stolen items at $702,000. The overnight burglary was discovered by cleaners this morning, the police said. Poul-Erik Bentsen, the deputy police commissioner in Odense, said at least two burglars climbed up a roof and jumped into the yard of the late-18th-century house, where Andersen is said to have been born. They drilled holes in a wooden door and removed a panel without setting off the alarms, the police added. The museum offered a $8,500 reward for information on the stolen papers.

1312-> Thomas B. Nolan Is Dead at 91; A Shaper of U.S. Geologic Survey
Thomas B. Nolan, who is credited with shaping the modern missions of the United States Geologic Survey in his 68-year career at the Federal agency, died on Sunday at the George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 91 years old and lived in Washington. He died of a pulmonary embolism, the agency said yesterday. Dr. Nolan started working at the Geologic Survey in 1924 as a junior geologist studying the Mother Lode gold region in California. He served as the agency's assistant director from 1944 to 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower promoted him to director. As director, he led such ambitious and sophisticated projects as evaluating the effects of underground nuclear tests and the photographic mapping of the moon. He stepped down from that post in 1965 but continued doing research for the survey until his death. Dr. Nolan established programs to train astronauts in geology, study public health dangers from naturally occurring chemicals and research earthquakes and volcanoes. He also created a network to collect data on water resources and the evaluation of offshore mineral deposits and mineral resources in wilderness areas. Mountains, minerals and fossils were named for Dr. Nolan. His honors included a prize from the International Geologic Congress, a medal from Columbia University, a commendation from President Ronald Reagan and awards from Princeton University, the Tokyo Geographical Society and Department of the Interior. Dr. Nolan was born in Greenfield, Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in metallurgy at Yale University in 1921 and a doctorate in geology there in 1924. His wife, the former Mabelle Orleman, died in 1983. He is survived by his son, Thomas Jr., of Escondido, Calif., and two grandsons.

1313-> COMPANY NEWS; IN SALES RACE, FORD'S TAURUS GAINS ON HONDA'S ACCORD
The Honda Motor Company's Accord is still the best-selling car in the United States so far this year, but the Ford Motor Company's Taurus is looming in its rear-view mirror, according to the trade magazine Ward's Automotive Reports. For 1992's first half, Honda sold 191,682 Accords in the United States market, versus 181,189 Taurus sales, a margin of 10,493 units. This time last year, Accord was 57,480 cars ahead of Taurus, and Taurus seemed unlikely to unseat Accord as America's best seller. But Ford gave the Taurus a modest face lift this year, while Accord has not received a fresh look since 1990 and is not scheduled for restyling until 1994. Ford is also offering a $1,000 cash rebate on the Taurus, and industry experts say Ford has benefited from "Buy American" sentiment.

The Adding Machine Joseph Papp Public Theater 425 Lafayette Street Greenwich Village Today Written by Elmer Rice; directed by Michael Schwabe; original music composition by Evan Chen; technical direction and stage management by James Rossow; design and construction by Mr. Basgall, Kevin Byrne, Pam Clouse, Richard Goodman, John Gegenhuber, Pat O'Hara, Cynthia Orthal, Timm Reinhard, Mr. Rossow, Mr. Schwabe and Jayson Stahl. A Jim Henson Foundation presentation of Puppetry at the Public: The International Festival of Puppet Theater, executive producer, Cheryl Henson; producing director, Leslee Asch; associate producers, Bill Yates and Anne Dennin. WITH: Tracey Gilbert, Dave Herzog, Mr. Basgall and Mr. Schwabe. When "The Adding Machine" was first produced in 1923, it was considered a classic of expressionist theater. Anyone expecting this Elmer Rice play to show its age is due for a jolt. In the expert hands of the Hystopolis Puppet Theater, "The Adding Machine" is a bold and timely reflection on the perils of an industrialized society. This Chicago-based company has the directness of the Steppenwolf Theater, rushing into Rice as if the play had been newly conceived. At the same time, there is no attempt to update the author's observations. Hewing to the text, Michael Schwabe (as director) and his collaborative team pit the play's hero, Mr. Zero, against the adding machine and not against a computer. But the troupe's scenic and sound effects are strikingly modern, with the puppets themselves influenced by artists like Picasso and Henry Moore. Draped in black, the puppeteers (who include Mr. Schwabe) manipulate the figures Bunraku-style while also dubbing their voices. As actors, the puppeteers consistently enliven the action. In the opening scene, Mr. Zero is seen in bed, trying to rest after a hard day of bookkeeping, as his shrewish, thickly corseted wife delivers a nonstop monologue verging on a tirade. Her mouth becomes disembodied and flies across the room, enlarging and then multiplying until the husband is besieged by a chorus of viragos. Mr. Zero, whose head looks like a boxing glove in repose, exudes helplessness, deepened in the subsequent scene with his employer. After 25 years of dutiful service, Mr. Zero is made redundant. Rising in outrage, he slays his boss, spinning the play on its tragic trajectory. When the protagonist goes on trial, society joins him in the dock, as the author explores the reasons for Mr. Zero's rebellion. Approaching this story with full satiric intention, Hystopolis treats it as a mordant cartoon, more "Maus" than "Roger Rabbit." Later, as Mr. Zero rises from his grave and enters an afterlife, "The Adding Machine" shifts into fantasy, with an ethereal dance between the hero and his office mate, Daisy, the opposite of his battle-ax wife. These and other puppets are artfully conceived and operated, especially so in the case of Shrdlu, the companion on Mr. Zero's death journey to the Elysian Fields. This flying broomstick of a creature, with spindly parsnip fingers, is a droll devil. Along the way there are incidental amusements, including a heaven-based boss who could be a scolding cousin to Jonathan Winters. In the second act, there is a brief slackening of tension, more the fault of Mr. Rice than Hystopolis. But it does not seriously detract from a creative partnership between a socially conscious playwright of the past and an innovative contemporary ensemble. Underground Joseph Papp Public Theater 425 Lafayette Street Greenwich Village Through Sunday Conceived, designed and directed by Theodora Skipitares; score composed by Robert Previte; scenes written by Andrea Balis, Julie Mars, Garry Rich, Ms. Skipitares and Sebastian Stuart, with excerpts from Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man"; dramaturge, Ms. Balis; lighting by Liz Lee; technical director, Michael Draper; puppets by Ms. Skipitares, Holly Laws and Daniel Carello; musician, Jerome Harris; voices on tape by Mr. Stuart, Ms. Wittmer, Anna Trainer and Kevin O'Connor; photographer, Valerie Osterwalder. A Jim Henson Foundation presentation of Puppetry at the Public: The International Festival of Puppet Theater, executive producer, Cheryl Henson; producing director, Leslee Asch; associate producers, Bill Yates and Anne Dennin. WITH: Preston Foerder, Cora Hook, Sara Provost and Ms. Skipitares and Tom Costello and Mary Lou Wittmer as narrators. Last season in "The Radiant City," Theodora Skipitares explored the expansive world of highways, parks and skyscrapers established under the aegis of Robert Moses. With her new puppet play, "Underground," she turns her sights downward, looking into subterranean spaces, both actual and metaphorical. The results are dark and unrevealing. Collating 10 vignettes from various sources, Ms. Skipitares has created a small, hermetic chamber piece. In most of the scenes, the puppetry seems peripheral and adds very little to the storytelling. In the director's characteristic fashion, two actors (Tom Costello and Mary Lou Wittmer) narrate the stories and dub the voices of characters. The scenes range through history from the myth of Persephone in Hades to the contemporary story of Jessica McClure, the little Texas girl who was trapped in an abandoned well. In the McClure episode, a large wire sculpture is manipulated by puppeteers and stands in awkwardly for the well. At other times, wall-size environments are animated, often with minimal effect. In contrast to the scenic elements, the texts are evocative, especially when conjuring historical moments with social and political weight: a cholera epidemic, unionism in coal mines and racial discrimination (in a selection from Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man"). In one amusing section, "Fallout Shelter," written by Sebastian Stuart, a provocative idea is merged with puppet art. A family of four is ensconced in a shelter, bonding during an unnamed emergency. Although Ms. Skipitares has craftily filled the shelter with brand names of civilization, the room is incompletely equipped in certain crucial areas, raising the question of how ready people are for life underground. Like characters out of "The Brady Bunch," the parents and children privately soliloquize about their true feelings toward one another and their confinement. In a moment of crisis, individualism takes precedence over family values. Except for this scene, the anthology remains a work in progress.

1317-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Senate Contest Isn't Over Till Absentee Votes Are In
Local election boards will count hundreds of absentee ballots next week to determine the final tally in the election for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. Geraldine A. Ferraro, in saying good night to her supporters shortly after midnight, said that 20,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted. But several election board officials said that no estimate of the number of absentee ballots was available and that it was impossible to guess the number that would be returned. "I couldn't give you a figure on how many absentee ballots there are so far because they're still coming in," said Naomi Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the New York City Board of Elections. Ms. Bernstein added that there would be hundreds of absentee ballots to count next week and that they could affect the balance. "It is so close at this point that until all the votes are tallied we cannot issue any kind of a call on it," she said. Ms. Bernstein and other election board officials said an estimate of the number of absentee ballots would be available today, based on the number of ballots distributed and the number received so far. Local county election boards and the New York City election board will begin counting the absentee ballots on Tuesday. They must be postmarked by midnight Monday, Sept. 14, to be valid, election board officials said. Election boards must allow seven days for all the absentee ballots to arrive. Absentee ballots can be requested by any registered voter by mail, up to seven days before the election, or they can be picked up in person the day before the election. In addition to the absentee ballots cast by people in the country, votes cast at polling stations in embassies and on military bases abroad will also be counted.

1319-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE INCUMBENT; Round Two: D'Amato Takes Aim At Opponent
Even before he found out that Robert Abrams would most likely be his Democratic opponent, Republican Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was spewing venom in Mr. Abrams's direction. In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. D'Amato skewered the State Attorney General with several select adjectives: "insipid" and "flaccid, no, no, I mean, placid, placid." In contrast, he flattered former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, his preferred opponent. He predicted she would win and spoke of her "charisma" and "star-like quality." In fact, Mr. D'Amato, who issued a blistering attack on Ms. Ferraro just a month ago, expressed outrage at the "nauseating pillory" of Ms. Ferraro during the primary campaign and insisted that the other candidates should apologize to her.. "Their race was an absolute, total disgrace -- mean-spirited, downright ugly, a turn-off, a mud bath," said Mr. D'Amato, a 12-year incumbent. And, elaborating at his Manhattan campaign headquarters Tuesday night, Mr. D'Amato said: "I'm certainly not going to stand by and let anyone dump manure on me." Calm Day in Washington While the Democratic candidates for his seat fretted through the final day of their campaign, Mr. D'Amato was in Washington, wondering -- indifferently, he said -- whether his opponent would be "him" or "her." "It doesn't really make too much difference," he said before flying back to New York in the early evening. "Whoever it is, it is not going to be an easy race." Nonetheless, Mr. D'Amato directed his first barbs at "him." "That little, disingenous guy, I don't know what he stands for other than trying to get elected," Mr. D'Amato said. He added: "How's that? And I haven't even started." Because Larry Rockefeller, an environmental lawyer, failed to get on the Republican ballot, Mr. D'Amato was left with little to do yesterday primary but contemplate ways to spend his $8 million campaign fund. At 7 A.M., he voted in the Congressional election in Island Park, L.I. (for Peter T. King). Then he flew to Washington for a day of meetings -- "half hour on breast cancer research, very interesting" -- and Senate votes. He said he had preferred Ms. Ferraro as his opponent because controversy over ethics would be muted by mutual difficulties. Mr. D'Amato had sweated through a two-year Senate ethics investigation, which cleared him of breaking any rules but scolded him for "improper and inappropriate" conduct in allowing his brother, Armand, to use his office and stationery for lobbying. Ms. Ferraro, while a Representative, was found in violation of the Ethics in Government Act for failing to disclose information about her husband's finances. Regardless of his opponent, Mr. D'Amato said his campaign would be "a referendum on jobs and economic growth," criticizing President Bush's failure to revive the economy. It would be "an informative campaign -- hah, hah, hah," he said. "And don't print that 'hah, hah, hah.' "

1320-> SPORTS PEOPLE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Sherrill Apologizes for Incident
Coach JACKIE SHERRILL apologized yesterday for allowing the castration of a bull in front of his Mississippi State football team, and the school's president promised that such an incident would not occur again. "Even though I was not involved in the procedure that took place, I take responsibility," Sherrill told his weekly news conference. "If this incident was in any way not perceived as proper by those who love Mississippi State, then I apologize." The bull was castrated in front of the team on a practice field before Mississippi State defeated the Texas Longhorns, 28-10, on Sept. 5. Later, Sherrill said he allowed the procedure because it was educational and motivational.

1321-> Noncitizens and Right to Vote; Advocates for Immigrants Explore Opening Up Balloting
They are, by most measures, typical New Yorkers who pay taxes, endure the subways, send their children to city schools and complain about rents, crime and alternate-side-of-the-street parking. But one thing sets them apart. As legal immigrants who are not United States citizens, one million New Yorkers cannot vote in city elections. One-eighth of the population, they are, in the traditional political sense, powerless. But that could change. Increasingly, advocates for immigrants here -- as in Washington, Los Angeles and several smaller cities across the nation -- have begun exploring the sensitive issue of securing voting privileges for immigrants who are not citizens. "It is said that immigrants' rights are the civil rights of the 1990's," said Jamin Raskin, an American University law professor who is the intellectual author of this grass-roots drive. "By that logic, noncitizen voting is the suffrage movement of the decade." If noncitizens were given a voice in local politics, proponents say, they would not feel the impotence that occasionally spills over into the kind of street violence that recently erupted in the Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights. But opponents counter that the right to vote should be earned, not given away; it is a prize that many citizens fought to obtain. There are about 10 million legal immigrants who are not United States citizens. Some are not yet eligible because they only recently arrived or earned legal status; others are unwilling, for personal and financial reasons, to renounce their homelands. In number at least, they represent a potential political force of some diversity and dimension, particularly in such cities as New York. That, in part, is why this issue is so threatening to some and so appealing to others. But equally important to many critics is that, in their eyes, the concept of voting rights tinkers with the very notion of what it means to be a United States citizen. "No one should be given the franchise without taking the Pledge of Allegiance," said Daniel Stein, executive director of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group that supports stricter immigration controls. "If you divorce citizenship and voting, citizenship stops having any meaning at all." Ethnic Tensions Fanned In cities where legislation was drafted to give noncitizens the vote, ethnic political tensions have been quickly fanned, particularly between blacks and Latinos. In others, even discussion of such efforts has elicited anti-immigrant sentiments. And so far this year, only the suburban town of Takoma Park, Md., has succeeded in granting noncitizen immigrants the right to vote. Most state legislatures -- which the United States Constitution charges with defining the electorate -- are chronically reluctant to make election law changes. Nonetheless, the debate is gaining energy. In New York, for example, the recent protests and rioting in the Dominican community of Washington Heights gave fresh momentum to a noncitizen voting-rights drive. The New York State Assembly's 24-member Task Force on New Americans plans to introduce a bill this summer that will enable municipalities to extend the vote to immigrants who are residents but not citizens. Until World War I, nearly half of the states in the country allowed immigrants to vote at one time or another, even in Presidential elections. Aliens enjoyed voting rights that many citizens -- blacks and women -- did not. After World War I, at a moment of high military nationalism, state after state purged their constitutions of alien suffrage provisions, although the nation has continued to draft immigrants at times of war. Many states, New York among them, now specify that voters must be citizens. Others, such as Maryland, leave voter criteria up to the localities. Five Maryland suburbs, in fact, have been allowing aliens to vote for decades without controversy but they are primarily members of the diplomatic community. 'Taxpayers and Neighbors' What happened in Takoma Park, population 17,000, was different. Ideology was involved. The suburb provided sanctuary to Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees in the 1980's; some 2,000 noncitizen immigrants, mostly Central Americans, now live there. When it came time to draw up new voting wards, equal in population, based on 1990 Census numbers, an injustice manifested itself, said Professor Raskin, a Takoma Park resident. Those wards with immigrant populations had fewer voters. "They may be aliens from a national or international perspective, but locally they are taxpayers, neighbors and parents of kids in schools," Professor Raskin said. "No taxation without representation, remember?" The Takoma Park "Share the Vote" campaign, which succeeded last November by the slimmest of margins, made one dark argument amid its idealism: People without access to normal channels of political participation will find other ways, perhaps violent ways, to make their grievances understood. Look at Mount Pleasant, advocates said. In Mount Pleasant, a neighborhood in Washington, Central Americans rioted in the spring of 1991 after police officers wounded a Salvadoran man they said was wielding a knife. As in Washington Heights, the immigrants took to the streets to vent frustrations that they said were never paid any heed -- because no politician was beholden to them. Buoyed by the success of the campaign in Takoma Park and sobered by a visit to El Salvador, the Washington City Council member who represents Mount Pleasant sponsored his own bill for noncitizens. But when community leaders, especially blacks, protested the very concept, Councilman Frank Smith Jr., who is black, shrunk his measure to apply only to immigrants who have formally applied for citizenship, a relatively small group. The bill comes up for a hearing in September. "The Latino versus African-American issue is not an issue of political power at this point; it's an issue of economics," Mr. Smith said. "Some folks say I'm encouraging people to stay here and compete with us. But they're going to stay here anyway. " Also this spring, in Los Angeles, Leticia Quezada, the first Latina president of the school board, formally proposed allowing noncitizen parents to vote in school board elections. Her "parent empowerment" proposal, interpreted by opponents as a masked attempt to expand her constituency, particularly angered black educators. A school board vote was postponed, even as Latino parents threatened to pull their children out of school in protest. "Unfortunately, the temperament of this state, particularly in a recession, is significantly anti-immigrant," Ms. Quezada said. "But even if this is something that cannot be done immediately, I believe we are at the infancy stage of a new movement." The ethnic dynamics may prove to be different in New York than they were in Washington and Los Angeles. In New York, the immigrant population is more diverse, with large numbers of non-Latino black Caribbean immigrants. "You'll have certain populations resentful, but possibly it won't be the African-Americans here, but the old-line whites," said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. If history is any lesson, perhaps even the idea will be less controversial in New York, particularly in the city. In the late 1960's, a radical move in New York City went largely unnoticed. With the decentralization of the New York City schools, all parents -- illegal and legal immigrants included -- were awarded the right to vote in the 32 community school board elections. Although a very local privilege, it has been used in some neighborhoods to reshape community politics. In Washington Heights, an active parent registration drive in 1986 brought in 10,000 parent voters, most of them immigrants.

1324-> Hal Roach Recalls His First Century
The cinema celebrates its 100th birthday next year, but Hal Roach got there first. The man who paired Laurel with Hardy, put black glasses on Harold Lloyd and cranked out more than 200 Our Gang comedies began his second century last week, and Thursday night the Smithsonian Resident Associate Program will honor him at the National Museum of Natural History here. The evening's events will include screenings of "The Pip From Pittsburgh," a 1931 Charlie Chase comedy, and "Helpmates," a 1932 Laurel and Hardy classic. Along with birthday cake and champagne, Mr. Roach will be presented with the James Smithson Medal, the Smithsonian's highest award, given "in recognition of exceptional contributions to art, science, history, education and technology." Mr. Roach, who lives in Bel Air, Calif.,relies on a hearing aid these days, and getting out of a chair is a minor event. But his vision is sharp, his memory runneth over, and he has some decided opinions on Hollywood comedies. "They don't make the right kind of thing," he said in an interview at his hotel here today. "You can't make people laugh for more than half an hour and be consistent." Therein lay the secret of the 30-minute 2-reelers that Mr. Roach and other comedy directors turned out by the hundreds in the early days of film. "The important thing, once you get 'em laughing, is to keep 'em laughing until you're through," he said. "With a 90-minute feature, you've got to stop the laughter and then pick it up again, which is tough." Mr. Roach's proposed solution is to lop a half-hour off the typical feature film, run a comedy short before it, and thereby give parents and their children a reason to go to the movies together. Mr. Roach is brimful of ideas and projects, in fact. "You don't just tell your brain to go to sleep," he said. "I have a very good game show, two feature pictures that would be very good, and I have a show that would be the finest drama on television. It's for my own amusement. I'm kind of lazy and haven't approached anyone." The game show, said Mr. Roach, is based on a game he used to play in the car with Harold Lloyd and four other actors on the way to film locations. A kind of spelling bee with a bluffing element thrown in, it would involve some audience participation, with viewers invited to send in three words for contestants to spell. "The thing that I like about it is the people watching the show have a great chance at winning some money, especially if that last word is a real toughie," said Mr. Roach, who still gets out to the Santa Anita race track. "It's a good game." One idea for a feature comedy is "Punch and Hudy," about the two toughest convicts in a prison who, inexplicably, get along with no one but each other. Mr. Roach admitted that the idea is "Laurel and Hardy Go to Jail," more or less. Ideas Across the Ocean Skillful recycling, of course, was a key to survival in the early days of Hollywood. In many cases it sustained entire careers. Mr. Roach said Stan Laurel often came to the rescue when comic bits that looked good on paper did not work in front of the cameras. "He was English, and he remembered a lot of very funny visual acts that were great for comedies," Mr. Roach said. "Laurel could almost always come up with an old idea that was English. Charlie Chaplin lived on those. That's where he got his comedy 100 percent." One of the most famous Chaplin gags, the shoe-eating scene in "The Gold Rush," was lifted directly from English vaudeville, said Mr. Roach. "It was a bit about tramps under a bridge, and a one-legged guy who wanders in with a new pair of shoes around his neck. The other guys convince him to boil one of the shoes for dinner, but they make a mistake and cook the wrong shoe." Mr. Roach fondly remembers Harold Lloyd as the biggest money maker he ever got his hands on. He said he used to watch the actor closely when they both worked on a dozen films at Universal. "On every one of those pictures," he said, "I was watching him all the way through, seeing the way he played even lesser parts with great finesse." "Harold Lloyd was not a comedian," Mr. Roach continued. "But he was one of the best actors around. He played a comedian. He never said, 'What do I do next?' He said, 'What does he do next.' And he was never much until he put the glasses on." About Those Glasses The idea for the famous glasses, Mr. Roach recalled, came up by accident, when Earl Mohan, who played drunks, put on a pair of light brown glasses and reeled around the set. "It was such a change in the character that I sent for a bunch of those frames," said Mr. Roach. A black pair made their way to Lloyd's face, with results that still cause Mr. Roach to beam with pleasure. "As soon as we put the glasses on him, he became a profitable comedian," he said. "I made enough money off him to build the Hal Roach Studios." That was in 1919, and over the next 40 years, the studio produced, in addition to the Harold Lloyd films, comedies by the Our Gang troupe, Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chase, as well as the "Topper" films with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett, "Of Mice and Men," which Mr. Roach has described as Laurel and Hardy without the laughs, and, not last but certainly least, "One Million B.C." The roster of actors who passed through the studio's doors included Jean Harlow, Harry Langdon, Will Rogers, Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts. Ronald Reagan made training films at "Fort Roach" when the studio was taken over by the War Department in the early 40's. Purveying a Higher Comedy The studio's sophisticated, conceptual comedy stood in marked contrast to the work of Mack Sennett, the king of slapstick. Mr. Roach does not seem to think all that much of his old rival. "Everyone knocked themselves down, picked themselves up," he said dismissively. Even worse was the intrusion of Sennett's Bathing Beauties, darlings of the print press. "To get this tremendous publicity, he had to put these gals in every picture," Mr. Roach said. "But they were not funny. So when he cut to the girls, the laughing had to stop." "But the theaters wanted laughter, so all of a sudden I was getting almost twice the money he was getting for the same kind of picture." Money comes up a lot when Mr. Roach talks about film. Names may occasionally escape him, but never a salary or a box office figure. And a clever bit of improvising that paid off puts him in seventh heaven. He recounted the tale of a panic meeting of the film producers' association after a rash of bank closings in 1924. Let Them Eat Oats "Everybody was scared they couldn't pay their stars," Mr. Roach recalled. "I got up and said: 'To hell with the stars. You're the guys that make the pictures. If you can't do anything else, star a horse.' And I walked out and made 'King of the Wild Horses,' 1 of the top 10 films that year." Here came the beauty part. "I made five pictures with the horse," he said, "and then sold them for $10,000 to Fox."

1327-> Ireland Plans a Referendum on Abortion Law
The Irish Government has gingerly begun a new national debate on abortion, one of the most divisive issues in this predominantly Roman Catholic country, by setting a referendum on the question. With Parliament coming back into session on Wednesday, the Government today disclosed its plan for a three-part referendum on Dec. 3. The abortion law was thrown into confusion in February by a Supreme Court decision that liberalized the law but did not make it clear to what extent abortions would be legal in the future. In a statement after a Cabinet meeting today, officials said there would be separate votes on the conditions under which abortion might be permitted, the right to travel abroad for an abortion and access in Ireland to information about abortion. The wording of the questions has yet to be decided. How Prime Minister Albert Reynolds's Government deals with the abortion issue, and the equally delicate question of divorce, will affect its ability to win in a national election, which is expected within the next year. The Government recently issued a study that called for discussion of the divorce issue. But the Government did not say whether it favored a law permitting divorce, or even a referendum on the matter, although it indicated that a referendum seemed likely. Abortion is now the more volatile issue. The country was recently reminded of the position of the Catholic Church when Pope John Paul II appeared to tell a group of Irish bishops in Rome that he favored a constitutional prohibition against abortion. He said that outlawing abortion was "a courageous defense of life" and that "to uphold this principle and to enshrine it democratically in the Constitution and laws of the state does not imply insensitivity to the rights of others, including mothers in complex and difficult situations." "Another Blow to Pluralism," was the headline of the main editorial in The Sunday Tribune, a liberal weekly. The thrust of the Pope's remarks, it said, "was dismaying from the perspective of those who may wish to advance in Ireland the concept of a pluralist, tolerant and just society." How Law May Be Eased A poll published last Thursday by The Irish Times showed that 58 percent of those responding opposed a referendum to impose a total ban on abortion, apparently preferring to leave the matter to Parliament. The survey also showed that 75 percent favored a new law that would guarantee the right to abortion information, and 66 percent favored a guarantee of the right for women to travel abroad for abortions. The Government's denial of the right to travel set off an uproar last February in the case of a 14-year-old girl who said she had been raped by the father of a friend and wanted to go to Britain for an abortion, as about 4,000 Irish women do each year. The Government said no, but the Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and the girl had the abortion. The rape suspect is to be tried this year. In a referendum in 1983, 67 percent of the voters approved a constitutional amendment banning abortion. While virtually all Irish politicians say they are opposed to abortion, there is a substantial support for liberalization of the law.

1329-> CREDIT MARKETS; Demand Strong for 10-Year Notes
Demand for $11 billion worth of new 10-year Treasury notes was extremely good yesterday, helping to lift prices of outstanding notes and bonds. The new securities were sold at an average yield of 7.53 percent, up from the average yield of 7.29 percent at the last 10-year auction on Feb. 12. The $33 billion worth of bids submitted at the auction was the largest amount at a 10-year auction since the late 1970's, analysts said. Traders said the total included a large bid from one Wall Street house, which they would not identify. In addition, noncompetitive tender offers totaled $689 million, a very large figure for a 10-year note sale. Those bids are usually submitted by small investors and small banks who are willing to accept the average auction price. "We had a very good, solid retail book," the manager of one government bond desk said, "because the issue on the yield curve looked reasonably priced, particularly against the bond." 'Mom and Pop' Business Looking at the noncompetitive bids, Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, said it looked as if "Mom and Pop trotted down to the Fed, took out the tender orders and submitted them." He added, "These are people looking for yields they used to get on bank certificates of deposit." With two-thirds of the refunding auctions completed, the focus of market participants shifted immediately to today's sale of $10 billion worth of 29 1/2-year bonds, as well as the release tomorrow of employment data for April. Since the employment report could easily influence price movements in the new bonds after it is released, there are big risks accompanying a bond purchase at the auction. "The whole problem is Friday," the bond trader said. William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said: "Usually there is one auction during a refunding that tends to be more of a problem than the others. So far, we haven't had any problems." Report Sees Fed Easing While the good auction results provided most of the push on prices, short- to intermediate-term issues moved higher early in the session on a report issued by Johnson-Smick International, an economic consulting firm based in Washington. The report said the Federal Reserve Board seemed likely to ease monetary policy again before the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee on May 19. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 29 1/2-year bonds to be sold today were offered at a price to yield 7.97 percent. In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10014/32 , up 13/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.99 percent late Tuesday. Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9915/32 , up 7/32 , to yield 7.09 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 10010/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 5.20 percent. The rally also helped to lift prices of the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday. The notes, which were sold at an average rate of 5.96 percent, were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 5.86 percent. Bill Rates Are Down Talk of an easing move by the Fed helped to knock down rates on outstanding Treasury bills. Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.58 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 1 basis point, to a late offered rate of 3.72 percent. In the investment-grade corporate bond market, a unit of the Chrysler Credit Corporation offered a total of $750 million worth of senior notes backed by loan receipts on new and used automobiles. The bulk of the issue consisted of $720 million worth of 5.90 percent notes with a final maturity of Nov. 15, 1997, and an average life of 2.2 years. The securities were priced at $99.8272 to yield 6.04 percent, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 5 3/8 percent two-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. This part of the issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Bear, Stearns & Company Inc. acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The rise in Treasury prices, coupled with a slowdown in new issues, helped to raise prices of outstanding tax-exempt municipal bonds. According to market participants, prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt securities rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point. Following are the results of the auction of 10-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.792 Average Yield . . . 7.53% Low Price . . . 99.792 High Yield . . . 7.53% High Price . . . 99.792 Low Yield . . . 7.53% Accepted at low price . . . 81% Total applied for . . . $33,389,126 Accepted . . . $11,073,571 N.Y. applied for . . . $31,447,839 N.Y. accepted . . . $10,650,074 Noncompetitive . . . $689,000 Interest set at . . . 7.50% The 10-year notes mature May 15, 2002.

1331-> The Pop Life
Rhythmic Additives Suzanne Vega has made a career of chilliness, a sort of frozen intimacy. Armed with an acoustic guitar and lean backup band, she exemplified vanguard pop from the 1980's, mixing traditions from folk to performance art. Her new album, "99.9 F" (A&M), her first in two years, is a radical departure, and it's full of activity. For one, it's bursting with samples and odd noises and manipulated voices. In 1990, Ms. Vega had a backhanded success with the song "Tom's Diner," which became a dance-floor hit as remixed by the English group DNA. The idea caught on. When an album-length set of remixes, also called "Tom's Diner," came out later that year, it was clear that Ms. Vega's chilliness was blank enough to be filled up. Her new album does just that. "When I heard the remixes, it didn't make me plan to make a hip-hop record, but I didn't pretend that they didn't exist in making '99.9 F,"' said Ms. Vega. "The last record I made, my producer and I were thinking about getting away from using normal drum kits and using more rhythms in different ways." Her producer, Mitchell Froom, suggested using various percussion instead of a drum kit. "He wanted to get away from rock and from the anthemic sort of stuff, open up the music to all sorts of different sounds," Ms. Vega said. Like a lot of technological experimentation, "99.9 F" is a product of limitations. Though Ms. Vega has her own stock of melodies, and her own distinctly arctic voice, she isn't known for the depth of her expressive vocabulary. There is a plainness to her expression that lends itself to being decorated. "I'm pretty aware of my strengths and weaknesses, and a great wide-ranging emotional voice isn't one of the strengths," said Ms. Vega. "So it was fun to distort things, use the technology. In "Blood Makes Noise" I'm singing through a megaphone, something Tom Waits does all the time. But if you're a woman and come from folk music and play an acoustic guitar, people lock you up in a category, and that becomes a big step." The new album may be the last pop recording Ms. Vega makes for a while. She says she's tired of the pop life. "I'm not planning to quit making records," she said. "But I may do them way smaller; it's easy to do something with acoustic guitar and classical backdrop and suddenly you don't have a big pop thing. I don't know if I want to do pop, it's just too big and it can squash everybody. People challenge you on why you write about blood, let's say, and unconsciously you try to conform and then you feel flat, with no idiosyncracies left. One day you can't remember who you are and why you wanted to dress the way you dress." But "99.9 F," she said, "took on such mind-bending proportions, and it took all these twists and turns. It was so much fun I couldn't let it go." Jazzing Up the Blues Before the saxophonist Branford Marsalis left to take over the musical duties on the "Tonight" show, he finished an album of blues, "I Heard You Twice the First Time" (Columbia), with guest stars including B. B. King, John Lee Hooker, Joe Louis Walker, Linda Hopkins and others. Mr. Marsalis's brother Wynton released a blues set himself last year, in which he explored the possibilities inherent in jazz's relationship to the blues form. But Branford Marsalis is doing something else. "I Heard You Twice the First Time" is an album that mixes vernacular roadhouse blues with sophisticated harmonies and rhythms. In pieces like "Mabel," with John Lee Hooker, Mr. Marsalis celebrates the rural and anarchic. On "Sidney in Da Haus," he celebrates New Orleans blues polyphony, while Sidney Bechet blends it all with modern hard-driving swing. On "Brother Trying to Catch a Cab," the opening track, Mr. Marsalis displays modern tenor saxophone improvisation at its best. And as an end piece, "Simi Valley Blues" delves into the later style of John Coltrane to express outrage at the Rodney King verdict; it uses the Pledge of Allegiance as an ironic counterpoint to the song's title. "I didn't know about this sort of blues when I was a kid," said Mr. Marsalis. "I listened to it when I was an adult. The only thing I heard on the radio was contemporary stuff." His introduction to blues came from a meeting with the bassist, songwriter and producer Willie Dixon, who pointed him in the right direction. "In Montreal at a festival, Willie Dixon was playing, and I went up and talked to him," said Mr. Marsalis. "He was one of the few folk cats that had the ears open enough -- B. B.'s another one -- to be accepting of jazz musicians. Dixon had heard Wynton, and he laughed and said, 'You jazz cats knock me out!' Then he gave me a list of albums to pick up, which I did. I saw him some years later on David Sanborn's show; he was playing with David and I was playing with Betty Carter. I went up to him and said, 'You don't remember me, but you're the reason I'm interested in blues,' and he laughed and said, 'You jazz cats knock me out.' "

1332-> HORSE RACING; Krone Won't Ride in Travers
Julie Krone, still suffering from a viral infection and a cracked rib, canceled her mounts at Saratoga Race Course today for the third time this week and also withdrew from Saturday's Travers Stakes as the rider on Lee n Otto, the 30-1 long shot. The 29-year-old jockey, who led all riders in winning races at Belmont Park's recent spring and summer meeting, said she expected to return to the races on Sunday. "I hurt my rib last Saturday when Teddy C. reared in the gate," she said. "But it wasn't in a dangerous area. I rode six winners in two days with it. The rib wasn't anything. It was the virus that killed me." Krone denied reports that she had injured the rib while bungee jumping at Saratoga Lake. "I don't know how rumors like that get started," she said. The jockey canceled her rides last Monday; rested on Tuesday, the track's normal day off; canceled again on Wednesday, but returned Thursday and rode no winners in five races. Her place aboard Lee n Otto in the Travers will be taken by Richard Migliore.

1333-> Relief on Auto Alarms
To the Editor: "Wailing About Wails" (Topics item, Aug. 12) echoes the feelings of New Yorkers on the usefulness and nuisance of car alarms. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has signed a bill I sponsored that outlaws the sale of new car alarms that sound for more than three minutes or that can be set off by other than direct physical contact. In addition, the new law makes it easier to enforce local restrictions on car alarms. Under previous law, agents were required to issue summonses to car owners in person; the new law allows agents to place tickets on the offending vehicle's windshield instead. ROY M. GOODMAN State Senator, 26th Dist. Albany, Aug. 12, 1992

1334-> CURRENTS; When Five Barns Make One House
IT would definitely not be everybody's dream. But on a clear day, Ed and Jane Dadey, two artists in Marquette, Neb., can scale the tower of their home, which they call a "mutant Little House on the Prairie," and get quite a view. The Dadeys' house (above) consists of five salvaged barns joined together. "Our intention was to get a lot of space cheap," said Mr. Dadey, 44 years old, who grew up in the area. The interior of the cavernous space is largely unfinished, except for a room that functions as a combination drafting room, computer center, darkroom, kitchen, laundry room, bedroom and even bathroom. Mrs. Dadey, 40, is a widely respected needleworker and quilter who worked on Judy Chicago's "Birth Project"; Mr. Dadey, a sculptor and furniture maker, helps design her quilts on his computer. They have 12,000 feet of space and lots of plans, including the establishment of a nonprofit art center with artists-in-residence. Meanwhile, the odd, rambling structure probably qualifies as one of the country's more unusual homemade houses. Viewed on the horizon, it looks as though it could have been designed by a fancy architect, if you squint hard.

1336-> How to Stomach The Debates
POLITICAL pundits and Ozzie and Harriet types -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- are howling "Hobson's choice" over the proposed early evening schedule for the Presidential debates, which begin Sunday at 7 P.M., Eastern time. But it is not the apparent conflict between family and country, the choice between sitting down to dinner or sitting down to the debates, that has people so exercised. No, it is the inevitability of high-fat retro food. Oh, some voice the quaint notion that "family dinner" means "no TV." But when pressed, most admit that just about everybody watches television while they eat and that it is the particular cravings that television arouses that make them feel fatalistic. "The debates don't represent a decision between an Ozzie-and-Harriet-style family meal and watching television," said Bill McKibben, author of "The Age of Missing Information," a book about television-watching published by Random House this year. Rather, the choice, Mr. McKibben said, is between "watching 'Ozzie and Harriet' and watching 'The Bill and George Show.' " Likewise, the choice of food to view by is not between carrot sticks or cucumber slices. More likely, it's between cheese curls and taco chips. Conventional TV dinners don't fill the bill. Swanson's, the company that invented the TV dinner, typically enjoys high sales during campaign seasons, said Kevin Lowery, the company's manager of corporate communications. But the dinners fail to address the nuance of appetite and attitude fostered by dining in front of the tube -- to say nothing of the sense of occasion inherent in the Presidential debates. The traditional TV dinner might be too tidy. "The whole thing about eating in front of TV is fingers," said Anthea Disney, the editor of TV Guide. "Using your fingers, and eating out of a bowl." This urge is typically coupled with cravings for junk food. "While watching television, you are not seized with a desire for some healthy nourishing food," Mr. McKibben said. "I don't suddenly want carrot sticks. I want Cheetos." Other professional viewers have noticed a similar itch. Jeff Jarvis, the critic for TV Guide, who watches television 60 hours a week, said his tastes run toward Coca-Cola, Snackwell's Bite Size Chocolate Chip Cookies and Cinnamon Graham Snacks. But the debates, he said, require more than ordinary television fare. "To me this feels like a macaroni-and-cheese event," he said. "I envision a real Velveeta kind of night." In addition to the nostalgic value of such Americana as macaroni and cheese, or meatloaf and mashed potatoes, these kinds of dishes offer a high-fat content that experts say is critical for debate-watching. "I know that in the long haul I am going to be bored to tears and I am only watching the debates out of civic duty," said Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor of New York City. "Therefore, I must comfort myself with the high-fat dishes I normally abjure." To get into the proper mood, Mr. Koch said he planned to eat a hot fudge sundae before dinner. Jeff Greenfield, political and media analyst for ABC News, agreed that a debate-night menu should include high-fat, gruel-like dishes. Not, he said, for comfort, but for digestibility. "The audience for debates skews old demographically," he said. "So you're looking at people who buy denture creams and laxatives, an audience of incontinent denture wearers that eats accordingly." Ms. Disney said the accord between high-fat dishes and political debate is born of a different physiological mandate. "We need to get mad during these debates," she said. "Little vegetables and pasta aren't going to do that. We need meat. Meat fat makes you mad. I call it hostility food." Foul! cries Rusty Staub, the former Met who owns Rusty's on Fifth in Manhattan. "Whenever you get a tense situation on television in our bar, it brings on the hard stuff," he said. "If people are feeling hostile and tense, they don't eat." The restaurant's manager, Kevin Taylor, said the situation is irreversible. "During the Democratic convention, we tried to balance it with humor, offering dishes like 'Wild Bill Clinton Chili' and 'Roasted Quayle,' " he said. "But nobody ordered them when serious stuff was going on. They just ordered hard liquor." Indeed, some people feel that food has no place at the debates. "The first thing I think of is indigestion," said Andy Rooney, the commentator on CBS for "60 Minutes," which will be pre-empted on Sunday by the first debate. Mr. Rooney echoed Mr. Staub's findings. "I'd take a strong drink with the debates," he said. Therefore, to buttress the cheese curls and taco chip hors d'oeuvres, a group of recipes have been culled. All are variations on classic American themes, but each offers enough deviation to provide that subtle je ne sais quoi for debate-night menus. Mr. Jarvis has supplied a macaroni-and-cheese recipe that, he said, is "as American as American cheese, as mushy as politician's rhetoric." Bill Blass, the designer, has suggested a recipe for an upscale meatloaf that he cooks for charity events. Michael Romano, chef of the Union Square Cafe in Manhattan, suggests variations on the basic mashed-potato theme to provide a grace note to the meatloaf. And Mr. Koch has endorsed a variation on the fudge sauce that he used to make during his days in Congress. It can be used over ice cream, as a fondue for cookies, or as a sauce for brownies. The best recipes, like the best candidates, are flexible, accommodating and easily adaptable to prime-time institutions.

1338-> Art in Review
Isa Genzken Marian Goodman Gallery 24 West 57th Street Midtown Through Oct. 17 Critical writing on the German artist Isa Genzken makes sweeping claims for the radical nature of her work, though few of these claims are borne out by this show. It includes pieces from 1980 through the present, which may be part of the problem. The collection of painting, sculpture and photography looks scrappy, and little of it feels fresh. Two large color photographic close-ups of ears, for example, one with earring, one without, must have seemed more interesting in 1980 when they were new than they do now, and Ms. Genzken's recent lacquer-on-canvas paintings of what appear to be suspended gymnast rings suggest computer-generated versions of work by Robert Moskowitz. This isn't a terrible idea; it just doesn't have much to do with anything else going on here. Some of her sculpture is more engaging. A large, hollow cast-concrete cube perforated with holes plays decorative lightness off its industrial material in a nice way. A rectangular concrete framelike form, broken and repaired, titled "Window," is evocative in its suggestion of being an isolated architectural element that has survived demolition. The best works here are the small modeled and carved white plaster sculptures from the mid-1980's. From mounds of plaster Ms. Genzken has cut interior rooms, walls and arches. The one titled "Little Chapel" resembles both archaic rock-cut caves and Kurt Schwitters's legendary "Merzbau" in Hanover, Germany, destroyed in World War II. And when one sees displayed amid this fictional architecture a lump of plaster with a tiny wire protruding from the top titled "My Brain" (1984), one has a sense of Schwitters's antic spirit and of an originality otherwise missing in this show.

1339-> BASEBALL; Saberhagen Is Eight-Ninths as Impressive as Gooden
The 1993 starting rotation for the Mets remains an abstraction of blind optimism and genuine uncertainty. There will have to be an addition made, likely from outside the organization. And there will have to be a lot of medical hopes realized. The concept, though, isn't altogether crazy, and the last two nights have infused the abstraction with an encouraging dose of realism. Barely 24 hours after Dwight Gooden turned in his first complete game of 1992, a 3-2 victory over the Cardinals, Bret Saberhagen calmly and economically posted eight shutout innings in what became a 4-3, 14-inning loss at Busch Stadium. The Cardinals, after being held scoreless for 13 innings, scored four runs in the bottom of the 14th to negate Jeff Kent's three-run homer in the top of the inning. Saberhagen, whose late-season quest has been more for peace of mind than any enhancement of statistics, pitched with blistering effectiveness. He required only 86 pitches to dispense with the Cardinals, allowing five hits and walking none. So there could be life and power pitching after David Cone, after all. "Can I be a quality starter game after game for the Mets next season?" Gooden asked tonight. "Yeah. They can rely on that." "Myself, Saberhagen, Sid, Schourek, it's a solid four," said Gooden. "We'll need a fifth, and none of the big three will be able to have an off year. We'll have to set the tone." The tenor of Saberhagen's return after his second setback with a problematic right index finger has heightened and sweetened of late. He started last week againt Montreal, working five capable innings and blowing away enough Expos to rekindle the excitement he had brought to the first third of this season. And tonight, he wasn't overpowering, but he was phenomenally adequate. He could undoubtedly have gone deeper into the game. Aha! A Curveball! As for Gooden, his resurgence has been distinguished most intriguingly by his precious bit of discovery in a season of personal turmoil and professional mediocrity. Gooden has found his curveball. "I can't even tell you the exact moment I felt I had it back," said Gooden. "But it's there, and it's right." As a result, Gooden feels at least close to whole on the mound. And as a consequence of that, Gooden discovered himself on the field at Busch Stadium Wednesday night, the game over, nine innings on the scoreboard, the baseball still in his hand. It was his first complete game since June 1991. "He's at the highest point of his season," said Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach for the Mets. "The consistency on his fastball is better. His release point is better. Best, the quality of pitches he's making when ahead in the count is much greater. He makes mistakes still, but not nearly as many." It has been a season of scandal and embarrassment and fear and failure for Gooden. "It's been worse than 1987," said Gooden, who missed a chunk of that season in rehabilitation for substance abuse. "There was the spring, Darryl's book, the shoulder. Bam, bam, bam." The personal thumping has been replaced by the crackling of his curveball. "I'll throw it in any spot now, three, four times in a row," said Gooden. "Early in the season, guys would see it and know I couldn't get it over. It was big and lazy and wild. They started to cheat on my fastball. And that, because of the shoulder, wasn't what it should have been, either." Fresher, better equipped, Gooden began to last longer, to work easy innings, to humble lineups again. Since Aug. 2, Gooden has gone at least seven innings in seven of his eight starts. INSIDE PITCH JOHN FRANCO will fly to Birmingham, Ala., Friday to be examined by Dr. JAMES ANDREWS. The closer for the Mets, who was set to have surgery to repair a damaged tendon in his pitching elbow after a recent diagnosis by the club's doctor, has wanted a second opinion. . . . DWIGHT GOODEN, saying his emotional allegiance was with nephew GARY SHEFFIELD of San Diego, said his baseball mind told him Pittsburgh's BARRY BONDS deserved the National League's most valuable player award. "He's earned every statistic he's got," Gooden said of Bonds. "No one pitches to him."

1341-> Japan Leader Now Cites 'Promise' on Auto Parts
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who caused a furor last week by saying that a $19 billion figure for Japanese purchases of United States car parts was only a target, further muddied the issue today by saying that Tokyo had indeed promised to increase the amount of American-made parts it buys. Members of Congress and many Americans reacted angrily after Mr. Miyazawa said the figure was a target and not a firm promise. But today Mr. Miyazawa talked about promises. Asked in Parliament whether the figure was a target or a promise, he said, "The Government will endeavor to sincerely fulfill its promise to the United States." During President Bush's visit to Japan earlier this month, Japanese officials and auto makers referred to the $19 billion in auto parts as a target, saying that fulfilling it would depend in part on the American industry's providing the right components at competitive prices. The pledge to raise Japan's imports of American-made automotive parts from the current level of $9 billion was contained in a joint United States-Japan statement at the end of Mr. Bush's visit. Mr. Bush, on a campaign to open Asian markets for American products, was accompanied to Tokyo by the heads of the Big Three auto makers. They were to hold a second round of talks with their Japanese counterparts next month, but on Monday the president of Nissan, Yutaka Kume, who heads the Japanese auto manufacturers association, said he was not interested in meeting the American executives in Detroit. Some United States politicians had seized on Mr. Miyazawa's Jan. 21 "target" remark as evidence that Japan was reneging on its pledge and that Mr. Bush had returned empty-handed from Tokyo. Members of Congress have introduced dozens of bills seeking to restrict Japanese car sales in the United States unless Japan shrinks its trade surplus with Washington, currently $41 billion, within five years. Another remark by a Japanese official also provoked strong reactions among American workers last week. Yoshio Sakurauchi, Speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament, told local constituents that American workers were illiterate and lazy. A Government spokesman, Koichi Kato, said today that Japan did not expect Mr. Sakurauchi's comment to develop into a serious problem between Tokyo and Washington.

1345-> Briton Repeats His Commitment to Europe, but Warily
Prime Minister John Major told a clamorous session of the House of Commons today that Britain was committed to closer European union, but he said the details of future monetary and political cooperation still needed further deliberation. After eight hours of often acerbic debate, Mr. Major and his Cabinet won a narrow vote of confidence, 330 to 288. It came a week after his Government had to make an embarrassing policy reversal and back out of the European monetary system, causing the value of the pound to fall steeply. Mr. Major defended his Government's action, saying it had been helpless to overcome huge speculative pressures on the pound. But the Prime Minister said the jittery financial markets only underscored the depth of doubts and apprehension in France, Britain and elsewhere over both the monetary system and the treaty on European union, suggesting that a slower and more careful course was required. Changes Sought in System "The good European does not ignore those fears but seeks to put them right," said the Prime Minister, adding that rising doubts over Europe must not tempt Britain into becoming "a sour, isolated country off the mainland of continental Europe." He said Britain supported the monetary system, but would not rejoin it until changes were made in the exchange rate mechanism, which sets upper and lower limits for all European currencies and which he blamed for contributing to the pound's decline. And while the Prime Minister said he was committed to the treaty, which narrowly won ratification from French voters on Sunday, he felt it did not go far enough to take into account national interests within the decision-making process. The treaty, which Mr. Major signed with other European leaders in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in December, is a blueprint for closer political and economic cooperation among the 12 member nations of the European Community. Others Want to Press Ahead Such remarks are likely to put the Prime Minister further at odds with government leaders on the Continent, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who want to press ahead with the treaty under a timetable that envisions its ratification by the the end of the year. On the domestic front, Mr. Major is also facing angry political criticism, both from the opposition Labor Party and a small but noisy group of rebels within the ranks of the Conservative Party who say last week's fiscal turmoil has sharpened their outright opposition to European union. Several members of Parliament spoke tonight in favor of a national referendum, as in France, to allow the British people a chance to vote on the treaty, a move Mr. Major opposes. Kenneth Baker, a former member of Mr. Major's Cabinet, argued that the events of recent days had torn "a gaping hole" in the Maastricht treaty. Amid growing criticism of his policies, Mr. Major last week agreed to demands that he recall the House of Commons from its annual recess and schedule a special two-day debate on the Government's economic and European policies. The 'Devalued' Mr. Major Looking defensive and a bit tense, Mr. Major was interrupted repeatedly by noisy outbursts and catcalls between rival party loyalists. John Smith, the Scottish lawyer who took over this summer as Labor leader, brought his party to its feet, waving papers, when he described Mr. Major as "the devalued Prime Minister of devalued Goverrment." In a mocking attack, Mr. Smith blamed Mr. Major and his Conservative Party for the longest recession in Britain since the 1930's. It proved to be a hard day all around for Mr. Major, as he faced the most serious political test of his 22-month career as Prime Minister. Tonight, he suffered another setback when David Mellor, a Cabinet minister and close personal friend, resigned from the Government in the wake of a sex and favors scandal. Stories about Mr. Mellor, whose post as National Heritage Secretary earned him the sobriquet "Minister of Fun" because his brief included arts, the news media and sports, had displaced the fall of the pound and the Europeans crisis on the front pages of British papers in recent days. Under Renewed Attack Last summer, Mr. Mellor acknowledged newspaper reports of a torrid extramarital affair with an Italian actress. But he came under renewed attack recently after revelations that he and his family had accepted a free vacation from the daughter of a top official of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. In his remarks before the House of Commons, Mr. Major said Britain would rejoin the European currency system system, a cornerstone of future European economic policy, but only after it had been "made to work for the benefit of all its members." Speaking of the Maastricht treaty, Mr. Major emphasized Britain's longstanding apprehensions about tying itself to a highly centralized bureaucracy in Brussels that would limit or frustrate British policy makers. He said he wanted "to put in place" some unspecified agreement that would give more leeway to the national interests of individual member nations.

1347-> Hasidic Public School District Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules
A special public school district in a Hasidic community in Orange County was established in violation of the constitutional separation of church and state, a State Supreme Court judge ruled today. The school district, which provides bilingual classes in English and Yiddish for 138 severely disabled children in the Hasidic enclave of Kiryas Joel, was formed in 1989 after many parents in the community refused to send their children to local public schools. Community leaders vowed to appeal the ruling. They said students in the Kiryas Joel Union Free School District had the same rights as children in the rest of the state. But in his decision, Justice Lawrence E. Kahn said the legislation establishing the district was a clear case of the government supporting religion in violation of the Constitution. "The statute, rather than serving a legitimate governmental end, was enacted to meet exclusive religious needs and has the effect of advancing, protecting and fostering the religious beliefs of the inhabitants of the school district," he wrote. Plan Is in Disarray The New York State School Boards Association, which brought the lawsuit, called the decision a resounding endorsement of the principle that public money should not be used to support religion. "We happen to feel that this is one of the most important constitutional decisions in the last decade," said Louis Grumet, the group's executive director. The ruling throws into disarray Kiryas Joel's carefully crafted plan to educate its disabled children. Made up entirely of Satmar Hasidim, ultra-Orthodox Jews who adhere to strict dress codes and generally shun outsiders, the community, about 35 miles northwest of New York City, educates its 4,000 or so non-disabled children at a large parochial school where boys are separated from girls and the emphasis is on religious instruction. But special education is far more expensive, and the community said it could not afford to educate its disabled children privately. It balked at sending them to the public schools in the nearest district, the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District, saying that it did not want them exposed to outside influences. To deal with the situation, the State Legislature passed, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed, a bill establishing a special district for Kiryas Joel's handicapped children. The district, which has one school building, is run by Steven Benardo, a former superintendent for special education in the Bronx. It is forbidden to teach or endorse religion, even though all its students are members of the Satmar community. An Unwanted Precedent If it is upheld, the ruling will effectively close the school, leaving the children to find an education elsewhere. The school district and the state also vowed to appeal, saying the children were being denied the right to a public education. "The school provides for the children who live in Kiryas Joel the same education and the same provisions for the handicapped as the children outside Kiryas Joel," said Nathan Lewin, the lawyer for the school district. "Forming the school district was simply a permissible accommodation, like drawing any other school district line would be." But Mr. Grumet of the School Boards Association said that if the school district had prevailed, it would have encouraged other religious groups around the country to set up their own school districts where their children could be educated separately. "This was no school district -- this was a private school," Mr. Grumet said. In his opinion, Justice Kahn seemed to agree. "The intent of the Legislature and Executive to be responsive to the citizens of Kiryas Joel is laudatory and reflects the political process straining to meet the needs of a religious group," he wrote. However, he cautioned, the legislation, if it were allowed to stand, would chip away at the First Amendment, even as it applied to the members of Kiryas Joel. "This short-range accomplishment could in the long run jeopardize the very religious freedom that they now enjoy," he said.

1348-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: CONGRESS; Weiss Wins, Biaggi Loses In House Bids
Voters in New York's Congressional primaries last night rejected Mario Biaggi, a convicted felon aiming for a political comeback in the Bronx, and handed victory to Ted Weiss, a dead man whose selection will allow Democratic Party leaders to designate someone else to run in his place in November. Overall it was a successful night for incumbents of both parties, with the stunning exception of Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Democrat who lost in a Brooklyn-Manhattan-Queens district that was drawn to include a majority of Hispanic voters. Two black Democratic Representatives in largely black districts managed to win renomination despite challenges that were expected to be formidable. Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn and the Rev. Floyd H. Flake of Queens both won with more than two-thirds of the vote, according to nearly complete results available late last night. In the Bronx, the Democratic incumbent, Eliot L. Engel, turned back Mr. Biaggi, who was convicted in 1989 of bribery and extortion, by a margin of nearly 3 to 1. "To voters who have come out to say that crime does not pay and betrayal of the public trust will not be tolerated, I say thank you," Mr. Engel told supporters at a restaurant in Riverdale. Large Field for Seat Mr. Weiss's victory, despite his sudden death on the day before the primary, means that the Manhattan Party leader, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, and his counterpart in Brooklyn, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., will jointly decide on a candidate to run on the party's line in November. Whoever the designee is will almost surely be the next representative from the heavily Democratic district. Mr. Weiss defeated Arthur R. Block, who is affiliated with the fringe New Alliance Party. The field of potential successors to Mr. Weiss is large and includes a variety of state lawmakers, as well as New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who was soundly defeated in yesterday's Senate primary, and former City Council President Carol Bellamy. Mr. Solarz is also a possibility, though he said in his concession speech last night that he had no regrets about running in the predominantly Hispanic district. Among other things, he told supporters, he said he was grateful that there would never be any suggestion that a campaign between him and Mr. Weiss, whom he called a "good friend," led to Mr. Weiss's death. Ackerman Is a Winner In the Manhattan-based 14th District, now represented by Bill Green, a Republican, City Councilwoman Carolyn B. Maloney won the Democratic primary and the right to oppose Mr. Green in November. She defeated Abraham J. Hirschfeld, a parking-garage magnate who has run unsuccessful races for senator and lieutenant governor in New York and for mayor of Miami Beach. Other incumbents who turned back challenges included Gary L. Ackerman of Queens, who won in a Queens-Nassau-Suffolk district against Rita Morris, a professor of library science at Nassau County Community College and mother of Hank Morris, a well-known political consultant. In central New York State, Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey of Ulster County was leading Mayor Juanita Crabb of Binghamton in the Democratic primary for the seat now held by Matthew F. McHugh, an Ithaca Democrat who is retiring. Yesterday's primaries were the middle act in what has been a strange and frequently contentious political drama this year. It has been marked by the convoluted process of redistricting and a record number of retirements among New York's 34-member House delegation. The size of the New York delegation will shrink in January to 31 members, as other states will new Representatives because of population growth in the last decade. At the outset of the redistricting process this year, state legislators engaged in acrimonious talks aimed at resolving which three members of Congress should be sacrificed. Later eight members of the delegation announced their retirements, and on Monday, a ninth member, Representative Weiss, died on the eve of the primary. Had the resignations been known in advance, Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Albany might have settled relatively quickly on a new political map. Instead, they were at impasse for weeks, and it was only after a special court-appointed panel stepped in with a plan this summer that the Legislature finally acted. The chief features of that plan were the creation of one new district, wiggling through dozens of neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, so that a majority of the residents are Hispanic, and the fusing of other districts in such a way that a few pairs of incumbents were likely to have to run against each other: Democrats Gary L. Ackerman and James H. Scheuer in Queens; Mr. Solarz and Mr. Weiss, Democrats, in a new district stretching from Coney Island and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn up through the West Side of Manhattan, and Frank Horton, a Republican, and Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat, in the Rochester area. But Mr. Scheuer and Mr. Horton, both in their 70's, retired rather than face potentially bruising fights, and Mr. Solarz, after agonizing for weeks and commissioning polls showing he would have an uphill fight against Mr. Weiss, decided to run instead in the new district with a Hispanic majority. Elsewhere, Representatives Towns and Flake faced strong challenges. Mr. Towns was running against Susan D. Alter, a member of the New York City Council who is white, while Mr. Flake faced Simeon Golar, a black lawyer and former chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission who has run unsuccessfully for Congress four times. In the Bronx, the season's throw-out-the-incumbent pitch came from a former incumbent, and a former felon at that. Mr. Biaggi, who was convicted of bribery and extortion in 1989 and released from prison after contending that he was near death, was vying for a comeback against Representative Engel, whose political base is Co-op City. Mr. Engel, repeatedly reminding voters of Mr. Biaggi's mournful assertions of illness barely a year ago, said sarcastically that his opponent "must have gone to Lourdes."

1349-> China Expels Three Canadians on Rights Mission
Three Canadian members of Parliament who came to China to investigate human rights gained first-hand insight into the issue today when the Government detained them, jostled them and put them on the first flight out of the country. The legislators had planned to go to Tiananmen Square, reporters in tow, to honor the victims of the 1989 military crackdown on the democracy movement. They had also intended to go to the gate of a Beijing prison to request permission to visit dissidents who are known to be inside. "They engaged themselves in activities inconsistent with their status," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said this afternoon. "The Beijing Municipal Public Security Department has therefore ordered them to leave China immediately." The incident underscores China's fundamental quandary in trying to address human rights issues. A Shift in Strategy After the 1989 crackdown, in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands wounded, Beijing's initial response was to avoid the issue of human rights and accuse critics of interfering in China's internal affairs. Then just over a year ago, the Government switched strategies and expressed a willingness to receive human rights delegations and discuss human rights issues. People's Daily has thus been full of tributes to the importance of human rights -- and sympathy for homeless Americans, who it says lack the human right to shelter. But the Chinese are clearly concerned that foreigners, like the Canadian M.P.'s, will use China's willingness to discuss human rights to embarrass the Government. The Canadians made no effort to keep their plans to lay a wreath secret. They invited reporters to go along, speaking on telephone lines that are known to be tapped, and presumably there were urgent meetings among Chinese State Security and Foreign Ministry officials about how to deal with the problem. In September, guards jostled three members of the United States Congress who tried to unfurl a memorial banner at Tiananmen Square. The three were denounced but not expelled. Canadian's Reaction "If this is the kind of human rights the Chinese demonstrate to legislators of the Canadian Parliament, then God help the people of China," Geoffrey Scott, one of the legislators, said after arriving in Hong Kong late this afternoon, The Associated Press reported from Hong Kong. The other M.P.'s were Svend Robinson, a New Democrat from British Columbia, and Beryl Gaffney, a Liberal from Ontario. Mr. Scott is a Conservative from Ontario. The Canadian Ambassador, Fred Bild, declined this evening to comment on the matter, but a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy said Mr. Bild had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry to be informed of the expulsion and had responded that he was unaware of any action by the legislators that was illegal. The embassy spokesman said he did not know if there would be any further protest from Canada. Protection of Copyrights In another issue involving relations with the West, the Chinese Government warned today that it is considering imposing retaliatory duties totaling $1.2 billion against American products, if the United States imposes duties against Chinese goods. The warning, in the form of a report this evening from the official New China News Agency, comes as Chinese and American negotiators are about to hold a final round of trade talks in Washington at the end of this week. If China and the United States have not reached agreement by Jan. 16 on measures to protect American copyrights and other intellectual property, then Washington is prepared to levy retaliatory duties against a variety of Chinese exports. So far, China offers little meaningful protection to American books, computer software and chemicals, and even President Bush's autobiography has been sold in pirated editions in Beijing. American industry groups estimate that China obtains $300 million worth of American software and $118 million worth of sound and video recordings without paying for them. China has taken steps to address American concerns, but by American reckoning the steps are too little and too late. The Chinese protest that protection of intellectual property takes time, and that anyway it is customary for developing countries to be somewhat cavalier about foreign copyrights and patents. "As the U.S. retaliatory date approaches, the Chinese side is also considering counter-retaliatory measures against the U.S. by levying retaliatory duties on some of the U.S. commodities," the New China News Agency declared. It said the American products subject to such duties might include aircraft, cotton, corn, steel and chemicals.

1350-> BASEBALL; Newly Empowered Owners Rescind Order to Realign
Seventeen days after Commissioner Fay Vincent resigned under fire, the owners who replaced him as baseball's ruling body yesterday rescinded his order to realign the National League. The executive council, led by Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, took the action coupled with the Chicago Cubs' agreement to withdraw their lawsuit challenging Vincent's order. Lawyers representing both sides appeared yesterday morning before Judge Suzanne Conlon in United States District Court in Chicago, informing her of their agreement and asking her to vacate her July 23 decision granting the Cubs a preliminary injunction blocking the team's move to the league's Western Division. The lawyers then asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to dismiss the commissioner's appeal of Judge Conlon's decision -- a hearing had been scheduled for next Wednesday -- and went back to Conlon to secure her dismissal of the suit. Victory for Tribune Company The decision to abandon realignment, which Selig and the executive council initiated in a telephone conference call Wednesday, was a clearcut victory for the Tribune Company, which as owner of the Cubs played a pivotal role in the attempt to oust Vincent. The action provided further evidence that the owners plan to dilute the powers of the commissioner before they hire Vincent's successor. Even though Conlon vacated her order, her ruling that Vincent exceeded his authority remains the last decision in a lawsuit against the baseball commissioner and could serve as precedent for future cases. But Selig and the executive council evidently had no concern about such implications because they apparently plan to change the Major League Agreement, which defines the commissioner's authority. "In light of restructuring," said one lawyer involved in the realignment case, "it could be that a new agreement will have different powers and language. This decision, even if it stood, wouldn't necessarily have binding precedential effect for the future." With Vincent gone, the executive council obviously had no desire for a prolonged legal fight. The council, made up of eight owners and the two league presidents and chaired by Selig, acts in place of the commissioner. "Everyone's view," the lawyer said, "was let's do what has to be done to get back to ground zero, which is what Bill White called it, and return to the status quo before realignment." Bill White is president of the National League. Because of the Tribune Company's role in the effort to unseat Vincent, one owner yesterday described Vincent's realignment order as "the arrow that pierced his heart." Tribune lawyers, according to some owners, had been deeply involved in drafting documents that were used in the campaign against Vincent. Besides the company's own involvement in the move against Vincent, all six clubs whose local television rights the Tribune holds now or will hold next season joined the 18-man coalition that voted to ask Vincent to resign. Vincent declined to comment on the council's action. 10-2 Vote to Realign The league's owners voted, 10-2, last March to realign, seeking to correct geography problems that had the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds playing in the West while the Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals remained in the East. But the Cubs used their veto rights under the league constitution to block the proposed switch of their club and St. Louis to the West and Cincinnati and Atlanta to the East. Subsequently, six clubs -- Atlanta, Pittsburgh, San Diego, San Francisco, Montreal and Houston -- said the commissioner should order the teams to move. He did so on July 6, but only two months later, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, San Diego and San Francisco became part of the 18-owner group that voted to ask Vincent to resign. In voting to rescind realignment, Selig and the executive council allowed Conlon's ruling that Vincent had exceeded his authority to remain as a rare decision against the commissioner. In fact, in the words of a Federal judge in the same circuit, referring to an earlier case, the Major League Agreement gives the commissioner "broad and unfettered" powers. But those powers very likely won't be nearly so broad when the owners are finished altering the commissioner's role. Some owners would prefer a chief executive officer who would answer to a board of directors made up of the 28 club owners. In a statement announcing the executive council's action, Selig did not address the future role of the commissioner, but he did talk about a new schedule-format committee that was named yesterday whose job will be to examine "all aspects of divisional alignment, scheduling and possible new formats." New formats could include interleague play and an increase in the number of divisions and number of teams in the post-season playoffs. "We can move forward," Selig said in the statement, "to resolve the realignment issue through consensus rather than confrontation, which is the approach that I would like to take to each and every problem confronting the game today." John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox is the chairman of the new committee. Other members are Stanton Cook of the Cubs, Eddie Einhorn of the Chicago White Sox, Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies, Richard Jacobs of the Cleveland Indians, Stan Kasten of the Braves and the two league presidents, White and Bobby Brown. It had already been decided that no matter what happened in the appeal of Conlon's decision, there would be no time to realign the National League for the 1993 season. The Cubs said they opposed realignment because they didn't want to give up their rivalries with Eastern Division teams. But just about everyone else in baseball said the Cubs opposed the switch because the Tribune Company feared the team's move to the West would hurt the Tribune Company's superstation, WGN. The company feared that playing more West Coast games meant later starting times, which would result in smaller viewership and reduced commercial revenue for WGN.

1351-> At the Bar; In Quayle's home state, a lawyer and ex-backer doesn't like the Republican attacks on the bar.
Among the otherwise forgettable ad hoc groups supporting this year's Presidential tickets, one seems particularly odd. In fact, it could be called "Masochists for Bush-Quayle," for it is made up of what have become the Republicans' favorite whipping boys and girls: lawyers. On Sept. 15 the Bush campaign unveiled the names of the 100-member steering committee of Lawyers for Bush/Quayle '92. These practitioners are alike in several ways. If, as their favorite candidates contend, America has too many lawyers, none considers himself to be among the surplus. None of them have ever filed a frivolous lawsuit or harmed American competitiveness. All firmly believe that when the President and Vice President chastise lawyers, they are clearly talking about someone else. But there is a dissenter on the committee, and in the unlikeliest of venues: here where Dan Quayle lived as a young boy. Earlier this year, when Peter Obremskey of Lebanon was asked to join the steering committee, he casually agreed, then quickly forgot about it. After all, Mr. Obremskey was a lifelong Republican who cast his first vote in a Presidential election for Barry Goldwater, liked President Bush all right and knew Mr. Quayle, with whom he had played golf several times at the Ulen Country Club, a stone's throw from the house where Mr. Quayle's grandmother once lived. So his name appears on the list -- with Lebanon misspelled. But the 56-year-old Mr. Obremskey is a trial lawyer -- one of the tassled-shoes set who, after the committee's formation, became a scourge of the Republican National Convention, along with liberals and homosexuals. Much of his livelihood comes from representing accident victims, and he is past president of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association, which represents those representatives. So furious is Mr. Obremskey over the Bush-Quayle bar-bashing that on Tuesday, after a reporter's call reminded him of his presence on the list, he quit the steering committee. And come November, he says, he is contemplating something even more radical: casting his first vote ever for a Democratic Presidential candidate. Mr. Obremskey, a starting forward on the 1958 Hoosier basketball team that won the Big Ten, says his outrage is not a function of hurt feelings, wounded professional pride or economic self-interest. Instead, he says, by making scapegoats of lawyers the Bush-Quayle campaign is poisoning public perceptions of the profession, polluting jury pools and perverting the judicial process, all to score some cheap and ultimately ephemeral political points. "It's bad for the Republican Party, it's bad for the legal profession and it's bad for the population of this country, because it impacts on the poor bastards I represent," he said. Truth be told, few on the steering committee actually like the anti-lawyer fulminations. "They were painting with a broader brush than they needed to," said John C. Shepherd of St. Louis, a past president of the American Bar Association. Another in the association's huge stable of former presidents, Eugene Thomas of Boise, Idaho, said the Republican standard-bearers had been "misadvised." To Mr. Obremskey, these lawyers represent fat cats -- the fat cats at the receiving end of personal injury lawsuits -- and can afford to be forgiving. "They don't deal with people who get run over and maimed," he said. "It's the little guy who's affected by this anti-lawyer propaganda." His partner and fellow trial lawyer, Kent Frandsen, says he feels the same way, though for him the subject is more painful. Mr. Frandsen's late father, G. Kent Frandsen, a one-time judge and director of admissions at the Indiana University Law School in Indianapolis, officiated at the Quayles' wedding ceremony. And it was the senior Mr. Frandsen who had to field the barrage of questions about just how someone with the mediocre grades and low test scores of Mr. Quayle got into law school. The experience was so stressful, his son believes, that it led his father, a healthy 61-year-old, to suffer a fatal heart attack within days of the 1988 election. He "always had a special place in our hearts," says the handwritten note from the Vice President hanging on Kent Frandsen's office wall. But the younger Mr. Frandsen said his father would be "disappointed" to hear Dan Quayle engaging in anti-lawyer diatribes. Mr. Obremskey was more blunt: "He'd turn over in his grave." Mr. Obremskey said he still liked Mr. Quayle and did not think he actually believed everything he said. He suggests that the Vice President, like the caddies on the Ulen links, is carrying someone else's clubs. "By upbringing and because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Dan Quayle's natural inclination is ultra-conservative," Mr. Obremskey said. "But he's just a puppy dog. He's become a tool of the far right and a pawn of big business."

1352-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail; Clinton's Invited Guests Hope to Bash Arkansas
"Washington, come on down!" That was Mr. Clinton's invitation to Washington insiders, especially those in the Bush Administration, when he delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention in July. "We took one of the poorest states in America and lifted it up," the Governor said. "So I say to all of those in this campaign season who would criticize Arkansas, come on down, especially if you're from Washington." The price is right. They're coming. Today and tomorrow. There'll be a half-dozen or more of them, top Republican officials like Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin, Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, Samuel K. Skinner, the general chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Michael R. Deland, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. They're all primed to traipse the length and breadth of Arkansas, painting Mr. Clinton as "the failed Governor of a small state" and ridiculing some of his most repeated campaign boasts: that he has been a great manager, a great environmentalist and a great friend of both labor and industry. " 'Come on down!' These words will live in infamy," predicts a Bush-Quayle campaign flier. Quayle Is Closer To the Action So how is Dan Quayle doing this far, this time around? Through most of the 1988 Presidential campaign, Mr. Quayle was a phantom candidate, the off-trail nominee, showing up in places that time had forgotten. His political profile was rarely higher than the fold of the local paper or the evening news on the local cable channel. And that's the way his handlers wanted it. Because early in the campaign Mr. Quayle suffered from a seemingly incurable case of political foot-in-mouth disease. This year, this far, things are going better for the Vice President. There was considerable speculation that once James A. Baker 3d returned to the White House to run the 1992 Bush-Quayle campaign, much as he ran the 1988 campaign, Mr. Quayle would again be banished to the political outback. Not yet. No love is lost between the men, but Mr. Baker has apparently seen nothing so far that requires such a drastic political demotion. True, Mr. Quayle is seldom seen with the President. True, he is spending much of this week in Idaho, Montana and South Dakota. And true, he is still preaching mostly to groups of the Republican true-believers, bringing them to their feet with his hard-right thundering about family values. But on any given weekend he also shows up on one or more of the nationally televised Sunday news shows, and about every 10 days he unloads a substantive speech in a place like Los Angeles or Washington that zings in the ears of Bill Clinton and Al Gore like a fingernail scraping across a blackboard. Wait! The Video Is Coming Soon Governor Clinton was on his way to Notre Dame the other day to give his version of the family values speech when his aides handed out a news release that said he had been endorsed by the "Official Madonna Fan Club" -- copy of club letter attached. Talk about family values. Here was some grist: The news release was filled with supposed quotations from Mr. Clinton based on titles of Madonna songs and movies, complete with boldface highlighting. Like: "I just want to thank my lucky stars. I think this endorsement sends a loud and clear message to the Bush-Quayle campaign: Poppy don't preach." Out came the laptops computers. Tap. Tap. Tap. In fact, the 10,000-member Madonna fan club has endorsed Mr. Clinton, seeing him as the true standard bearer of family values, according to Robert Del Vecchio, the club's director. But the rest of the news release was just fun and games. Any other day, given a good night's sleep and a hot meal, the red flag of skepticism would have gone up among the weary reporters traveling with the campaign. But this day some of them actually wrote articles. Blame Dee Dee Myers, the Governor's campaign press secretary and self-described material girl.

1353-> John Sturges, Film Director, Is Dead at 82
John Sturges, the director of action films like "The Magnificent Seven," "The Great Escape," "Gunfight at the O K Corral" and "Ice Station Zebra," died on Tuesday at French Hospital, near his home in San Luis Obispo, Calif. He was 82 years old. He died of emphysema, said Roberta Soules, his sister-in-law. Mr. Sturges's movies were often mean and muscular and celebrated situations involving tough men in desperate situations. He gave starring roles to Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn in "The Magnificent Seven" in 1960 and "The Great Escape"in 1963. Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine earned wide recognition in "Bad Day at Black Rock," for which Mr. Sturges was nominated for an Academy Award for direction in 1955. In an article in The New York Times in 1975, the novelist Wallace Markfield wrote that Mr. Sturges loved "exploiting the plain, pure physicality of hard, marred men doing difficult jobs." Mr. Sturges directed more than 40 documentary films when he was in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He enjoyed making movies about the war and once said they were about "why our side won." One of his war films, the last movie he directed, was "The Eagle Has Landed" in 1977, starring Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that it was "a good old-fashioned adventure movie that is so stuffed with robust incidents and characters that you can relax and enjoy it without worrying whether it actually happened or even whether it's plausible." The movie, set in 1943, concerns the efforts of German commandos to kidnap Winston Churchill and carry him back to Berlin. The director's other credits include "The Old Man and the Sea" in 1958, with Spencer Tracy, and the feature-length 1945 documentary "Thunderbolt." Mr. Sturges was born in Oak Park, Ill., and attended Marin Junior College near San Rafael, Calif. He joined RKO-Radio Pictures in 1932 in the blueprint and editing departments. After the war, he returned to Hollywood and made his debut as a director in 1946. His first two pictures were "Shadowed" and "The Man Who Dared." He is survived by his wife, Katherine, of San Luis Obispo; a daughter, Deborah Wyle, and a son, Michael, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.

1354-> HOCKEY; A Nail-Biting But Winning Brooks Debut
Except for a brief period late in the second period and early in the third, the Devils looked marvelous tonight, what with their new uniforms, with John MacLean back and with Herb Brooks making his debut as their coach. The white, red and black uniforms appeared to be more intimidating than the white, red and green the Devils wore in their first 10 years at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. What was more intimidating for the Islanders, however, was the Devils' speed and the way they erupted for three quick goals early in the second period en route to a 4-3 triumph in the National Hockey League opener for both teams. MacLean was showered with affection by the crowd in his first official game back since April 1991, but the loudest cheers came on the goals by Scott Stevens, Bobby Holik, Aleksandr Semak and Zdeno Ciger. For those unfamiliar with the Devils, the team people often call the United Nations of the N.H. L., Semak is a Russian and Holik and Ciger are Czechoslovaks. Islanders Score First It was the Islanders who first intimidated the Devils by opening the scoring with a short-handed goal from Bill Berg. The home team took control immediately afterward, though, and scored the next four goals. "We had a lapse there for a while and it cost us," Coach Al Arbour of the Islanders said about the quick goals by the Devils, three of which came in just over four minutes. Stevens started the onslaught by tying the game during the first power play for the Devils, and Holik put the Devils in the lead on their second manpower advantage. Semak, the diminutive but elusive center, made it 3-1 unassisted by using as a screen Darius Kasparaitis, the Islanders' Lithuanian defenseman. Ciger's goal that extended the lead to three with 4:43 left in the second period was a crowd-pleaser. Ciger weaved through the Islanders with speed in the neutral zone and passed to Aleksei Kasatonov the moment he entered the Islanders' zone. Kasatonov saw Ciger take off for the goal and returned the puck to Ciger for the backhander that beat Glenn Healy from close range. Derek King's goal with four seconds left in the second and Marty McInnis's goal 1 minute 45 seconds into the third period brought life to the Islanders, but that was the closest they could come against Chris Terreri, who made 31 saves. "We didn't have the flow we had earlier," Brooks said about the Islkanders' comeback. "We lost our sync." Said MacLean: "Yeah, we let them come back to make it close, but the bottom line is they never got the tying goal and we won." No Pain for MacLean MacLean said he felt relief to get his first official game back "under my belt." He said he felt no pain in his reconstructed right knee. MacLean played on a line with the team's two Russian forwards, Semak at center and Valery Zelepukin and left wing. It was in a preseason game against the Islanders last year that MacLean tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The injury required reconstructive surgery that forced him to miss the entire season, but, judging from the way he played tonight, he showed no aftereffects of the injury. MacLean will be wearing a brace on his right knee. Brooks also made a return of sorts in an official league game. It was the first N.H.L. game for Brooks since April 1988, when he coached the Minnesota North Stars. He replaced Tom McVie as coach of the Devils in June after coaching the Devils' minor league team at Utica, N.Y., last season. SLAP SHOTS VLADIMIR MALAKHOV, the Russian defenseman, missed the game for the Islanders with a pulled muscle in his groin, and he is expected to also miss Thursday's game at Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday. . . . The Devils have agreed to a new contract that calls for one year plus an option year for SLAVA FETISOV, the Russian defenseman.

1355-> CYCLING; LeMond Bids for Elusive Title
In Europe, where cycling ranks with soccer and track and field as the major sports, Greg LeMond is a hero. He is the only American to have won the world's most famous race, the Tour de France, and he has done it three times. In the United States, Greg LeMond is an aberration -- a star, but in a sport regarded by Americans as minor. Yet he has never won America's most important bicycle race, the Tour Du Pont, finishing 28th in 1989, 78th in 1990 when he had a blood disorder and 12th last year when he was still weak from the flu. This year's Tour Du Pont will begin Thursday with a prologue time trial. It has attracted 12 professional and 3 national amateur teams, each with 7 riders. LeMond will ride for the French team Z (pronounced zed). The 11-day stage race will cover 1,000 miles. It will start here, wind through Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia and end in front of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington. It is 150 miles shorter than last year's race, but there are more mountain courses. The favorites include LeMond, of Wayzata, Minn., and his teammate, Atle Kvalsvoll of Norway. They also include Gianni Bugno of Italy, the world champion, and Laurent Fignon of France, who ride for Gatorade-Chateau d'Ax of Italy, plus Alexi Grewal of Jamestown, Colo., and Mike Engleman of Boulder, Colo., who ride for the American team Coors Light. LeMond has been America's best road racer for more than a decade. At 5 feet 9 inches, he weighs 152 pounds, 5 pounds heavier than his usual. He will become 31 years old in June, and there are touches of gray at the temples. Biggest Earner in Cycling He is by far the biggest earner in the sport. His salary is $1.9 million, and total income, including endorsements, appearances and royalties, reaches $4.5 million. But the boyish enthusiasm remains. So does his obsession with the Tour de France, in which he struggled and finished a disappointing seventh last summer. "I'd love to win here," he said today, "and I'm hoping to finish in the top 10. I'm not sure I'm in good enough shape to win, but I'm better than in the past. Last year, I was happy to finish each day. "I have not lost the hunger to win any race. If anything, I've gained more motivation. But anything before the Tour de France is a training race for it. At the same time, you don't put on the brakes. When you're young, you have the mental capacity for a lot of races. When you grow older, you realize you have to steer your energy. This is not the Tour de France. I'm not going to be shattered if I don't win this race." Unrelenting Dedication From late February to September, when he races in Europe, LeMond, his wife and their three children live mostly in their home in Belgium. Then they return to their home in the Minneapolis suburbs. He trains almost every day. For example, in the last five days he trained on the road for 31/2 , 21/2 , 5, 5 and 4 hours. "That's not considered a lot," he said, almost in apology. With that dedication and his gregarious nature, LeMond is a darling of cycling crowds everywhere. Last year, after a stage of the Tour Du Pont, a man walked up to him and held out 25 photographs of him. "Please sign them," he said. "I want to give them to cycling friends for Christmas." LeMond patiently signed them. The next day, the man stood near the finish line. "Greg LeMond pictures," he said, "personally autographed. Only $25 each." He sold them all. BIKE SPOKES GREG ORAVETZ of Boulder, Colo., who led this race for three days last year, withdrew Wednesday after he aggravated a lower-back injury during training Tuesday. He was replaced on the Coors Light team by DAVID FARMER of Philadelphia. The United States amateur team lost two riders when BOB MIONSKE of Madison, Wis., contracted bronchitis and JOHN LIESWYN of Gainesville, Fla., broke a collarbone Sunday in a race. They have been replaced by JONAS CARNEY of Allandale, N.J., and CHANN McRAE of Plano, Tex.

1356-> In Big Re-election Fight, Glenn Tests Hero Image
For 16 years, Senator John Glenn, space man and movie hero, was the untouchable icon of Ohio politics. But then came the Keating Five scandal, a souring public mood against Congress and now a blistering political advertising campaign characterizing him as another Senate hack. As a result, Mr. Glenn is facing the first serious re-election challenge of his career. His Republican opponent, Lieut. Gov. Michael DeWine, is well financed, articulate and aggressive. But as he tours the state, Mr. Glenn is reaching once more into the well of good will that he earned as a Mercuryastronaut, and he appears to be breaking into a lead. Touring a Ford plant outside Cleveland on Tuesday, the Democratic Senator donned an auto workers jacket, shook hands with everyone in sight and promised to resist vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, which he said would cost jobs. 'He's Been Around Too Long' But crowds of workers came to him without prompting, in a flight of nostalgia so distracting they virtually halted production for more than an hour. Mr. Glenn kicked the tires and tugged at the radiator hose of a new van model as if preparing for another test flight. "Ain't nothing like this happen around here before!" exclaimed Sharon Wallace, a 40-year-old assembly line worker. "I remember watching him circle the Earth on television when I was in fifth grade." Republican prospects to pick up the Senate seat lie with the hope that 30 years after he climbed into the Mercurycapsule, many voters do not identify with his adventure and those who do will not believe it is as relevant as their desire to change Congress. "He's been around too long," said David T. Evans, executive chairman of the Gallia County Republican Party. Mr. DeWine hopes to cut Mr. Glenn down to size with a withering attack campaign that mocks the Senator with the stock speech quip: "What on earth has John Glenn done?" To answer his own question, Mr. DeWine is spending heavily on a television advertising campaign that suggests that Mr. Glenn's role in the Keating Five thrift scandal and a lingering $3 million 1984 Presidential campaign debt make him unfit to serve in the Senate. The most visible DeWine advertisement displays a photograph of Mr. Glenn side by side with a photograph of Charles Keating wearing jailbird numbers across his chest. "Glenn first said he only took $34,000 from jailed S.& L. kingpin Charles Keating, but later admitted he collected over $200,000," says a narrator. "After 18 years in the Senate, now Glenn wants six more? That's why it's time for a change." 'Exercised Poor Judgment' The facts in the advertisements are incomplete and have long been known. An independent legal counsel for the Senate ethics committee found two years ago that there was no evidence that Mr. Glenn intentionally did anything wrong in the Keating affair. The committee later concluded that the Senator "exercised poor judgment" by organizing a lunch between then-House Speaker Jim Wright and Mr. Keating eight months after the Senator learned of Mr. Keating's legal problems. Nevertheless, some Ohio Democrats say privately they are concerned the Republican attacks could stick in this year of anti-incumbent fever. "The political graveyards are full of people who don't respond," Mr. Glenn said in an interview. Taking his own advice, Mr. Glenn has responded with a few negative spots of his own, including one that notes that Mr. DeWine, during his four terms in Congress, overdrew his House bank account by $13,000. Polls here have been volatile, with one recent survey showing Mr. Glenn ahead by only three points. But other polls show him with a comfortable 15- to 24-point lead. The campaign has boiled down to the perception of Mr. Glenn's image. Is he still the last icon of Camelot, or is he just another politician abusing perks and doing the bidding of the special interests? "Glenn's aura has been diminished somewhat by his problems, but he is still not like other politicians," said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron and a Republican. "The DeWine ads are kind of harsh and people are very tired of the negative advertisements."

1357-> Europe, Backing Germans, Accepts Yugoslav Breakup
In a triumph for German foreign policy, all 12 members of the European Community, as well as Austria and Switzerland, recognized the independence of the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia today. In a series of separate statements, various European governments asserted that the Belgrade Government no longer had a right to rule the two republics. "Slovenia and Croatia have held referendums that showed clearly that their people want independence," a statement issued by the Danish Foreign Ministry said. "It is now time to fulfill the desire their people have expressed." In Belgrade, the Serbian-dominated Government denounced the decision on recognition as "contrary to the sovereign rights of Yugoslavia." The Government said it would continue to function until all six Yugoslav republics reached an agreement on their future relations. But some diplomats said that today's move meant that Yugoslavia had effectively ceased to exist. A Victory for Germany The action by the European Community marked an important diplomatic victory for Germany, which has vigorously supported Slovenian and Croatian independence. German officials announced last month that they would recognize the two republics regardless of the wishes of other European countries, and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher lobbied intensely for the breakup of Yugoslavia. Mr. Genscher said in a radio interview today that he was "very happy" with his success. He asserted that Croatia "has achieved the highest imaginable standard of respect for minority rights." Recognition of Croatia had been jeopardized at the last minute by the release of a European Community report questioning Croatia's commitment to respect the rights of ethnic minorities. The report, prepared by a former French Justice Minister, Robert Badinter, said Croatia should provide constitutional guarantees that human rights and minority rights would be observed. There are 600,000 Serbs among the 4.5 million residents of Croatia, and many of them rose up in rebellion after Croatia declared its independence last year. Croatian fascists slaughtered thousands of Serbs during World War II, and Serbs said they feared they would be victimized again if Croatia became independent. Human-Rights Guarantees President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia was reported to have given last-minute guarantees that the rights of minorities would be respected in a letter to European Community leaders this week. France and Britain, two of the countries that today announced recognition of the breakaway republics, said they would not send ambassadors to Croatia until human-rights issues were resolved. "Implementation of recognition for Croatia presupposes certain conditions," Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France told reporters in Paris after a Cabinet meeting. But the 10 other European Community members said they would proceed swiftly to establish full diplomatic relations with Slovenia and Croatia. Slovenia is at peace, and has for months been functioning as an independent state. But Croatia has been raked by civil war, and one-third of its territory is occupied by Serbian forces. Leaders of Croatia and Slovenia today expressed gratitude for Germany's support. Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel of Slovenia said recognition of his republic's independence was due largely to "the wise policy of the German Government." But Serbian leaders deplored the European Community's decision and singled out Germany for special criticism. Vladislav Jovanovic, the Serbian Foreign Minister, described Germany's role as "particularly negative," and said he regretted that other European Community leaders had decided to follow the German lead. Disconcerted Europeans "It is a very serious precedent to encourage unilateral secession in one multinational state," Mr. Jovanovic said in an interview broadcast on British television. Although most European governments favored eventual recognition of Slovenia and Croatia, some had sought to postpone today's announcement so recognition could be part of an overall peace settlement in the Balkans. But German officials insisted that recognition was the only way to force the Serbs to accept a settlement. Germany's decision to press for quick recognition of the two republics, disregarding appeals from the United States and the United Nations, marked a new assertiveness that some Europeans find disconcerting. "Germany is acting in a highly sensitive psychological environment," said a commentary this week in Bonn's principal newspaper, the General-Anzeiger. "The fear of German dominance and unilateralism has grown." Guardians of Security Foreign Minister Genscher and other German officials say their support for Slovenian and Croatian independence reflects their belief in the principle of self-determination. They also view themselves as guardians of European security in the face of growing instability. "Hanging on to structures that people no longer want raises tension in Europe," Mr. Genscher asserted last month. As recently as a year ago, during the gulf war, Germany was criticized by its Western allies for its reluctance to assert itself on the world stage. But in recent months, German leaders have become convinced that there is a dangerous vacuum in Europe, and they have stepped forward to fill it. Flushed with new self-confidence after unification, they brush aside assertions that they are seeking to rebuild Germany's traditional sphere of influence in central Europe, and insist that their goal is simply to defend democracy and stabilize an increasingly volatile continent. Domestic politics has also played an important role in Germany's decision to press the cause of Slovenian and Croatian independence. Influential Catholic leaders, as well as the predominantly Catholic Christian Social Union, which is part of the ruling coalition, have strongly pressed the Government to defend Slovenia and Croatia. In addition, the 600,000 Croatians who live permanently in Germany have emerged as a highly vocal and effective lobby on behalf of their homeland. After residents of Slovenia and Croatia voted for independence in special referendums, fighting broke out in both republics as the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army sought to prevent them from seceding. The fighting ended quickly in Slovenia, where few Serbs live, but went on to claim thousands of lives and cause great destruction in Croatia. Slovenia and Croatia are predominantly Catholic and have long historic ties to other nations in Central Europe. Much of the rest of what was Yugoslavia is either Orthodox Christian or Muslim, and was for centuries under the rule of Ottoman Turks. With Slovenia and Croatia now independent, the fate of the other republics is in doubt. Serbia and its ally Montenegro have said they will seek to maintain some form of federation, but the other two republics, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, are seeking independence. Age-Old Border Disputes Greece strongly opposes recognition of Macedonia, fearing a renewal of age-old border disputes. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is deeply divided by ethnic and religious hostility, presents the prospect of new factional violence. Many European diplomats are perplexed by the question of under what circumstances their governments should recognize new nations. The European Community is facing decisions not only on Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also on republics of the former Soviet Union. The community's decisions will be closely watched by secession-minded groups in many parts of Europe, including Slovakia, northern Italy, and regions of Spain, France and Belgium. Among the other countries that said they had recognized Slovenia and Croatia or that they would do so on Thursday were Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the Vatican.

1361-> Long Road to a Treatment
It took 13 years, beginning in 1908, for two French researchers, Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, to develop the anti-tuberculosis vaccine now known as bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG. The tubercle bacillus that Dr. Robert Koch discovered in Germany in 1882 grows very slowly in a laboratory, taking three weeks per generation. At the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France, Calmette and Guerin sought to develop a weakened strain of the bacillus that would confer immunity but not the disease. Working with a strain of bovine tuberculosis, they grew a new generation every three weeks, until, on the 39th, they noted a strain that was no longer virulent in laboratory animals. It took years to prove that the weakened strain did not revert to a virulent form. On the 231st generation, the bovine strain was first used to immunize a child whose mother died in childbirth of tuberculosis. In the initial attempts BCG was swallowed; later, it was injected into the skin. Throughout the world, laboratories made their own BCG from strains sent from France. However, the daughter vaccines were not standardized. Thus, there is no single bacteriologically identical BCG. "All the BCG's marketed in the world differ in every way we can make them" said Dr. George W. Comstock, an expert in BCG at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "It is more correct to speak of BCG's, not BCG."

1362-> House Inquiry Is Expanded Into Research Overcharges
The investigation into universities' overcharging the Federal Government for scientific research that began at Stanford University has widened to include not only dozens of other major research universities but also contractors for two Government agencies and the officials who negotiate the research contracts. Government officials told the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations today that the universities -- including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard Medical School -- had overbilled the Federal Government millions of dollars in inappropriate expenses. In a turnaround of sorts, officials from the General Accounting Office accused auditors for the Office of Naval Research and the Department of Health and Human Resources with laxity and complacence throughout the last decade, saying the auditors had approved without proper scrutiny millions of dollars worth of questionable billings at more than 600 universities. Rear Adm. William C. Miller, chief of the Naval Research Office, conceded that his agency sometimes had not done a good job for taxpayers in accounting for indirect research costs over the last decade. But he said the Naval Investigative Service was looking into bringing criminal charges against individuals at three universities involved in research cost overbillings: Stanford, M.I.T and the University of Hawaii. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation at Stanford. Rules Changed, Universities Say Officials at research universities, including those cited today, contend that although university accountants made some errors, the large numbers cited by Federal auditors reflect unfair changes in Government rules that disqualified many costs allowed previously. The chairman of the subcommittee, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said for the first time that the investigations into overbilling had spread outside the research universities. The National Academy of Sciences, a nonprofit organization that sponsors research, had been audited, he said. And Mr. Dingell said the subcommittee is now auditing a major contractor, CH2M Hill, based in Denver, in connections with research charges on consulting work done for the Environmental Protection Agency's toxic waste cleanup program. Company officials said they believed that their billing had been appropriate but that they were prepared to make good on any overcharges that might be uncovered. The subcommittee is also directing audits of the Department of Energy's weapons research and production contractors and the overhead costs that they charge the Government. Government Failure Cited Mr. Dingell said there has been a widespread failure of Government responsibility, sending a signal to university officials and others doing business with the Government that "the Federal Government is going to let anybody steal anything they wanted to." This was the third hearing on university research costs since March 1991. University research projects are financed two ways. The direct costs of salaries and laboratory supplies are paid for in a Government research grant. Then the university charges a supplementary rate to recover some percentage of overhead cost, such as for use of the library, electricity and administrative services. These are called indirect costs, and problems arise because the indirect cost rate is negotiated independently with each university that does federally sponsored research, and because some universities have been either careless or overly aggressive in calculating the indirect costs. The Defense Contract Audit Agency, which works with the Office of Naval Research and others, has completed audits of 22 universities and expects to complete another 20 by the summer. Auditors said at today's hearing that they had determined that Stanford owes the Government $231 million for overbillings for 1981 through 1988. Stanford's total indirects costs during that time came to about $600 million. Among the other questionable billings uncovered by auditors were these: *$19 million at M.I.T., including $23,012 for hotel rooms, meals and alcohol for a biology department retreat, *$44,000 in overseas travel for Carnegie Mellon University, including a cruise down the Nile River, *$11,295 for a St. Patrick's Day party at Syracuse University, *$6.4 million in overcharges for two years of indirect costs at Pennsylvania State University, including $15,000 for promotions at the Hershey Amusement Park. *$736,000 in unallowable transactions at Berkeley, including the cost of 150 football tickets for potential donors. Kenneth D. Campbell, a spokesman for M.I.T., said some billings were unfairly represented. For example, he said the biology department retreat was a legitimate expense because the 25 professors attending spoke for 30 minutes apiece about their latest research projects. He agreed, however, that the costs for alcohol should not have been included.

1363-> U.S. NAMES ENVOYS TO FIVE REPUBLICS
The Bush Administration has selected candidates to be United States ambassadors to five of the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union. The State Department has been scrambling to establish diplomatic relations with the 11 republics that emerged, along with Russia, from the final collapse of the Soviet Union in December. Some of the new capitals had even been off limits to American officials when they were part of the Soviet Union. All of the designated ambassadors, who must be confirmed by the Senate, are Foreign Service officers. All five have backgrounds in Slavic studies. The candidate chosen to be the Ambassador to Ukraine is Roman Popadiuk, the deputy press spokesman of the White House, who is 42 years old. He was born in a displaced persons camp in Austria of Ukrainian parents who were taken to Germany during World War II as forced laborers. A Waiting Embassy in Kiev An embassy building and housing will be waiting for him in Kiev, where there was previously a United States consulate. But no American mission existed in the other four republics until Monday, when State Department advance teams raised American flags in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; Yerevan, Armenia; Bishkek (formerly Frunze), Kyrgyzstan; and Minsk, Belarus, to signify that their embassies were formally opened. The nominee for Belarus, formerly Byelorussia, is David H. Swartz, 51, who served previously in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and speaks Russian and Ukrainian. Edward Hurwitz, 60, has been chosen for Kyrgyzstan, formerly Kirghizia. He was recently the senior United States diplomat in neighboring Afghanistan and is familiar with central Asia. He has also served in the Soviet Union and speaks Russian. Another specialist in Soviet affairs, William H. Courtney, 47, has been selected Ambassador to Kazakhstan. Mr. Courtney was a member of the American delegation to the conference on arms reductions in Geneva and Administration officials said his experience in arms control would be especially useful in Kazakhstan, where numerous nuclear missiles are still deployed. The nominee for Armenia is Nelson Ledsky, 62, whose career has been centered mostly in Europe. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is expected to decide when to open United States Embassies in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan after he visits former Soviet republics next week. -------------------- More U.S. Aid for Baltics RIGA, Latvia, (Reuters), Feb. 6 -- Vice President Dan Quayle pledged extra United States aid worth $18 million today for the three Baltic states and urged the swift withdrawal of Russian troops from their territories. Mr. Quayle reopened embassies in Estonia and Latvia that had been closed since the 1940's and signed agreements for Peace Corps workers to help develop projects in the two republics. Mr. Quayle is scheduled to visit Lithuania on Friday.

1364-> On the Street; Snow or Faux, Clothes Make The City Skier
Designer ski clothes are emerging in Central Park with even the lightest dusting of snow. On a recent single-digit-temperature Sunday, with only an inch of fresh snow over the frozen lake, skiers promenaded and bikers made tracks under the lake's Bow Bridge. A week ago, snow-making machines were enlisted to turn part of the park's Great Lawn into a winter carnival that soon became a trampled mudhole. But that didn't stop the fashion parade. There were sleek black one-piece ski suits, velvet ski jackets trimmed in gold beads, colorful parkas and coats in American Indian patterns. There was just enough snow to build a minisnowman or a snowball for a traditional battle, but it was still fun.

1365-> NEW YORK REPORT FINDS DRUG ABUSE RIFE IN SHELTERS
Eighty percent of the homeless men housed in New York City's vast armory shelters and 30 percent of the adults in shelters for families use drugs or alcohol, most commonly cocaine, , an extensive survey by a mayoral commission has found. This is the first survey of the homeless in city shelters to include widespread urine testing as well as face-to-face interviews in which the residents were questioned about drug and alcohol abuse. What emerged was a portrait of a far more troubled population than had previously been documented. Only a minority of the homeless needed just housing to get back on their feet, the survey found. New Agency Is Sought In addition to extensive drug and alcohol use, the survey found, the city's homeless are hobbled by interwoven afflictions: extreme poverty, mental illness, AIDS, domestic violence and lack of education and job skills. The survey, which tested and interviewed about 1,000 of the city's 15,500 adult shelter residents, was conducted over three weeks for a mayoral commission studying the problems of the city's shelter system. Citing the new evidence, the commission, headed by Andrew Cuomo, is calling for a complete overhaul of the city's efforts, including a new agency or authority to run the system, more small shelters with specialized services and new rules that would give permanent housing only to those who successfully complete treatment or training, depending on the need. The commission's 118-page report was delivered to Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday. A copy was obtained by The New York Times. A mayoral spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said Mr. Dinkins was pleased that the commission had "reaffirmed" the Mayor's advocacy of smaller, service-enriched shelters. He said Mr. Dinkins wanted to study the creation of a new agency to run the system "to test the theory against the reality and see if it's the best way to go." Mr. Dinkins will meet with the commission chairman, Mr. Cuomo, on Tuesday, and will probably release the report on Wednesday, Mr. Jones said. Mr. Cuomo, who runs a nonprofit group that operates shelters for families and who is the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, declined to comment on the report until the Mayor had a chance to review it. The commission's survey found differing drug use among various segments of the homeless population. The urine testing was anonymous and voluntary. Such testing generally detects drug use in the previous three days. No one was paid to participate, the report said. Previous Surveys Over all, urinalysis of 525 men in an array of shelters, including smaller ones for people with special needs, found that 65 percent of them tested positive for alcohol or drugs, mainly cocaine. In the large barracks-style shelters, the incidence was even more common: Fully 80 percent of the men there had drugs or alcohol in their systems, again mostly cocaine. Another 495 adults, mainly women in family shelters, were tested. In the family shelters that offered more services and privacy, drug or alcohol use was 26 percent, compared with 34 percent in the large congregate shelters. As in the shelters for homeless single people, cocaine was overwhelmingly the substance detected through urine testing. Previous research that relied on interviews had suggested that drugs were not so pervasive. A recent survey conducted for the city found that only 18 percent of the adults in singles shelters said they were using drugs, though officials said at the time that they believed that figure underestimated the problem. In analyzing the new data, the commission cautioned that there was tremendous diversity within the population of drug users. Some are addicted and will require long-term residential rehabilitation, while others need outpatient care, acupuncture or methadone, the panel said. For yet others, the report said, drug use is a symptom, not a cause, of homelessness, which can be traced to a knot of problems including poverty and lack of skills, as well as the general evaporation of decent-paying manufacturing jobs in the New York region. The report noted that some of the homeless appeared to have had a drug problem before they entered the system. But others appeared to have become ensnared once they were in the shelters, which have become notorious as dangerous places where drugs are often sold openly. George McDonald, an advocate for the homeless and one of the three commissioners who drafted the report, said yesterday that the bleakness and violence of the armories, like Fort Washington in upper Manhattan, had contributed to the high levels of crack abuse among homeless men who often spend years in such shelters. "They do it out of despair and desperation and the utter hopelessness of the situation," he said. "They feel worthless." Already, the highlights of the commission's recommendations, which were disclosed by some commissioners two weeks ago, have drawn praise from elected officials including City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and the Borough Presidents of Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx. But the highlights were criticized by members of the Dinkins administration -- including Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales, who said he was not convinced that the commission's ideas would work. Since then, Mr. Dinkins has said the recommendations intrigue him. Mayor's View Mr. McDonald said yesterday that the Mayor had told him that he "would be surprised by the consensus" for the commission's recommendations within his administration. In its report, the 22-member commission harshly criticized the city's current shelter system as an exorbitantly expensive failure that fosters dependency rather than helping the homeless overcome their often crippling problems. In particular, the commission assailed "the absurd waste and inhumanity" of the armories, where the city's Human Resources Administration spends $18,000 a year for a single man to sleep on a cot in a room with 900 other men. The commission's report calls the $53,000 a year that city spends to keep a family in a barracks-style shelter where they have little or no privacy and few services "simply another expensive handout." "The system was not, and is not, designed to empower a family to escape persistent poverty and dependence on government programs," the report stated. The survey found that the typical family in the shelter system was headed by a young black or Hispanic woman with a very young child. Typically, the mothers themselves had grown up in families on welfare. One in five had been physically or sexually abused. One in 10 had spent time in foster care. Almost one-third of the families had never had an apartment of their own and more than a third had no high school diploma and had not worked in the last year. Four of 10 families had either a mental health or drug abuse problem. The commission called homeless single men and women "a forgotten population." While the city has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading its system for families, homeless single people -- possibly an even needier population -- have been relegated to dangerous shelters with almost no services. "It is not enough to provide only 'shelter' to these vulnerable and troubled individuals," the report said. "Many of them need significant social services and medical attention." Of homeless single people, 94 percent were minorities, half had served time in jail and one-fifth had been homeless for five years or more. For these men, the commission advocated expanding the use of programs modeled on the Federal Job Corps, which provides education, training and counseling. The commission counseled the Mayor to modify the new plan for homeless men and women that he proposed last October. The Mayor's plan, which called for the city to build and nonprofit groups to run 24 small, specialized shelters in mainly middle-income residential neighorhoods, ran into strong opposition from elected officials and city residents afraid to live near the homeless. Instead, the commission advocated that nonprofit groups build and operate the new programs. Drug-treatment centers would probably not be placed in residential neighborhoods but in commercial or mixed-use areas or outside the city entirely, the report said. The commission contended that private agencies could do the job better and more efficiently, while specialized programs would help the city qualify for more Federal funds to pay for drug treatment and job training. The cost savings and increased revenues would mean that the city could provide more services to the homeless and build 5,400 units of emergency and permanent housing -- 50 percent more than the Mayor had proposed -- at the same $280 million cost as the Mayor's beleaguered five-year plan. The commission said its approach would allow the city to pay for 1,100 more drug- and alcohol-treatment slots and 763 more permanent units. The commission also contended that the city should ask more of the homeless themselves, even as it provides them with enriched services. To address concerns that families living doubled up have declared themselves homeless as a way to obtain subsidized permanent housing, the commission would require the homeless to document their poverty and lack of housing alternatives before being granted shelter. Now such requirements are not generally enforced. The commission also would require the homeless to complete treatment or training programs before placing them in permanent housing or providing them with a voucher to obtain housing in the open market.

1366-> New Yorkers, etc.
There's always been a line drawn in the matter of personal questions, but it seems, as the years go by, that not only is it getting fainter but, for many, it's become invisible. It's being breached by the thoughtless, the ignorant and the arrogant who assume that literally nothing is sacred, no matter how private or intimate. These people believe that they have a right to know whatever they wish about another person, and that this leaves them free to ask anything that might assuage their curiosity. Not long ago, it was considered beyond the pale to ask a friend or acquaintance the cost of an apartment or to inquire about salary. It's still considered bad form, but it's not beyond the pale. As almost anyone who owns an apartment can testify, there is little hesitation in asking what was paid for an apartment ("and what's the maintenance?") or, if it's applicable, what the rent is. But money matters are in a sense benign compared with some of the extraordinarily personal questions and comments that now occasion little surprise. Which doesn't mean these questions are approved of, or liked. It simply means they're no longer unusual. Most pregnant women have discovered that a swelling abdomen almost invites certain queries and actions, even by virtual strangers. "People feel they can take certain liberties with you, almost as though you're in the public domain," said Laurie Sprayregen, now pregnant with her second child. "They wouldn't normally ask you how much you weigh but they immediately ask how much weight you've put on. Then, right after my son, Jimmy, was born, they asked, 'When are you having the next one?' That isn't what you want to even think about at that time." But both are infinitely preferable (if a choice must be made) to two other ubiquitous questions. "Do you plan to have children?" is usually addressed to the recently married. "Was it planned?" is directed at the obviously pregnant. And the latter question is preferable to the laying-of-hands-on-stomach by the barest of acquaintances, generally women who seem to believe that the gesture is always expected and welcomed. Childless couples hear a refrain of "didn't you want children?" In the mind of the questioner, this may be the tactful version of "weren't you able to have children?" An exchange overheard at a recent cocktail party carried it one step further: "You don't have any children?" "No." "And you don't have a dog?" There was no reply. The childless one looked stupefied. Remarks familiar to widows and, to a slightly lesser extent, widowers, are generally made by well-meaning people with the best will in the world. One of the most common is very often the last thing the bereaved one wants to discuss: "How did he (or she) die?" Within weeks or sometimes days after this, there's "when are you going to sell your apartment (or house)?" Even when worded slightly differently for renters, this carries the same unspoken message: you don't need as much room now. "Change is the one thing you don't want to think about when tragedy strikes," said Carol Dudley Katzka, whose husband, Gabriel, a motion picture producer, died two years ago. "As a matter of cold fact, women especially are nesters and they don't want to think in terms of making a major move. And if the question is addressed to someone who must for economic reasons sell the house or apartment, it can be very painful." What usually follows "when are you going to move" is "are you dating?" Depending on the sensibility of questioner, this query rarely waits for six months or a year to elapse. "Dating is a terrible word to begin with," Mrs. Katzka said. "Sometimes you want to say, 'why are you asking such a stupid question?' But you don't want to hurt feelings because they mean well." It's not that a man or woman whose spouse has died isn't interested in eventually meeting someone, she said, but there are more subtle ways of asking about and arranging such a meeting. Pat Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Women's Project, an organization that promotes women producers and playwrights in the theater, probably hit the ultimate intrusive question. She and her husband, Gerald, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, were having dinner with another couple when the woman leaned over, carefully inspected Mrs. Schoenfeld's face and said "Why haven't you had a face lift?" "It was so outrageous I couldn't do anything but laugh," Mrs. Schoenfeld said. But she finally collected herself. "You mean you can't tell that I've had one?" she said. The other woman is still wondering -- had she or hadn't she? She hadn't.

1369-> Surgeon General Warns of Smoking in Latin Lands
Latin America and the Caribbean are on the verge of an epidemic of smoking-related disease like the one that has plagued the United States and Canada unless governments work to stem the popularity of cigarettes, the United States Surgeon General said today. Issuing the annual Federal report on the health effects of smoking, the Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, said the threat required coordinated action among all countries. While 80 percent of the 526,000 smoking-related deaths each year in the Americas occur in the United States and Canada, she said, Latin America is primed to be the "growth" region for cigarette-related disease as disproportionate numbers of young people and women take up the habit. The report said the popularity of smoking in Latin America was more sensitive to price than in North America, and the per capita consumption of cigarettes in Latin America declined in the 1980's because of economic recession. But health officials fear that the incidence of smoking will start rising as economic conditions improve, Dr. Novello said. "It seems to us this is the perfect window of opportunity now to take action," she said at a news briefing. "Knowing these facts, it is our hope that hemisphere neighbors, poised to follow the same path, can avert the death and disease that inevitably result from tobacco use." Smoking's prevalence in Latin America is 37 percent for men and 20 percent for women, Dr. Novello said, compared with 30 percent for men and 25 percent for women in the United States. But in some urban areas in Latin America, 50 percent of youths smoke, and the rate among women, particularly young women, is also rising rapidly, she said. Dr. Novello's report called for systematic studies to determine how many people smoke in Latin America, how smoking is viewed culturally, how tobacco is produced and consumed and how taxation and legislation might be used to curb smoking. Among the things that account for some of the rising popularity of smoking in Latin America, it said, are advertising, urbanization, growing population, improving education and the entrance of more women into the workforce. If considering the economic effects of the growth and sale of tobacco, the report said, Latin nations should note that health costs associated with smoking will far exceed the benefits. Joining Dr. Novello at the briefing, the director of the Pan American Health Organization, Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, said governments must give a higher priority to controlling tobacco. He called for international studies, with assistance from the United States, to help the extent of the problem and a commitment to keep smoking from becoming epidemic. In a separate report, the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said surveys of teen-age smokers showed they chose the most heavily advertised brands when they took up cigarettes. The agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that survey findings indicated smokers aged 12 to 18 preferred Marlboro, Camel or Newport cigarettes, the three most heavily advertised brands. Adult smokers also made Marlboro their first choice, followed by Winston and Salem. But adults smoked a wide variety of other brands, the report said. The report noted that the preference for Camel jumped noticeably the year after the beginning of an advertising campaign featuring a cartoon camel, "Old Joe." On Monday, Dr. Novello called on the makers of Camel cigarettes to end their ad campaign featuring the character because studies suggested that it might encourage children to start smoking, a charge the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company denied. Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, an industry group, said it was not extraordinary that younger smokers chose the most popular brands since adults did also. The industry does not encourage teen-age smoking, he said, but there is no evidence that advertising dictates who starts smoking and when. After people start smoking, he added, advertising influences brand choice.

1372-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; European Channel Takes a Stab at CNN
Spawning the latest of CNN's international clones, a dozen state-backed European television stations have decided to create an all-news satellite channel that should begin broadcasting in five languages early next year. Euronews, as it is to be called, has been under discussion for more than a year, but the final approval came last week when its Geneva-based directors chose Lyons, France, as the station's headquarters. Hoping to reach an initial audience of some 23 million viewers with programs in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, Euronews makes no secret that it aims to provide a European perspective on the news as an alternative to the American view provided by the Cable News Network. Planning for the channel was given a strong impetus during the Persian Gulf war last year when, along with much of the rest of the world, European television stations found themselves dependent on CNN for much of their news coverage. With an annual budget of around $50 million, Euronews will receive half of its financing from participating television stations -- Antenne 2 and FR3 of France, RAI of Italy, ARD and ZDF of Germany, RTVE of Spain and other state-owned stations in Belgium, Greece, Finland, Monaco, Yugoslavia and Egypt. The European Community has agreed to provide a quarter of the budget for five years, while the balance will come from advertising and sponsorships. The new channel also has the backing of the powerful European Broadcasting Union, which formed a holding company called Euronews Development. Euronews hopes to manage with a staff of only about 200, including 50 journalists, because its images will be provided by the 39 stations in the European Broadcasting Union. Distribution will be by satellite, at first only to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. But Euronews will also be available on cable television in many European countries. Each country will normally receive the same image, but with a "voice over" narration in its own language. Tough Competition The competition, though, will be stiff. Already, viewers in much of Western Europe can watch programs from neighboring countries via cable. Also, the CNN format has been borrowed for 24-hour news in English by Sky News of Britain and for the Spanish-language news by Galavision, which is owned by the Televisa network of Mexico. Furthermore, while the British Broadcasting Corporation now telecasts a single news and entertainment television channel by satellite to Europe, its BBC World Service, which focuses heavily on news, has recently expanded from radio to television in Asia. Several European broadcasting groups are also contemplating all-news channels for domestic viewers.

Good things have been scarce for Manhattan in the last 10 years. The Jaspers had just one winning season and lost at least 20 games five times. Nor has Manhattan ever won a M.A.A.C. tournament game. That luck could change on Saturday night at the Knickerbocker Arena, when the Jaspers meet the winner of Friday night's preliminary game between Canisius (8-21) and St. Peter's (7-20) in the quarterfinals. The winner of the tournament earns an automatic bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.

1376-> The House's Tactician of Taxation
Dan Rostenkowski will be leading the fight for the Democrats' middle-class tax cut in the House this week, but that does not mean he expects it to become law. Or even that he necessarily thinks it should be. After all, he consistently said for weeks that the economy would probably be helped more by being left alone and that his bill, and President Bush's, too, are responses to political, not economic, needs. That argument fits the persona the head of the Ways and Means Committee enjoys most, that of the committee chairman who exceeds Washington's expectations, works for a clean tax code and usually seems above partisanship. His friendship with Mr. Bush, which dates from their service together on Ways and Means two decades ago, produces "Dear Danny" letters and brings occassional golf dates. And he complains that these days, "We never quit politicking in the House of Representatives." But don't feel sorry about Mr. Rostenkowski's being forced, as he puts it, by circumstances and other Democratic leaders to fight a party fight. He protests too much. He may not have used his partisan skills much in recent years, but this product of the Chicago organization (Mayor Richard J. Daley decided he would be a Congressman in 1958, and he was) knows the moves instinctively, both in working this tax bill and in dealing with an unexpected and irritating primary challenge back home. In Chicago, Mr. Rostenkowski is scoring political points with a tale of an arrogant Federal Government that wants to move a Social Security center from one neighborhood in his district to another, even though both neighborhoods oppose the change. And he is using his prominence on the tax bill -- "the high visibility of theater that takes place in here" -- to campaign with celebrity status and as an acceptable excuse when he must miss an event. It was his idea to have Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, introduce Mr. Bush's entire tax program with the intention of putting it before the House to show that Republicans would not vote for it. The measure contains some provisions no one in Congress likes, like taxing annuities, and others that even Mr. Bush does not want considered now because of their costs, like a $500 increase in the personal exemption for children. Mr. Rostenkowski then intended to show that Democrats would support his alternative measure, which he said would define "the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans." "We're going to see to it that middle-income Americans have a better tax break," he said. Threat of a Veto But he was hardly surprised on Friday when President Bush threatened to veto the bill, whose two years of tax credits of up to $400 a couple would be paid for through permanent higher rates for upper-income taxpayers. The day before, Mr. Rostenkowski said that the usual process of first insisting that no compromise was possible and later making a deal was unlikely to be followed this year. "I think the President has been emphatic enough about raising marginal tax rates that he's not going to sign anything," Mr. Rostenkowski said in an interview on Thursday. Concerning the bill's appeal, Mr. Rostenkowski discusses that exclusively in terms political rather than substantive. He frequently repeats that the economists his committee heard in December advised inaction, but says: "The one time I agree with the economists, I'm forced to do something other than sit on my fanny and do nothing. The political climate insists that we have something." He moved this bill through his committee faster than usual, with his customary invitation to Democratic colleagues to change it if they wished and his customary show of muscle to defeat their changes. The most innovative challenge Mr. Rostenkowski faced was the idea of taking the $46 billion his two-year middle-class tax credit would cost and replacing it with permanent credits for children, at about $180 a year. Two of his proteges on the Ways and Means committee, Representatives Marty Russo of Illinois and Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, tried that idea out. The chairman assembled the votes to beat them soundly. But when it came to making sure that Democrats would be, if not enthusiastic, at least mollified, Mr. Rostenkowski was ready to give way to the caucus on other points. First, he agreed to add Mr. Bush's accelerated-depreciation provision and another clause to help small businesses buy new equipment and to limit the corporate tax cut to two years. Then, after saying sharply that he would not change anything else, he agreed to drop the corporate cut altogether. There is one difference between this bill and others Mr. Rostenkowski handled recently, and it may be a measure of how seriously the tax bill should be taken as a potential statute as opposed to the political statement the Representative says he was told to make by leaders like Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley and Mr. Gephardt. This bill pays no attention to the 1990 budget act's requirement that any losses in revenue be paid for, year by year, by increases in revenue somewhere else. In theory, the Democrats' bill would raise revenues, taking in $14 billion more in six years through tax increases than it would lose in tax cuts, but that does not meet budget-act requirements that it be revenue neutral. All the defense that Mr. Rostenkowski offers is that Mr. Bush's bills do not balance either, except with slick accounting. But the budget act problem is not going to cost the measure any Democratic votes to speak of this week, and Mr. Rostenkowski, like the party leaders who urged him to provide a platform of fairness in a tax bill, is confident the bill will pass. In his office in the Rayburn House Office Building, distinguished by a quizzical stuffed toy snow leopard, a gift from a wildlife organization, the Ways and Means chairman talked about the bill and its politics animatedly for half an hour. Mr. Rostenkowski kept returning to the question of what was the point of it all if Mr. Bush was simply going to veto the growth package, either in this form or after a House-Senate conference. Mr. Rostenkowski suggested that those who wanted to do nothing, who "stood in the shadows" as he might have preferred, could then say that the right policy objective had been reached. On the way, they could urge both sides, "get all the mileage you can out of your taking care of the middle class, working on fairness, getting growth packages, putting incentives in." But in the end, leave the tax code unchanged. That comes later. This week, the chairman and the leaders must pass the bill. "The worst thing that happens to us is we wind up not passing a bill," Mr. Rostenkowski said. "Then Bush has got free range in his arsenal of criticism. Then he can just throw it at us, and we have no defense: 'They can't get together; they are bickering; they won't see what's in the best interests of the country.' The fact of the matter is I really don't want a bill if I can avoid doing it. But the political climate insists we have something."

1377-> Ukraine Halting A-Arms Shift to Russia
President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine declared today that he was suspending the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia because he had no guarantee that they were being destroyed. Mr. Kravchuk made the unexpected announcement at a news conference in Kiev marking his first 100 days in office, and a week before leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States are to gather for a meeting in the Ukrainian capital. "We ask the West to understand our Government," Mr. Kravchuk said. "As long as there is no guarantee of full destruction, Ukraine will bear no responsibility." He said there was a danger that the weapons "may fall into the wrong hands." He also noted that Ukraine's policy was that weapons transferred from its territory "will never be used, will never make anybody stronger or more powerful than at present." No Evidence Is Cited There was no immediate indication of specific factors behind the decision by Mr. Kravchuk, who cited no evidence that the weapons were not being destroyed. And there was no immediate reaction from Russia, whose President, Boris N. Yeltsin, is on vacation. Before Mr. Kravchuk's announcement, Ukraine had already transferred more than half its tactical weapons to Russia for destruction in accordance with treaties with the United States, and in keeping with Ukraine's stated intention of ridding its territory of all nuclear weapons by 1994. Nuclear warheads for intercontinental missiles based in Ukraine, but left under the joint control of the commonwealth, are also to be transferred to Russia. Mr. Kravchuk said he believed that Russia did not have sufficient capacity to destroy the weapons and that Ukraine had a right to its own weapons-dismantling plant. The Ukrainian leader also asserted that Russia was no longer allowing Ukraine to dispose of its nuclear wastes in Russia. And he suggested that his country could set up its own plants for destroying or reprocessing nuclear weapons near the Chernobyl atomic power station, which is already restricted and contaminated. Mr. Kravchuk made clear that he envisioned the possibility of Western assistance in setting up such a plant, which would help in the maintenance of the Chernobyl plant and provide employment for military-related industries in Ukraine. Tension on Military Issues Mr. Kravchuk's statements came against a background of deepening suspicions between Ukraine and Russia, much of them focused on the former Soviet military. The two republics have butted heads over the Black Sea fleet, over weapons stationed in Ukraine and over Ukraine's insistence on forming its own army. Behind the dispute is not only the power represented by the military but also the commercial value of the weapons. Both Russia and Ukraine have already embarked on sales of ships and other weapons abroad. Mr. Kravchuk's statements suggested several possible motives for his action. One was that he was really concerned that the Ukrainian weapons would end up in the wrong hands or would remain in Russia undestroyed. Another was that he wanted to send a signal before the Kiev summit meeting, at which the question of the army is expected to play a major role. There was also the possibility that Mr. Kravchuk had become wary of the situation in Russia and in the military. Moscow is now bracing for a congress of former Communists and others longing for the former Soviet Union, who are to convene on Tuesday. Officers of the former Soviet Army, for their part, have become increasingly militant in defending their jobs. There was no immediate indication of how the West would respond. But there is certain to be anxiety, since Mr. Kravchuk's move today represents just the sort of maneuvering with nuclear weapons that many in the West have feared.

1378-> Theatrical Director's Calling Card: Sex and Death
Reza Abdoh is back, and more provocative than ever. The enfant terrible of sex and death has created yet another demonic work of experimental theater. By now, though, the "enfant" label is greatly in need of revision. "I'm almost 28," he said on a recent afternoon, as he navigated his way through the moldering elegance of a faded hotel. "If you're still an enfant terrible at that age, well, you're in deep trouble." Mr. Abdoh has transformed the abandoned ballrooms of the Diplomat Hotel in midtown Manhattan into what he terms "a landscape of the mind of the serial killer." The world premiere of his multi-media event, titled "The Law of Remains," was last week on the mezzanine of the Diplomat, 116 West 43d Street. Tickets are available at the door or can be reserved by calling (212) 826-6585 for the show, which will be performed until March 14. In New York, Mr. Abdoh is best remembered for "Father Was a Peculiar Man," the critically praised theatrical event he directed on the streets of the meat-packing district in Manhattan during the summer of 1990. In the drama, very loosely based on "The Brothers Karamazov," audiences were led about the cobblestone streets to witness phantasmagorical tableaux, including a nightmarish outdoor banquet, a mock burial scene and a re-enactment of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In "The Law of Remains," conceived, written and directed by Mr. Abdoh, a cast of 14 actors takes audiences of 130 on a journey to examine what might be described as a festival of depravity. They witness the hallucinogenic story of a character named Jeffrey Snarling, patterned after the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. 'In a Haunted Space' Essential to the production, Mr. Abdoh said, are the evocative ballrooms of the hotel, with their flaking plaster, peeling paint, water-ravaged ceilings and worn marble stair treads. "We had to do this in a haunted space," Mr. Abdoh was saying as he prowled the scuffed parquet of the Diplomat's Crystal Ballroom, a decaying paradise of arching gilt spaces and plaster putti friezes. He gestured to the dusty recesses of the room, which was once alive with big-band sounds, U.S.O. dances and even debutante cotillions. "This is a ghostly place, with the residue of old dreams, passions, loves, laughter," he said. The inspirational text for "The Law of Remains" is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, said Mr. Abdoh, and the dramatic action symbolically traces the soul's cyclical journey from its genesis to its destruction and eventual regeneration. As in Mr. Abdoh's previous presentations, the audience is be treated to a dreamy, fragmented narrative marked by continual shifts in time and place. Onlookers wander from area to area, observing half-glimpsed scenes. In "The Law of Remains," actors portray Rudolf Nureyev, Pee-wee Herman, Connie Francis and President Ronald Reagan, who is costumed as a sultry sex goddess. The plot, such as it is, concerns a group of film makers -- "Andy Warhol and the Factory crowd," said Mr. Abdoh -- "who are making a film about serial killers and the cult of evil personified," he said. The drama's antihero, Jeffrey Snarling, "is a man who is unable to show love except by destroying." To Mr. Abdoh, "The Law of Remains" is an investigation of American pop iconography, "the way in which the media create superstars out of serial killers," he said. "Our culture, and the media, cannibalize the remains of its icons and inhabitants," he said. The drama is a typically extreme Abdohvian experience that "is hardly for the faint of heart," said Diane White, Mr. Abdoh's producer, who has worked with him on four previous works. In "The Law of Remains" there is nudity, there is theatrical murder, simulated stabbings and chain sawings. "People are titillated by serial killers, as well as repulsed," said Mr. Abdoh, adding that "The Law of Remains" "depicts the ecstasy of the American psyche in that glorification of the Dahmers." "It's a high: a drug," he said. Skeptical, Not Celebratory But Mr. Abdoh denied that his drama is glorifying murder, or serial killers. "It looks skeptically at the way in which serial killers are glorified," he said. "This work is about the release of inner demons." Mr. Abdoh looks the part of the classic Artaudian director, with his hollowed, angular face and piercing brown eyes. The Iranian-born Mr. Abdoh came to the United States at the age of 16 and labored creatively to win his enfant-terrible reputation. Once he mounted a performance of "Medea" in a basketball court, and in 1988 he created a drama called "Peep Show" in a sleazy motel in Los Angeles, where theatergoers toured scenes depicting the drug trade, the porn industry and the contras. Mr. Abdoh (whose name rhymes with "show") was born in Teheran, the son of an Iranian boxer-cum-sports entrepreneur and his Italian wife; the family moved to England when he was 7. In Mr. Abdoh's work "there is always a ghost or shadow of the father who at once was comforting and nurturing and at the same time destructive and cruel," he said, adding that he was physically abused by his father. "The Law of Remains" is the last work in what Mr. Abdoh calls "The Bogeyman Trilogy." The first part, "The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice," was performed at the Montreal Festival in June, and the second installment, "Bogeyman," was the last production of the Los Angeles Theater Center before it went out of business in the fall. "Hip-Hop" was a parable of madness and sexual repression; "Bogeyman" was Mr. Abdoh's apocalyptic vision of a world in the throes of the AIDS crisis. Three and a half years ago, Mr. Abdoh said, he tested positive for H.I.V. "It can't help but color my work, the idea of life as a clock ticking," he said. "I don't linger on it, I'm not constantly aware of it, but my work does examine death in life." Conventional Thinking? No, Thanks Mr. Abdoh's work has on occasion been criticized by reviewers as overly self-indulgent. "I have no interest in traditional plot or in creating theater that is sound or well-made," he responded. "It's absurd and archaic to think that theater has to have conventional characters and a conventional form. If some think of this as self-indulgent, well, that's fine." He conceded that his work "is extremely demanding, physically and emotionally, for the actors." Juliana Francis, who has acted in six of Mr. Abdoh's productions, said, "I find it tremendously liberating, though painful at times." In "Bogeyman" she had to work on a 20-foot-high platform and played the archetypal victim, an object of incest, violence and repeated rape. "It's O.K., I had my catharsis and murdered the father at the end," she said cheerfully. New York audiences "may be burned out by the real crises in the city," said Mr. Abdoh, "but I hope that many people will be invigorated by it," he said of "The Law of Remains." "As usual, some will be offended by it. But I hope that others will be inspired."

1379-> Family of War-Crime Suspect Recounts Its Trial by Ordeal
Since his marriage nine years ago to the daughter of John Demjanjuk, Edward Nishnic has been on a single-minded quest to prove that his father-in-law, a retired Cleveland auto worker, was not Ivan the Terrible, the sadistic operator of the gas chamber at the Treblinka death camp. His quest has taken him from Israel, where Mr. Demjanjuk has been convicted of war crimes and sentenced to die, to Poland, the site of Treblinka, and to Ukraine, where he has continued his effort to track down Ivan Marchenko, the man he believes was really Ivan the Terrible. Last week, his search finally showed some signs of success. A Federal appeals court in Cincinnati ordered that Mr. Demjanjuk's appeal of his extradition to Israel be re-examined. The court said Mr. Demjanjuk, a 72-year-old native of Ukraine, may have been wrongly turned over to Israel based on erroneous information. The court ordered the Justice Department to turn over any evidence it had that Mr. Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible and to indicate how long it had had such information. Review by Israel Court And in Israel, the Supreme Court said it was considering recently discovered information that may support Mr. Demjanjuk's assertion that he is the victim of mistaken identity. Mr. Demjanjuk has said that he spent the years in question as a prisoner of war. But prosecutors in Israel say that, even if he was not Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka, there is evidence that he was a guard at other death camps. Whatever the truth, and whatever the outcome, the years of accusations have taken a toll on the Demjanjuk family. Mr. Demjanjuk and his wife, Vera, have used up their savings, remortgaged their home and sold everything they could, including a ride-on lawn mower, to pay their legal costs. Their children's families, too, have been affected. "We're $160,000 in debt, our phone's been disconnected six times in the last eight months, and my wife lost not only her father but her husband to this case," Mr. Nishnic said. "She's been basically a single mom while I worked on this case. At an age when we should be on our second or third house, we're still living in a rental, and sometimes I wonder when we'll be able to have a normal life. But I'm not going to give up until we track down Ivan Marchenko and clear John's name." To that end, Mr. Nishnic, 37, and his brother-in-law, John Demjanjuk Jr., have sorted through dozens of bags of garbage thrown out by Justice Department lawyers, looking for -- and finding -- evidence that the department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, may have suppressed and failed to follow up leads indicating that Mr. Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible, and that Mr. Marchenko, another Ukrainian, was. Mr. Marchenko has not been seen since World War II. Mr. Demjanjuk was stripped of his American citizenship in 1981 after a Justice Department inquiry. Witnesses have identified him as Ivan the Terrible and placed him at camps where the Nazis killed hundreds of thousands of Jews. Finally extradited to Israel in 1986, he was convicted in 1988 on evidence collected by the Justice Department and sentenced to death. Learning the Hard Way Mr. Nishnic, whose higher education consists only of a few courses at Cuyahoga community college, said he had no idea what he was getting into. "We had no money, no help and it was way over my head," he said. "I didn't know anything about the courts or that there was even anything called the Freedom of Information Act, and we were up against superpowers. But it was fascinating to read the trial transcripts." Mr. Nishnic did most of his work in the basement of the tidy suburban home here where Vera Demjanjuk waits to learn her husband's fate. This is also where the family -- Mrs. Demjanjuk, Mr. Nishnic and his wife, Irene, and another Demjanjuk daughter, Lydia, and her family -- have gathered every other Sunday for a telephone conversation with Mr. Demjanjuk, who has been in solitary confinement in Israel for six years. By 1986, the year Mr. Demjanjuk was extradited, Mr. Nishnic was so deeply involved in the case that he quit his sales job to work on it full time. He was joined soon after by John Jr., who quit college to help. Now Mr. Nishnic is supported by his wife's part-time work. Over the years he has, with the help of Ukrainian Americans in Cleveland and elsewhere, raised more than $1 million for his campaign. The first break came quickly, in the form of an anonymous envelope, containing a Justice Department memorandum and sent to his family in Cleveland. Mr. Nishnic, a tall, engaging man, speaks excitedly about the inquiry that followed, like a private investigator describing the chase. "We got a few more after that," he said, "and I thought someone inside the department was leaking them. They told us enough so that it was clear that the Office of Special Investigations had not shared the evidence they had, so I went down to the library and looked up how to file a Freedom of Information request. They didn't answer when they were supposed to, so we had to sue them. I called law firms all over the place, but no one would help us, and then I found a number at the library for a Freedom of Information clearinghouse, which turned out to be a Nader organization, and a woman there talked me through how to do it." Mr. Nishnic did not learn the origin of the anonymous letters until a trip to California to meet other people whose relatives have been investigated by the Nazi-hunting unit. "A young woman came up and asked if I'd been getting my mail and told me to drop by the next time I was in D.C.," he said. "I did, and she showed me her whole garage, filled floor to ceiling with plastic garbage bags. It stunk. Johnny and I put on rubber gloves and coveralls and got down on all fours and sorted through the documents and cigarette butts." Negligence With the Garbage The bags contained garbage taken from the Nazi-hunting unit. Because the unit was not housed in the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington, its garbage was easily retrieved from a nearby bin, Mr. Nishnic said. Last summer, after an investigation of how documents were taken from the unit's garbage, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility said that the papers had been negligently discarded, and that Mr. Demjanjuk's supporters had obtained them legally. The information that Mr. Demjanjuk's supporters found included leads to Soviet documents indicating that Mr. Marchenko was known to other Treblinka guards as the sadistic Ivan, who slashed his Jewish victims as he forced them into the gas chambers. It has been largely the impact of those documents that has led to the current reassessment of the case. Around that time in another bag of garbage, Mr. Nishnic and other Demjanjuk supporters found an account of the Justice Department's interview with a man who had worked alongside Ivan the Terrible at Treblinka. The report showed that that man had initially been unable to identify photographs of Mr. Demjanjuk, and that he was led to do so only after the photographs were displayed in a way that clearly singled out Mr. Demjanjuk: The man was shown two sets of photographs. The only person who appeared in both sets was Mr. Demjanjuk, whose picture was left face up in the first set as he examined the second set. When Mr. Nishnic and the younger Mr. Demjanjuk asked the Justice Department for full records on those matters, the Justice Department started an investigation on the suspicion that they had stolen Government documents. Mr. Nishnic was so alarmed, he packed a bag of garbage and took it to Washington to try to explain. But first at the airport and later on Capitol Hill, he ran into human and electronic obstacles. "The pop cans set off the metal detectors, and the guard asked what I had in it, and I said garbage, and he made me open it," he said. "I started banging on doors, but nobody would talk to me." Eventually, a member of his state's Congressional delegation, Representative James A. Traficant, decided to help him. "I told him I was really in trouble, and he listened," Mr. Nishnic said. It was Mr. Traficant, a Democrat from Youngstown, who provided a key weapon in the investigation. "He appointed me his investigator of Nazi crimes, and that has opened all kinds of doors when I've gone to Eastern Europe," Mr. Nishnic said. "People will finally let me see some of the files that I have not had access to." Mr. Nishnic said he is now hopeful about his father-in-law's fate. "I think Israel will let him go now, will send him back here," said Mr. Nishnic, who has spent the last week logging more than 100 calls from reporters around the world. Calls at All Hours Last week, he seemed indefatigable. He spoke of making calls at 2 A.M. to fit in yet one more interview, of rushing back and forth with documents between the sun porch of his mother-in-law's house and the cluttered basement where he keeps the files, the phones and the fax. As he told the family's story, his mother-in-law, a small gray-haired woman who met her husband in a displaced persons camp in Germany, cooked, vacuumed and gardened. She and her daughters will not talk to reporters. John Jr., who declines to be interviewed, returned from his father's court appeal in Israel on Thursday and is taking a few days to be with his wife, who is pregnant. "Before I married Irene, I wasn't interested in John, I was interested in his daughter," said Mr. Nishnic. "But once I started looking into it, I couldn't stop. I am sure there was such a creature as Ivan the Terrible, and I'm sure it was not John Demjanjuk, so I thought the only way to solve it was to find the real Ivan." Learning by Experience Those who are familiar with the case say Mr. Nishnic's investigative efforts have been remarkable. "Ed Nishnic is an intensive, thorough person," said Edward Marek, the Federal public defender for the Northern District of Ohio, whom the Cincinnati appeals court has named to represent the elder Mr. Demjanjuk's interests. "It's unusual and delightful to have a person involved in the litigation with this extensive grasp of the facts, and it's very important since we have to get a handle on it so quickly." Still, along with accounts of the effort's success, Mr. Nishnic offers numerous sad accounts of how draining the task has been. "Two weeks ago, I thought enough is enough when my 6-year-old came down to the basement and pointed to the picture of Ivan Marchenko on the wall and said, I know who that is daddy, it's Ivan the Terrible," Mr. Nishnic said. "Other 6-year-olds talk about 'Sesame Street,' but my son thinks about Ivan the Terrible."

1381-> Let There Be Light (but not Heat, Cold or Ultraviolet Rays)
Spring is a good time to add glass to a home in the form of a sun room or greenhouse, skylights, a patio door or supplementary windows. This popular improvement can enhance a home's comfort and appearance and sometimes lower energy bills. But be wary; using the wrong glass can make rooms less comfortable by draining heat or admitting excessive amounts (both also raise energy bills) and can cause upholstery, wallpaper, hanging art, carpets and other interior items to fade because of exposure to ultraviolet rays. A pane of ordinary clear glass allows nearly all of the visible light, heat and ultraviolet radiation striking it to pass through without being absorbed or reflected. Adding a second pane of similar glass has little effect on light and ultraviolet radiation, but the air space between the panes, if sealed to prevent air movement, significantly slows the passage of heat. Fancy Glass Double-pane windows of ordinary glass, the standard type used in residences, are often referred to as insulating windows. To block visible light (some of which becomes heat when absorbed and reradiated by indoor objects) and ultraviolet rays, they are available with tinted or reflective glass. The drawback of both is reduced illumination that can darken a room uncomfortably and hinder the growth of houseplants. A better substitute is low-emissivity glass. Low-e glass, as it is commonly known, is specially coated with metal oxides to contain indoor heat, repel outdoor heat and ultraviolet rays and yet allow visible light to pass. Low-e glass looks practically like ordinary glass -- it may have a slight tint -- but is more energy efficient, affords greater comfort year-round and reduces fading of interiors. All major manufacturers of window and architectural glass products offer items made with low-e glass. Choosing it instead of standard insulating glass typically raises the cost of windows by about 15 percent, said Mike Johnston, an architectural specialist with Marvin Windows and Doors in Warroad, Minn. There are two basic types of low-e glass, each with somewhat different properties. Glass coated by a vacuum process after sheets are formed is called soft-coated; glass coated by a heat process during forming is called hard-coated. Soft-coated low-e glass can reflect as much as 90 percent of the heat striking it; the hard-coated variety reflects only 74 to 80 percent depending on the manufacturer, said John Sopko, staff engineer for PPG Industries' Glass Research and Development Center in Pittsburgh. But soft-coated glass requires special handling. Double glazing is essential because the coating deteriorates when exposed to the moisture in normal air, and skill is required when sealing the edges of such units to keep moisture out of the air space between panes. Hard-coated glass, which is more durable, is used frequently for removable storm panes, often advertised as "energy panels," on standard insulating windows or in combination storm and screen units. Windows made with hard-coated low-e glass generally cost less than those made with soft-coated glass. But windows made with soft-coated glass often carry longer guarantees, Mr. Sopko said. Some double-pane windows of both kinds contain argon gas instead of air. Argon is a more effective insulator, but hard-coated windows containing it must be sealed carefully to keep the argon from being diluted with air. Another low-e option is a coated polyester film called Heat Mirror, developed and introduced in 1981 by Southwall Technologies of Palo Alto, Calif. Window manufacturers mount the film between double panes of an insulating glass unit, thereby creating two insulating air spaces. Costs Versus Benefits Windows with Heat Mirror can cost more than windows with low-e glass. For example, the Heat Mirror version of one window offered by Four Seasons Solar Products in Holbrook, L.I., costs about 20 percent more than the company's low-e glass version, said Chris Meyer, a product manager of Four Seasons. But the air space that is gained without the weight or reduced visibility of an additional pane increases the insulating capacity of windows with Heat Mirror by as much as 74 percent over average hard-coat low-e units, according to figures certified by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, an independent tester of glass compounds in Berkeley, Calif. Other advantages of Heat Mirror include near complete ultraviolet protection (even the best low-e glass transmits about 26 percent of ultraviolet rays) and better noise insulation than with double-pane glass. Low-e film that can be attached by homeowners to ordinary windows is also available. One brand is Gila/Sunshine, manufactured by Courtaulds Performance Films in Chandler, Ariz. Ace, True Value, Home Depot and other home centers began offering this product this month. Durability and some kinds of performance are poorer with applied film than with low-e glass and Heat Mirror. But the cost of applying low-e film is 75 to 85 cents a square foot compared with $5 a square foot or more for dual-pane low-e glass, said Bart Oliver, director of sales and marketing at Courtaulds Performance Films.

1383-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ships Group Seeks TV Deal
The Operation Sail organization, preparing for the onslaught of 250 tall ships honoring the quincentennial of Christopher Columbus's voyage, is seeking to designate an official broadcaster for its July 4 weekend celebration in New York. ABC paid $10 million for rights to televise the last Operation Sail in 1986, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. Emil Mosbacher Jr., the chairman of Opsail '92, said that a live telecast of the next parade of ships should have equally broad appeal. He cited a report by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, which said that visitors to New York during the 1986 event spent $500 million more than would normally be spent during a July 4 holiday. The event "will probably not be terribly expensive to produce," said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a member of the Opsail committee. Juan Carlos, the King of Spain, has been invited to attend the ceremonies, he added.

1384-> Notes With Pleasure
The Persistence of Dreams Our image of the past, Michael Kammen reminds us, is shaped and reshaped as much by myth and tradition as by fact. This is from "Mystic Chords of Memory: The Transformation of Tradition in American Culture" (Knopf). In the 20th century, with the professionalization of historical scholarship, we harbor a naive assumption that illusory legends and social myths will be molted like so many dead or useless skins. . . . Nevertheless, myths and traditions have their own resilience, not completely controllable. True history can never be totally disengaged from social memory, or serve as an exquisite corrective for its flaws. Not enough people pay attention to scholarly history. They never have, and I don't believe they ever will. Historians, for their part, are not infallible, even when they "merely" function in their capacities as custodians of the past. Historians are participating members of society regardless of whether they are unloving critics or uncritical lovers of their culture. What people believe to be true about their past is usually more important in determining their behavior and responses than truth itself. Handing On the Spark Alice Walker finds in an antique quilt a fitting image of the way in which generations of black women have handed down precious knowledge. This is from "Double Stitch: Black Women Write About Mothers & Daughters," edited by Patricia Bell-Scott and others (Beacon Press). In the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., there hangs a quilt unlike any other in the world. In fanciful, inspired and yet simple and identifiable figures, it portrays the story of the Crucifixion. . . . It is obviously the work of a person of powerful imagination and deep spiritual feeling. Below this quilt I saw a note that says it was made by "an anonymous black woman in Alabama, a hundred years ago." . . . And so our mothers and grandmothers have, more often than not anonymously, handed on the creative spark, the seed of the flower they themselves never hoped to see. . . . No song or poem will bear my mother's name. Yet so many of the stories that I write, that we all write, are my mother's stories. Only recently did I realize this: that through years of listening to my mother's stories of her life, I have absorbed not only the stories themselves, but . . . something of the urgency that involves the knowledge that her stories -- like her life -- must be recorded. Lost Mother Earth A visit to a Hopi kiva, or sacred lodge, offered Thomas Keneally a very specific instance of the way in which we have lost our faith in nature. This is from "The Place Where Souls Are Born: A Journey to the Southwest" (Simon & Schuster). In the kiva, as it has always existed, are stone benches around the wall, a fireplace and a draft-deflecting stone which probably also has theological meaning and above all a crease called the sipapu in the floor. The is the Place of Emergence, the notch through which souls enter the visible universe, climbing out of the mothering earth by way of the kiva's ladder and so entering the surface life of the world. . . . Through the sipapu and up the ladder climbs all the energy and ambiguity of humankind. I love big cities as much as any other urban decadent, and would find it hard to imagine life without the urban tumult and smell of spiritual and footpad danger. . . . The city separates its citizens from the necessity of believing earth to be the chief of mothers. There are so many diverse trades in the big town, and it is from these . . . from the traffic of intentions rather than from the phases of the earth, that all plenty and all birth seems to derive. Why We Don't Need More Facts Instead of solving problems, our frenzied accumulation of data is actually inhibiting our ability to act, according to Neil Postman in "Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology" (Knopf). The fact is, there are very few political, social and especially personal problems that arise because of insufficient information. Nonetheless, as incomprehensible problems mount, as the concept of progress fades, as meaning itself becomes suspect, the Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information. . . . To the question "What problem does the information solve?" the answer is usually "How to generate, store and distribute more information, more conveniently, at greater speeds than ever before." This is the elevation of information to metaphysical status: information as both the means and end of human creativity. In Technopoly, we are driven to fill our lives with the quest to "access" information. For what purpose and with what limitations, it is not for us to ask; and we are not accustomed to asking, since the problem is unprecedented. Art's True Community Art can't eliminate our fears -- but it can diminish their influence, according to Walker Percy in "Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book" (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper). The salvation of art derives in the best of modern times from a celebration of the triumph of the autonomous self -- as in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- and in the worst of times from naming the unspeakable: the strange and feckless movements of the self trying to escape. Exhilaration comes from naming the unnamable and hearing it named. If Kafka's Metamorphosis is presently a more accurate account of the self than Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, it is the more exhilarating for being so. The naming of the predicament of the self by art is its reversal. Hence the salvific effect of art. Through art, the predicament of self becomes not only speakable but laughable. Kafka and his friends laughed when he read his stories to them.

1385-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS; San Diego Newspaper Adjusts To Merger
After the walls separating the news rooms of the competing San Diego Union and Tribune recently came down, literally, the staffs of the papers stared across the expanse at one another. "It was as if we were afraid of moving to the other side, like a border guard might shoot us," said Elizabeth Douglass, a Tribune financial writer. The two papers, competitors for more than 60 years under the same ownership, were merged on Feb. 2 into the new Union-Tribune, a morning paper with afternoon editions. The new paper has more pages of business, sports, entertainment, opinion and comics than either of its predecessors. It has a circulation of about 390,000, compared with 271,000 for the morning Union last year and 117,000 for the afternoon Tribune. It also has one editorial voice -- The Union's -- where there once were two. New Paper's Rivals And, in a way, the combined paper might be more vulnerable to competition than its two predecessors were. Competition for Tribune readers began soon after the merger announcement in September. The Los Angeles Times, which publishes a San Diego County edition, is advertising on San Diego radio and television for the first time. Its circulation totals about 74,000 in the county. "We sampled some Tribune readers in November and decided to rachet up our visibility," said Phyllis Pfeiffer, general manager of The Times's San Diego edition. "But face it, no one has the bucks to flaunt around like they did in the 80's." Herb Klein, editor in chief of Copley Press Inc., parent of The Union-Tribune, said he welcomed competition. But, he added, "I'm not worried about The L.A. Times succeeding." Potential for Weeklies Indeed, the biggest competition may come from local weeklies. The San Diego Community Newspaper Group, for example, has three weekly newspapers in three communities in the city, with a combined circulation of 65,000. John Gregory, editor in chief of the group, said that The Union-Tribune might be strong for now, but that "within a few months we will probably expand and profit from their problems of covering a city this large with one paper." Despite their common ownership, The Union and The Tribune differed on their approaches to news and editorial policy. The Tribune was considered more aggressive in its news coverage and was more politically independent than the conservative Union. Indeed, The Tribune won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for its coverage of a midair collision and another in 1987 for its editorials on immigration. The Union-Tribune offers a broader range of political commentary than its predecessors. But in the new combined paper, "the editorial policy of The Union hasn't changed," Mr. Klein said. Management Lineup The former editors of the two papers, Gerald L. Warren of The Union and Neil Morgan of The Tribune, had battled each other for more than 10 years over news coverage, subscribers and the favor of their publisher, Helen K. Copley. Now, Mr. Warren is editor of the combined paper. Meanwhile, Mr. Morgan is the associate editor and writes a daily column on local issues. Karin Winner, managing editor of The Union, is the executive editor, in charge of the day-to-day operations. Before the merger, The Tribune, like many afternoon newspapers, had watched its circulation fall for years. Indeed, the paper's circulation dropped even further after the merger was announced, slipping below 100,000. "It was clear that the decline would continue," Mr. Klein said. In addition, advertising in both papers was down, as it is throughout the industry because of the recession. The two papers lost about 8.5 percent of their advertising last year, compared with 1990, with most in the very profitable category of classified ads. The Union and Tribune had employed a total of about 450 people in their news rooms. But as a result of the merger, the news staff was reduced to about 310, with most people accepting buyouts to leave. The newspaper said less than 30 jobs were lost in other departments. It now employs slightly more than 1,700 people. Readers' Reaction So far, The Union-Tribune has received somewhat mixed reviews from its readers. For example, Mike McKinney, a lawyer and former Union reader, seemed pleased with the new paper, noting the opinion pages were more balanced. "You can actually find some liberals," he said, adding, "Now, they even have 'Doonesbury.' " But Bill Hobbs, a mathematics professor at Point Loma College in San Diego and former Tribune reader, was disappointed. "For all the falderal, I can't tell that the paper has changed a bit," he said.

1388-> U.S. Condemns Serbian Attacks; Plans No Force
The Bush Administration today condemned the stepped-up Serbian attacks on Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, but officials said the United States was not preparing to increase military or diplomatic efforts to end the fighting there. When pressed by reporters about what steps were being taken to halt the devastation in the Balkans, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the most promising developments involved peace talks scheduled for Wednesday in London among Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian representatives. Officials at the United Nations said the Security Council had delayed until Friday a formal meeting to discuss possible military actions in Bosnia, ignoring an Austrian proposal today to set a 48-hour deadline to halt fighting or face "further steps necessary to insure compliance." Administration officials in Washington said the United States was not pursuing a resolution authorizing the use of force to help provide aid to Sarajevo. An overland relief convoy is scheduled to leave the Croatian port of Split for Sarajevo on Wednesday. The State Department said the convoy would not have an armed escort. An international relief operation has flown nearly 170 flights of food, medicine and other supplies into Sarajevo since July 3, but airborne aid is limited by the small size of the city's airfield. United States and European diplomats expressed reluctance to transform the peacekeeping effort into a peacemaking force using military means. American and British officials, in particular, have voiced reservations about sending ground troops into the Balkans, and cast doubt today on the military utility of air strikes against Serbian targets around Sarajevo. "It would have very little affect on the ground," a British official said. "A few large explosions would kill a few of them, but you can't intimidate them into stopping by roaring overhead and dropping a few missiles." In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said today that France, which already has 3,000 soldiers taking part in a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Balkans, would not act unilaterally to try to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a television interview marking Bastille Day, Mr. Mitterrand said France would carry out any decisions adopted by the United Nations Security Council, but he added, "France will not go and make war in the Balkans by sending its army on its own initiative." The United States has two warships off the Yugoslav coast now -- the guided-missile cruiser Biddle and the amphibious ship Iwo Jima -- but the vessels are still waiting to join up with a European naval force that will monitor the embargo against Yugoslavia. The Pentagon said today that the Biddle locked its missile-guiding radar on suspected Yugoslav military planes three times last weekend after the aircraft flew within 4 and 13 miles of the two Navy ships. The Yugoslav planes turned around after the American ships locked on their radar.

1389-> A.T.& T. Plans for Business
In an step-up of the battle for small-business telephone customers, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it was adding four long-distance calling plans with 10 to 30 percent discounts for frequently called numbers. Before the recession, small-business customers were often neglected by long-distance carriers in favor of large- and medium-size businesses, where profit margins were often more attractive or prospects of big market-share gains more likely. In addition, residential customers were hotly pursued because they typically phoned at night when the phone networks were underused, thus making phone operations more efficient. With the recession, however, every customer became important. American Express estimates there are more than 17 million businesses with fewer than 100 employees. A.T.& T. recently joined in a venture with American Express to market a card that combines features of American Express cards and A.T.& T.'s long-distance card, Universal. A.T.& T. estimates that its present one million small-business customers make anywhere from $25 to $100,000 a month in long-distance calls. One of A.T.& T.'s four new discount plans gives 20 percent off for frequently called domestic long-distance calls and up to 30 percent off for certain international calls. A second plan gives discounts for calls to up to 20 of the business's customers and a third plan discounts all calls for an area code, depending on call volume. A fourth plan involves businesses signing up for an 18-month contract and qualifying for certain discounts. A.T.& T. last month announced an extensive program aimed at small businesses, and earlier this month the MCI Communications Corporation, its rival, answered with an extension to small businesses of its popular "Friends and Family" program. The MCI plan offers 20 percent discounts to everyone in a "calling circle," but with the same requirement as residential customers that businesses try to enlist others in MCI.

1390-> BASEBALL; Morgan Racks Up 5th in a Row
Cubs 5, Giants 0 Mike Morgan won his fifth straight decision today and had a run-scoring single as the Chicago Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants, 5-0. He pitched eight innings, allowing four hits and a season-high seven walks while striking out six. Morgan (5-2), unbeaten since April 15, singled to cap a three-run fourth inning against Dave Burba (2-6). Morgan is 6-0 lifetime at Wrigley Field, including 4-0 while with the Dodgers. Morgan was in trouble early but twice escaped jams by retiring Matt Williams. Williams, who has only 3 hits in his last 33 times at bat, struck out with runners on first and second in the first and flied out with the bases loaded in the third. Mike Felder had two hits for the Giants, who lost for only the sixth time in 19 games. "He bent, but he never broke," Mark Grace, who homered for the Cubs, said of Morgan. "We needed that today. He really picked us up." Mike Felder had two hits for the Ginats, who lost for only the sixth time in 19 games. Royals 5, Tigers 1 DETROIT (AP) -- Kevin McReynolds and Wally Joyner homered as Kansas City beat Detroit and stopped a five-game losing streak. Mark Gubicza (5-3), Rusty Meacham and Jeff Montgomery combined for a three-hitter. Gubicza, 5-1 in his last seven starts, gave up two hits in six and two-third innings, struck out eight and walked four. He had defeated Detroit with a six-hitter on May 17. Rangers 4, White Sox 2 ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) -- Bobby Witt allowed three hits in eight innings as Texas beat Chicago. Witt (5-4) allowed two runs, struck out seven and walked two. Jeff Russell pitched a perfect ninth for his 13th save. Red Sox 2, Angels 1 ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mike Greenwell singled in the go-ahead run in the fifth inning, then left with a groin injury as Boston beat California for a three-game sweep. Greenwell, who had been out with a wrist injury and came off the disabled list on May 17, hurt his groin in the bottom of the fifth when fielding Gary DiSarcina's single. Joe Hesketh (1-2) gave up six hits in seven innings. Jeff Reardon pitched the ninth for his 12th save, leaving him two shy of Rollie Fingers's career record of 341.

1391-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Delegates; How New York Voters Determine Who Fills Seats at Democratic Convention
If anything underlines the difference between the two contenders for the Democratic nomination for President, it is this: In the New York primary tomorrow, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas will field 186 candidates for delegate and alternate to the Democratic National Convention, while former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California will have 19. Mr. Clinton's candidates, a veritable who's who of New York Democrats, include Carol Bellamy, the former City Council president; Sandra Feldman, head of the United Federation of Teachers in New York City, and Representative Gary L. Ackerman of Queens. Mr. Brown's candidates are mainly political neophytes like Raymond St. Dennis, identified by a Brown campaign worker as "a local guy who has been working his rear end off for us," and Mark D'Acampora, a 29-year-old television engineer from Centereach, L.I., who used to be a supporter of Ronald Reagan. "I called the '800' number after seeing Brown on C-Span, and they sent me a letter asking me to be a delegate," Mr. D'Acampora said. In the byzantine realm of New York election law, and particularly in this campaign, it does not really matter that Mr. Clinton will carry full delegate slates in all 34 Congressonal districts while Mr. Brown carries delegates in only five. It will not affect the candidates' representation at the convention, since Mr. Brown will be awarded his share of delegates at post-primary caucuses. And it will probably not affect the voting tomorrow, either. The larger question is whether just who comprises the New York delegation matters at all, whether getting elected delegate means anything more than winning a ticket to the ball. "It depends on if it's a brokered convention," said Norman Adler, a political consultant and veteran of many Presidential campaigns. "If they're just going there and raising their hands at the proper time for the chosen candidate, you could get by with a bunch of trained chimps." Ms. Bellamy, however, suggested that lesser primates would not do. "I do think it matters who the delegates are," she said. "At the convention you adopt a platform. And you have the chance, with all the television coverage, to create an impression of what the party looks like." Fathoming tomorrow's ballot may prove almost as difficult for voters as getting on the ballot was for most delegates. In the old days the delegates were kingmakers; the names of the candidates themselves did not even appear on the New York primary ballot. But since 1976, New York voters have selected both the candidate and the delegates of their choice. Voters in the Democratic primary tomorrow will choose from seven candidates for President: Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brown, former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, former Mayor Lawrence A. Agran of Irvine, Calif., and three who have dropped out of the race -- Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. That vote will determine how many delegates representing each candidate go to the Democratic National Convention in July. Each candidate who gets more than 15 percent of the vote in a Congressional district will get a proportional number of the delegates from that district. Voters will then choose four to six delegates, depending on the district and irrespective of whom they selected for President. That vote only decides which of a given candidate's slated delegates goes to the convention. The winners will be those delegates with the most votes, divided equally between men and women. Although Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin have full slates in many districts, a vote for their delegates will be wasted unless the former candidates get votes themselves. Caucus and Convention Role If Mr. Brown gets, say, 35 percent of the votes in a district where he had no delegates on the ballot, the Democratic State Committee will then hold a caucus in that district by May 4. The candidates for delegate will be submitted to the state committee by the Brown campaign and are likely to include some of the labor leaders and local politicians who have endorsed Mr. Brown recently. In the primary, 159 delegates -- or delegate slots, in Mr. Brown's case -- are selected. The rest of the 268-member New York delegation, the second largest in the country after California's, will be chosen at the state Democratic convention at the end of May. Eighty-five of those delegates will be pledged to a candidate on the basis of the breakdown of tomorrow's primary results and will include 35 party leaders and elected officials. The remainder will be uncommitted delegates, mostly active party members. John Marino, the New York State Democratic chairman, said he would insist on a heterogeneous delegation. "I'm going to put a lot of pressure on everyone to think about our affirmative action goals," he said. "I want African-Americans, Latins, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and good-faith efforts with disabled Democrats, gays and lesbians." In all but four districts, three on Long Island and one in the Albany area, the space under Mr. Brown's name will be blank.

1392-> CHRONICLE
One of the biggest draws in town on Saturday? It's not a show, not a rock concert, not a ball game. Rather, it is a forum at Hunter College entitled "Women Tell the Truth: A Conference on Parity, Power and Sexual Harassment," with Prof. ANITA F. HILL as the keynote speaker. A capacity crowd of 2,000 people is already scheduled to attend, and another 1,500 have been told there is no more room. "The responses stunned us," said GLORIA STEINEM, who will introduce Professor Hill. "We cut off reservations on April 13, and even then there was a big waiting list. This is a year in which women are finally saying about many of the men in decision-making positions, 'They just don't get it.' There has been an enormous amount of outrage and energy released by many things, but clearly the match to the fuse was the Clarence Thomas hearing. "What Anita Hill, the Willie Smith trial, the Mike Tyson trial and the abortion-rights march in Washington have done is to break through the isolation and allow people to discover that their neighbors feel the same way." BELLA ABZUG, who will also address the forum, agreed. "There has been a lot of lip service on the support of women, but with only two women in the U.S. Senate and 28 in the House, it remains only lip service," she said. She plans to circulate petitions calling on "political parties to nominate and support only women for all open seats until women achieve parity in our Government." "We're fighting back," she said. The speakers at the panels and workshops will include GERALDINE FERRARO, ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, CAROLBELLAMY and RUTH MESSINGER. The architect of the allied air war against Iraq last year, Lieut. Gen. CHARLES A. HORNER, is moving up. The 55-year-old three-star Air Force general will earn a fourth star and a promotion to commander of the United States Space Command in Colorado Springs, one of the most senior assignments in the American military hierarchy. When he assumes his new command in June, General Horner will oversee the nation's constellation of military spy satellites and early-warning sensors that monitor ballistic missile launchings around the globe. Announcement of the appointment, which has been approved by the White House, is expected to be made this week at the Pentagon.

1393-> POSTINGS: Mount Olive Child Care; Kids in the Corporate Scene
As many as 16 infants, 40 toddlers (16 months to 3 years old) and 60 preschoolers (up to 6 years old) could liven up the corporate landscape of the 670-acre International Trade Center (ITC) in Mount Olive, N.J., next spring. Bright Horizons, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass., child-care company, will open its 46th center there in a 6,200-square-foot, one-story building at 450 International Drive. "As the owner of a very large mixed-use business park we saw the need for this amenity," said Leslie R. Smith Jr., executive director of ITC. The Rockefeller Group, which is still developing the complex that includes the New Jersey Foreign Trade Zone, is financing construction of the $1.2 million project. The day-care center's exterior "will be sympathetic to other buildings," said Richard C. Ashcroft of Cooper, Robertson + Partners, Manhattan architects. Inside, there will be an infants' room with a food preparation counter, refrigerator, changing tables and two sleep areas; a toddlers' area with changing tables and bathroom and playspace; and a preschoolers area adjoining a kitchen with low countertops for snacks. There will also be outdoor play areas. The design also calls for a nursing nook and a reception-resource area where parents -- who will pay tuition not yet set up -- can stop by for coffee or parenting tips. "We strive for a home-like environment," said Heather Samson, field manager for Bright Horizons.

1394-> PRO BASKETBALL; Jordan Scores 56 Points, Finishing Sweep of Heat
Bulls 119, Heat 114 MIAMI, April 29 (AP) -- The Miami Heat took an 18-point lead. Then Michael Jordan took over. Jordan scored no points in the first 10 minutes and then scored 56 after that tonight to help the Chicago Bulls beat the Heat, 119-114, and complete a sweep of their first-round playoff series. Jordan's point total tied the third highest in playoff history. He holds the record of 63, set in a double overtime game against Boston in 1986. Jordan scored 55 points in a regulation playoff game against Cleveland in 1988. The defending National Basketball Assocation champions advanced to a second-round matchup against the winner of the Knicks-Detroit Pistons series. The Knicks lead, 2-1, going into Game 4 Friday night at Detroit. Miami, outscored by 49 points in the first two games, roared to a 33-15 lead in the first playoff game ever held in Florida. The Bulls pulled even in the second quarter but could never pull away. Jordan, who averaged 45 points per game in the series, put Chicago ahead to stay by hitting a fallaway jumper for a 98-96 lead with 5 minutes 30 seconds left. He added 12 more points down the stretch, including two clinching free throws with 9.5 seconds left for the game's final points. Scottie Pippen added 31 points for the Bulls. Glen Rice scored 25 for Miami. Rony Seikaly added 22 points and 12 rebounds. The series sweep was the third for the Bulls in the last two seasons. They have won 18 of their last 20 playoffs games. Miami, making its first playoff appearance, fell to 0-17 against Chicago. But the Heat made the Bulls look like an expansion team in the first 11 minutes, scoring on eight consecutive possessions (18 points total) to take a 33-15 lead. Jordan, held scoreless for the first 10:12, rang up 17 points in the second quarter. He hit a jumper to give Chicago its first lead, 44-43, but the Heat regrouped and led, 56-51, at halftime. The noisy sellout crowd of 15,008, armed with clackers passed out before the game, sounded the like world's largest infestation of crickets. Jordan was even hotter in the third period, when he scored 19 points, including baskets on the Bulls' first four possessions. But the Heat led by 80-79 going into the final quarter. Suns 101, Spurs 92 SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Jeff Hornacek and Kevin Johnson each scored 22 points, including 11 apiece in the fourth quarter, as Phoenix defeated San Antonio to sweep their first-round playoffs series. The Suns meet the winner of the Portland-Los Angeles Lakers series. Portland, which leads the series, 2-0, tried to clinch it Wednesday night at Los Angeles.

1395-> Breaking Up Is Really Hard to Do; Scarcity of Judges Leads to Divorce Chaos in Passaic County
In Passaic County, marriages that are on the rocks are being kept together, at least in the legal sense, for two or three years after the couple files for divorce. There aren't enough judges to hear the cases. Just how hard breaking up can be in this situation dawned with painful slowness on Rodney Sasso, a Paterson firefighter who filed for divorce from his wife in the spring of 1989, after nearly 20 years of marriage. Last December, nearly three years later, the contested divorce finally worked its way up the backlogged list of trial dates and was heard. "I thought it would take a year, tops," Mr. Sasso said. "But you go to the court and they say the judge can't see you, next time there's no judge available, and that happens four or five times." For Mr. Sasso, the delays meant higher legal fees and a delay in his re-marriage until earlier this year. For others, divorce lawyers say, the clogged court system means spouses who do not know where they will be living, children who do not know where they will be going to school, career moves delayed, new loves put on hold. "It's causing chaos," said Michael Diamond, president of the Passaic County Bar Association and himself a matrimonial lawyer. "People are completely dejected, because they can't get on with their lives." Martin Verp, Mr. Sasso's lawyer, said that some divorce cases were four years old, and that the average time of dissolution was now "in excess of two years." up from about one. Normally a contested divorce should take between a year and a year and half at the outside to be tried, lawyers said. "It is disrupting a lot of peoples' lives," Mr. Verp said. Six of the county's 27 judgeships are vacant, a result of illnesses, retirements and some low-grade political skirmishing in Trenton over the appointments to fill the vacancies. Another vacancy will arise in June. Trials Suspended With criminal cases taking precedent over civil matters, and juvenile cases elbowing matrimonial cases aside in the Family Court, divorce trials are being pushed further and further back on judicial calendars, Mr. Diamond said. On Feb. 14, only coincidentally Valentine's Day, Nicholas Mandak, the assignment judge in the four-judge Family Court, tried to shake more judicial appointments out of Trenton by declaring a moratorium on scheduling contested divorce trials. But Mr. Diamond said the gesture might only have added to the problem. Although the order was quickly lifted, Judge Mandak, likening the unresponsiveness of court scheduling procedures to navigating an ocean liner, conceded that no divorce trials were scheduled at all in March, further backing up an already clogged system. Although other counties suffer from overcrowded matrimonial dockets, especially since last year's amendments to the state Domestic Violence Act opened up new legal remedies for battered spouses, lawyers say Passaic is the only county that suspended trials. Judge Mandak said he was as frustrated as anyone with having to work with a shortage of judges, but denied that the moratorium created any new problems. "What the lawyers are complaining about is not the moratorium, they're complaining about trial delays," he said in an interview. "And when they say it's taking them three years, they're talking about from the time a complaint is filed to the time a contested divorce matter is actually heard. There may be some that take three years, but some are being heard within a year." Mr. Sasso said that the situation presents plenty of opportunities for an estranged spouse to drag out a painful process. "The only issue was the house and my pension, and I said she could have the house," he said. "I thought that was equitable, and that's how it ended up. The judge even kept saying he didn't know what we were doing there. But she wanted her day in court, and I had to wait for it." Some former spouses are using the slow-moving court system to duck their monthly support payments, Mr. Diamond said. "You have a husband who's required to make the mortgage payment, but he doesn't give a damn, he starts skipping payments because he figures it will be months before anyone can take him to court." Part of the problem has been the newly dominant Republicans in the State Senate, where judicial appointments are confirmed, are insisting that Gov. Jim Florio abide by a tradition that county judgeships be divided evenly between the two parties. "There are four Republican vacancies and two Democratic vacancies, and the Governor has nominted three Democrats and no Republicans," said State Senator Joseph Bubba, a Republican from Wayne. "That speaks volumes." John A. Girgenti, a Democrat from Hawthorne and another Passaic Senator, said the political problems were close to being solved. "We do understand that there's a problem and that people are waiting in some cases two or three years, and nobody is trying to downplay that," he said. "But we're trying to work something out. We've spoken to the Governor's office and I've met with the chief counsel, and I think there will some movement to fill those vacancies shortly."

1396-> Plan Is Cut For Plants In Converting Of Sludge
Saying they had been persuaded by community opposition, Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that they had cut back a plan to build a string of plants that would convert sewage sludge to fertilizer and similar products. Instead of eight plants, as originally proposed, they now propose to build five. Two of the three that were dropped --in Red Hook in Brooklyn and Maspeth in Queens -- were among the proposed plants most vehemently resisted by neighboring residents and business people, who said they feared the proposed plants would bring noxious odors and greatly increased truck traffic. A third proposed plant to be dropped, on Wards Island in the East River, did not draw similarly intense opposition from the closest communities in Manhattan and Queens. But officials said that they had decided they could do without that one and that a second plant planned for the island, which is to go forward, appeared sufficient for that location. Also still planned is a second plant in Maspeth and plants in Sunset Park in Brooklyn and Mariners Harbor on Staten Island, all of which have also been the objects of vigorous community opposition. The final plant to be built is already under construction in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. 'Very Persuasive' Opposition "There was very persuasive community opposition that the local impacts would be too high," Albert F. Appleton, Commissioner of the city's Environmental Protection Department, said of the decision to drop the Red Hook site and one of the Maspeth sites. "And in terms of the impact on the program," he said of the city's sludge-disposal effort, "we felt we could drop those sites without compromising the success of the long-term program." But he added that the city was "definitely going forward with" the other five sites. However, the Maspeth, Sunset Park and Mariners Harbor sites are subject to approval by the City Planning Commission and, depending on certain circumstances, possibly by the City Council as well. Mr. Appleton and his aides said last month that they were reconsidering the Red Hook site. Their decision to drop it as well as the Maspeth and Wards Island sites was reported yesterday in New York Newsday. The Commissioner also said the three proposed plants could be dropped, at least for several years, because projections for future sludge output had been reduced. A 1988 Federal Law The proposal for the plants -- the five still planned are expected to cost a total of more than $1 billion -- is the city's response to a June 30, 1992, deadline to stop dumping sewage sludge in the Atlantic Ocean, the city's sludge-disposal method for decades. The city negotiated that deadline under a 1988 Federal law banning such disposal as environmentally damaging. Sludge is the thick liquid residue generated in sewage-treatment operations, with about 13,000 tons of it produced daily in the city. Because the proposed plants will not all be completed until 1998, the city has an interim plan for contractors to haul the sludge to such out-of-state sites as a Virginia landfill. These contracts and other aspects of the sludge program are being looked at by the Manhattan District Attorney's office for possible corruption. In Red Hook, the decision to drop the proposed site at Beard and Richards Streets has led to "rejoicing" because the neighborhood is already burdened with about a dozen garbage-transfer stations, said Robert Acito, district manager of Community Board 6, which covers the area. In Maspeth, Frank Principe, head of the West Maspeth Local Development Corporation, said that while cancellation of the proposed site south of Maspeth Creek was welcomed, many in the community were still unhappy over the Dinkins administration's intention to press forward on the site north of the creek.

1397-> Charge of Musical Fakery Retracted
The former music director of New Kids on the Block has retracted his charge that the group was involved in musical fakery and dropped a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the group's founder. The former music director, Gregory McPherson, who also produced the group's records for two years, said in a statement released last week: "The allegations that I made regarding New Kids on the Block lip-synching were untrue. They did sing lead on their albums." Mr. McPherson publicly made the claims of fakery and filed the lawsuit in January. He retracted them at a news conference in Boston that he held with the group's founder, Maurice Starr. In an interview yesterday, Mr. McPherson said he was "not in a position to make any other comment because our negotiations are still going on." But in a separate interview, Mr. Starr said Mr. McPherson had called him "and wanted to end all the lies." He said the two would work together on projects, but not with the New Kids. "He will produce some gospel music and score films," Mr. Starr said. "We will continue our working relationship and he's going to make money from that." When asked if there had been an out-of-court settlement, Mr. Starr said: "It wasn't about that. We were all very prayerful and let prayer lead the way." Mr. McPherson, who was the New Kids' music director and producer for two years until December 1990, asserted last January that the group contributed no more than 20 percent of the singing on any of their albums. He contended that Mr. Starr and his brother, Michael Johnson, did the rest. Mr. Starr founded the group and still manages it, though he is not a member. Mr. McPherson also maintained that New Kids did none of the singing in a Coca-Cola commercial in which they appeared in 1990 and that they went on tour with an eight-track tape to supplement their singing. In his suit against Mr. Starr, Mr. McPherson said that he was not paid for producing soundtracks for the group's video "Hanging Tough Live" and television commercials for it, and that the group's managers had not given him formal credit for his creative contributions. He said at the time that he had not include his allegations of fakery in the lawsuit because he had been a part of it himself. Other Suit Continues In February, the New Kids filed a defamation suit against Mr. McPherson, charging that his claims about the group were false and defamatory and were made to injure the New Kids for Mr. McPherson's private gain. Leonard L. Lewin, the group's lawyer, said that despite Mr. McPherson's retraction, the defamation suit would not be dropped. That suit, filed in Massachusetts Superior Court in Boston, asks the court for an unspecified amount in punitive damages. "It doesn't change anything as far as the New Kids' suit," Mr. Lewin said. "I said from the beginning this was a bunch of malarkey, and I was right. This makes the New Kids' suit look pretty good."

1398-> Judge Admonishes Gotti Over Behavior at Trial
John Gotti clashed with the judge in his racketeering-murder trial yesterday, exchanging sharp words in court, as the prosecution came close to completing its case. Glaring at Mr. Gotti, who had been muttering and gesturing at the prosecutors, Judge I. Leo Glasser suddenly interrupted the questioning of a witness and briefly excused the jury. "Mr. Gotti, this is addressed to you," Judge Glasser said sternly, standing at the bench and staring down at the defense table after the jury left the courtroom in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. "If you want to continue to remain at this trial and at that table," the judge said, "I am going to direct you to remain at that table without making comments which can be heard in this courtroom, without gestures which are designed to comment upon the character of the United States attorneys, the questions which are being asked of the witnesses." 'I Will Have You Removed' "If you can't refrain from doing that," the judge continued, "I will have you removed from the courtroom. You will watch this trial on a television screen downstairs. I am not going to tell you that again." Mr. Gotti retorted, "That's your prerogative." The reputed boss of the Gambino crime family stood behind the defense table, his arms folded across his chest. He spread his arms toward the prosecutors. "They don't need me to make gestures to describe them, for sure," he added. "Mr. Gotti, I don't want to engage in any debate about this with you," Judge Glasser said. "Neither do I," Mr. Gotti shot back. "I am just putting you on notice," the judge said. "Neither do I," Mr. Gotti said. "I am not here for a paycheck." The exchange was the culmination of what appeared to be the judge's growing distress at the gestures and remarks that Mr. Gotti has been making throughout the trial. Much of Mr. Gotti's anger has been directed at John Gleeson, who is handling most of the prosecution's case. Bolstering a Tax Charge With the jury back in the courtroom, Mr. Gleeson resumed questioning witnesses to bolster a tax-conspiracy charge. The prosecution is expected to rest its case on Monday. Anthony Gurino, the owner of a plumbing company that employed Mr. Gotti as a salesman for 13 years, testified that he was a boyhood friend of Mr. Gotti and gave him a job that he needed for probation when he got out of jail in 1977. Mr. Gurino, who was threatened with contempt of court if he refused to testify, insisted that Mr. Gotti was a valuable employee who had obtained business for the company, ARC Plumbing and Heating. "Isn't it a fact, sir," the prosecutor said, "that ARC got work not because he was with your company as a salesman, but because you were with him and he was with a crime family?" Mr. Gotti's lawyer, Albert J. Krieger, promptly objected to the question. But before the judge could respond to the objection, Mr. Gurino replied, "It's not so." Noting that Mr. Gurino regarded Mr. Gotti as a friend and employee who was described in newspapers as a crime figure, the prosecutor asked if he had ever said to Mr. Gotti, "Are you part of a crime family?" Another defense lawyer, Anthony M. Cardinale, objected to the question, and the judge sustained the objection. But Mr. Gurino still answered, "No," as Mr. Gotti laughed at the defense table. Mr. Gurino acknowledged that he was serving a prison sentence for obstructing justice in a case involving Gotti associates. But he said all he had done was sell some property for a friend's family. The prosecution sought to show that the Gurino company and two others paid Mr. Gotti as a ploy to conceal his criminal income and that Mr. Gotti failed to file tax returns for six years when the companies paid him a total of $211,000. Besides the Gurino company, which employed him during the period, Mr. Gotti was also employed as a salesman by Capri Construction Corporation in 1984 and 1985 and by Scorpio Marketing Inc. in 1989 and 1990. Ex-Lawyer on the Stand For testimony about Scorpio Marketing, the prosecution called Michael Coiro, a former lawyer who represented Mr. Gotti for many years and who is now serving a 15-year sentence on a racketeering charge. When the prosecutor asked if Mr. Gotti was a good friend of his, the former lawyer leaned forward on the witness stand and replied in a firm, loud voice, "The best." Mr. Coiro said he gave up his law practice after being indicted in 1983, then went into a garment business and became Mr. Gotti's partner in Scorpio Marketing, a garment firm operated by Lewis Kasman, a close friend of both men. The prosecutor suggested that they formed Scorpio Marketing as a device to provide business income for Mr. Gotti. But Mr. Coiro exclaimed, "That's ridiculous!"

1399-> AUTO RACING; Elliott's Nascar Bid Falls Short
Alan Kulwicki regained the lead with 26 laps left and held on to win the Food City 500 Nascar race this afternoon by 78-hundredths of a second over Dale Jarrett. The big story going into the race was Bill Elliott's bid to win his fifth straight race, which would have set a modern-era Nascar record. But Elliott crashed on the 31st lap and again on lap 250 and was never a factor. Kulwicki's victory in the Hooters Thunderbird continued Ford's dominance of the Nascar season. Fords have now won all six races this year and 10 straight dating from last October. Jarrett had taken the lead on a restart on lap 439. Kulwicki dogged his tracks until lap 474, when he dipped below him through turns three and four to pass and pulled away for the victory. Kulwicki earned $83,360, averaging 86.316 miles an hour before a record crowd of 62,300. Fernandez Wins Easily PHOENIX (AP) -- Adrian Fernandez, in his first Indy Lights event, drove to an easy victory in the season-opening race at Phoenix International Raceway. Fernandez, of Mexico City, won the 75-lap event on the one-mile oval by 2.114 seconds over runner-up Robbie Groff in the race for drivers in Buick-powered Wildcats.

1401-> Bridge
Nine star-studded teams, four in the open series and five in the women's series, began play here today in selection trials. The winners of the two groups when play ends Sunday will represent the United States in the World Team Olympiad in Salsomaggiore, Italy, in August. One player here is smarting after a narrow defeat Saturday in the Westchester-New Jersey division final of the Grand National Teams, played in Scarsdale, N.Y. Larry Cohen of Little Falls, N.J., was teamed with Marty Bergen of Farmingdale, L.I., Luella Slaner of Scarsdale, N.Y., Ethan Stein of Irvington, N.Y., Steve Weinstein of Upper Montclair, N.J., and Fred Stewart of Accord, N.Y. In part because of the diagramed deal, they lost by three imps to Warren Rosner of New City, N.Y., Steve Sanborn of Manhattan, Ron Gerard and Chuck Lamprey, both of White Plains, who advanced to the national final in Toronto in August. Mr. Sanborn as South climbed to six spades as shown and would have been defeated if West had routinely led a diamond. He chose a heart, however, and South made the right move by winning in his hand with the ace. He led a space to the 10 and cashed the ace. He drove out the spade king and West shifted belatedly to a diamond. South won the queen with the ace and reached this position: [ DIAGRAM ] When the spade jack was led and a diamond thrown from dummy, East was squeezed in three suits and a slam was made that was neither bid nor made in the replay.

1403-> Bass's Profit Rises by 21%
Bass P.L.C, the world's largest hotel operator and Britain's biggest brewer, today announced a 21 percent profit rise in its fiscal six months ended April 11. The company, which owns the Holiday Inn chain and the Bass ale and Tennant's beer brands, reported pretax profits of $:271 million ($499 million) in the six months. It attributed the increase to stringent cost controls and a decision to rein in spending. Operating profits at Holiday Inns, hit last year by the impact of the Persian Gulf war on travel, rose 27 percent, to $:54 million ($99.4 million). The company said cost controls helped improve margins of the company, which has 328,000 hotel rooms.

1404-> BASEBALL; Is It Time for Yanks to Turn Thoughts to '93?
The second half begins right here, which can't be a pleasant thought for the Yankees. Their season is fading and their record is falling, but their hope is lingering. But is any of that important? Maybe not. As August nears and the race in the American League East leaves them behind, the Yankees -- opening an 11-game trip on Thursday against the Angels -- are likely to begin thinking about other things. Their most important question now: Do they continue playing for this season or take a look at the future? Their record is 42-45, they are fifth in a division that still belongs to Toronto and they are 11 games back. No one is foolish enough to think the Yankees can contend over the final two and a half months, but it is still too early to concede. Breaking Even Isn't Enough By the end of the trip, which includes four games against California, three at Oakland and four at Seattle, they should know for sure. It's a road swing that will answer some questions, but their rookie manager, Buck Showalter, said over the three-day break for the All-Star Game that playing close to .500 might not be enough. "People said the same thing when we left on that 14-game trip in June," he said. "They talked about how important it was to us. We came out of it 7-7, and everybody said what a great trip it was. To me, it wasn't. At some time, you've got to start winning some series." The Yankees, who will activate relief pitcher Steve Farr from the disabled list on Thursday, haven't done that. Without a big trip now, August will mean nothing. "August, to me, is the toughest month of the season," Showalter said. "That's when seasons are made or broken." Pitching Help From Minors? It's probable the Yankees will have made some decisions before then. They may soon call up two of their younger pitchers, Bob Wickman and Sam Millitello, from their Class AAA Columbus affiliate, clearing the way by dumping Shawn Hillegas and Curt Young. As one team official said recently of Hillegas and Young: "We've got two pitchers on our staff who were released by Cleveland and Kansas City. Can you see Shawn Hillegas pitching the third game of the World Series?" Wickman is 9-4 and Millitello is 2-2 at Columbus. The Yankees, like most teams, must begin evaluating their minor league system in anticipation of the upcoming expansion draft. They could also bring up outfielders Bernie Williams and Gerald Williams, one of whom could fill a gap if Mel Hall is lost to free agency this winter. First Trip Best Forgotten In the meantime, they go west remembering that their first trip here was a 1-6 disaster. They won the first game at Seattle, then lost the rest. "I don't want to say I'm disappointed," said Roberto Kelly, the lone Yankee player at the All-Star-Game, "but I don't think we're where we should be. I don't think we should be in first place, but we should be above .500, too." Since opening the season with six consecutive victories, the Yankees have gone 36-45. Last year's team was 38-40 at the break, but went on to lose 91 games. A .500 finish this season would be an improvement and mark the team's best finish since 1988, when it was 85-76. But it wouldn't please Showalter. "I'm not satisfied or happy with our record, and I don't think our players are," he said. "As long as there are teams ahead of us in the standings, we can't be pleased. I don't ever want to be satisfied with mediocrity."

1406-> MUSLIM FAST IN U.S. HOLDS DIFFICULTIES
During Ramadan, the holy month that began with the new moon this week, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn to dark. In many Islamic countries, this means that restaurants close throughout the day, governments and businesses trim working hours, children leave school early and people take daytime naps to stay awake for nighttime meals. But for the Muslim minority in the United States, Ramadan must be observed amid fast-food outlets, coffee breaks and 9-to-5 working hours. Some find that the non-Muslim environment adds to the physical difficulty of keeping the monthlong fast -- but also to the spiritual rewards. "In the Middle East you are in a sea of people who are all observing Ramadan," said Omar Abunamous, a Palestinian who came to the United States from Kuwait 12 years ago. "Here everyone is carrying on normally, eating and drinking." By "everyone," he was referring to the vast non-Muslim majority. Fasting in a Restaurant The fasting can be especially difficult for observant Muslims like Mr. Abunamous's son, who is a cashier in a restaurant. "I don't envy his situation," Mr. Abunamous said. "All day he is surrounded by customers who come to eat and drink." Some Muslims, however, say that observing Ramadan is no different here than in an Islamic country. "It's the same food, the same moon, the same everything," said Amin Awad, who emigrated from Jerusalem in 1957 and now owns the Haifa Halal Meat store on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. "God is here; God is everywhere. You could practice your duties toward God anywhere. If anyone gives excuses, that's another story." Dr. Najma Sultana, a child psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor at the State University Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn, said Ramadan made it "very hectic to carry out your professional responsibilities." "It interferes with your energy and your concentration," said Dr. Sultana, who came this country from India in 1973. But she added, "We get a lot of strength from the spiritual side of it." Meals at Night Fasting during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, is one of the central pillars of Islam. Muslims are enjoined from eating, drinking, smoking or engaging in sexual relations from daybreak until the sun has set, as is dictated in the Koran. A light meal is taken each evening to break the fast, then a more substantial one later and another meal before dawn. The month is also marked by extra prayers and special efforts to avoid anger and be generous to those in need.Muslims believe that the Koran was revealed to Mohammed during Ramadan, and during the month pious Muslims read through all 114 suras, or chapters, of their holy book, which is about the length of the New Testament. Ramadan begins after the first sliver of the new moon has been sighted. Religious authorities in the Middle East declared the moon sighted on Tuesday night, and some Muslims in the United States began fasting on Wednesday. Others began fasting yesterday after sightings in the United States, which has a Muslim population of at least 1.4 million. Some Muslim groups claim the population is much higher. On Wednesday, Ghazi Y. Khankan, who teaches Arabic to grade-school children in the Northport school district on Long Island, was wondering how thirsty he would be after talking for a long time. Mr. Khankan is a producer and director for Voice of Islam Broadcasting in New York. He has a timer in his home that turns on a recording of the call to prayer that Muslims in Islamic societies hear chanted from their mosques five times a day. It "puts us in the atmosphere back home," said Mr. Khankan, a native of Aleppo, Syria. He said that was particularly true in the evenings during Ramadan, when "you hear the Koran being chanted from the radios in cafes or coming from windows, and everyone is rushing home" to break their fast. Hussien Elmeshad, the assistant bursar at Columbia University, said that the real difficulty with observing Ramadan in the United States was the peer pressure faced by Muslim children. His own children go to a Muslim private school in New Jersey. Mr. Elmeshad, who came here from Egypt 14 years ago, lives in Palisades Park, N.J. Dr. Sultana spoke of Muslim teen-agers on athletic teams who want to be excused from fasting for major contests. She sympathized with them but said, "We cannot forgo fasting, even for a tournament." Yousef Salem, who owns a business in San Jose, Calif., said Ramadan never affected his two daughters, who were competition ice skaters. Fasting is difficult only for the first few days, said Mr. Salem, who was born in this country of Lebanese parents, but has also lived in Saudi Arabia. For him, the big contrast with Ramadan in Arab nations was that people there could break their fast and then socialize until several hours past midnight while here they had to retire early in order to work the next day. But Muslims are increasingly able to keep Ramadan as a community affair, meeting nightly in mosques or Islamic centers for prayers and meals, and extending these gatherings well into the night on weekends. Spiritual Rewards Many Muslims agreed that although observing Ramadan in a non-Muslim society might be more demanding, it was also more rewarding spiritually. Dr. Shaheer Yousaf, an orthopedic surgeon in Waldorf, Md., who came to the United States from Pakistan in 1975, questioned the practice in his homeland and other Islamic countries of "artificially changing their schedules." "Absolutely, you get more benefit here than when you just make your A.M.'s your P.M.'s," he said. Muslims in San Jose feel that keeping Ramadan in the United States is a special "test of their character and determination," Mr. Salem said. "People get a joyous feeling because they have accomplished something in a place where they didn't have to."

1407-> Alps Caught in Vise Between Tourism and Trucks
The people of the Alps have always reshaped their breathtaking and dangerous landscapes. But in recent years they have become more than ever the masters of the mountains, taming rivers behind dams, razing forests for roads and ski runs and covering slopes with tourist resorts. Yet in the scramble to accommodate 100 million visitors a year in a region that ranges from southern France to Slovenia, a debate is raging over how much further man can go in extracting pleasure and profit before nature strikes back. Some say nature is already doing so. Narrow valleys are choking on the pollution from factories and passenger and freight traffic -- traffic that will increase as trade barriers in Europe come down. As traffic increases, so does acid rain, which has already blighted more than half the trees, which then topply easily in storms. The wolf, the bear, the ibex and the falcon have largely disappeared, along with many other bird and plant species. The Evil That Men Do "The question is not whether but when we are reaching a turning point," said Thomas Berghold, a professor of physics and environmental counselor to the city of Zurich. "If we let this kind of economic growth run its course, it will destroy the Alps as a habitat." Not that life was ever without danger among these stunning peaks, which range across France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria and Slovenia. Yet since the skiing boom of the seventies, things have changed: Alpine villages, once protected by thick forests, have become more exposed. Mountain roads have changed watercourses and destabilized the slopes. The sick and diminished forests and the erosion have in turn brought more mudslides, floods and avalanches. Experts warn that such disasters are likely to increase. "You cannot meddle with water flows on such a scale, and then expect to get away with it," said Pierre Gensac, a watershed specialist. No to Revolving Restaurants In every Alpine nation, environmental associations are pressing for a slowdown in the conquest of the mountains. They argue that the 40,000 ski runs, with their 12,000 lifts and cable cars, are enough, that there is no need for more revolving restaurants on mountaintops. Dozens of groups are demanding a ban on new resorts, on helicopters dropping skiers on untouched glaciers, on bulldozers. The rest of Europe is watching and its interests are contradictory. Many nations have a stake in the Alpine slopes because the snow and ice feed Europe's four major rivers, the Rhine, the Rhone, the Po and the Danube, which spill into three different seas. "The Alps are Europe's watertowers," said Tage Nielsen, a specialist in water management. The speed with which water runs steadily from forests or gushes from eroded slopes, he said, can have great impact on the water needed for drinking, irrigation or navigation hundreds of miles away. But the Alps are also Europe's crossroads, and the European Community is demanding new highways and tunnels to cope with traffic. A cargo boom will put new pressure on the Alps, which already have the world's busiest mountain roads, carrying more than 15 percent of Europe's freight traffic through a narrow sliver of territory. No to More Tunnels Just below the glowing Mont Blanc, the roar of traffic echoes around the narrow valley as trucks and cars heading for a tunnel linking France and Italy. Last year, 800,000 trucks and four million passenger cars passed through. Managers expect the tunnel to be saturated soon and want to double its size. But the people of Chamonix, a nearby French resort, are fighting this. "We want less traffic, not more," said Claude Marin, an official at the Chamonix town hall. "We already get the fallout from 25 tons of fuel a day." For the moment, he said, the tunnel project has been postponed. Chamonix is just a part of the anti-traffic lobby. In March, the Green Party in Switzerland collected 50,000 signatures, enough to force a referendum this September on a separate plan -- a $25 billion project to drill two railroad tunnels through the Alps. This would be Europe's public works project, costing almost twice as much as the tunnel under the English Channel. The two tunnels are the cornerstone of a new transit agreement between the European Community and Switzerland, which has committed itself to doubling its railroad capacity by 1995. Until a hundred years ago, the mountains and their wild waters were seen as enemies. Then governments built dams to control mud and water and laid ducts and culverts to capture water for reservoirs and generators. Cheap electricity attracted industries, bringing wealth but also waste. "Hydro-power has made for the most drastic intervention," said Jaro Stvan, author of "The Tamed Alps," a study of man's impact. Tiny Switzerland has more than 1,100 dams, reservoirs, basins and small and large hydroelectric installations, producing 60 percent of the nation's electricity. "It has completely changed the lakes, the landscape and the water regime," said Mr. Stvan. "Below the dams, rivers and gullies are often stone dry." Mr. Stvan, an architect, rails against the "ugly ski-lift terminals, parking places, boxlike hotels and apartments that have no respect for the landscape or the local style and building materials." But he worries most about new resorts, railroads and other big projects that will require more energy and more dams. Plans to add a second dam to the high Grimsel Lake in Switzerland have brought wide opposition because it would inundate one-third of an ancient glacier. Critics warn that the glacier could break or melt, slip into the lake and create a wave that would flood the valley below. 'All Those Machines' George Roth, a farmer who looks out over three stunning Swiss valleys on the heights above Leysin, says he does not mind skiers. Even in winter, Mr. Roth and his wife, Josianne, get up early and milk the cows. Then they take the cable car up to 6,000 feet, where they have converted a summer stable into a skiers' cafe. They like the extra income and mingling with the visitors. But they hate "all those machines. "Everyone wants bigger and better ski runs," said Mr. Roth, so machines flatten the runs and harden the snow, which turns to ice. The ice melts later than snow, "so we get less grass." Mrs. Roth added, "There must be a way to ski and not destroy so much." As they spoke, two helicopters broke the luminous stillness. The Demise of Farming Experts say that good ski-runs need not be an ecological hazard if properly shaped and lined with vegetation. But such rules are often overlooked. "Ski-runs generally create more run-off," said Mr. Nielsen, the watershed specialist. "Water comes down faster and in bigger quantities. You need bigger culverts and check dams. With excess run-off, ravines quickly become deeper and slopes become more unsteady and slide or collapse." The Roth family owns one of the last four farms around Leysin. Twenty years ago, there were 25. The story of the vanishing farmers is repeated throughout the Alps, although many governments subsidize farmers to keep them on the land, to take care of trees and guard the landscape. "If you take away the farmers, the landscape degrades even faster," said Mr. Berghold, the adviser in Zurich. "Many chalet owners are outsiders and they don't know or care." Furthermore, Government officials and environmentalists worry about the dwindling number of cows, seeing cattle as useful, rather than the environmental burden they are viewed as elsewhere: The cows crop grass, and short grass holds snow, while long grass bends and lets the snow slip off, leading to snowslides in these steep slopes. Organizing for Action The seven Alpine nations signed an Alps Treaty in October to regulate growth and make the economy and the environment more compatible. But it may take several years before regulations are written and accepted as law. In all Alpine countries, citizens' groups have banded together to protect the mountains. Some belong to national Green Parties, while others work locally, lobbying against garbage dumps or ski lifts. The International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, an umbrella for more than 30 groups, informs governments, local officals and private groups of damage that new projects can cause. Of late, large corporations have found environmental action good for their image and have started to support conservation groups. What amazes Alpinists is how much people are willing to soil the beauty they have come to admire. The head of Alp Action, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, warns that tourism may yet kill tourism unless the precarious beauty of the Alps is protected. Jeffrey Sayer, who works at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Geneva, said he recently returned to Nadelhorn peak after 15 years. Even here, on one of the Alps highest peaks, he said, the changes were striking: "Paths and gullies were worn and mountain bikes and sports vehicles had skidded and rutted the soil. Looking down, I saw ski lifts and bulldozed runs everywhere. People enjoy skiing; it's important for people to earn money. I find it hard to oppose. But I wouldn't want to see it go much further."

1408-> Reviews/Dance; A San Francisco Troupe's Self-Guided Exploration
Alonzo King makes dances that are peculiar, uncomfortable to watch and oddly static, all things that ballets are not supposed to be. Mr. King is an extremely popular, nationally known ballet teacher, but there are no lyrical effusions or star pyrotechnics of the sort beloved by dancers. However, by the time the program of dance presented by his Lines Contemporary Ballet group wound to an end on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, where the company performs through Sunday, it was clear that Mr. King is an original. His work has a look of rough, self-guided exploration similar to the earliest modern dance pieces of Garth Fagan. The program got off to an abysmal start with the 1991 "Cante," set to a Spanish-flavored score compiled and composed by Donald Ivan Fontowitz. Wearing black and bathed in red light, the dancers in this 10-year-old San Francisco-based troupe looked awkward as they spun and stretched in stop-and-start posturing voyages back and forth across the stage. The piece had a Bejartian sultriness to it, but none of that choreographer's sophistication. Nora Heiber added a welcome dash of wit, and Marina Hotchkiss brought some genuine warmth to the proceedings in a lead cast that also included Katherine Warner, Summer Lee Rhatigan, Eric Thome, Vincent Cowart, Gregory Dawson and Chiharu Shibata. Things got better with "Gurdjieff Piano Music," a 1992 work set to a propulsive and enjoyably dated-sounding score by the mystic G. I. Gurdjieff and by Thomas de Hartmann. Dressed in what looked like shredded white dancers' practice clothes and bits of underwear, performers appeared and disappeared in solos, duets and trios in the suite form Mr. King apparently favors. There were a good many strange lifts. In one trio, two men manipulated a woman who seemed to be cheerfully drunk. A male trio was filled with heroic poses that might have been choreographed by Ted Shawn. Nothing made much logical sense but the dance was often intriguing. There were interesting stage patterns and, even more, a feeling that Mr. King and his dancers were traveling through an emotionally charged landscape. Mr. King works a good deal with bodies that stretch and then bow or crumple. They jiggle and bounce on the stage floor, not following the sort of line of travel that helps to define dance. In "Without Wax" there is a look of magnetized scattershot choreography reminiscent of the dance of William Forsythe, who has acquired this piece for his Frankfurt Ballet. But everything comes together authoritatively in this 1990 work, which is set to music by Bohuslav Martinu and a fascinating string score by Sofia Gubaidulina. What looks like instinctual experimentation is ordered here by an overarching emotional theme symbolized in opening and closing images in which the dancers seem to reach for something just over their heads. Like Mr. Forsythe, Mr. King loosens a few of the binds of ballet conventions here, most compellingly in a tender but bizarre pas de deux almost hidden at the back of the stage. "Without Wax" is a yeasty, provocative work that received a strong performance from the company, which also includes Freddie Miranda, Debra Rose and Laurie Skophammer. Costumes were designed by Sandra Woodall. The evening's lighting was by Craig Miller.

1409-> Book Notes
Rockin' for Runyon The hottest ticket in town these days is the revival of "Guys and Dolls," the musical based on characters from Damon Runyon's stories. But hotter even than tickets to the show are Runyon's books, which, it seems, are out of print. While the Martin Beck Theater was ringing up record sales, local bookstores were ringing up nothing but disappointment. Even a random check of several used-book stores turned up no Runyons. "Isn't it sad?" said Felice Rose, manager of the Shakespeare & Co. bookstore on Broadway and 81st Street. "Every other day I cry about someone who's out of print, but this is really a crime. This is someone who should never have gone out of print." William Morrow & Company until recently had the rights to two Runyon short-story collections, "Bloodhounds of Broadway,' which went out of print in May 1989, and "Romance in the Roaring 40's," which went out of print in November 1990. Scott Manning, a spokesman for Morrow, said the editor responsible for the Runyon books had left the publishing house, and nobody was sure whether there had been any efforts to renew the rights and bring the books out again. Sheldon Abend, whose American Play Company is the literary agent for the Runyon estate, said that Morrow had done a bad job with the books and that "right now I have several appointments with publishers whose names I don't wish to disclose for this very purpose of bringing out Damon Runyon's books." Larry Kramer, the playwright, said the reviews of "Guys and Dolls" had prompted him to seek out a few Runyon titles at Coliseum Books on 57th Street at Broadway, and he said he was "shocked and dismayed" to be told there were none to be had. "A great American author like this," he said. "Can you believe it?" It would seem, then, that the best source for brushing up on Runyon would be a new biography of him by Jimmy Breslin, "Damon Runyon: A Life" (Ticknor & Fields), which came out last September. But Mr. Breslin's book, as it happens, has also fallen into a peculiar gulf: between the hard-cover publication and the paperback version, which Laurel books, a division of Dell, is not scheduled to bring out until December. This means that bookstores might still have unsold hard-covers that were not shipped back to the publisher, but that Ticknor & Fields will not ship the book again or begin a publicity campaign that ties the book to the hot show. "Alas, the hard-cover has run its course," said John Herman, editorial director of Ticknor & Fields, which has sold about 30,000 copies of the book. "If the show had happened when we published, it would surely have helped sales, but these are the vagaries of publishing." Roger Bilheimer, publicity director for Dell, said that there were no plans to hurry the Breslin paperback, and that come December, the publisher could still tie the book's publicity campaign to "Guys and Dolls." "The show is going to be here for a while," he said. Tell that to Mr. Breslin, who is fuming that neither publisher is trying to take advantage of the show's popularity to promote his book now . "If either of these publishers don't try to remedy the situation I will resort to bombing," he said. Mr. Breslin tried, at first, to be calm and said that wondering what might have been if the book had come out at a different time was like "riding the bus back from Aqueduct and saying 'if only the horse had run faster.' " But that resignation did not last very long. "What is it with these publishers?" he said. "One's not going to push it and the other isn't going to bring this book out till December. What are they: crazy?" Big C, My Oh Yes The book by an author named Cheever came with the characteristic large letter C covering the jacket and cradling the name inside. But the first name is Benjamin, son of John, who has written his first novel, "The Plagiarist" (Atheneum). The book not only borrowed from the covers that distinguished John Cheever's works; it borrowed from the Cheever family life, as well. "The Plagiarist" is about a magazine editor who is the son of, as the book jacket describes, "an aging, acerbic, alcoholic and much-acclaimed American writer." The cover design was an homage, said Lee Goerner, Atheneum's publisher and editor in chief. "It's a fun gesture," he said. "Kind of a wink and a nod to John Cheever." Given the book's title, said Mr. Goerner, the gesture "seemed particularly appropriate." Readings for a Cause New York City is always rich with readings by authors, but there are two readings coming up over the next several days that seem to speak to two particularly compelling realities of life in the city: the devastation that AIDS has caused in the artistic community and the sometimes tense relations between blacks and Jews. A Different Light, a bookstore at 548 Hudson Street that specializes in gay and lesbian literature, has scheduled for Friday night at 10 o'clock a memorial tribute to George Stambolian, an acclaimed editor of gay literature and a series of anthologies by gay writers, who died of AIDS in December. In addition to editing the works of individual writers, Mr. Stambolian compiled a groundbreaking series of short-story collections by gay writers, beginning with "Men on Men," which was published in 1986, and continuing through "Men on Men 4," which is scheduled to be published by Dutton/Plume this year. Among the writers who are coming from around the country to participate in the reading are Edmund White, Andrew Holleran and Felice Picano -- all members of the Violet Quill Club, a group of gay writers who met regularly in the West Village and on Fire Island in the early 1970's to discuss their works at a time when gay literature was rare in mainstream publishing. On Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Jewish Museum has scheduled a reading -- "Working It Out: Storytellers' Views" -- by five fiction writers who are to read from their works and speak about American blacks and American Jews in the literary imagination. The reading, which is being done in conjunction with the Jewish Museum's current exhibition, "Bridges and Boundaries: African Americans and American Jews," is to take place at the museum's temporary headquarters in the New-York Historical Society on Central Park West at 77th Street. Grace Paley, whose books include "The Little Disturbances of Man," will be the moderator of "Working It Out" and will also read from her work. The other authors to be featured are James McPherson, author of "Elbow Room"; Gloria Naylor, whose books include "The Women of Brewster Place"; Hugh Nissenson, author of "The Elephant and My Jewish Problem," and Lynn Sharon Schwartz, author of "Leaving Brooklyn." The exhibition and reading are being presented in collaboration with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

1410-> The Mayor Plays Brooklyn, And the Reviewers Await
The trappings of Mayoralty have already arrived at Brooklyn Borough Hall -- a stately desk and swivel chair, four computers, three fax machines, 35 telephones, a photocopier, a metal detector, a lectern, some flags -- almost every conceivable thing, in fact, that Mayor David N. Dinkins could need for his "government in exile." But it seemed at times around Court Street that word of the Mayor's visit was getting out about as quickly as rush hour traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. "Nobody knows he's coming," said Tony Juliano, the graying bootblack of Caramanica's shoeshine stand outside Borough Hall, who has spent more than four decades kneeling over some of Brooklyn's most politically connected shoes -- from Abe Stark's to Stanley Steingut's to Eugene Gold's. Ross Lograsso, the manager of the Monte-Grosso Barbershop on Remson Street, said, "No one knows nothing about nobody. When they see the traffic, then they'll know about it." Some Problems of Logistics As the Mayor's weeklong experiment in transporting City Hall two miles across the river to Brooklyn begins this morning, it was probably inevitable that the move would present his aides with some logistical difficulties -- not to mention a considerable amount of skepticism from the people he hopes to meet. There were a few invitations that appeared to be lost, in the politically volatile case of a reception for the borough's notables and luminaries scheduled for Wednesday evening. "The invitations are in the mail," said Michael Kharfen, the director of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, who has the task of keeping the mayoral roadshow running smoothly. "In some cases we're calling people just to tell them, 'Come.' Just in case." And there was the search for two archetypal Brooklyn families to have coffee with Mr. Dinkins and tell him what's on their minds. The Mayor's aides have found one in Bushwick and are frantically negotiating with another in Canarsie. "It was a major undertaking," Mr. Kharfen said. Mr. Dinkins's undertaking, which begins with an early morning ride on a Brooklyn-bound No. 4 train, is also scheduled to include visits to business and community leaders, tours of housing projects, hospitals and schools, and a campaign-style stroll through Brighton Beach. When Mr. Kharfen held a briefing last week with the borough's political leaders, including Borough President Howard Golden and the borough's City Council contingent, he received an inkling of the reception Mr. Dinkins might expect. "Monday comes, Friday leaves," said Councilman Victor L. Robles complained. "This borough has tremendous needs and has felt in the past, and still does, like a stepchild. After it's all over, then what?" Mr. Kharfen replied, "He doesn't start being Mayor of Brooklyn on Feb. 24 and stop on Feb. 28." The borough's Council delegation has drafted a letter to Mr. Dinkins outlining its concerns and complaints, including what the council members see as inequitable financing for the District Attorney's office, the Brooklyn Public Library and school construction. "I'm delighted that he's finally coming to Brooklyn," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman, who heads the delegation. "Many of us have complained that the Mayor's been absent from our communities. To get down and dirty with the people -- that's a laudable idea." Warding Off Distractions For the week, the Mayor and a staff of more than 30 will occupy much of the west wing of the newly restored Borough Hall, including the ornate 2,500-foot hall that was a courtroom and before that the chambers of the City Council of Brooklyn. No one in the the Borough President's office has been displaced, although they have been distracted. An aide to Mr. Golden has circulated a memo urging staff members to keep their minds on their work. Mr. Dinkins is not the first Mayor to move City Hall across the East River. Fiorello H. La Guardia did so for five days when Brooklyn celebrated its centenary in 1934. And he did Mr. Dinkins one better. He and his wife, Marie, moved into a Brooklyn hotel for the duration. "They did their regular life in Brooklyn," said Thomas Kessner, a professor of history at the City University of New York's Graduate Center. "They wanted to get a feel for the place."

1418-> Review/Theater: Falsettos; Broadway Boundary Falls Amid Reunions
Last night's opening of William Finn's exhilarating and heartbreaking musical "Falsettos" at the John Golden Theater marked the official end of the Broadway season, and what more perfect end to this season could there be? In a theater year marked by signs of an American musical renaissance on Broadway and an explosion of American playwriting off Broadway, "Falsettos" is a show in which the boundary separating Off Broadway and Broadway is obliterated, a show in which the most stylish avatars of the new American musical embrace the same thorny urban landscape of embattled men and women to be found in so many new American plays. The evening also brings this highly charged season to a close with the charged emotions of an eagerly awaited reunion. "Falsettos" is the seamless merging of two one-act musicals, "March of the Falsettos" and "Falsettoland," that were produced individually in 1981 and 1990. All three original leading men -- Michael Rupert, Stephen Bogardus and Chip Zien -- are back, as is the original director, James Lapine (who is also co-author of the book). A lot has happened to them since they and "Falsettos" first came together. A lot has happened to the audience. Like any reunion worth attending, this one tempers its feelings of joy with those of deep loss. The wave of euphoria "Falsettos" evokes is inseparable from the wave of tears that rises audibly through the house once Mr. Finn raises the ghosts of those Falsettoland loved ones no longer here to join the party. Those who have never encountered this work in any form will have the enviable experience of meeting its achingly articulate characters and laughing for the first time at the idiosyncratic linguistic twists of songs about "Four Jews in a Room Bitching," the perils of psychotherapy and the familial predicament of watching "Jewish boys who cannot play baseball play baseball." Newcomers can also be confident that Mr. Lapine reassembles and refreshes his original intimate staging. Douglas Stein's spare and sparkling Pop Art production design remains intact, and so does the scale of the "teeny tiny band" playing the clever orchestrations of Michael Starobin. What old "Falsettos" hands will discover is that Mr. Finn has done some smart, delicate tinkering with "March of the Falsettos" and that "Falsettoland" gains exponentially in power by being seen only 15 minutes, instead of 9 years, after the first installment. Seen in this form, "Falsettos" also emerges as far more complex than its simple story might suggest. In telling the adventures of Marvin (Mr. Rupert), a man of 1979 who leaves his wife and son for a male lover, Whizzer (Mr. Bogardus), Mr. Finn is not merely writing about the humorous and sad dislocations produced by an age of liberated sexual choices and shifting social rules. When 1981 arrives in Act II -- and with it, a virus "so bad that words have lost their meaning" -- Mr. Finn is not merely charting the deadly progress of a plague. The unified "Falsettos" is as much about Marvin's abandoned wife, Trina (Barbara Walsh), and young son, Jason (Jonathan Kaplan), as it is about Marvin, Whizzer and Mendel (Mr. Zien), the psychiatrist who goes from being Marvin's doctor to Trina's new husband. Most important, it is about all its people together, a warring modern family divided in sexuality but finally inseparable in love and death. "I want a tight-knit family," sings a childish, self-absorbed Marvin early on as he tries to juggle lover, wife, son and shrink. Two acts later that ambition has been achieved and enriched as all the reconfigured couples are joined by still another couple, an endearing pair of "spiky lesbians" (Heather Mac Rae and Carolee Carmello), to celebrate Jason's bar mitzvah. But the battle to achieve that tight-knit extended family is not easy. It cannot be won until Mr. Finn's male characters answer the jokey question they ask rhetorically in song in Act I: "Who is man enough to march to 'March of the Falsettos'?" That question demands that these boys, whatever their age or sexuality, figure out what masculinity is. How they clumsily try to do so -- in and out of bed, marriage and psychotherapy -- is the source of the show's humor in Act I. The answer they discover is what gets them through the tragedy of Act II. As Mr. Finn sees it, the man who is man enough to march forward is the man who is man enough to love men, women and children unselfishly, standing face to face, no matter what. If Jason's bar mitzvah is one of the most moving you've ever seen, it is in part because it takes place in an AIDS patient's hospital room, in part because Marvin in tandem with his smart son has at last grown up to be a man. This progress is beautifully delineated by Mr. Rupert, whose nearly 25 years of honorable service as a juvenile in Broadway musicals reaches its long deserved, highly affecting payoff in Marvin, a character whose leap past eternal boyishness into mature, consuming passion inspires the most full-throttle singing and acting of this performer's career. Marvin's story also gains some new gravity in "Falsettos" thanks to the recasting of his son and estranged wife. Jonathan Kaplan, a very young Woody Allen with a big singing voice, is a sublime Jason. Barbara Walsh, as Trina, repeats the strong performance she gave in Graciela Daniele's fine Hartford Stage Company production of "Falsettos" last fall. Because of Mr. Finn's revisions, she has a spine denied her distinguished, ditsier Off Broadway predecessors in the part, Alison Fraser and Faith Prince. In addition to her new show-stopper ("I'm Breaking Down," adapted from "In Trousers," an earlier Finn musical about Marvin and company), Ms. Walsh socks over a rewritten "Trina's Song" in which she indicts the "happy frightened silly men who rule the world" more fervently than before. Mr. Zien, the most perpetually addled of therapists, and Mr. Bogardus, a pretty boy who ages fast, are both better than ever as respectively the wittiest and the most heroic of those men. When Mr. Zien offers a citation from the Torah to support his contention that "Everyone Hates His Parents," he ignites one of Mr. Finn's most riotous verbal riffs, just as Mr. Bogardus's forceful, never entirely knowable Whizzer conversely extends the spectrum of "Falsettos" to defiance and political rage in the chilling, unsentimental "You Gotta Die Sometime." At this late date, it may be superfluous to praise Mr. Finn's talent as a composer, but one of the virtues of "Falsettos" is that you take in his whole, wide range in one sitting and appreciate the dramatic uses to which he puts his music, not just the eclecticism of tunes that range from show-biz razzmatazz ("Love Is Blind") to lullabye ("Father to Son") to lush ballads ("Unlikely Lovers"). Neither an opera nor a conventional musical, Mr. Finn's score is full of fine details: a musical signature from Act I will turn up fractured in Act II just as a life cracks up; the notes underlying "spreading" in an internist's lyric about "something bad spreading, spreading, spreading round" themselves spread the terror of a still nameless virus that defies the meaning of words. Mr. Finn's range is a decade's range, at least as seen from the admittedly limited perspective of mostly white, moderately young and affluent, often Jewish New York. When "March of the Falsettos" first charged confidently forward in the tiny upstairs studio theater of Playwrights Horizons 11 years ago, nothing so bad was happening, and the high spirits of that moment pump through Act I of "Falsettos" as if pouring out of a time capsule. Act II plays out in another key as lovers no longer "come and go" but "live and die fortissimo." "Falsettos" may now be a Broadway musical, but it cannot and does not pretend for a second that the lovers have stopped dying. It is the heaven-sent gift of Mr. Finn and company that they make you believe that the love, no less fortissimo, somehow lingers on.

1419-> British Airways Plans A Slight Peak Fare Rise
Despite strong bookings, British Airways said yesterday that it planned to raise fares only slightly for the peak summer travel season on the main North Atlantic routes. The good news for travelers was delivered by Sir Colin Marshall, British Air's chief executive, at a briefing for analysts and the press at the Pierre Hotel. The airline is by far the largest carrier across the North Atlantic. Normally, when bookings are strong, carriers try to push up fares, and in addition the heavy losses caused by the Persian Gulf war last year have created pressure to try to recoup when times are good. But some analysts said that the economic recovery in many nations had been fragile and a fare increase could dampen a travel rebound that has begun on most international routes. British Air's fare increases are expected to be about 1 to 2 percent, Sir Colin said. 'A Good Idea' "Holding the line on a fare increase is a good idea," said Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst for County NatWest. "The economies of the world are just getting their strength back and they could be set back again." British Airways said that its April traffic increased 10.3 percent from April 1990. The comparison was not made to April 1991, it said, because the gulf war severely skewed that month's results. Holding down fare increases will mean that peak-season travel between the United States and Europe will be cheaper than it has been in some time. In 1989, for example, the lowest fare between London and New York available on weekends was $692 round trip. It rose to $738 in 1990, and increased again in 1991 to $758. This summer it is expected to be about $689. Sir Colin said that bookings in economy class, where most early bookings are made, were so strong that those who waited until the last minute might not find space. Virgin Atlantic recently announced a low fare of $398 round trip from New York to London but it must be bought on the day of travel. The offer is good until June 15. Sir Colin said British Air would consider the Virgin Atlantic low fare but said the airline already had attractive low fares and might decide not to match. Lori Levin, a spokeswoman for Virgin, said the carrier's bookings had been strong. Another reason that British Airways may want to keep fares low is that it plans a major increase in capacity on the North Atlantic of 11.5 percent over two years ago. The carrier will, for example, beef up its flights from one daily to two a day to London from Chicago, Boston, Washington and Miami. Sir Colin said that all the major carriers such as American, United and Virgin were putting more seats on the North Atlantic route. A Strong Recovery Domestic traffic has been disappointing for the United States carriers, which hope that a good summer on recently acquired international routes will help offset the domestic weakness. British Airways has shown a strong recovery from the heavy losses that most carriers suffered last year. In the company's fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, the airline showed a profit of $37 million, compared with a loss of $254 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2 billion, up 29.3 percent. British Airways has also held its own in the increasing competition in the North Atlantic, having seen its market share go up by 1 percent at Heathrow even though 17 new carriers have begun service to Heathrow in recent years.

1423-> BASEBALL; Mets and A's Are Pitching From the Stretcher
If they had a World Series for teams that have used the disabled list most often and most prominently, the Mets would play the Oakland Athletics this season. Interestingly, the Athletics remain serious contenders for a spot in the real World Series despite their siege of injuries. The Mets? They unmasked themselves as pretenders before suffering a remarkable run of serious injuries to starting players in the last two weeks. They had some significant injuries before this stretch, but unlike the Athletics, they were not able to overcome them. The Mets have placed players on the disabled list 17 times this season. That's not the highest number in the National League; St. Louis and Philadelphia have each had 19 players disabled, one less than the Athletics have had. Oakland reached 20 yesterday, by putting pitcher Bob Welch on the disabled list for the third time this season. He is the fifth player to make it to the list three times this year. Julio Franco of Texas, Vince Coleman of the Mets, Ivan Calderon of Montreal and Jose Oquendo of St. Louis are the other four who have visited the list, which requires a minimum stay of 15 days. Injuries Just About Everywhere But the Mets would win the N.L. spot in the World Series for the Injured because of their star-studded, or at least starter-studded, list. Of the team's starting position players, two-thirds of the outfield -- Bobby Bonilla and Howard Johnson -- and three-fourths of the infield -- second baseman Willie Randolph, third baseman Dave Magadan and shortstop Kevin Elster -- are now on the disabled list (Elster has been on since mid-April). Bret Saberhagen, one of their top starting pitchers, is lodged on the list for the second time, and Dwight Gooden, another starter, and John Franco, the chief of the relief corps, have also lost time while on the list. Like the Mets, the Athletics have had all three of their regular outfielders and two of their top starting pitchers disabled. Rickey Henderson has been on the list twice, Jose Canseco once and Dave Henderson twice, except Dave Henderson's stay has been continuous except for a week in the first month of the season. In addition to Welch, Dave Stewart has been on the list once. Replacements Go Down, Too Catcher Terry Steinbach and shortstop Walt Weiss have joined their A's teammates, with Weiss missing the first two months of the season. Injuries have also struck players who have replaced the injured starters. Randy Ready and Scott Brosius have each been on the disabled list twice, and Lance Blankenship was on once for a month. The Mets certainly suffered from Saberhagen's first absence, which lasted for slightly more than two months. The Mets compiled a 3-7 record in games started by Saberhagen substitutes, though Pete Schourek, his most frequent replacement, pitched some very good games that the Mets lost because they scored few runs. But Anthony Young did a highly capable job in filling in for Franco, Saberhagen returned around the time Gooden began ailing, and Dick Schofield, acquired in an early-season trade, has performed as well as Elster, except perhaps for a few points on his batting average. As difficult as injuries had been on the Mets, the August onslaught is what has them reeling now. They lost Saberhagen again, Bonilla, Johnson, Magadan and Randolph in 12 days. True, the Mets have lost six games in the standing in that span, but they had done nothing before August to indicate they could make a serious run at the Pittsburgh Pirates. Hanging In at the Top The Athletics, on the other hand, have, been in first or second place all season, except for the last two days in May. They were three games behind Minnesota for 10 days in the latter half of last month but reeled off winning streaks of six games and seven games and built their own three-game lead over the Twins. They have been more fortunate than the Mets in one sense in that their leading players, except for Dave Henderson, haven't missed great gobs of time. Rickey Henderson's stays on the disabled list lasted 20 days and 16 days. Canseco was on for the minimum 15 days. At other times, though, Manager Tony La Russa, has had the additional problem of a seeming lack of desire by Rickey Henderson and Canseco to play. Whatever the difficulties, La Russa has manipulated his debilitated forces and worked a magic that has escaped the Mets.

1424-> THE SUPREME COURT; Ruling Inspires Groups to Fight Harder
It was clear today outside the Planned Parenthood clinic that challenged this state's abortion law that both sides in the debate remained a universe apart. Hours after the Supreme Court handed down a decision upholding most of the restrictions in Pennsylvania's abortion law, opponents and proponents of abortion rights confronted each other across a narrow Philadelphia street in front of the clinic. Kathy Coll, head of the Delaware County Pro-Life Coalition, a group based in the Philadelphia suburb of Havertown, Pa., that opposes abortion rights, saw the decision as a step toward overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right. But a Philadelphia Councilwoman, Augusta Clark, said the decision ripped "a chunk" out of Roe v. Wade. Both Sides Vow Fight "This is a sad day for American women," said Councilwoman Clark, who brought three generations of women from her family to Planned Parenthood's offices today and wore a button showing a coat hanger slashed by a red line. "The Supreme Court has turned a right into a privilege." Essentially, groups that favored a woman's right to an abortion said they saw the Supreme Court decision as placing real obstacles in the path of poor women and teen-agers, while those who oppose abortion rights said the decision would spur them to push harder to rid the country of abortions altogether. Deborah Leavy, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Philadelphia, said that the 24-hour waiting period in the Pennsylvania law would especially penalize poor women in rural areas. Only 8 of 67 counties in the state have clinics that regularly perform abortions, she said. Women "have to take time off from their jobs, get the bus fare, explain where they are going," she said. And if it takes two days instead of one to have an abortion, that makes it that much harder, she said. Effect on Teens Seen Teen-agers would also be hurt by the ruling, abortion rights advocates said. Dr. Cathy K. Dratman, the medical director of Philadelphia's Planned Parenthood clinic, estimated that about 10 percent of the teen-agers who get abortions at the clinic, about 200 girls a year, will have to get court orders because they cannot tell their parents that they are pregnant and want an abortion. "To find an abortion provider is a big step. Then to go to court -- it's going to be very difficult," she said. Dr. Dratman said that the Planned Parenthood clinic, which schedules abortions Wednesdays through Saturdays, has three doctors who perform about 3,400 to 3,600 abortions a year. But Ms. Coll said that her group sees the decision as "a right-to-know bill." "It requires that women in Pennsylvania and in other states throughout the country will be given the same consideration that the rest of the population has when they have medical procedures: that they be informed," she said. "And it tells parents of minors that you have a right to know and that you have a right to say yes or no to a minor child's abortion." Ms. Coll and other opponents of abortion rights said their next step would be to push for even more restrictive laws. But to achieve that, she said, "I really think we need a new Supreme Court justice or a new constitutional amendment." Graphic Tactics Those who favor abortion rights, on the other hand, said they would be working to remove all restrictions. Councilwoman Clark said her group, Sisters Are Pro Choice, will actively campaign against politicians who oppose the Freedom of Choice Bill, and will campaign for those who favor it. In an immediate reaction to the Supreme Court ruling, Pennsylvania abortion providers have set up an 800 number, 1-800-84-TEENS, that teenagers in the state can call for help if they are afraid to tell their parents they are pregnant and want an abortion. Dr. Dratman said she wants to send every legislator who voted for the state's restrictive abortion law pictures and descriptions of the women who die from illegal abortions when they cannot get legal ones. She called the tactic, analogous to the anti-abortion rights scheme of using pictures of aborted fetuses, the most graphic way to explain the consequences of today's decision. "I never thought, when I came to this clinic 6 years ago, that we would be facing this situation now," said Dr. Dratman, an obstetrician. "I was trained to do abortions and I never thought anything about it." But, she said, that was part of the problem. "I think we just took abortions for granted," she said, while, "the other side has been plotting since 1973 about how to reverse Roe v. Wade." The abortion opponents, she said, "have been organized; they have raised millions of dollars; they have the Catholic Church in their corner." As for abortion-rights opponents, Ms. Coll said: "We certainly never took anything for granted." For two decades, we've been on the outside." But, she said, opponents were impelled by what they see as the moral force of their convictions. "We recognize that this is a big battle. It is the central issue of our time," she said. Ms. Coll said she sees the weight of public opinion as on the side of those who want to keep abortions legal and accessible. "It's a David-vs.-Goliath battle," she said. "We also recognize that David won."

1425-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Duracell to Finance 'Great Performances'
WNET-TV in New York said yesterday that Duracell Inc., the battery manufacturer, would replace Texaco Inc. as a corporate underwriter of "Great Performances," a public television series that WNET, Channel 13, presents on PBS. In a telephone interview, Jonathan Olken, vice president and director of marketing and development at WNET, said that Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., had agreed to provide $1.5 million for the 1992-93 season of "Great Performances," compared with the $1 million that Texaco spent in the 1991-92 season. He added that Duracell would not have any role in determining the content of programming on "Great Performances." The series has branched out in recent years from classical music and dance programming into shows that present more contemporary music and drama. Texaco announced its decision to end its corporate underwriting in April, two months before the end of its contract to help finance 18 original programs in the 1991-92 season. After that contract expired, "Great Performances" broadcast "The Lost Language of Cranes," a drama with gay themes adapted from David Leavitt's novel of the same name. Gay organizations and publications had questioned the timing of Texaco's announcement. WNET also said yesterday that the McDonald's Corporation would underwrite "Behind the Scenes," a 10-part series on the arts for children and their families. The company's support includes an unusual promotion: basing Happy Meals, the chain's boxed meals for children, on "Behind the Scenes," including placing educational toys related to the series inside the meal packages.

1426-> U.N. Resumes Relief Flights to Sarajevo
Despite continuing ground fire that made the operation more than usually risky, the United Nations command reopened Sarajevo airport to relief flights today after a 24-hour suspension caused by heavy shelling. The resumption of the airlift of food and medicine was approved by Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the United Nations military commander in Sarajevo, despite a heavy mortar attack on the airport that began late on Monday night and continued into the early hours today. After restarting at breakfast time, the flights were suspended again, for 90 minutes, in midday, after another mortar landed near the airport terminal. Then they resumed once more. The on-again, off-again nature of the relief operation reflected the continuing failure of the cease-fire that the warring sides signed last week in London. The truce that was to have begun across this newly independent state on Sunday evening has been no more successful than the many cease-fires that preceded it. shelling and sniper fire are continuing in Sarajevo, and battles of greater intensity are raging in at least 12 towns. Relief for 400,000 Residents At a news conference here General MacKenzie said at least some of the cease-fire breaches had been a result of Bosnian Government defenders in Sarajevo and the Serbian nationalists' firing on their own positions. "We have evidence that both sides shell themselves in order to create a particular image," the general said. "I got so frustrated with this a month ago that I said to both sides, 'If you stop shelling yourselves maybe we'll have peace around here.' " General MacKenzie, who is to hand over command of the United Nations force at the end of the month to another general yet to be named, probably one from France, said both sides in the fighting were breaching the conventions of war by placing mortars close to hospitals and artillery pieces near schools, as well as by reacting to attacks on military targets by shelling civilians. He did not specify which side was responsible for which offense. The 52-year-old general also appealed to the Bosnian Government to accept that the direct military intervention it has asked for from the United States and other Western powers was a "totally impossible dream," because of the military challenges involved in the mountainous terrain. Geneeral MacKenzie estimated that the United Nations would need 40,000 troops to impose peace in the Sarajevo region alone, compared with the 1,600-member force approved by the United Nations Security Council, and that even such a force would be at risk from warring factions outside Sarajevo. Emphasizing that he was expressing a personal view and not United Nations policy, General MacKenzie said the Sarajevo Government should accept that there was no alternative to direct political negotiations with the Serbian nationalists, a step that the Government has refused. By that the General apparently meant that Sarajevo would eventually fall to the superior military power of the Serbian nationalists. The nine United Nations relief flights that landed today represented less than half the 20 that have been scheduled for most recent days. But United Nations officials said enough food and medicines were brought in to keep the relief pipeline flowing to the 400,000 residents. The fighting was less intense than on Monday, when 15 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the heaviest mortar and sniper attacks in a month. But United Nations military observers reported heavy exchanges of fire around Dobrinja, a Government-held suburb adjacent to the airport, and there were reports of mortar attacks in districts along a band from the airport on the southwestern edge of the city to the New City area close to the center, about five miles away. The Government also reported heavy shelling of many of the provincial centers in Government hands or in the hands of the Croatian forces that have also been fighting Serbian nationalist troops. The towns reported to have been heavily attacked included Gorazde, the last predominantly Muslim town in eastern Bosnia not to have fallen to the Serbian forces; Gradacac in the north, Bihac in the northwest, Stolac in the southwest and villages near Brcko in the northeast and Visegrad in the east. When the Sarajevo airport reopened after the overnight mortar attack, which damaged a United Nations relief warehouse and seven United Nations vehicles used to transport supplies into the city, one of the first aircraft to take off carried Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, to Zagreb, capital of Croatia. The trip by Mr. Izetbegovic and several top officials was aimed at persuading President Franjo Tudjman toresume shipments of arms and ammunition to Bosnian forces defending Sarajevo. At a news conference on Monday in Sarajevo, Mr. Izetbegovic said of the supplies, which were cut off last month by Bosnian Croats, who have forces 10 miles from Sarajevo, "It looks like we will be getting what we want." After the Zagreb talks, Mr. Izetbegovic, looking relaxed, said: "We didn't discuss a military pact, but we will cooperate in oppossing aggression. We will coordinate our military efforts. There is nothing now to prevent this." Mr. Izetbegovic has been in telephone and fax contact with Mr. Tudjman, who has been pressing Mr. Izetbegovic about relations between Bosnia and Croatia, including formal constitutional links. Mr. Izetbegovic also faces new pressures from international mediators. Lord Carrington, the former British Foreign Secretary who negotiated the latest truce accord in London on behalf of the 12-nation European Community, said in Belgrade he held "the Muslims," meaning the Izetbegovic Government, "as much, if not more, responsible" for the failure of the accord as the Serbian nationalists. Lord Carrington was in the Serbian capital for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic. -------------------- Yugslovia Invites Observers UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- In an effort to dispute assertions that Serbia is fueling the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milan Panic, the new Prime minister of truncated Yugoslavia, invited United Nations observers today to monitor military bases in Serbia. After delivering his invitation in a letter to the Security Council, Mr. Panic said that his primary objective was to stop the killing in Bosnia and that he had ordered all Serbian personnel and arms out of Bosnia. Asked whether Serbian troops would be more loyal to him or to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, he replied: "You'll learn very fast who is in command." Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a rare rebuke to the Security Council, has criticized senior members of the United Nations for the swift approval last week of a plan aimed at carrying out a cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a private letter to the Council on Monday, he admonished its members for ignoring his objections and expanding the role of United Nations forces in the area. He called the decision unrealistic. Diplomats provided the letter to reporters.

ART SCHLICHTER, suspended twice by the National Football League for gambling, says he had a relapse because he wasn't serious enough about his recovery. Schlichter admitted Monday that he started gambling again in April and May, betting unspecified amounts on horse racing. "I did some things that were not very healthy for me," Schlichter said in an interview in The Cincinnati Enquirer yesterday. "I have to come to grips with the fact that I can't handle money; it's a part of the disease," Schlichter, a former Colts and Ohio State quarterback, was arrested Friday and charged with passing a worthless $3,000 check. He has pleaded not guilty. "When I came here, I think I didn't take serious enough my recovery," said Schlichter, who has been playing for the Cincinnati Rockers of the Arena Football League. The Rockers' general manager, KEITH SPRUNK, said Schlichter will play as long as he continues therapy and doesn't gamble illegally or bet on Arena Football games. (AP)

1429-> DAY OF CONTRASTS IN RANCOROUS RACE
The personalities and tactics of the New York Senate race were sharply etched yesterday, as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato took his campaign to the Senate floor in an all-night filibuster for the kind of local cause he has made his specialty. And in New York, where State Attorney General Robert Abrams has been trading rancorous attacks with Senator D'Amato, the state's top Democrat urged a sharp shift in strategy. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo warned Mr. Abrams that to win he would have to find a specialty of his own, a way to set the campaign agenda and thus refocus the political debate. It was a day that seemed to distill the angry clangor that this campaign has become with just four weeks left before Election Day. Focus on Jobs Mr. D'Amato harangued his Senate colleagues for 15 hours, holding up a tax bill in what he acknowledged was a hopeless effort to append conditions that might save 875 jobs at an upstate typewriter factory. Mr. Abrams promptly held a news conference in Manhattan with Jay Mazur, the head of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, to brand Mr. D'Amato a hypocrite and declare that the Senator's support for 12 years of Republican policies had cost New York thousands of jobs. Meantime, the first statewide poll since the general election campaign -- completed a week ago by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie but released only yesterday -- showed Mr. Abrams running six points ahead, though the margin of sampling error made it possible he was either 14 points ahead or about even with Mr. D'Amato. The D'Amato camp, which for more than two weeks has been running harsh television commercials faulting Mr. Abrams as "hopelessly liberal," also acknowledged that it was running two even more pointed 10-second ads, attacking Mr. Abrams -- without elaboration -- for "lobbying" for higher pay and renting "a luxury office suite." They repeat Mr. D'Amato's contention that Mr. Abrams "wants to raise your taxes." In contrast to their usual practice, Mr. D'Amato's aides did not announce that the ads were running. "These were so short," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. D'Amato's spokesman. "We didn't think they were that important." In fact, the ads are brief, and could easily mislead casual listeners. Mr. Abrams contends that his support for a new national health insurance plan does not call for raising personal taxes -- only for a new payroll tax on employers, in lieu of the private health insurance premiums they now pay, and new taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and corporations. And though neither says so, the ads refer to events of six and seven years ago. In 1985, Mr. Abrams wanted to take office space that cost $6.9 million a year, $750,000 more than the space the state favored. But his aides said yesterday that he ultimately settled on space that cost $300,000 a year less than the next costly option. Asked by reporters whether he favored a pay increase for himself -- in 1986, when the Legislature was considering one for all state officials -- Mr. Abrams said he did. But his aides said he never lobbied for the raise. It was precisely such thrust-and-parry that helped lead Mr. Cuomo, who had decried attacks on Geraldine A. Ferraro by Mr. Abrams and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman during the Democratic Senate primary, to say that Mr. Abrams had to find a way to reshape the campaign debate away from Mr. D'Amato's attacks. "There is an awful dilemma here," Mr. Cuomo told reporters. "Bobby's race is all negative." The Governor said Mr. D'Amato had put Mr. Abrams on the defensive at a time, he said, when Mr. Abrams did not have enough money for television ads of his own, while forcing him to respond to repeated attacks on his integrity and broadcast his own ads criticizing Mr. D'Amato as the target of repeated investigations into his ethical conduct in office. Mr. Cuomo said that if the race was waged on those terms, Mr. Abrams would be in trouble. Flying Mud "If it gets to be mudslinging, these people are better at it than we are," Mr. Cuomo said in comparing the two parties. "They've been practicing it for years. Some of us have been involved in it, too, but we're kind of amateurs, we're kind of crude, you know. Sometimes we miss with the mud, sometimes we get dry dirt and put it in the bucket and you go to throw it and it gets blown away by the winds. These guys are good. They get mud, they make mud balls, with stones in them, they know how to throw them, how to hit you." Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Abrams should stress his alliance with Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democratic candidate promising change, and his own record in office, while also rebutting Mr. D'Amato's attacks. Mr. Cuomo also reported on his talks with Mr. Ferraro, who has refused to endorse Mr. Abrams out of anger at his attacks, saying she had praised Mr. Clinton and that she had forgiven him for once suggesting Mr. Cuomo "sure acts like" a Mafioso. Ms. Ferraro has declined to speak to New York reporters since her defeat by Mr. Abrams. Mr. Cuomo said he hoped Ms. Ferraro's feelings about Mr. Clinton might mean that she would eventually endorse Mr. Abrams. He said Ms. Ferraro had viewed Ms. Holtzman's tactics as anti-Italian slurs, but believed that Mr. Abrams was only guilty of not speaking out against those. "Maybe she can say, 'Well, the same graciousness that allows me to support Clinton 100 percent will allow me now to support Bobby 100 percent,' " he said of Ms. Ferraro. The Marist poll showed Mr. Abrams with the support 46 percent of 583 likely voters surveyed, compared with 40 percent for Mr. D'Amato. Mr. D'Amato led upstate, Mr. Abrams led in New York City, and they were virtually even in the suburbs. It was conducted on Sept. 24, 28, and 29.

1430-> FOOTBALL; Redskins Will Stay in D.C.
The Washington Redskins' owner, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia today dropped plans to move the National Football League team to Alexandria, Va. The deal was canceled after Cooke rejected revisions to an earlier plan to build a stadium at an abandoned rail yard, Wilder said. "Mr. Cooke made it clear to me that he could not accept these additional changes," Wilder said. "We never anticipated the intensity of the resistance before we could present the facts." Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of the District of Columbia announced earlier in the day that Clifford Alexander, the Mayor's representative in talks with the Redskins' owner, was continuing discussions with Cooke's people in hopes of either renovating R.F.K. Stadium to suit the team or building a new stadium nearby. District officials last week offered to spend $75 million to expand R.F.K. Stadium, the Redskins' home since 1961, to bring seating capacity to near 70,000. Cooke and Wilder had reached a preliminary agreement in June on a stadium proposal that called for Virginia to issue about $150 million in bonds to finance infrastructure work, while Cooke would build a $160 million, 78,600-seat stadium in Alexandria.

The Digital Equipment Corporation displayed new software that makes it easier to design programs for "massively parallel computers," which use 100 or more processors to analyze information. At a news conference yesterday in Cambridge, Mass., the giant computer company also said it would resell, as original equipment, the newest version of an M.P.P, or massively parallel processing, computer made by the Maspar Computer Corporation. Digital said its newest version of Maspar's M.P.P. machine was three to five times faster than the original and was comparably priced at $175,000 to $1.7 million. M.P.P. computers, the fastest-growing segment of the industry, will become a $1 billion market by 1995, analysts have projected. The segment now accounts for $300 million in revenue.

1433-> BASEBALL; Gallego's Wrist Injury Spoils a Good Night As Yankees Triumph
Glance at the box score of last night's game at Yankee Stadium and it would seem the Yankees should be rejoicing. Shawn Hillegas emerged from the bullpen and made an auspicious starting debut, Matt Nokes clubbed an upper-deck homer off Willie Banks and the Yankees topped the first-place Minnesota Twins, 2-1. John Habyan pitched the ninth inning and notched a save in his fourth straight appearance as the new closer. The Yankees won for the fifth time in the last seven games and regained the .500 mark as their erratic pitchers stifled the best hitting club in the American League on just six hits. What a night, right? Wrong. The medical report contained distressing news and Yankee excitement was tempered because second baseman Mike Gallego was hit by a pitch in the fifth inning that fractured the ulnar bone just above his right wrist. Gallego, who missed the first 35 games of the season with a bruised right heel, is expected to miss at least six to eight weeks. But it is the sort of injury that could end his season. Pat Kelly becomes the regular second baseman. 'It's a Good Win' "It's a good win, but you hate to lose Gallego," said Manager Buck Showalter. "Anytime you lose a guy like Gallego, it is a blow." The Yankees signed Gallego to a 3-year, $5.1 million free agent deal in January after he left the Oakland Athletics, but it has been a treacherous first season as a Yankee. Even if Gallego returns in six weeks, he will play fewer less than 90 games. Team physician Dr. Stuart Hershon will reexamine Gallego today and hinted the injury could sideline the second baseman even longer than six to eight weeks. "A fracture is a break," said Hershon. "Six to eight weeks is a rough estimate of when he might be able to come back. Bones take time to heal." It has taken time for the Yanks to find a suitable rotation this season and Hillegas tried to worm his way into it last night. After making 12 straight appearances in relief, he took the ball and was terrific. He halted the Twins on four hits while pitching six stellar innings. Hillegas and Banks, a rookie from Jersey City, were both difficult on the hitters and the teams battled to a 1-1 tie through six. The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the first inning as Banks walked Andy Stankiewicz on four pitches to create trouble. Mel Hall replaced Stankiewicz at first with a groundout and moved to third on Roberto Kelly's single. Don Mattingly lined a sacrifice fly to left to make it, 1-0. Banks Gets Stingy But Banks was stingy after that and it looked as if Hillegas might have to toss a shutout to get a victory. He did not do it as Pedro Munoz ripped a bases-empty homer in the fifth to tie the score, 1-1. Hillegas lasted another inning before being replaced by Rich Monteleone. Banks remained and Nokes took one of his pitches into the right field upper deck with one out in the seventh to spoil the rookie's return to the New York area. Nokes was 1 for 14 before the homer and is still hitting just .205. Monteleone pitched two shutout innings to record his fifth victory in six decisions and Habyan tossed a shaky ninth for his fifth save of the season. But Hillegas offered the sort of effort the Yanks have been dreaming of. Then again, it was just one start and he has fooled managers before. "You take it with a sense that it was only one start," Showalter said. "We need to see a lot more consistency before we feel sold on him." Hillegas, who said he wanted to start the day he arrived in the Yankee clubhouse, waited for his opportunity and now wants to remain. He will start again Sunday. "I want to stay in there as long as I can," Hillegas said. "I am going to have to screw up for them to take me out of it." INSIDE PITCH The Yankees demoted left-hander JEFF JOHNSON to Class AAA Columbus and recalled lefty reliever GERALD NIELSEN from Class AA Albany. Nielsen was 3-5 with a 1.19 e.r.a. and 11 saves in 36 games. Johnson, who was 2-3 with a 6.43 e.r.a. with the Yankees, was sent to Columbus for the third time this year and his chances of returning to the majors seem remote. Nielsen will try filling some of the void left by the absence of STEVE FARR and STEVE HOWE. The club might recall TOREY LOVULLO or MIKE HUMPHREYS to take Gallego's spot on the roster.

1436-> SPORTS PEOPLE: AUTO RACING; There's Only Vroom For One of Them
AYRTON SENNA, the defending Formula One driver's champion, has been less than pleased with the performance of his McLaren Honda racer this season, so he was thinking about signing with Williams-Renault. He'll have to think again. Senna learned Friday that his chief rival, ALAIN PROST, is close to signing for next year with Williams-Renault. So, Senna's interest is gone. The Brazilian two weeks ago offered to drive for free for the British-based Williams team, but withdrew the offer after learning of Prost's agreement, which reportedly gives the Frenchman the right to veto prospective teammates. Prost and Senna had a heated rivalry at McLaren, and Prost eventually was forced to leave McLaren for Ferrari, which dropped him last season. Prost hasn't had a contract this year. NIGEL MANSELL and RICCARDO PATRESE, who have dominated the Formula One season in Williams-Renault cars, are both leaving the team after this season. (AP)

1437-> Ex-Official With N.Y.U. Is Arrested
A retired financial-aid administrator was arrested yesterday on charges of stealing $4.1 million from New York University by falsifying more than a thousand tuition- refund checks between 1982 and her retirement in May, Federal law-enforcement officials said. The retired aid official, Dora Malfrici, 53 years old, was taken into custody in Fort Myers, Fla., where she moved last summer after 35 years on the N.Y.U. staff. Her husband, Salvatore, 60, was also arrested in connection with what law-enforcement officials said was one of the largest embezzlements ever uncovered at a university. If convicted, the Malfricis could face up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000 apiece. Federal prosecutors said the Malfricis spent more than $785,000 of the N.Y.U. money on expensive jewelry they bought at a Fortunoff's store in Paramus, N.J., before they left for Florida. They also spent thousands of dollars on Florida real estate, the prosecutors said. University officials refused to discuss the case in detail yesterday or to speculate on how more than $4 million could have been stolen without being detected. She Denies Charges In Fort Myers, where the Malfricis were released after their arraignment, Mrs. Malfrici denied any wrongdoing. "I don't know where they're coming off with $4 million," she said, adding that she had been in charge of the tuition assistance from 1969 until she retired. "I never stole anything from the university." "All I can say is I worked for N.Y.U. and if they have bookkeeping problems and are trying to push that off on me, then that's wrong. I'm the little guy," she said. "Every year I balanced the books. I don't see how anyone could have stolen any money." Virgil Renzulli, a university spokesman, said N.Y.U. auditors noticed irregularities in tuition-assistance refund accounts in June, a month after Mrs. Malfrici retired, and reported the problems to the F.B.I., which began going through the university's records and subpoenaing banks to see where the money had gone. He would not say what drew the auditors' attention to the irregularities. On the campus yesterday, an N.Y.U. employee who had worked in the registrar's office for years and said she had known Mrs. Malfrici voiced amazement at the extent of the scheme. "No one believed she could do anything like that," said the employee, who spoke on the condition that she not be identified. "She didn't look like the type." But she added: "I'll tell you one thing. She wore a lot of jewelry." Law-enforcement officials said the checks were issued as refunds from the Tuition Assistance Program, a state-financed financial-aid program that provides expense money to needy students. But N.Y.U. officials said the money was stolen from a university account, not from the state. Under the state-funded assistance program, a student applies for aid, is certified by the university and the Higher Education Services Corporation in Albany sends the money to the school, said Denise Duncan-Levy, a spokeswoman for the corporation. In the process, she said, the school must certify that the applicant is an eligible student. The Government said Mrs. Malfrici's job was to make sure that students who were entitled to refunds under the program received their checks. But the prosecutors said that she saw to it that checks were made out to hundreds of students who were not entitled to any money back. Those students never knew about the checks, the prosecutors said, because Mrs. Malfrici deposited the money in bank accounts she and her husband controlled. The checks were made over to Elizabeth Pappa and deposited in accounts in that name, which the Government alleges the Malfricis had opened at banks in Manhattan and in New Jersey. The criminal complaint against the Malfricis said the F.B.I. had not been able to track down anyone by the name of Elizabeth Pappa and that she apparently never existed. Some of the checks -- the authorities did not say how many -- were payable directly to Elizabeth Pappa. "The refund checks were issued by N.Y.U. without proper authorization," said Kate Cosenza, a spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. "Apparently she knew some way to indicate these names were entitled to refunds when they were not. Somebody had to phony up documentation." Mr. Renzulli said the university was "reviewing all of its external and internal audit procedures to make certain something like this cannot happen again." Law-enforcement officials, meanwhile, expressed surprise at how the complicated and long-running scheme had been carried out. James M. Fox, an assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is in charge of its New York office, said that many of the checks were deposited in bank accounts in the name of Elizabeth Pappa, accounts opened by the Malfricis that listed their old address in Ramsey, N.J., and their telephone number there. Mr. Fox said an audit of three banks used by the Malfricis -- Crossland Savings Bank and the Manhattan Savings Bank, both in Manhattan, and the United Jersey Bank in New Jersey -- showed that the only source of deposits in the Pappa accounts were N.Y.U. tuition-assistance refund checks. The criminal complaint against the Malfricis, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the defendants eventually transferred money from the Pappa acounts to other bank and brokerage accounts in their own names. The F.B.I. has traced some of the money to the Malfricis' joint accounts in the Hudson City Savings Bank, the Valley National Bank and United Jersey in New Jersey and the Sunbank Lee Bank in Florida. In addition to the jewelry, the Malfricis also bought an $80,000 condominium in March 1987 and $95,000 worth of other Florida property, said Allen H. McCreight, the special agent in charge of the Tampa, Fla., F.B.I. office. The Federal government has filed civil-forfeiture complaints against both properties, he said, as well as seizing jewelry, bearer bonds, stock certificates, checks, cash and a collection of paintings, porcelain figurines and other artwork from the Malfricis' Florida home.

1441-> THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; McElligott Wright Is Losing McElligott
McElligott Wright Morrison White in Minneapolis said yesterday that Tom McElligott, chairman, chief executive and creative director, would soon leave the two-year-old shop. In a telephone interview, Tony Wright, McElligott Wright's president, confirmed part of the reports to that effect in this week's issues of Advertising Age and Adweek, which described Mr. McElligott's departure as a "palace coup" that occurred while he was at the International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes, France. "Tom wasn't fired," Mr. Wright said, "and there wasn't a coup." He added: "Tom wanted to leave, and we wanted him to leave." Efforts to reach Mr. McElligott in Cannes were unsuccessful. In interviews with the trade publications, he said he had been planning to leave the agency, but at a later date. Claire Canavan, the agency's director of finance and administration, said she and Mr. McElligott, who own 54 percent of its stock, were in negotiations to sell their holdings. She added that she had accepted another job at a bank in St. Paul. The remaining partners at the agency, with annual billings estimated at $30 million from clients like Conde Nast and Washington Post, plan to buy Mr. McElligott's stock and rename the shop, Mr. Wright said. Mr. McElligott co-founded the agency in November 1990 after seven years at Fallon McElligott Rice, now Fallon McElligott, a Minneapolis shop known for award-winning creative work for clients like Rolling Stone magazine and Porsche.

1442-> Brazil Reported Nearing Debt-Reduction Accord
Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, and its commercial bankers are on the verge of reaching an agreement that would reduce and restructure the country's $40 billion of debt, bankers involved in the talks said yesterday. Three years of negotiations between commercial bankers and large debtor countries have so far produced agreements with Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina. The completion of the Brazilian negotiation would come just about 10 years after the third-world debt crisis began, with Mexico defaulting on its loans in 1982. The complex proposal includes a series of options that would reduce Brazil's debt burden by about 35 percent. In exchange, the banks would get new bonds for their old loans. The bonds would be tradable in the debt markets and have some guarantees backing both the interest and principal payments. The exact form of these guarantees, however, was still under discussion yesterday. One problem is that the Brazilian Government, even with assistance from the International Monetary Fund, does not have enough money to provide guarantees for all the new bonds that are expected to be issued in exchange for the old loans. Bankers say there is now about $3.2 billion in this guarantee fund. The talks now are over what options under the debt-reduction program will get the priority for the guarantees and what happens if there are not enough guarantee funds when the deal is completed. One option is to offer the banks higher interest rates on some of the new bonds until there is enough money to provide a full guarantee, bankers said. Under the debt proposal, bankers will be able to pick from several options of new bonds to swap for their old loans. In general, the new bonds would reduce the debt for Brazil by either cutting the principal balance of loans or by lowering the interest rate. In one option, the loan principal would be cut 35 percent, the same reduction offered in the first deal, reached with Mexico, in 1989. In other options, interest rates would be cut to a level that would equal the saving on the payments from a 35 percent cut in the principal. In another option, Interest rates would be lowered even further in the early years to help Brazil. They would then rise in later years as Brazil's ability to pay improved. Another issue still being discussed is the terms for repayment of past-due interest.

1443-> HORSE RACING; Dancer Has a Record in Mind
The clip on his tie is a horseshoe filled with diamonds, and the ring on his left hand was given to him upon his induction into the harness racing Hall of Fame in 1969. Stanley Dancer removed the ring and proudly showed it off as he spoke about the Hambletonian. Dancer celebrated his 65th birthday last week by training horses and sitting in the sulky. He drove harness racers at three different tracks and county fairs. But his biggest race in recent months will come Saturday afternoon in the most prestigious event in harness racing. That's when Dancer will be aiming at a record fifth Hambletonian triumph when he directs Guardian Angel in the 67th edition of the race. This will be Dancer's 20th Hambletonian. He drove in his first 39 years ago and captured his first title in 1968 with Nevele Pride. His horses may change but his enthusiasm is constant. Dancer's last victory as a driver in the Hambletonian came in 1972 with Super Bowl, the last horse to capture racing's triple crown -- the Yonkers Trot, the Kentucky Futurity and the Hambletonian. "I love it, that's all I can say," said Dancer, who has not been deterred by numerous spills and two heart attacks. "I have no desire to quit."

1444-> COMPANY NEWS; PERKIN-ELMER AND APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS TO MERGE
The Perkin-Elmer Corporation and the Applied Biosystems Corporation said yesterday that they had agreed to merge in a deal valued at $330 million. Perkin-Elmer, based in Norwalk, Conn., makes analytical instruments used to determine the composition and molecular makeup of chemical substances. Applied Biosystems of Foster City, Calif., makes instruments and products for life-science research. The deal, already agreed to by the boards of both companies, calls for Perkin-Elmer to swap 0.678 share of its stock for each share of Applied Biosystems. The closing of the merger, expected by early 1993, is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and by regulators. Applied Biosystems, with 14.6 million shares outstanding, closed unchanged yesterday at $17 in over-the-counter trading. Perkin-Elmer, with about 33.75 million shares outstanding, closed at $31, up 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

1445-> Garden Q. & A.
Erosion Control Q. To combat erosion behind my house, I am looking for fragrant sumac. Do you know where I can find it? -- Jeanne Swartele-Wood, Mahwah, N.J. A. The fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica) is a delightful garden addition, unlike some of its noxious cousins in the 200-plus-member cashew family (namely poison sumac and poison ivy). This extremely hardy native, which grows from Florida to Ontario, typically reaches a height of about three feet. It bears small spikes of yellow flowers in spring and has brilliant orange or scarlet autumn foliage. Another common name for it, lemon sumac, more clearly describes the citrusy scent that emanates when its leaves are rubbed. I think you've made an excellent choice here, since these deciduous, shrubby plants adapt easily to poor soils and are quite useful for erosion control. They also make effective low screens or windbreaks, especially for wildlife habitats. The cultivar Gro-low, as its name implies, is low and spreading, with fragrant golden-yellow flowers. The cultivar Laciniata has longer, oval-shaped leaves. Fragrant sumac plants are available from Forestfarm, 990 Tetherow Road, Williams, Ore. 97544, (503) 846-6963; and McKay Nursery, attention Keith Rudolph, Waterloo, Wis. 53594, (414) 478-2121. Alerting Birds Q. Birds keep flying into my penthouse picture window and committing suicide. What can I do to stop their unfortunate actions? -- Leona J. McCoy, Manhattan. A. It is not uncommon for some species of birds to become confused by the reflection of the sky in window glass. They are trying to fly through what they believe is an open space. Interestingly enough, the "city-wise" species like finches, sparrows and pigeons rarely make this mistake. It is only the less widely seen birds, as well as migrating passers-by, who do, making the self-destruction all the more poignant. One solution to this problem, devised some years ago by savvy nature centers, is to place a silhouette of a diving sparrow hawk in the window. The image of this natural predator apparently repels many of these birds and also breaks up the window reflection, said Arthur C. Brown, president of the Brown Company, which sells bird-related products, including the Birdsaver, a black vinyl, self-adhesive silhouette of the sparrow hawk. The image has a 14-inch wing span and costs $1.95. Mr. Brown suggests that it is most effective when positioned high up on the outside surface of the windows that seem most often to confuse the birds. A free catalogue is available from the Brown Company, 140 Dean Knauss Drive, Narragansett, R.I. 02882; (800) 556-7670. Planting Peonies Q. Peonies have long intrigued me. Is this a good time to add them to my city garden? -- John Tennyson, Brooklyn. A. Early autumn is indeed the time to plant as well as to move or divide peonies. This is the time for the herbaceous plants as well as the tree peonies, since moving them now will enable their roots to become established before the onset of winter. It's important to prepare the soil well by mixing it with generous amounts of leaf mold or compost, along with a trowel full of bone meal or superphosphate for each plant. Work down to a depth of at least a foot and a half, and also work the soil enrichers into a generous circle around the plant site. This is a good time to check the soil pH. It should not be too acidic, or lower than 6. If it is, work in several trowels of ground limestone, stirring well. After improving the soil, scoop out a shallow hole and carefully place the peony root in it. Be sure the sprouts or "eyes" are pointing up. Space herbaceous peonie plants at least two feet apart, and give tree peonies even more distance if you can. Carefully work soil in around the spread roots, then gently cover each piece with no more than about two inches of topsoil. Water the area well. After the ground freezes, mulch deeply, using evergreen boughs, straw, bark chips or even additional soil mounded over the planting area. The goal is to prevent the plant from being pushed out when the soil swells from frost. Just remember to pull the mulch back early in spring, before new growth starts.

1447-> Ruth Southard Sohn, Novelist, 84
Ruth Southard Sohn, whose novel "No Sad Songs for Me" was made into a 1950 movie starring Margaret Sullavan and Natalie Wood, died at her home here on Friday. She was 84 years old. She died of colon cancer, said Peter Sohn, one of her three sons. Mrs. Sohn wrote "No Sad Songs for Me," published in 1944, under her maiden name, Ruth Southard. The novel, her only published work, was about a young woman who discovers that she has cancer and who, with only eight months to live, spends the time planning her husband's future. In addition to Peter Sohn, a resident of Seattle, Mrs. Sohn is survived by two other sons, Kurt Sohn of Dallas and Richard V. Sohn of Houston, and three sisters, Sylvia Gugliotta of Atco, N.J., Naomi Massey of Evanston, Ill., and Hazel Enyeart of Gardnerville, Nev.

1448-> Senate Sends Bush Bill on Abortion Advice
The Senate sent President Bush a bill on Monday that would allow federally financed family planning clinics to resume abortion counseling, a move that sets up an election-season veto fight. The senators sent the measure to the White House on a voice vote. The House approved the bill on Aug. 6, but the vote was far short of the two-thirds majority supporters would need to overturn an expected Presidential veto. A ban on such counseling was imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988, and continued by Mr. Bush. The Supreme Court upheld the prohibition in a 5-to-4 decision in April 1991, but most clinics that receive Federal money have continued to offer advice because legal challenges have kept the Government from enforcing the rule. The ban is now scheduled to go into effect at the end of this month. Opponents of the ban say it makes it harder for poor women, who are most likely to use Government-financed clinics, to find out about abortion.

1449-> Children At Play Saving The Earth
DEEP inside the Rube Goldberg-like Urban Tree House, 7-year-old Lillian Tagro was furiously pedaling a stationary bicycle that pumped water through clear plastic tubes, around a series of pipes and eventually onto a table piled high with crushed walnut shells. "I'm making a river," she said. The Urban Tree House, or the Sussman Environmental Center, as the new building is officially known, was built behind the Children's Museum of Manhattan, at 212 West 83d Street. The structure, which opened last week, is meant to involve children with a hands-on and entertaining experience based on the themes "reduce, recycle, re-use and rethink." Last Friday, I brought along my two children, Jake Steinberg, 9, and Lucie Steinberg, 5, to join a handful of others for a road test of the 2,000-square-foot multilevel building: a free-standing playground with a message. The children did not need a formal introduction. Past the old tires planted with spring flowers they ran, and up the metal steps to the colorful structure decorated with old tin cans, plastic bottles and bright orange traffic cones stuck into a familiar New York City icon: the water tower. Rosenwach, a company known for such things, fabricated the water tower; New York Telephone plugged into the project by donating a wad of wires; Con Edison came through with brightly colored stanchions and flashing lights. High-minded statements were behind the project, which began when the museum, which opened at the present site in November 1989, decided to address what its executive director, Andrew Ackerman, described as "the social issues that press directly on kids, such as drugs, sex and the environment." Mr. Ackerman is starting with the environment. He said he wanted to do "something benign that would help kids understand the difference they could make." About half the $250,000 budget has been raised so far from donations. Instead of lecturing, the museum decided to get children involved in doing. "Before you know it, they've learned a whole lot of information while having fun," Mr. Ackerman said. "By experiencing something you become part of it. And, by the way, where else can you slosh around in water and dirt and have your parents say 'right on'?" It might take a second visit for children to settle down and read the informative display panels. For now, this group ran from one area to another, obviously having a great time. "What's this all about?" the adults kept asking. "Fun, fun, fun," said 10-year-old Anna Sussman. Jane Clark Chermayeff, the exhibit curator, said: "The city was terrific in helping us re-use. The earth is the best recycler. Water becomes rain, then clouds. We're drinking the same water dinosaurs drank millions of years ago. This is a nature center without nature." But with worms. Joy Suarez, who runs the museum's birthday party program, was stationed at the composting corner -- dubbed "Hot Rot." Four-thousand earthworms, imported from Kalamazoo, Mich., were nibbling on leftovers. "Kids come down and play with the worms," Ms. Suarez said. "They make for an incredible party." Lucie, whose sixth birthday was rapidly approaching, was clearly not interested in celebrating that milestone in the company of worms. "Don't you have bigger ones?" asked Regis Wu, 8. "Worms are wonderful," Ms. Suarez said. "When I was a little girl, I used to love to play in the dirt. "Every two months, we plan to harvest our nutrient rich material and add it to our soil. It's so exciting. My goal is to get everyone in the city to begin using worms in their own kitchens for compost." On the top level of the building, Lu Parker, who described her job as "an interpreter of the museum," was manning the "Prove It!" section and getting ready to demonstrate the scientific properties of soil. Jake and Anna were not quite ready to attend. A few feet below, they were busy fishing for empty cans with magnetic hooks. "I got a Bumble Bee Tuna and some Goya sardines," was Jake's first cry of success. Anna bagged Geisha baby clams. "Yum, yum," she said. On the mezzanine, a few feet above them, Ms. Parker explained how to test soil. " 'Acid, base, just right,' are the three results we can get," she said, and asked Regis to squeeze a drop of lemon into a glass vial. "We need gentle hands," Ms. Parker said. Regis had them, and soon the city soil, harvested in front of the museum, and the country soil, from way out of town, yielded -- not surprisingly -- quite different results. "Isn't that my Rockland County soil?" Mr. Ackerman asked with a touch of pride. "I get assignments. 'We need leaves' or 'we need dirt.' It's great when the executive director of the museum is asked to bring in dirt. Now does this happen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art?" Regis, Lucie and Lillian were focused on the different soils. The country soil tested "just right." "Does everyone agree we should plant in this?" Ms. Parker asked. Three heads nodded in silence. Then a small plant and markers with the children's names were placed into the newly prepared pot. "Be sure to come back and visit and see how your plant is getting on," Ms. Parker said. Then it was on to the bagged garbage area. "Garbage is a big problem," said Ms. Chermayeff, who based the exhibits on her feeling that if "children can get their hands on the real working parts of the city, they'll be able to claim their place in the cycle." The children did not stop to read the printed explanation hung behind the plastic garbage bins emblazoned with numbers representing pounds, like "45" and "6 1/2" and "54" and "23," and filled with sacks of garbage. "The idea is to show children how much garbage is made every day and every week and to give them an idea of the volume and how difficult it is to dispose of," Ms. Chermayeff said. Sam Chermayeff, 10, had no trouble lifting the largest load. O.K., so he has had plenty of time to practice. His father is Ivan Chermayeff, a partner in Chermayeff & Geisma, a New York graphic-design firm, and the designer of the tree house. The other children rose to the occasion, some pairing up to hoist the bags up through the pulleys. "I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger in a 9-year-old form," Jake said. "This is making me very hungry," said Lillian, who ended up bracing herself by lying on the floor. "Let's go for pizza." Then all the children, like moths to a candle, were drawn back to the water-cycle display, designed by Bran Ferren and Michael Mensch of Associates & Ferren. Wielding scoops and shovels, they diverted rivulets of water that flowed into a large deep trough through hills and valleys of dark brown sand-like material. "That's ground-up walnut shells," Mr. Ackerman said. "We did a lot of research by calling all over the country to find the material that would have the right consistency. This stuff just washes off and doesn't stick to anything. Perfect for parents." Robert Blandford, the museum's associate director, felt it was time to turn on the Mee Fog, a system that uses a little water and shoots it out in a cool mist. The mist descended on the group like a magical cloud. "In the summer," Mr. Blandford said, "it will be our air-conditioning." Jake had another, more pressing thought. "I guess I won't be taking a shower tonight, Mom," he said. Guess again, Jake.

1450-> Right Out of the 60's, With Plenty of Hair, But Actually Dressed (Mostly in Versace)
IT was, as they used to say, a happening. Monday night's "Rock n' Rule," Gianni Versace's combination benefit fashion show and rock concert (with a bit of rap and rave thrown in), was both a throwback to the 1960's and a this-minute way to present his outrageous designs. "It will be like Barnum & Bailey," the designer had promised before the show. Well, there were no elephants or lion tamers, but there were some elements of a three-ring circus. A dozen male models and 19 female models arrayed themselves on three stages in the Seventh Regiment Armory at East 67th Street and Park Avenue, transformed into a Renaissance-style piazza for a monthlong Italian festival. The wooden cupola and arched loggias may have been incongruous, but there could not have been a more striking backdrop for Versace's neo-classical prints, gold-studded black leather, bell bottoms and bandage-wrapped bodices. The women's clothes were worn by models with towering masses of false hair and long falls straight out of the swinging 60's. Was that really Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington beneath all that hair? You bet. Along with Naomi Campbell, who wore her hair down, the supermodels were co-chairwomen of a party after the fashion show. The party went on intermittently between performances by the singers Puff Johnson and Lenny Kravitz, whose dreadlocks and maribou-trimmed outfit made their own fashion statement. After the finale of Miami-inspired prints from Versace's spring collection, there were performances by the rap group Trilogy and the rave group Soul System, and dance music spun by C & C Music Factory. The models' fake hairdos made them stand out at a dinner that preceded the fashion show and during dancing that followed until past 1:30 A.M. Nina Griscom and Sandy Hill Pittman, co-chairmen of the dinner, had done themselves up in the designer's bandage-wrapped bodices but didn't go all the way. They wore their usual simple hairstyles. No mode of dress was specified on the invitations, but every woman who owned or could borrow a Versace wore it. The designer's sister, Donatella Beck, was poured into a gold-studded black leather cat suit. Both Liz Tilberis and Anna Wintour wore his black jackets with gold studs. In a more elegant vein was the long, off-the-shoulder coral-colored princess style from Versace's couture collection worn by Ellin Saltzman, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, which co-sponsored the evening with the Italian Trade Commission. (The party raised $190,000 for the Community-Based Clinical Trial Program of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.) The male guests wore everything from casual to formal: Calvin Klein in jeans and blazer, Ken Natori in black tie. "I automatically put on black tie whenever I go out with Josie," Mr. Natori replied to teasing by Burton Tansky, Bergdorf's chairman, who was in a business suit. The 300 dinner guests included Lorraine Bracco, who sat to Versace's right, Liza Minnelli, Isaac Mizrahi, Todd Oldham, Blaine and Robert Trump, Spike Lee and John McEnroe and Tatum O'Neal. After dinner, 400 people arrived for the show, dancing and a pasta supper at midnight. Dario Mariotti, the resident manager of the Mayfair New York hotel, and his wife, Gabriella, were among the last to leave. "I can't believe we stayed until 1:30," Mrs. Mariotti said. "I never dance, but the music was irresistible." That's what happens at a happening.

1451-> BASEBALL; On the Way Out, Vincent Finally Gets a Consensus
Fay Vincent himself has emerged as the only winner in the dispute between the commissioner and a sizable group of club owners, George W. Bush, owner of the Texas Rangers, declared yesterday. "If anybody can find any winner in this mess," Bush said in a telephone interview, "it's my friend because he showed that among the rubble, there rose a dignified human being with a lot of class. He's clearly the winner as far as I'm concerned." Bush said he was surprised and saddened when Vincent called him earlier in the day and told him he had decided to resign. "But it's the commissioner's call and I completely understand," he said. "He knew some of us would stand by him until the very bitter end, and I was fully prepared to do that. This is the wrong decision by baseball, but he took a loftier position. He said 'it's not me, it's the game.' " Eli Jacobs, owner of the Baltimore Orioles and another Vincent supporter, said the now former commissioner had been "an unselfish decison-maker, not once failing to act in the best interests of baseball." "Even this final act of resignation is one I'm sure Fay considers to be the best thing for baseball given the existing divisions among ownership," said Jacobs. "I am disappointed. Baseball and its fans have lost a great friend." John McMullen of the Houston Astros, firmly in Vincent's corner despite their disagreement on many issues, said that Vincent was "personally ethical and correct." "All the decisions he made he did in the best interests of baseball," McMullen said. Stanton Cook of the Chicago Cubs used the same phrase in discussing Vincent's resignation. "I think his decision is in the best interests of baseball," said Cook, one of the leaders of the opposition movement. "Now that he has decided, we can get on with the job at hand." What is the job at hand? "To get the important issues that face baseball resolved," Cook said. The Cubs are owned by the Tribune Company, which also owns the superstation WGN. The company opposed Vincent because he was trying to reduce the impact superstations have on revenue clubs receive for local television rights. Asked about that issue, Cook did not address it directly. "It's just the general area of television is the way I would talk about it," he said. "There are a number of television issues that will be addressed, as well as several other issues." Cook said he did not know what the owners would do next. Bush said he didn't know either. "I'm at a loss to tell you what's going to happen," the Rangers' owner said. "That was one of the warnings we discussed at our meeting. What's next? What if? And who answers the questions?" Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, did not have answers yesterday. In fact, he said he had no comment at all. Donald Fehr, the head of the players' union, said he would withhold comment for the moment, but Richie Phillips, his counterpart with the umpires' union, lamented Vincent's departure. "With Peter Ueberroth, Bart Giamatti and Fay Vincent," Phillips said, "there was always an air of independence about them. It's a shame that's gone now, because there's nowhere for people throughout baseball to go. It's sad. I always felt his commitment was to the entire baseball community. The community is not 18 baseball owners, so I am disappointed that he bowed to their pressure."

1454-> BASEBALL; A Rare and Extremely Modest Road Streak for Mets
The lead was shrinking for the Mets. A 5-2 margin had been reduced to 5-3 after a Braves run in the seventh. The 5-3 edge was trimmed by another run in the eighth. Sid Fernandez, hurt, was done for the night, and the Mets' closer, the ailing John Franco, wasn't on call. Soon enough, the phone was ringing in the bullpen. Anthony Young, the right-hander, was up throwing when he heard the call, and he knew what he had to do. "There was no reason to pace myself," said Young, the converted starter who came in to replace Lee Guetterman with one out in the ninth, David Justice on first base and the Mets clinging to a 5-4 lead. "I went after it. All I told myself was make quality pitches." Young made six of them. He struck out Brian Hunter. He then got Damon Berryhill on strikes for the final out to give the Mets a second straight victory over the Braves. "The manager doesn't have a set closer," said Young, who earned his second save. "I could be used in long relief, short relief. The idea is to be ready." No one was quite ready for what happened in the seventh. Fernandez, who had pitched with the consistency and capability that had been his 1992 trademark, had a 5-2 lead and apparent control of the game at his fingertips. But he had complained privately of tenderness in his elbow, and a leadoff triple by David Justice brought Manager Jeff Torborg out of the dugout determined to remove Fernandez, but unsure about little else. "I didn't have anything definitive in mind," Torborg said. The manager ultimately opted to call on Guetterman and reserve Young for the night's closer role. Guetterman gave up a sacrifice fly to Hunter that closed the score to 5-3. And in the eighth, he yielded a leadoff homer to Lonnie Smith to shrink the margin to 5-4. But the left-hander, himself a reclamation project, got through the eighth and got an out in the ninth before Justice singled. 'Never Get Beat' Franco, his left elbow bothered by an inflamed tendon, could only sit and watch as the call went down for Young. And then Franco could only root. "A. Y. has the right makeup," Franco said. "I've told him in those spots you just have to throw." It helps that the best pitches Young throws are sinking fastballs and sliders. The right-hander, in following the code of conduct for closers, has streamlined his repertory of pitches. "I've been told that in those moments you should never get beat with your third or fourth pitches," Young said. Young, other than a hard liner foul on his first pitch to Hunter, didn't get touched, much less beat. And so the Mets, with their second straight triumph at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, have rekindled the notion that they just might be able to restore respectability to their reputation before the All-Star Game break. There was enough early offense and enough stable pitching by Fernandez for a little breathing room to negotiate the final innings. Eddie Murray and Daryl Boston doubled back to back off Mike Bielecki in the second inning, and Mackey Sasser and Howard Johnson added r.b.i. singles as the Mets claimed a rare 3-0 lead, one that might as well have been an apparition the way things had gone at the plate for the Mets in 1992. And when Fernandez, who had sailed through the first three innings without allowing a baserunner, faltered in the fourth and allowed a pair of runs, the Mets found a way to answer. Bobby Bonilla walked and Murray doubled for the second time against Bielecki in the sixth. And then with one out left to work with, Dave Gallagher hit a chop to third that Terry Pendleton butchered into a two-run error. INSIDE PITCH SID FERNANDEZ, who was diagnosed as again suffering from inflammation in his elbow, once more dismissed the problem as minor. "I'm not concerned," Fernandez said. The left-hander, arguably the most consistent pitcher for the Mets this season, had been lifted from two of his last three official starts because of the tenderness. . . . JOHN FRANCO threw Tuesday for the first time since he was found to have an inflamed tendon in his elbow. "I still felt it," Franco said. "It's hard to explain. It's not a burning sensation. It's like an ache." . . . Manager JEFF TORBORG said he had told his closer that he would be willing to rest him through the All-Star Game break, but that he was also agreeable to going with one less pitcher and gamble that Franco might get better. . . . BILL PECOTA started at shortstop to give DICK SCHOFIELD a rest. Schofield came in as a defensive replacement in the seventh. The Mets won their second straight road game for the first time since May 23. . . . MACKEY SASSER started behind the plate, and Torborg said he would at least consider giving Sasser a stretch of games as a starter.

1455-> Campus Journal; The Life of an Anarchist Captured on Microfilm
When her Irish Setter bounded into a guitar shop with her, Candace S. Falk, a young graduate student, thought she would get an unfriendly reaction. Instead the store-owner stroked the pet and asked its name. The answer sent him hurrying down to the store's basement to fetch an abandoned box of letters signed by the dog's namesake -- the turn-of-the-century anarchist "Red Emma" Goldman. Ms. Falk's discovery, in 1975, of that boot-sized box filled with letters between Emma Goldman and her lover, Ben Reitman, led her to begin a 12-year research project that was completed last month at the University of California at Berkeley. Goldman was "an advocate of free speech, women's issues and world peace," Ms. Falk said, so "the perfect place for a historical project on Emma Goldman was, of course, Berkeley." "There's such a range of politics in Berkeley that even in a time when 'politically correct' is so caricatured, people here resist clumping everyone on the left together," she said. Over the years more than 100 graduate students, professors and, in Ms. Falk's words, "elderly anarchists" have been involved in collating the material for publication. It is now available, fully annotated, on 69 reels of microfilm at 13 libraries nationwide, including the New York Public Library and the Olin Library at Cornell University. Ms. Falk also plans to publish the highlights in a book. Working out of a small, bright bungalow, the Emma Goldman Papers team tracked down, read, dated and indexed some 40,000 documents from all over the world. The walls are lined with copies of newspaper articles, legal documents, cartoons and photographs of a serious, dark-haired woman wearing pince-nez and a high-collared shirt. This woman, who was born in 1869 in Lithuania and died in 1940, wrote as many as a dozen letters a day. The collection contains more than 18,000 letters she exchanged with prominent figures of the early 20th century, including Albert Einstein, H. G. Wells, the birth-control advocate Margaret Sanger and Roger Baldwin, who later said Goldman had inspired him to found the American Civil Liberties Union. As a student at the University of Chicago in the 1960's, Ms. Falk was protesting the Vietnam War when she first heard Goldman's name. Reading Goldman's 1931 autobiography, 'Living My Life,' Ms. Falk discovered a kindred spirit who had opposed the draft during World War I. Many of the student researchers "find something in Goldman that resonates with who they are," the 44-year-old Ms. Falk said, "whether they are socialists and feel like outcasts, or gay and want open sexual expression." Goldman addressed these issues, and also spoke out on topics like free love, birth control and the eight-hour work day. Rachel Rivera, 31, worked on the Goldman papers while a graduate student in journalism at Berkeley. "With all the debate over government censorship and intrusion," she said, "I often think how great it would be if she were around today." Some Berkeley students not involved with the project have had the chance to appreciate it, and even contribute. At a talk Ms. Falk gave on Goldman, Kirin Contractor was moved by the story of this controversial woman, and wrote of it to her mother in the Indian Himalayas. Her mother replied with the news that Ms. Contractor's grandmother had been good friends with Goldman and that they had exchanged many letters. After sitting for years in a trunk in the Himalayas, those letters are now included in the collection. After the recent riots in Los Angeles, a consortium of 28 Los Angeles high schools asked the Berkeley team if they could develop a Goldman curriculum, one that would show how Goldman maintained a vision of hope while expressing the alienation felt by a marginal member of society. It has just been completed. After giving a talk on Goldman at an Oakland high school this year, Ms. Falk took out a bag of buttons quoting Goldman: "The most violent element in society is ignorance." All 50 students, she said, went away wearing Emma Goldman's words.

1456-> Ernest Volwiler, 99, Medicinal Chemistry Leader
Dr. Ernest H. Volwiler, a leader in medicinal chemistry who did groundbreaking work in anesthetics in the 1930's, died Saturday at the Westmoreland nursing home in Lake Forest, Ill. A longtime resident of nearby Highland Park, he was 99 years old. Dr. Volwiler spent his entire career with Abbott Laboratories, where he rose from a researcher to chairman. Assisted by Dr. Donalee Tabern, he formulated Nembutal in 1930 and, six years later, sodium Pentothal. The drugs are commonly used as the first anesthetic with which to put a patient to sleep for surgical or dental procedures. Duane L. Burnham, Abbott's current chairman and chief executive, said the formulation of the two drugs were breakthroughs in anesthetics medicine. Aside from the development of anesthetics, Dr. Volwiler also contributed to their commercial production, and in World War II he directed the production of sulfa drugs and penicillin, which are used to fight certain bacterial infections. Ernest Volwiler was born in Hamilton, Ohio, grew up on a farm and taught all grades in a country school to raise money for his college tuition. He graduated cum laude from Miami University of Ohio in just three years. He earned master's and doctorate degrees in chemistry at the University of Illinois. Wallace C. Abbott himself asked Dr. Volwiler in 1918 to join his pharmaceutical company. It was to be the young chemist's sole place of employment. He began as a researcher. In 1920 he became chief chemist, a post he held for 10 years. Then came three years as director of research, after which he was vice president in charge of research and development until 1946. He served as executive vice president until 1950. Dr. Volwiler was the company's president and general manager from 1950 to 1958, when he was elected chairman. He retired the following year. He was a past president and chairman of the American Chemical Society, which presented him with its highest honor, the Priestley Medal, in 1958. He was inducted into the National Inventors' Hall of Fame in 1985. Dr. Volwiler's wife of 71 years, the former Lillian F. Huggler, preceded him in death. He is survived by two daughters, Doris Semler of Arlington Heights, Ill., and Margery Grinnell of Edina, Minn.; a son, Wallace E. Volwiler of Morrison, Colo.; nine grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.

1459-> BASEBALL; Mets Win One Over Phillies
The Mets are 10 games under .500; the Phillies have reached sub-27. The Mets are 15 1/2 games behind the National League East-leading Pirates; the Phillies are a whopping 24 games back. The Mets have six players on the disabled list; the Phillies have eight. These two teams met tonight at Veterans Stadium. Needless to say, scintillating September baseball was not on display. The Mets' starter, Pete Schourek, battled through mechanical problems and a questionable curveball. Terry Mulholland, the Phillies' starter, just battled. Schourek and the Mets won, 6-3. Schourek pitched six and two-thirds innings, giving up 10 hits but only two earned runs. Anthony Young earned his 13th save when he came in with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the ninth and forced Mariano Duncan to hit an infield grounder to end the game. Schourek himself hit a sacrifice fly to drive in the game-winning run. For the Mets, the game was so much routine: six hits scattered among six different batters, an early lead that ended up getting threatened, and a player -- this time, Vince Coleman -- leaving in mid-game with an injury of some sort. Coleman strained his left ribs and came out after the seventh inning.

1462-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview; BUSH AND CLINTON PULL NO PUNCHES IN HOLIDAY RALLIES
President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton opened their fall campaigns yesterday with a struggle over the mantle of Harry S. Truman: Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton lacked the character to claim it; Mr. Clinton asserted that Mr. Bush was destroying the very middle class that President Truman had helped to create. Mr. Clinton chose Truman's hometown, Independence, Mo., for the Labor Day kickoff to his campaign, presenting himself as the committed champion of "the great American middle class" in the Truman tradition. In a rousing speech delivered on the courthouse steps in a heavy rain, Mr. Clinton assailed Mr. Bush as a man who did not recognize the nation's economic suffering, its aspirations or its needs, and who had no right to claim political kinship with the Democratic President from Missouri, as Mr. Bush has done in recent weeks. "Harry Truman did not wake up every morning worrying about how to lower taxes one more time on millionaires," Mr. Clinton declared. "Harry Truman gave the special interests hell. George Bush is giving it to you, and it's time you took your future back." Sparring in the Midwest Mr. Bush, campaigning at a picnic in Waukesha, Wis., acknowledged that it was an uncertain time in the global economy, but he accused Mr. Clinton of trying "to scare American workers so that he can slip into office with that failed tax-and-spend policy of the past." The President, who has frequently called up the memory of Truman's come-from-behind victory in recent weeks, talked yesterday of Truman's leadership traits, and asserted that Mr. Clinton fell far short of them. Opening a new line of Republican attack, an energized Mr. Bush declared: "Harry Truman was a man of decisiveness, not equivocation. He'd find little in common with Governor Clinton, a man who hedges or ducks on almost every tough issue." Mr. Bush also mounted an indirect attack on Mr. Clinton's lack of military service during the Vietnam War, an issue that has dogged the Governor from Arkansas in recent days and that prompted an angry outburst from him yesterday morning. Accusing reporters of engaging in a "feeding frenzy" over an old issue, Mr. Clinton asserted it was time for them to direct their aggressiveness toward Mr. Bush and the Iran-contra affair. [ Page A17. ] The day's exchanges came as Mr. Clinton campaigned in Missouri and Ohio before ending the day in Connecticut, and Mr. Bush roared through Wisconsin and Michigan, all considered important swing states this fall. While Labor Day has traditionally marked the start of the general election campaign, the tone of the day underscored a struggle that has been going on for weeks. The Truman debate arises in a year when voters, implicitly or explicitly, seem to be looking for plain-spoken, truth-telling leadership. Ross Perot evoked many comparisons to Truman earlier this year. And Mr. Bush, when his poll ratings sank this summer, began comparing himself to Truman, who in 1948 won re-election against the odds by beating Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York. Mr. Clinton sought yesterday to reclaim the popular memory of Truman for the Democrats. Beyond the battle over Truman, the day offered a case study in the themes expected to dominate the next 56 days. Mr. Bush argued that his domestic plans have been stymied by a "gridlock Congress," that he was committed to ensuring "economic security" in his next Administration, and that the nation was on the mend and on the rise. 'Beneath the Rhetoric' "My opponent will kick off his campaign with a message of fear," said Mr. Bush, who began a full day of campaigning with a walk across a five-mile bridge in upper Michigan, and pressed the flesh with gusto along the rope lines this afternoon. But he urged voters "to look beneath the rhetoric and look at the facts." Campaigning later in Hamtramck, Mich., where he marched in a Polish-American parade, Mr. Bush also defended his emphasis on foreign policy in his first term. "There are those who tell me that foreign policy doesn't matter," Mr. Bush declared to an audience composed heavily of Polish and other Eastern European-Americans. "I say, tell that to the immigrants of America. Tell that to our children, who can sleep free of the nuclear nightmare and dream the sweet dream of peace." Mr. Clinton argued that the nation was at a turning point and badly needed a new economic course. "This election provides Americans their clearest choice in a generation," he declared in Missouri. "A choice between hope and fear, between running in place and moving ahead, between more of the same old trickle down and embarking on a new course to guarantee old opportunities in the American Dream." Mr. Clinton dismissed the Republicans' charge that his election would mean a throwback to "tax and spend" liberalism. "We've got to go beyond trickle-down economics," he said, "not back to tax and spend, but ahead to invest, and educate, and cooperate, and compete, and grow -- putting people first." In recalling Truman, he said the former President had left as a legacy "the great American middle class," which he described as "the generation of Americans who went to college because of the G.I. Bill, who were able to buy a home because of F.H.A. and V.A. mortgages, who raised my generation with the hope and the opportunity that all things were possible." "George Bush's legacy." he said, "is the destruction of that very middle class." He added: "He has blamed his failures on everything from the Federal Reserve to Saddam Hussein, from Congress to consumers to the press. He says the recession is really over; we just don't know it. And if it's not really over, it is because we have an attitude problem. The buck doesn't stop with George Bush; it doesn't even slow down there." 'Waffling and Wavering' Mr. Bush, speaking earlier in the day in Wisconsin, set up his own Truman test. He noted that the Missouri Democrat knew what it meant to be a businessman and a political underdog, "and so do I." The President then proceeded to mine a vulnerability that has caused problems for Mr. Clinton in the past: the charge that he is a straddler. "Whether it was the Soviet blockade of Berlin or the invasion of Korea, Harry Truman never flinched from the tough decision," Mr. Bush said. "Contrast that with Governor Clinton's waffling and wavering about whether he would have followed my lead and stood up to Saddam Hussein and his naked aggression." Mr. Clinton managed to escape the rain at his second stop of the day, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. rally in Cincinnati, where he was joined by his running mate, Senator Al Gore. Hillary Clinton, who was at the rally as well, received the longest and most sustained applause of the event. Vice-Presidential Campaigning Senator Al Gore, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, spent part of his day at an event that captured the party's traditions: a rally in downtown Detroit, attended by Owen Bieber, the head of the United Automobile Workers, Mayor Coleman Young, and a host of other Democratic luminaries. Mr. Gore said the steel in the bridge that Mr. Bush had crossed in Michigan that morning was made at a U.S. Steel plant shut down earlier this year. "Mr. Bush, you can walk across the bridge for a photo opportunity, but you've got to be thinking about the jobs of the people who built that bridge that you just put out of work," Mr. Gore declared. Vice President Quayle, who had begun a Western swing in Colorado, criticized Mr. Gore, asserting that his rival's environmental policies would lead to higher taxes. Mr. Quayle also told an enthusiastic audience at Mesa State College that Mr. Clinton had chosen as his running mate a man who was, when it came to spending, "bigger than Ted Kennedy, bigger than Howard Metzenbaum, bigger than Tim Wirth." Mr. Quayle also said that President Bush realized that raising taxes was a mistake, and the Democrats "just don't get it."

1463-> COMPANY NEWS; ELECTRIC BOAT WILL ELIMINATE 1,500 POSITIONS
The Electric Boat division of the General Dynamics Corporation plans to eliminate 1,500 jobs in 1993 -- half the originally scheduled number. The shipyard's president, Roger E. Tetrault, attributed the change to higher-than-anticipated attrition and delays in construction of the second Seawolf submarine. He declined to estimate how many of the 1,500 jobs will be eliminated through attrition, early retirements or layoffs. Electric Boat has about 19,000 employees.

1464-> A New Era for Windmill Power
A new generation of windmills that Don Quixote could never tilt at is ready to take its place as an economical and important source of the nation's energy. Because of striking improvements in technology, the commercial use of these windmills, or wind turbines as the builders call them, has shown that in addition to being pollution free, they can now compete with fossil fuels in the cost of producing electricity. As a result, officials of utility companies from around the world have come, cash in hand, to California to inspect the tops of the ridges here at the Altamont Pass, for example, where new machines that look like sideways helicopters married to computers are harnessing the wind. In recent months, utilities serving upstate New York Illinois, Iowa, California and the Netherlands have decided to try to use the wind to produce electricity commercially. Competing With Fossil Fuels Kingsley E. Chatton, president of U.S. Windpower, which operates 22 new-generation windmills here, said the economics of wind power was at the point where it "will compete with fossil fuel." Others agree. Edgar A. DeMeo, in charge of renewable-energy research at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nationwide research consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., said the work in California represented a significant advance. Mr. DeMeo's organization, which is supported by dues from utilities, carries out wide-ranging investigations on new technologies and ways to improve existing technologies involving all sorts of power sources. "We're beyond Kitty Hawk and into the jet age," he said. The turbines are a successor to the thousands of crude, flimsy windmills put up by optimistic pioneers of the early 1980's, machines that generated more tax credits than electricity and by now have largely disappeared. Capturing More Energy The new windmills capture far more of the wind's energy -- a surprisingly tricky feat. Wind varies greatly, but electricity must be so uniform that a user can, for example, set a clock by it. Uniformity has been largely achieved with durable, high-technology adjustable fiberglass propeller blades directed by computers. Wind turbines cannot replace fuel-burning plants completely because the wind cannot be ordered to blow. But it can be counted on enough over time to produce substantial amounts of energy and thus reduce conventional generation with its emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and carbon dioxide, the biggest greenhouse gas. Wind can also be used to save the water behind hydroelectric dams to last through dry seasons. In some locations, wind is reliable enough to be counted on at certain hours of the day or seasons of the year. The newest generation of windmills thus crosses an economic threshold that will allow their use in many areas of the country, although it will take several years before they produce a large fraction of the nation's electricity. Mr. DeMeo said he would not be surprised to see windmills generate 10 percent in 30 years -- about equal to the share now produced by hydroelectricity. He predicted that successive generations of windmills, building on the combination of sophisticated blades and computer control, would be bigger and would not need costly items like gearboxes, lowering costs further. A Cold, Noisy Wind On a recent morning here atop the Altamont Pass, about 30 miles east of San Francisco, the wind, at 30 miles an hour, was strong enough to whip open a car door as soon as the passenger began to open it. The turbines whined at different pitches, while the cold wind whistled through the 80-foot towers covering the bare hills. None of this seemed to bother the cows or the ground squirrels, but for a visitor it was altogether eerie. "Kind of a nice day, isn't it?" Chuck Ferguson, a field engineer, said as he opened the power electronics box at the base of one tower. It was generating enough electricity to run about 80 houses with their central air-conditioners going, meaning the 22 machines here can power thousands of homes and businesses. That's a lot of tilting. Mr. Chatton of U.S. Windpower said the cost of wind-turbine production, from capital investment to operation and maintenance, was about five cents a kilowatt-hour, roughly half the average retail price for power nationwide. A kilowatt-hour is enough electricity to light 10 100-watt bulbs for an hour. At an oil-fired plant, that much electricity costs about 5 cents in fuel alone, apart from capital investment, operation and maintenance expenses. So a power company that now uses oil could save money by building windmills. Cheaper to Build Windmills At existing plants that run on coal and natural gas, generation costs are lower, and the money to build the plants has already been spent. But in many locations, building new wind turbines may be cheaper than building new fossil-fuel-burning plants. Coal-burning utilities with no need for new capacity also have an incentive to turn to wind. The Federal Clean Air Act limits their sulfur dioxide emissions, often requiring them to buy cleaner fuel at a premium, or to buy "emissions allowances" from utilities that are cleaner than the standard required. Windmills do not pollute. Not that they are completely benign. Some complain that windmills clutter up the landscape. And in some places, environmentalists have said windmill blades have killed birds. Here at Livermore, U.S. Windpower has painted some blades with a striped pattern to see if this will keep birds away. Company officials say they have not found dead birds at any of the machines, striped or not. Still, windmill use is spreading. U.S. Windpower, a subsidiary of the Kenetech Corporation, has recently announced these projects: *A joint venture with the Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company to develop 250 megawatts worth of windmills, that is, about 600 windmills. A megawatt is a thousand kilowatts. *The sale of a 50-megawatt plant to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which is seeking to replace the output of a retired nuclear plant. *The construction of a 25-megawatt plant in Holland, with the power to be bought by Energiebedrijf voor Groningen en Drenthe, known as E.G.D., and the sale of a 50-megawatt plant to four utilities in the Pacific Northwest. U.S. Windpower also plans to have two turbines installed by Nov. 1 for the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation in upstate New York, to see how they work in cold weather. The Iowa-Illinois and Pacific Northwest deals are particularly significant because of the role utilities will play, as owners or co-owners, rather than buyers of power. The utilities can also supply money for capital costs at far lower rates than start-up high-technology companies can obtain. The Last Windmill Maker U.S. Windpower, the only American company that builds windmills, has outlasted the others and has 138 patents on its equipment. Some smaller concerns, however, do assemble windmills from imported components. U.S. Windpower's parent, Kenetech, is owned in part by its management and in part by the Hillman Company, Allstate Insurance, F. H. Prince & Company and a variety of other, smaller investors. Last year, the company had revenues of about $350 million. To produce alternating current at precisely 60 cycles a second, the standard for this country since early in the century, most traditional windmills have been designed to turn at only one speed. If the wind is not strong enough to turn the blades at that speed, no power is produced. If the wind blows more strongly, anything above the minimum amount of energy needed to produce electricity is wasted by the blades. Worse, on a really windy day the machines cannot work at all because they would be damaged. Combining Two Technologies The new generation of machines is a marriage of aerodynamics and microelectronics. U.S. Windpower adapted the idea of variable-pitch blades from airplanes and developed a system to let the blades and the generator turn at whatever speed the wind allows. Computers open and close electronic circuits to smooth out the air flow over the blades and create electric current that alternates at the right cycles. The result: while older machines produce no power until the wind reaches 14 miles an hour, the new ones start making electricity at 9 miles an hour. The older ones shut down at 45 miles an hour; new ones work at up to 60. Another innovation is size, with new machines having a bladespan of about 100 feet, up from 56 feet in previous designs. That means four times as much power, at a total cost only about two and a half times more. There have also been improvements in the blades, which are now 2,000-pound fiberglass structures derived from sailboat masts. The ridges where U.S. Windpower's turbines stand are between California's sunny central valley and the cloud-bound coast. Every day, the sun warms the air in the valley and as the hot air rises, cooler air from the coast rushes in to fill the void. This gives the site more predictable winds than most other places. But the "wind resource," as proponents call it, is not peculiar to California. In fact, by national standards, California is not particularly windy: a strip of states from North Dakota to Texas has far more wind. And although electricity is usually generated within a few hundred miles of where it will be consumed, Texas alone could, theoretically, generate 36 percent more kilowatt-hours from wind than are used in the entire continental United States.

1465-> Fed Division On Rate Cut
Most Federal Reserve System leaders favored cutting interest rates when they met June 30 and July 1 if new signs of economic weakness appeared, minutes of the session released today show. The minutes showed that the panel was divided on the interest rate cut, which occurred July 2. The cut occurred after the Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate bounded to 7.8 percent in June from 7.5 percent in May as the number of nonfarm jobs fell by 63,000. The Fed pushed the discount rate to 3 percent from 3 1/2 percent on loans that it makes to banks, and pressured the Federal funds rate on loans between banks to a target of 3 1/4 percent from 3 3/4 on July 2. The Federal Open Market Committee, which heavily influences the Federal funds rate, was split on whether interest rates should be cut in a 10-to-2 vote during the June 30-July 1 meeting. Voting against a rate cut were John P. LaWare, governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Thomas Melzer, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.

1466-> THE SUPREME COURT; Long Battles Over Abortion Are Seen
Both sides in the abortion debate said that yesterday's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey guaranteed many more years of legislation and litigation over how far states may go to restrict abortion. "The only thing this means is full employment for lawyers," said Kathryn Kolbert of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which represented Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania. "I expect many, many attempts by anti-abortion legislators to create new restrictions, and a great deal more litigation." Experts said it appeared that laws in the three places that have a near-total ban on abortion -- Louisiana, Utah and the territory of Guam -- would not stand. But they also predicted more moves by states to regulate abortion, perhaps adopting as models the provisions upheld by the Court yesterday and models still to be developed. Outcomes Are Predicted Although challenges to the three virtual bans are now making their way through the courts, most abortion experts said that yesterday's ruling all but foreclosed the possibility that they would be upheld by the High Court. Only four of the Justices indicated support for overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion a fundamental constitutional right. "I'd say that the Pennsylvania ruling pretty much decides the Louisiana case," said Burke Balch, the state legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. "I don't think there's any point passing more laws banning abortion as long as we're one vote shy." Mr. Balch characterized the Pennsylvania case as a stunning reaffirmation of Roe v. Wade. "We've been fighting to overturn Roe v. Wade for 20 years, and if necessary we'll fight for 20 more, but for now, we've lost," he said. "The Court has made it clear that 1.6 million children will continue to die each year, and states have no ability to protect them from abortion." Both sides agreed that the Pennsylvania decision is likely to spur a new round of state laws creating procedural obstacles to abortion. "I think we're going to see dozens of new laws restricting abortion," said Dawn Johnsen, the legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. "The bulk of the reaction will not come until January, when the vast majority of the state legislatures begin their new session. We have a list of 26 states that we consider at high risk of enacting additional restrictions." She and others said that they could not anticipate what kind of restrictions anti-abortion legislators might propose, but that they felt sure new legislative models would be introduced. But anti-abortion groups said that while the Pennsylvania decision allowed some restrictions, it did not give them great leeway in trying to prevent abortions. Denise Neary, executive director of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, said yesterday that she did not expect to propose any further tightening of the Pennsylvania abortion law. "I don't think the Court decision today gives us too much more room to do anything substantial in Pennsylvania," said Ms. Neary, who called the High Court ruling a limited victory. "The majority opinion reaffirming Roe v. Wade doesn't let us do much to protect human life." The Casey decision reaffirmed Pennsylvania's right to require that girls under 18 get a parent's consent, or approval from a judge, before getting an abortion. Such laws are currently being enforced in 17 states; another 16 have similar laws, many of them under court injunction. 'Informed Consent' Cleared The Pennsylvania decision also clears the way for states to enforce what are known as "informed consent" laws, requiring doctors to discuss alternatives to abortion, and to offer pictures of fetal development. In some states, as in Pennsylvania, the informed consent laws also require a wait of a day or two between the time a woman gets the information and the time she has the abortion. Currently, 13 states have laws requiring waiting periods, but these laws have not been enforced because Supreme Court rulings in 1983 and 1986 found them unconstitutional. Another 15 states have other, less restrictive, informed-consent laws. The Court yesterday struck down a portion of Pennsylvania's law requiring that married women notify their husbands of their intention to get abortions -- another form of restriction that has been found unconstitutional but is on the books, thought not enforced, in nine additional states. Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, who supported the law, said the Supreme Court ruling was a "victory for the unborn child." "The decision moves the country sharply away from abortion on demand and begins to re-establish in our law, in a balanced and reasonable way, the historic and traditional rights of members of the family: mothers, their unborn children, parents," he said. But abortion rights groups say the ultimate fate of the Pennsylvania abortion law remains in doubt. "There could very well be a second trial," said Ms. Kolbert. "The Supreme Court left open the possibility that we could bring in additional facts to show that some parts of the law do place an undue burden on women's rights to abortion. We have those facts, but we were not emphasizing undue burden in our litigation, since that was not the standard that applied until now." The ruling in the Pennsylvania case does not automatically put into effect any state laws regarding abortion, but it will have an impact on states with similar laws. In Ohio, which like Pennsylvania has legislation requiring a 24-hour wait and counseling on alternatives, abortion experts also expect continued litigation before enforcement begins. As a practical matter, the kind of restrictions upheld by the Court do not prevent most women from getting abortions, but they do make the process more cumbersome and costly. For example, a rural 17-year old in Honesdale in Pennsylvania's Wayne County, who today could drive four hours to the Allentown Woman's Center, pay $285, have an abortion, and drive home four hours later, will have a more difficult time when the law goes into effect. First, she would need to get the consent of a parent or, if she felt she could not tell a parent, find a lawyer and schedule a hearing to get a judge's approval. Then she would have go to the clinic for the counseling, wait a day, and return for the actual procedure. Those who work at abortion clinics say the obstacles may prove overwhelming to many of their clients. "Usually, the women we see from rural areas are very poor and have a hard time getting here even once," said Janis Glenn, director of Patient Services at the Allentown Women's Center, which serves women from 18 counties. "The 24-hour waiting period may be a dead end for women who would need to stay overnight." Then, too, the cost of abortions will likely be increased by the requirement that the informed consent counseling be conducted, one on one, by a doctor, rather than a counselor, as is currently the common practice. "It's going to increase our costs, since most of our doctors work for us only part-time, and we will have a lot of scheduling problems," said Carol Rogers, director of public affairs at Planned Parenthood of Ohio, who also worried that the counseling requirement may make it harder to recruit doctors into abortion practice. She and many other abortion-rights leaders said the decision would be a spur to new political action. "We've been lobbying for 15 years, and now we're going to focus on changing faces instead of changing minds," she said. "It's time for new legislators." Both sides said the abortion debate will now turn to the Congress and the Freedom of Choice Act, which would codify abortion rights, and prevent restrictions such as those contained in the Pennsylvania bill. "If Bush vetoes the Freedom of Choice Act, I think the American voters will veto him," said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League. "The Pennsylvania decision is a disaster, and to say Roe is overturned just a little bit is like saying a woman is a little bit pregnant. But it does make clear to the American people that we're only one Supreme Court Justice away from a complete criminalization of abortion, and their Presidential votes will be critical." Generally, said Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, the states where the right to abortion is most vulnerable, besides Utah and Louisiana, are North Dakota, South Dakota, Mississippi, Ohio, Illinois, Wyoming and Idaho.

1467-> Giorgio Perlasca, 82; Helped Jews Flee Nazis
Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian businessman who saved more than 3,000 Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps in World War II, died on Aug. 15 at his home in Padua, Italy. He was 82 years old. Mr. Perlasca died of a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Trapped in Budapest late in the war by the fall of the fascist Italian Government, Mr. Perlasca, a livestock trader, joined in a plan conceived by international relief workers and diplomats from neutral countries to save as many Jews as possible from the Nazis. When the Spanish diplomatic representative fled Budapest in November 1944, Mr. Perlasca, who had been a volunteer in Franco's army in the Spanish Civil War, persuaded Hungary to accept him as the Spanish representative, and in two months he issued travel documents to thousands of Jews to save them from deportation. In 1987 Mr. Perlasca, whose achievements had gone largely unnoticed, was made an honorary citizen of Israel and was honored by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum there. In 1990 he received the Medal of Remembrance of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. A tall, quiet man, Mr. Perlasca told The Jerusalem Post in 1987 that he had been motivated by neither religion nor politics. "I couldn't ignore it," he said. "I did what I had to do. I was lucky. I had friends among the Jews who were being killed by the Nazis. That gave me courage." Mr. Perlasca is survived by his wife, Romilda, a son, and a grandson.

Tenneco Inc. said that it had completed a $3 billion restructuring begun nearly a year ago by completing the sale of its pulp chemicals business to Sterling Chemicals Inc. for about $202 million. Tenneco's restructuring included the sale of $1.5 billion in assets, issuance of $716 million of new equity, $650 million in cost reductions and $250 million in retained earnings from a 50 percent cut in the common stock dividend. Tenneco, based in Houston, has major business interests in natural gas pipelines, farm and construction equipment, automotive parts, shipbuilding, packaging and chemicals. The restructuring has raiseed earnings for Tenneco after it lost $748 million last year. In the second quarter, the company posted net income of $178 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with a loss of $14 million in the period a year earlier.

1471-> Give Oregon Health Plan a Chance
Health Secretary Louis Sullivan rejected Oregon's application to reform its Medicaid program because, he claimed, the plan would discriminate against the disabled. But he provided only flimsy evidence to back up the charge, inviting suspicion that the decision had more to do with election year politics than legal niceties. Indeed, Gov. Barbara Roberts charges that the Administration rejected the plan before it granted Oregon an ample opportunity to respond. The Administration gets a chance to explain itself next week when it meets in Oregon with state officials. If it can't produce a bill of particulars, the Governor deserves to be granted her request that President Bush overturn the rejection. Like every other state, Oregon rations medical care to poor families by excluding many of them from Medicaid coverage. The proposed plan would ration care a different way: Every poor resident would be covered, but only for the most effective procedures. To this end, the state ranked 709 medical procedures and decided it could afford to cover the first 587 on the list. The rankings reflected judgments about which treatments helped patients, disabled or not. But Mr. Sullivan charged that the rankings also reflected community surveys about "quality of life" that reflected bias against the disabled. Yet he could point to only three examples, none convincing. Besides, Oregon has demonstrated willingness to rid the plan of legal problems and to allay the fears of critics -- including child welfare advocates -- that it will cover fewer and fewer procedures over time. But the Administration didn't bother to notice. An election year is an awkward moment for Washington to approve a program that would openly ration care and provide money for abortions. But Oregon, faced with tight budgets and no national health reform in sight, made a hard, honorable choice. Its decision to cover every poor person adequately, but not completely, may not be to everyone's liking. But without evidence of invidious discrimination, the choice ought to be Oregon's.

1472-> THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: California; For Bush, California Seems a Lost Cause
Republicans have all but given up on winning California for President Bush, essentially writing off the largest electoral prize of all to Gov. Bill Clinton. Although Mr. Bush carried California in 1988, he has never played particularly well on the West Coast, and his standing has sunk to historic lows in this state, where, on his watch, the economy has turned from the nation's most vibrant to a basket case. In addition, Republican messages on abortion and "family values" have alienated many voters. New public polls show a commanding lead for Mr. Clinton, regardless of any move by Ross Perot to re-enter the race, confirming the grim news that Republican consultants find in their private polling. Publicly, Gov. Pete Wilson, the titular head of the Bush campaign here, and other California Republican leaders express optimism that the President can still overcome a deficit of about 20 points in what Mr. Wilson calls a "volatile" race for the state's 54 electoral votes. But privately, barring a major gaffe by Mr. Clinton or damaging new personal disclosures about him, Republican strategists here are now focusing on Congressional and state legislative races. They fear that a Bush disaster will prevent the big gains they considered possible after reapportionment. The Candidate as Stranger While the Bush campaign asserts that its California effort is unabated, Mr. Bush has made only one campaign trip here since his nomination in mid-August, concentrating instead on closer races in the Midwest and South. He has no more visits planned; Mr. Clinton has been here nine times since his nomination in mid-July. The Bush-Quayle camp is, of course, not expected to fold tents, if only to keep Mr. Clinton focused on California and to help Republican fund raising. "We are certainly not writing the state off," said James Lee, spokesman for the Bush campaign here. "That would hurt Republican candidates down the line. It is still very early in the ball game." But others say the underlying reality is clear. "I don't think Bush has a chance," said Joe Scott, editor of California Eye, a political newsletter. "We are dealing with an economic situation Californians have not dealt with in 50 years. Pocketbook issues are overshadowing single-issue concerns. Conservatives are peeling off, and Reagan Democrats are coming home." Falling Away of the Faithful If George Bush wants to know why his chances are so dim here, he need only ask Barry Stratton, his former precinct leader in the conservative San Diego suburb of Poway. Mr. Stratton, a 37-year-old life-long Republican who works in a property management office, is now a Clinton volunteer. "What really changed my mind was this extreme turn to the right," Mr. Stratton said. "It's what you saw at the convention. That really scared me. They want a religious war, and I don't think that's what the American people want. They want the Republican Party out of their homes, and they want to get the economy back on track." Recent polls show that Mr. Stratton is not alone: *The latest Field Poll, released Sept. 17, showed Mr. Clinton ahead 49 percent to 30 percent, with 14 percent favoring Ross Perot. It is a measure of Mr. Bush's troubles that this was a considerable improvement for him; in July the Field Poll had him trailing by 28 points. (The latest sample was of 1,040 Californians, 864 of them registered voters, polled Sept. 9-15.) *A poll by The Los Angeles Times, published Sept. 15, gave Mr. Clinton a 21-point lead, whether or not Mr. Perot was a candidate. It found that 1 of every 6 Republicans and 1 of every 4 conservatives were defecting to the Democratic candidate, while only 1 in 14 Democrats planned to vote for Mr. Bush. (The Times polled 1,330 registered voters from Sept. 10 to 13.) *The Orange County Annual Survey found the candidates almost even (41 percent for Mr. Clinton and 40 percent for Mr. Bush), even though Republicans enjoy a 20-point advantage in party registration in that traditionally conservative county. The poor economy was cited as the main factor in Mr. Bush's fall. (The survey, conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2 by the School of Social Ecology at the University of California at Irvine, was of 1,012 county residents.) *A poll published by the San Diego Union-Tribune on Sept. 8 showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush in San Diego County 45 percent to 39 percent. Nearly two thirds of those polled said the economy and recession were the main issues. (The poll sampled 600 registered voters from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2. Like the three polls above, this one was conducted by telephone and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three to four percentage points.) Weakness Seen in 1988 The polls in Orange and San Diego counties are particularly ominous for the President. In 1988 Mr. Bush defeated Gov. Michael S. Dukakis by a landslide nationally but carried California by only 352,684 votes out of almost 10 million cast. He won here only because he rolled up large majorities in Orange and San Diego counties to offset Democratic margins elsewhere. Lyndon B. Johnson is the only Democrat to carry California since Harry S. Truman did in 1948. Mr. Lee, the campaign spokesman, acknowledged that the Bush campaign had not related well to Californians so far, but said: "We are getting a sharpening of focus from the national campaign, in terms of jobs, trust and the character issue. We're having some effect." A leading Republican strategist, Steven A. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer, argued that Mr. Bush could still carry the state. "Clinton does not enjoy a real base in California," he said. "There is a lot of frustration with him. A lot will come down to the debates." But Mr. Merksamer also said that the Republican National Convention, particularly the hard-hitting speeches by Patrick J. Buchanan and Pat Robertson, was extremely damaging to the President here. "Those were at odds with the way most Californians think and were not helpful," he said. Fallout in Local Races What concerns party consultants like Arnold Steinberg of Los Angeles is the effect of all this on Republican local candidates. "What started out as a year of tremendous opportunity because of reapportionment is turning into a year of lowering sights," Mr. Steinberg said. "We see districts considered Republican where we may now have to fight to keep them." Based on two major recent changes in the state's political ground rules, the Republicans had had well-laid plans to gain control of the state Legislature this year. First, the voters two years ago passed a Constitutional amendment limiting terms to six years in the state Assembly and eight years in the state Senate, and many incumbents are already leaving. Then, after the 1990 census, Governor Wilson vetoed a Democratic-drawn redistricting plan, and the state Supreme Court imposed an alternative that was much more favorable to Republicans. Democrats dominate the Assembly 47 to 33, and the leadership has fiercely battled Mr. Wilson on budget issues. Republicans had hoped a combination of redistricting and discontent with incumbents would give them an Assembly majority. Only half of the 40 Senate seats are up for election, but Republicans hoped at least to whittle the Democratic majority; there are 24 Democrats, 13 Republicans, 2 independents and 1 vacancy.

1474-> Earnings Reports Push Dow Up Slightly
Blue-chip stocks ended slightly higher yesterday after drawing support from gains in the General Motors Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.08 points higher, at 3,187.10. But in the broader market, declining issues led advances 925 to 848 on active volume of 219 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 258 million on Tuesday. General Motors shot up 1 1/4, to 31, apparently on a report in The Washington Post that the company's outside directors want Robert Stempel, the chairman, to step down. I.B.M.'s shares rose 1/8, to 68 1/2, after several days of losses on a grim third-quarter earnings report. Although investors bid up stocks, the buying lacked fire amid a smattering of mixed earnings reports and questions about the nation's fiscal growth plans. As the Presidential election draws near, analysts said they expected investors to take increasingly defensive positions in the likelihood Democrat Bill Clinton will be the victor. "The equity market has probably discounted Clinton and now is starting to pick and choose stocks that will produce superior earnings," said Phil Orlando, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management Inc. Secondary stocks continued to outpace blue chips. The Nasdaq index rose 4.45 points to 597.15, helped by positive earnings reports. Eli Lilly fell 1 1/4 to 59 3/8 after releasing third-quarter results that included a loss. York International tumbled 4 1/4 to 30 3/4. It said its full-year results would be below expectations. On the plus side, Union Pacific gained 1 3/4 to 55 1/4 on record third-quarter earnings. Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.19 of a point to 415.67. The American Stock Exchange index gained 2.02 to 373.42. The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.02 to 228.60. The average share was unchanged. The Wilshire Associates equity index -- the market value of New York Stock Exchange, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,024.716, up 4.672 or 0.12 percent.

1475-> COMPANY NEWS; Jenny Craig Plans Buyback of Its Stock
The diet-center operator Jenny Craig Inc., whose stock price has been trimmed because of a decline in sales and profits, said today that its directors had agreed to repurchase up to three million shares, or 11 percent of its stock outstanding. The company also reported that its profits fell 7.2 percent, to $9.72 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30., from $10.5 million, or 44 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue declined 5 percent, to $114 million, from $120 million. It was the first decline in revenue in the company's history. Trading in Jenny Craig's shares were delayed this morning because of an imbalance in orders. The stock closed at $13.375, down $1.625. Last October, the company went public and sold five million shares at $21 each. The stock's high was $33.875 in January, and it reached a low of $11.75 this month. "People were more disappointed in earnings than in the stock buyback," said Michael Tennenbaum, a vice chairman of Bear Stearns Inc., who is a Jenny Craig director and investor. He said Jenny Craig was not a buyer of its stock today but intended to buy shares in the next few days. Mr. Tennenbaum said directors had decided to disclose the buyback before the company's annual meeting, which is to be held Thursday in Del Mar, Calif. Four disgruntled shareholders, who cumulatively own 200 shares, in June filed a class-action suit contending that Jenny Craig had misled investors about its future growth. Ronald E. Gerevas, Jenny Craig's president, said the stock buyback was unrelated to the lawsuit. "We think it's an attractive buy," he said. Insiders control 61 percent of the company's 27.5 million shares outstanding. Jenny Craig has sufficient cash reserves to pay for much of the buyback and still finance planned expansion next year, Mr. Gerevas said. Even so, he said, "it's not been a pleasant period." Jenny Craig has continued to grow, opening 30 new outlets since June. With 728 weight-loss centers, itis the No. 3 company in the $2 billion commercial diet-center industry, after Weight Watchers International Inc. and Nutri/System Inc. "The company is doing better than most of the other chains," said John La Rosa, publisher of Diet Business Bulletin of Valley Stream, L.I. A survey of telephone-book ads conducted by the trade paper found a 9.7 percent decline in diet-center clinics since April. "We're in a recession and there's a growing anti-diet movement out there," he said. Sid Craig and his wife, Jenny, co-founded the company in 1983.

WENDY BACKER, the sole owner of Thinga-ma-bib, a San Francisco company, decided it was high time that babies and kitsch -- vintage post cards, plastic dinosaurs, tiny dolls in Hawaiian skirts, tinier ants -- got together at mealtime. So she put the kitsch in her bibs. "I was so disgusted with the pink-and-blue-duck stuff that I decided to make my own," she said. The vinyl bibs have seven themes, including "The Suburban Dream" (fake money attached to a picture of a house) and "La Bamba" (babies and electric guitars), below. She usually plows through flea markets for the vintage postcards; the knickknacks, she finds in variety stores, choosing things that "tickle my fancy."

1477-> BASEBALL; Seaver in Hall on a Truly Terriffic Reception
The mechanics on the mound were straightforward and sound, the strategy a mix of sophistication and strength, the slider as precise as the fastball was powerful. The demeanor was one of professional pride. With Tom Seaver there was always something both elemental and authoritative about his talent, and so it seemed only appropriate that his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame last night was pure and definitive. He received an unprecedented 98.8 percent of the ballots cast by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. Seaver, the franchise pitcher for the Mets who won 311 games and three Cy Young Awards in his 20 years in the major leagues, was named on 425 of 430 ballots submitted, a percentage that exceeded Ty Cobb's previous record of 98.2 percent achieved 56 years ago. Henry Aaron's 97.8 is the third-highest mark. Fingers Gets 81.1 Percent Seaver, the starter who gave legitimacy to an organization, will be joined in the Hall of Fame by Rollie Fingers, the reliever who gave stature and significance to a role. Fingers, the right-handed closer whose 341 career saves remain the game's standard, became the first pure relief pitcher to be named to Cooperstown, his 81.1 percent of the vote easily meeting the required 75 percent threshold. The 45-year-old Fingers, whose distinctions were his cool, his control and his handlebar mustache, pitched in parts of 16 seasons, winning the American League Cy Young and most valuable player awards in 1981 with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was a fixture on the Oakland Athletics of the early 1970's, a team that was part dynasty, part circus. He earned a pair of saves in each of Oakland's three World Series championships from 1972-74. The expected protest vote for Pete Rose turned out to be a muted one. Rose, who was kept off the ballot by the Hall of Fame's board of directors because of his status on baseball's ineligible list, received 41 write-in votes, none of which officially counted. Three Ballots Were Blank Only three members of the association made good on the threat to submit completely blank ballots, a total that did not substantially affect the fortunes of Seaver or Fingers or of Orlando Cepeda, the former Giants and Cardinals first baseman whose 246 votes fell well shy of the required 323. "He was the consummate pro from Day One," Ron Swoboda, the outfielder who played for the Mets with Seaver, said of the classic right-hander. "And that comes from a guy who clearly wasn't. I and others felt our way along in the majors. But Seaver, he seemed to be walking a golden path." Certainly, any time Seaver walked out of the dugout and followed his deliberate path to the mound, there was in the stands the anticipation of majesty and in the opposing dugout the reasonable expectation of humiliation. "What was special about him as a pitcher? You'd have to write a novel instead of an article," said Jerry Grote, the longtime catcher for the Mets. "Nolan Ryan left guys shaking their heads, believing they were overmatched. With Seaver, they'd get struck out and credit him with having made a good pitch. They'd come up again, strike out again and credit him with having made another good pitch. Then, the game would be over and Seaver would be in double figures in strikeouts. The guy didn't make bad pitches." His career statistics make for pretty good reading. Seaver, who also pitched for the Reds, the White Sox and the Red Sox, posted a record of 311-205, notched 3,640 strikeouts, amassed 61 shutouts, won 20 or more games in a season five times, and finished with an earned run average of 2.86. "To have a single memory of Seaver is to end the discussion about whether he should be in the Hall of Fame," said Tug McGraw, the relief pitcher who pitched alongside Seaver with the Mets. "He had complete knowledge of his own ability. And he was modest and astute enough to make sure it was always incorporated into the team's game plan as effectively as possible." But it was pure good fortune that initially incorporated Seaver's talents into the future of the Mets. Seaver was first drafted by the Braves, but his contract with them was voided by Commissioner William D. Eckert, who determined that it violated major league rules on the signing of college players. Seaver was then awarded to the Mets in a special lottery on April 1, 1966. A year later, the 22-year-old right-hander made his debut for the Mets at Shea Stadium, won his first game a week later and went on to be named the National League Rookie of the Year after going 16-13 with a 2.76 e.r.a. The Magic of '69 Seaver's presence and ability were the catalysts for the magic of 1969 when the Mets unburdened themselves of their farcical past and won a pennant and World Series. Tom was Terrific, the Mets were Amazin, and Seaver's 25-7 mark was his most dramatic stake to greatness in baseball and immortality in the hearts of New Yorkers. "Tom Seaver was and always will be the franchise player for the Mets," Frank Cashen, the chief operating office of the Mets, said in a statement yesterday. After 1969, there followed other great triumphs, as well as tears and turmoil. There was April 22, 1970 when Seaver struck out 19 Padres, including the last 10 outs; another World Series appearance in 1973, a 22-9 season in 1975. Then, there was the cataclysmic trade of Seaver to Cincinnati in 1977 after a contract dispute; there was the no-hitter against the Cardinals as a member of the Reds, the return to the Mets in 1982 and the embarrassing front-office mistake that led to his departure barely a season after that, the odd and yet exuberant experience of gaining his 300th career victory in a White Sox uniform in a game at Yankee Stadium. "He had obvious technique, obvious ability from the get-go," said Swoboda. "And then it was clear he had all the psychological tools to go with the physical equipment. He struggled a lot as a player, a person, a performer, but he always seemed to at least have his hands on the problems in those struggles." Low-Key Approach The 47-year-old Seaver, who has entertained notions of becoming a general manager while enjoying a second career as a broadcaster, had handled his expected election to the Hall of Fame with a silent diplomacy. He declined to speak publicly about his chances or the importance of the distinction, and last night he told Jack Lang, the executive secretary of the writers association, nothing more than that he couldn't believe he'd received a record percentage of the vote. "His substance, his character, his intelligence all forbid him from making a big fuss over it," said McGraw. "He might react with exuberance to those extremely close to him, but he probably doesn't have all that much to say. His performance has already spoken." Bill Mazeroski and Maury Wills, each in their final year of eligibility, failed not only to receive the required 75 percent, but also did not garner the 60 percent currently needed to be considered later by the veterans committee.

1478-> BASKETBALL; Cavaliers Beat Timberwolves for 9th Straight
Brad Daugherty scored 27 points and Mark Price became Cleveland's career assist leader as the Cavaliers won their ninth consecutive game, 113-98, over the Minnesota Timberwolves tonight. Daugherty made 9 of 11 shots for Cleveland, which shot 67 percent in the second half and 58 percent over all in its fifth successive road victory. Price added 16 points on 8-for-11 shooting and his 6 assists gave him 2,317, topping John Bagley's team record by 6. Lakers 104, Mavericks 80 DALLAS (AP) -- Terry Teagle scored 19 points and the Los Angeles Lakers took advantage of 19 percent Dallas shooting in the second quarter to win handily. The Lakers outscored Dallas, 25-12, in the second quarter as Teagle scored 9 points. The Mavericks missed its first 13 shots in the period, made only 3 of its first 23 and wound up 5 for 27 as Los Angeles took a 49-36 halftime lead. Bulls 102, Bullets 89 CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan scored 21 points and Scottie Pippen added 17 as Chicago won for the 11th time in 13 games. Washington closed to 76-67 early in the fourth quarter on a drive by Ledell Eackles, but the Bulls then pulled away for their 14th victory in 16 home games. SuperSonics 106, Nuggets 99 DENVER (AP) -- Ricky Pierce scored 28 points and Derrick McKey 26, and Seattle outscored Denver by 13-2 in the final 2:55 to win. The SuperSonics trailed, 97-93, with 3:21 left. Shawn Kemp's follow shot, Michael Cage's free throw and McKey's dunk gave Seattle a 98-97 lead with 1:53 to go. Mark Macon's layup gave Denver its last lead with 1:32 left. Pierce then made a 3-pointer to give Seattle a 101-99 advantage with 1:11 remaining.

1479-> COMPANY NEWS; Alcoa Loss Widens In Quarter
The Aluminum Company of America, the world's largest aluminum producer, yesterday reported a bigger fourth-quarter loss than a year earlier because of lower prices for virtually all of its products. But another aluminum producer, the Reynolds Metals Company, posted a 57 percent gain for the quarter. Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, said it lost $191.4 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $140.4 million, in the 1990 quarter. Sales for the quarter dropped to $2.45 billion from $2.75 billion. But investors bought Alcoa shares anyway, sending the shares up $4.625 to $67.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said investors were buying many of the so-called cyclical stocks, betting the issues would benefit from an economic upturn. A worldwide surplus has depressed the aluminum market, pushing ingot prices to 51 cents a pound, about half their high in 1990. Alcoa said in its earnings report that profit margins had declined across its product line in 1991. Aluminum shipments in 1991 rose 4 percent from a year earlier, the company said, because of strong demand for aluminum used in packaging. It shipped 2.84 million metric tons, up from 2.72 million tons in 1990. For the year, Alcoa's earnings fell 78.8 percent, to $62.7 million, or 71 cents a share, from $295.2 million, or $3.40 a share, in 1990. Sales dropped 8.2 percent, to $9.98 billion, from $10.87 billion in 1990. Reynolds Metals The Reynolds Metals Company reported a 57 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings, but its profits for all of 1991 were down sharply. The company, based in Richmond, said it earned $23.7 million in the final quarter of last year, or 40 cents a share, compared with a profit of $15.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 9.4 percent, to $1.45 billion, compared with $1.60 billion. Reynolds said its full-year earnings slumped 48 percent, to $154.1 million, or $2.60 a share, from $296.6 million, or $5.01 a share, in 1990. Sales fell 4.9 percent, to $5.78 billion from $6.08 billion. The results included an after-tax charge of $94 million for anticipated environmental costs. The Reynolds chairman, William Bourke, attributed last year's disappointing results to the "obstinate recession." He said that the worldwide oversupply of aluminum had "pushed ingot prices, in real terms, to their lowest levels ever." Reynolds said its 1991 aluminum shipments rose to 1.47 million tons from 1.42 million in 1990. The Reynolds share price was up $4.25 yesterday, to $55, on the New York Stock Exchange.

1480-> Designing Gifts to Aid A Learning Center
Last year, the benefit coincided with the start of the Persian Gulf war. This year, Lynn G. Feld, a special-events consultant for the National Center for Learning Disabilities, was not optimistic. "I knew it was going to be a very tough year for benefits," Ms. Feld said. She had already arranged evenings around "The Best of the West" and "The Great Gatsby's Garden." The approach of Valentine's Day gave her the idea. "I had a heart-shaped box made," Ms. Feld said, "and wrote to members of the creative community to fill it." Twenty-five decorated Valentine boxes will be sold at auction, to benefit the center, after a dinner in New York on Jan. 30 at the Marriott Marquis, Broadway and 45th Street. Boxes were contributed by artists, interior designers, florists and an architect, Michael Graves. Pure Madderlake's contribution is a newspaper-covered box filled with an antique doll, dried flowers and old photographs. Sylvia Weinstock, a master cake decorator, made a box that looks just like a sumptuously decorated cake, of course. Donna Karan filled a box with a scarf and jewelry; Adrienne Vittadini included a sequined dress that matched its box. One decoupage box holds a set of keys to a dark green Ford Explorer. The artist Robert Rauschenberg set his painted box on a porcelain enameled steel pedestal, and Whoopi Goldberg put together an irresistible assortment: In a red brocade lollipop-shaped box nestles an autographed videotape of "Ghost" and T-shirts and other items commemorating the movie "Star Trek: The Next Generation." There's also a copy of "The Color Purple," autographed by Alice Walker. "She went crazy," Ms. Feld said. "We're thrilled." The boxes will be on view at the National Center for Learning Disabilities, 99 Park Avenue, between 39th and 40th Street, on Tuesday from 3 P.M. to 5 P.M. Tickets to the benefit are $375 from (212) 687-7211.

AT the Howard Beach-J.F.K. subway station for the A, C and H trains, a new iridescent relief-mural of humanoid sea creatures gives riders something to look at and something to think about. "I called the piece 'In Search of Harmony Bay,' " said Esther Grillo, who designed the painted concrete sculpture, "because I wanted people to seek harmony here." She had the help of seven 14- to 18-year-olds from John Adams High School in Ozone Park, Queens, in the project, which was sponsored by the New York City Art Teachers Association-United Federation of Teachers under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's "Creative Stations" program, which finances temporary art for subway and railroad stations. It is expected to be at the station about a year. "Some of the kids are former graffiti artists," Ms. Grillo said, adding that some worked for money or to "improve race relations." Indeed, the images of white and violet fish swimming against a backdrop of translucent blues does make a rider feel part of a concordant sea.

1482-> D'Amato Serves as a Magnet for Funds
It was an obscure provision buried deep in the arcane language of a 1,000-page trade bill, but Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was on the case. A handful of sugar refiners, including one with a plant in Brooklyn, stood to gain $365 million in tariff rebates and Mr. D'Amato was all for it. With his help, the provision squeaked through the Senate in the summer of 1987. That fall, five years before his next race, Mr. D'Amato received $8,500 in campaign contributions from the sugar refiners. It is from such incidents that Mr. D'Amato, who has cultivated an image as a zealous guardian of constituents' interests, has also gained a reputation as one of the Senate's most aggressive and prolific fund-raisers. Several Inquiries Over the last decade, he has collected more than $21 million, much of it from people or businesses with matters pending before one of the Senate committees on which he has served. His practices have gained such notoriety that they have led to several well-publicized investigations and have damaged his popularity. But as Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, seeks a third term, his continued ability to amass a huge political fund has enabled him to run a fiercely competitive campaign against Attorney General Robert Abrams, a Democrat who is one of the state's all-time vote-getters. And Mr. D'Amato's fund has made it possible for Mr. D'Amato to wage a bold and expensive television campaign suggesting that Mr. Abrams has improperly accepted campaign contributions from people with business pending before his office. Mr. D'Amato has himself faced such criticism throughout his career. With more than $9.4 million collected since his last election, Mr. D'Amato will vastly outspend Mr. Abrams, who has raised $5.4 million but was forced to spend much of it in the bitterly contested Democratic primary. Last Friday Mr. Abrams had $545,000 on hand, while Mr. D'Amato had about $2 million. Television Ad Campaign Mr. D'Amato plans to spend every dollar of that money and thousands more expected from two fund-raising events next week, said Kieran Mahoney, his campaign manager. Nearly all the money will be used to pay for the television ad campaign, he said. Some of the commercials echo the criticisms of a state commission that faulted Mr. Abrams three years ago for accepting donations from lawyers and real-estate investors who had business before his office. While Mr. Abrams was not accused of doing favors in return for contributions, the panel described such solicitation as "implicitly coercive." The commission focused only on state officials, so it did not review Mr. D'Amato's fund-raising. Mr. Mahoney acknowledged that the D'Amato campaign has no general policy barring donations from people who are seeking help or legislation from the Senator. In fact, a review of Mr. D'Amato's campaign records shows a strong pattern of donations from businesses and people for whom Mr. D'Amato can provide critical assistance, whether on matters of parochial interest or broad public policy. 'Insultingly Preposterous' "The Senator fights hard for New York, and a lot of New Yorkers appreciate what he does," Mr. Mahoney said. He rejected as "insultingly preposterous" any suggestion that there is a relationship between campaign contributions and Mr. D'Amato's official actions. "We've helped hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, some of whom we have never met," Mr. Mahoney said. Over the years, the financial industry has provided the most money to Mr. D'Amato's campaigns, the records show. He has been a member of the Senate Banking Committee, where he has been a strong advocate for measures backed by the securities industry. In 1985, when he was chairman of the securities subcommittee, Mr. D'Amato excluded from legislation he introduced a proposal that would have limited the purchase of junk bonds by federally regulated savings and loans. That same year, Drexel Burnham Lambert, then the top marketer of the high-risk securities, held a fund-raising reception for Mr. D'Amato at Chasen's restaurant in Beverly Hills. Drexel, now defunct, had opposed the junk-bond proposal. Since his last election, Mr. D'Amato has accepted more than $300,000 from individuals who work for brokerages and investment banks, the records show. A study by Public Citizen, a government watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader, showed that Mr. D'Amato has accepted $627,402 since he went to the Senate in 1981 from political action committees organized by securities and banking groups. One of 8 Senators Mr. D'Amato was one of eight members of Congress made a target for defeat yesterday by Public Citizen, which asserted that Mr. D'Amato is improperly influenced by special-interest money. Mr. D'Amato "too often represents the lobbyists who pay for his campaigns, not the voters who sent him to Washington," said Craig McDonald, a spokesman for the group. Mr. Mahoney, the D'Amato campaign manager, defended the Senator's championing of the securities firms, calling their health vital to the economy of New York because they provide thousands of jobs. The Senator's relationship with Wall Street became a subject of an investigation by the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics after a complaint was filed by Mark Green, the New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, whom Mr. D'Amato defeated in the 1986 Senate election. In a report released last year, the committee found that Mr. D'Amato violated neither Federal laws nor Senate rules in his handling of the junk bond legislation after he accepted the donations from Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1985. In regard to most of the 15 other allegations made by Mr. Green, the committee found "no credible evidence" that Mr. D'Amato had acted improperly. But the committee did criticize him for "conducting the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner" by allowing his brother Armand to use it for lobbying activities. Armand D'Amato was indicted for mail fraud this year, accused of accepting $200,000 in unreported payments to lobby his brother on behalf of the Sperry Corporation and its successor, Unysis. He pleaded not guilty, and the Senator has said he was unaware of his brother's activities. On one fund-raising issue involved whether Mr. D'Amato had helped win roughly $60 million in Federal housing authorizations for Eduardo Lopez Ballori, a developer in Puerto Rico who was indicted on a technical Federal charge involving $30,000 in illegal contributions to the Senator's campaign. At a trial last June, which ended in a hung jury, Mr. Lopez Ballori contended that he was unaware of regulations restricting his contributions. The Senator, who said he was unaware of the improper contributions, donated the money to charity. Mr. Lopez Ballori is to be retried shortly in San Juan. The matter is one of several involving Mr. D'Amato, some of his contributors and fund-raisers, and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose New York regional office was run for much of the 1980's by one of his proteges and contributors, Joseph Monticiollo. Sugar in Brooklyn Employees of the office have testified before a Congressional committee or told reporters that Mr. Monticiollo and others in the H.U.D. office seemed to be pressing for favorable treatment for housing grants that would benefit such D'Amato supporters as a Great Neck, L.I., construction company called Jobco. Owners and employees of the company have contributed more than $5,000 to Mr. D'Amato and have held fund-raisers for him as well. Mr. D'Amato has denied exerting pressure on behalf of contributors. Jobco officials have denied benefiting as well, citing H.U.D. work received before Mr. D'Amato's election. In the 1987 debate over the proposal to benefit the sugar companies, Mr. D'Amato said the key issue was jobs for New York. He warned that the Domino Sugar refinery near the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn would be shut down -- and 800 jobs would be lost -- if the provision was not enacted. Domino stood to gain $135 million in rebates of sugar import tariff, more than any other company. Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island, complained that the tax break was a "government handout of the most outrageous kind," but Mr. D'Amato, with assistance from the other New York Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, pushed the measure through the Senate. Months later, the provision died in a conference committee because of opposition from the White House. Domino never got the rebate, but the Brooklyn plant remains open. No jobs were lost. Mr. D'Amato has continued to champion the sugar industry, which has given him $12,800 more in campaign contributions since 1988. Reviving the Specter of Mussolini The most dramatic television commercial of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's campaign came in two versions last week: tough and tougher. Ten days ago, the Republican Senator's campaign began running advertisements attacking his Democratic opponent, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, for calling him "a fascist." The ad shown to the press, and broadcast initially, used a narrator speaking over pictures of news clippings about Mr. Abrams's remark. But the campaign acknowledged yesterday that, without notice, it had also used another, visually harsher version of the same script, over silent sepia-toned footage of Benito Mussolini exhorting a crowd. The Senator's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said the first ad was made so quickly that the D'Amato team could not get the archival film it wanted, switched the commercials within 48 hours and simply forgot to alert reporters. But a tape provided by the D'Amato camp shows the same production date stamped on both versions. Ms. Mucha defended both yesterday, saying, "The only thing the ad was trying to say was where the word fascist originated from."

1483-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Purdue Beats Michigan on Road, 65-60
Woody Austin scored 19 points and Purdue took an early lead and held on tonight to beat Michigan, 65-60. The Boilermakers never trailed after going ahead, 8-6, three minutes into the game. Purdue beat Michigan for the fifth straight time, including three straight at Crisler Arena, and sent the Wolverines, who are ranked No. 15 by The Associated Press, to their second consecutive loss in the Big Ten. Purdue (10-5 over all, 2-1 in the conference) pounded Michigan (9-3, 1-2) on the boards for a 40-20 edge in rebounds, including 24-7 on the defensive end. Duke 110, N. Carolina St. 75 DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Christian Laettner scored 23 points and No. 1 Duke continued its early roll through the Atlantic Coast Conference with a rout. The Blue Devils (11-0, 5-0) had won their previous 10 games by an average of 21.8 points, with their only close call coming in an overtime victory against Michigan. Not much changed against the Wolfpack (7-6, 1-2) as Duke extended its winning streak to 17. With two minutes left before halftime, about one-third of the overhead lighting went out. Officials decided to complete the period without the full lights burning. That was about the only flaw in the night for Duke, and when Bobby Hurley finished the half with a 3-pointer, the Blue Devils held a 48-37 edge. Arkansas 99, Miss. State 78 FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Roosevelt Wallace, a reserve, sparked a late surge and No. 12 Arkansas, trailing midway in the second half, ran past Mississippi State in the Southeastern Conference game. Mississippi State led, 63-62, with 12:43 left after an layup by David Dominique. Then Lee Mayberry's 3-pointer then put Arkansas ahead for good. The Razorbacks poured it on, with Wallace leading the 25-6 run. His soft bank shot made it 70-64 with 8:30 left and Arkansas held the Bulldogs without a field goal for four minutes in building a 87-69 lead. On two straight possessions, Wallace rebounded a teammate's miss and completed a 3-point play. Moments later, he took a pass from Mayberry and made a behind-the-back pass to Clint McDaniel for an easy basket. Oliver Miller led Arkansas (14-3, 3-1) with 22 points. Wallace had 12. Tony Watts led Mississippi State (10-4, 2-2) with 25 points. Kentucky 84, Vanderbilt 71 NASHVILLE (AP) -- Kentucky's Jamal Mashburn took charge down the stretch, scoring nine of his 21 points during a two-minute span to lead the 10th-ranked Wildcats. The Wildcats (13-2, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) overcame a 38-33 halftime deficit to defeat the Commodores (8-5, 1-3) in Nashville for the first time in five seasons. Michigan State 78, Northwestern 61 EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Shawn Respert scored the game's first seven points in just 67 seconds and No. 11 Michigan State was never threatened in beating Northwestern. Northwestern lost its 25th straight Big Ten game, and its 47th league game on the road since the 1985-86 season. Respert made a 3-point shot and two layups to give Michigan State a 7-0 lead and force the Wildcats to call time out. The Spartans (12-1, 2-1) prevented Northwestern (7-6, 0-3) from getting a rebound for the first 12 minutes and led by 43-25 at halftime. Iowa St. 92, Morningside 55 AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Julius Michalik scored 16 points and tied a school record with 5 blocked shots as No. 24 Iowa State rolled past Morningside (7-5). The Cyclones (13-2) won their 11th straight home game and have won 11 of the last 12 over all.

1485-> Review/Art; Inviting (if Fanciful) Rooms From the View of Roy Lichtenstein
Roy Lichtenstein has a nearly in exhaustible talent for putting his best-known visual strategies to fresh uses. This is resoundingly affirmed by his latest paintings, a series of big, cartoonish domestic interiors on view in SoHo at the Leo Castelli Gallery and at 65 Thompson Street, a nearby exhibition space operated by Mr. Castelli and the Gagosian Gallery. Two paintings from this series were prominent in last spring's Whitney Biennial, but this double show is New York City's first chance to see a large group of the "Interiors," as they are collectively known. Clean of color, crisp of line, these paintings are full of Mr. Lichtenstein's most famous motifs and devices. His signatory black outlines and Ben Day dot patterns, borrowed from the comics in the early 1960's, are here, as are quotations from other art and artists through the ages. Yet these images of well-appointed living rooms and bedroom suites outfitted with paintings and sculptures seem strikingly unfamiliar, as if every element in them has been rethought and retooled. In short, the show includes some of the best paintings Mr. Lichtenstein has produced in the last 15 years. And fittingly, it celebrates both the 30th anniversary of his debut at the Castelli gallery, a show that helped ignite the Pop Art movement, and the 35th anniversary of the gallery itself. To a great extent, Mr. Lichtenstein has simply pulled back for a long view of a subject that has lurked at the edges of his art for years. His still-life paintings, like his images of mirrors or framed paintings hanging on walls, have often implied large rooms lying just beyond the canvases' borders. Now he's giving these settings the full treatment, with results so big (the paintings tend to be at least 10 feet on a side) and inviting that you almost want to walk right in, like the human actors entering Toontown in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." In taking the wide-angle view, Mr. Lichtenstein has in essence provided companionship for his depictions of artworks, companionship in the form of boldly outlined chairs, couches, coffee tables and bedroom sets. In the process, he expands upon a theme that is central to his art: the ins and outs and ups and downs of style. Now artistic styles play off design styles, yielding a witty commentary on art, decor and taste: good and bad, modern and conservative. These works suggest that the artist has seen too many glossy magazine spreads featuring the overdecorated homes of art collectors and is now taking revenge. On one level, the paintings are fabulous iconographic puzzles about art and taste that effortlessly tease one into a deconstructive mood, partly through their titles. "Interior With Yves Klein Sculpture," on view at Castelli, helps the viewer identify the blot of textured blue paint in the work's lower right corner as a blue sponge sculpture by the French postwar avant-garde artist. In the upper right corner, one spots the incongruous presence of the classical Greek sculpture of the discus thrower, whose poised heel and hand are visible at the edge of the canvas, and, across the way, a portrait of a portly gentleman in the style of Hans Holbein, altogether, an unusually diverse art collection. The final incongruity is a painting that hangs above the modern 1960's-style love seat at the back wall; it depicts a dowdy armchair whose banality is out of character with both the room's sleek furniture and its art. Such stylistic discord is present in nearly every painting, but always balanced by the canvases' dazzling visual unity. The Ben Day dots are in evidence everywhere, but now they're regularly joined by expanses of taut parallel lines running on the diagonal or the horizontal and defining rugs, walls or window blinds. There are also some new Ben Day variations, in which the dots assume overlapping starlike formations or are squeezed into cross-weave patterns. All these contrasting patterns infuse Mr. Lichtenstein's Pop Art imagery with some of the visual heat of Op Art, the art movement whose often strident optical abstractions played poor cousin, in terms of critical success, to Pop and Minimalism in the 1960's. Similarly, the black outlines that profile nearly every object in sight within these rooms (except the odd plant) have a new stark bluntness and variety. They hug the surface, flattening each image into a powerful tapestrylike configuration while also defining space in blocky geometric forms. Usually the lines are straight as a yardstick. But sometimes they undulate subtly, especially when describing a rug's edge, a set of drapes, or the dust ruffle on a couch or bed, adding wonderful touches of contrast. In "Interior With Mobile," at 65 Thompson, the lines of bureau and the bedside table adhere to the straight and geometric, while the double bed is described in lines that curve and dip, creating a come-hither sensuousness that makes the bed the picture's focal point. This focus is enhanced by the fact that all the furniture is plain white, while the artist's strong, judiciously chosen colors -- in this case, bright blue and yellow -- keep the painting's outer corners on full alert. Here, as in almost all the other paintings, each line, pattern and patch of color stands on its own while also contributing to the painting's unity. Mr. Lichtenstein never lets us lose sight of his rigorous skills as a composer of pictures -- even as his ironic images trace the dubious fates of pictures within the world of interior decor. Occasionally, Mr. Lichtenstein stumbles. The predominantly black and pale-yellow "Interior With Exterior (Still Waters)," which features a pool and patio seen through a sliding-glass door, is too rudimentary in color and composition. The portrait of George Washington doesn't save it, nor do the odd spatial ambiguities of the pool's reflections, which slyly suggest an abstraction by Clyfford Still. In an exhibition where all is complex yet unforced, it is simple yet forced. But otherwise these works show the artist in top form, inventing a bright new setting for some of his oldest techniques, which is is no mean feat for a 30th anniversary. Roy Lichtenstein's new paintings are at the Leo Castelli Gallery, 420 West Broadway, near Spring Street, and 65 Thompson Street, both in SoHo, through Feb. 29.

1487-> Settling a Subway Art Dispute, Artfully
It took a long letter from her lawyer, an appeal to the First Amendment, countless conversations among countless lawyers and a three-page agreement with 10 detailed conditions, but Jenny Marketou finally got her seven large photographs of Greek-Americans reinstalled yesterday on the walls of a subway station in Jamaica, Queens. The exhibit, part of a broad program of art in the subways run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was removed in December, only seven days after it went up, because some black New Yorkers who use the station found it offensive. About a dozen black commuters had complained to transit officials that the photographs -- portraits of Greek-Americans from Astoria, Queens -- showed only white faces, an M.T.A. spokesman, Tito A. Davila, said. Officials decided to remove the exhibit because they did not want to offend riders. But the artist, Mrs. Marketou, a Greek-born photographer, sculptor and teacher, objected vehemently. She contended that taking down her photographs represented a breach of her First Amendment rights and her artistic integrity. Crossing Cultures The point of her exhibit, Mrs. Marketou said, was to try to break down the cultural barriers that divide ethnic groups and neighborhoods, and to foster multiculturalism. The proper response to people's concerns should be to educate them, she said, and not to censor the artist. A month later, in late January, the authority agreed. That led to the reinstallation of the photographs yesterday afternoon. Mrs. Marketou spent the rush hour last night at her exhibit, answering questions and hearing both praise and criticism from commuters in the entry hall of the Jamaica Center Station, the new terminus of the E, J and Z lines at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue. Most of the thousands of straphangers who passed through ignored the photographs. Some stopped to study the large panels, each 6 feet by 5 feet, and the accompanying text. One young woman told Mrs. Marketou that she remembered the exhibit, had read about its removal and was glad that it was back. A man who said that he, too, was a photographer, chatted for a while with Mrs. Marketou and asked how he could get his photographs exhibited in the subway. But several people said they were offended by the exhibit. One commuter, Patrick Burns, said he thought it would have been more appropriate to have exhibited photographs of many different types of people. "It's a multicultural society, so why not include everybody?" he asked. Mrs. Marketou told Mr. Burns and other critics that she had concentrated on people of her own national background because that is what she knows. "This is an opportunity for one community to learn about another," she said. In the agreement, the M.T.A. said it would return the photographs to the walls of the station, and Mrs. Marketou promised to do several things to explain them better to the casual passer-by. She agreed to provide a large title -- Portraits of the Greek Immigrant Community -- that runs across the top of the display. Mrs. Marketou also promised to be at the exhibit for three rush hours after its reinstallation and to answer questions and respond to comments. M.T.A. officials said they were willing to reinstall the exhibit because the new explanations would make it more understandable to riders who might have been offended. "We hope there will be a better understanding of the artwork," Mr. Davila said. Mrs. Marketou said she was "very glad to see it back," but she remained critical of government officials whom she accused of trying to "judge and control art."

1490-> CONSUMER RATES; Tax-Exempt Funds Off; Taxable Yields Are Up
Yields were mixed in the latest seven-day period ended yesterday, as IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report surveyed more than 862 tax-exempt and taxable money market funds. Tax-exempt funds had lower yields, while taxable funds posted slight gains. The decline in tax-exempt yields came from strong investor demand for short-term municipal debt, which drove prices higher and yields lower. But the pattern is likely to reverse itself as investor appetite diminishes, forcing prices down and yields higher, and the supply of new issues begins to outpace demand. Assets of tax-exempt money funds increased by $149 million for the week, to a total $96.9 billion, with the average number of days left to maturity of securities in fund portfolios down one, to 66, IBC/Donoghue's analysts said. The seven-day average compounded yield fell to 2.15 percent from 2.33 percent last week and simple yield fell to 2.13 percent, from 2.31 percent. The 30-day average, which reflects any rise or decline over a much longer period of time, is still showing the drop in yields from cash pouring into the money funds. But analysts expect yields to rebound some and move up in the next couple of weeks as the cash influx is absorbed. For the 30-day period, the compounded yield is down to 2.47 percent, from 2.56 percent in the previous week. The simple yield is down to 2.44 percent, compared with 2.53 percent. Not assuming state taxes, this means that the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield is about 3.23 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 3.38 percent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket. In its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee, was the best-performing fund, with a yield of 2.81 percent. Assets of taxable money market funds grew by $6.4 billion, to $493.7 billion. Institutional money funds accounted for much of the growth, as their assets rose by $4.7 billion, to a total $174.1 billion and retail assets grew by $1.7 billion, to $319.6 billion. Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue, says there was still a chance for another easing by the Federal Reserve. But he does not expect it to happen until after the Presidential election, when the next employment report is due. "How well the markets receive the next rate cut, if it comes, will depend on who was elected into the Oval Office," Mr. Frank said. Taxable Yield: 2.83% The average seven-day compounded yield for a taxable money market fund was 2.83 percent, up from 2.81 percent last week, and the simple yield was 2.79 percent, up from 2.77 percent. Over a 30-day period the average compounded yield is 2.86 percent, down from 2.88 percent a week ago; the simple yield is 2.82 percent, down from 2.84 percent. Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable portfolios fell by one, to 64. The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, was the top returner among general purpose funds with a yield of 3.80 percent. For government-only funds with assets under $100 million, the United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, was tops at 3.99 percent. The average yield on bank money market accounts fell to 2.80 percent this week, from 2.82 percent last week.

1492-> STEVEN SPIELBERG; The Final Product Says It All
To the Editor: The comparison between Steven Spielberg and Walt Disney is right on. Who else today could turn the story of a tortoiselike alien into the largest grossing movie of all time? Like Disney, each of Mr. Spielberg's efforts is an oasis in a desert of exploitation and excessively violent releases. Mr. Spielberg's critics should pay close attention to the unparalleled quality of the final product rather than to his harsh negotiation techniques. It is this perfectionism that produces such imaginative and meaningful works of art in an industry ridden with commercialism and superficiality. As a junior in college, my only complaint/regret concerning Steven Spielberg is that he isn't 20 years younger. AMY D. ORINGEL Ithaca, N. Y.

Statistics show that signs are safer than signals on all but the most heavily traveled streets, traffic traffic engineers said, because motorists slow down and pedestrians are more careful. More than a quarter of the city's intersections will be converted, leading to a saving on electricity and maintenance costs.

1495-> A Stamp to Honor The Happiness Boys?
To the Editor: Your Feb. 12 letters for and against the Elvis postage stamp are all off the mark. For one thing, Washington and Lincoln will be terribly upstaged if one simply considers the face values -- 1 and 2 cents -- against 29 cents for a pop singer. And Washington and Lincoln were long gone before they made it onto postage. This leads to the main consideration. Elvis (if he has really left us) is being pushed to the head of the line. Deborah F. Reese claims Elvis would afford her "a pleasant reminder of happy days gone by." What about my generation -- which precedes hers by, ah, many years? In order for my age group to have its recollections burnished, we demand, before Elvis Presley, the issuing of portraits of Frank Crummit and Julia Sanderson; of Kate Smith; of the Happiness Boys, Billy Jones and Ernie Hare, and of Uncle Don. Please forgive the damp spots on this letter. HENRY MORGAN New York, Feb. 13, 1992 The writer's "Here's Morgan" was heard on WOR Radio, 1939-46.

1496-> SIDELINES: SIGNING BONUS; Canseco All Ink And No Talk
Oakland A's outfielder JOSE CANSECO signed autographs for $25 each yesterday at a baseball card show in Morristown, N.J., and left town refusing to talk to reporters. A crowd of 1,357 attended the show and approximately 1,000 bought autographs, according to promoter MIKE KUSHNER of Howell Baseball Cards in Freehold, N.J. That would make Canseco's take approximately $25,000. In addition to the autograph fee, people were charged $4 for admission to the show. Not everyone was happy to pay the price for a Canseco signature. "They had people like cattle in there," said CAROL BUONOMO, a teacher from Edison, N.J., whose son paid an extra $3 for an autographed picture. "They rush you through there and you don't even get a chance to chat with him. "I think the ballplayers should at least give just a half-hour of their time to the young kids, just the kids. They're the ones who look up to them." BOB McCARTHY of New York and his son balked at paying the high price for the Canseco signature. "I think it's O.K. for the old-timers to charge for the autographs, because they didn't make the type of money guys make today," McCarthy said. "But for guys making $5 million, it's not right." But Canseco had his supporters. LOURDES CARABALLOSO of North Bergen, N.J., was willing to pay for Canseco's autograph, but the show was sold out by the time she arrived. "People take small stories about him and really blow them up into big stories," Caraballoso said. "His life is just like everyone else's, except he's famous, so everyone hears about it." Canseco was charged with aggravated battery Feb. 13 in Miami for ramming his car into the car of his wife, Esther, after an argument. Canseco and his wife are separated. Yesterday, the player patiently signed autographs, and while he did not say a whole lot, he did have a few words for some of the autograph seekers. "I asked him when he's going to join the Yankees, and he said, 'Not in the next 100 years,' " said STEVE MINSK of Caldwell, N.J.
