Dec. 31, 1998-> 0-> Gingrich Pays Off Penalty
Speaker Newt Gingrich has completed payment of a $300,000 penalty imposed for violations of Congressional rules, the House ethics committee said today. Mr. Gingrich made a final payment of $150,000, the committee said, and ''has now satisfied in full'' the penalty imposed in January 1997. The Speaker, who is leaving Congress in January, had originally arranged a loan from former Senator Bob Dole to help with the payments, but later paid with personal money. Mr. Gingrich was reprimanded by the House in 1996 after admitting he misled the ethics committee and acknowledging he should have sought better legal advice before using tax-exempt organizations to advance his political goals.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 2-> HOCKEY; Lethargic Rangers Outmanned By Coyotes
Having spent three full days without a game in sunny Arizona, the Rangers were rested and ready for tonight's match against the Coyotes. With all three members of their first line out of the lineup, the Coyotes were weakened against the visitors from New York. As is often the case under these circumstances, the team that would seem to have the advantage was the team that played poorly and lost while the team that seemed to be at a disadvantage played well and won. Despite taking an early lead, the Rangers were sometimes frustrated and sometimes lethargic in losing by 3-1 before a howling capacity crowd in America West Arena. Niklas Sundstrom scored the Rangers' only goal. With Phoenix leading by 2-1 midway through the third period, Daniel Briere scored an insurance goal on a high wrist shot at the 12-minute mark. ''It usually works in reverse,'' Brian Leetch, the Rangers' captain, said, referring to the logic of predicting a game like this. ''We got outworked in our own zone.'' When asked if his team was stale, Rangers Coach John Muckler said that he could not use that as an excuse. In an unusual departure from his standard demeanor, Muckler criticized several players by name. He mentioned that John MacLean ''can't put the puck in,'' on a breakaway. And that Kevin Stevens ''missed a whole open net'' on a power play. He pointed out that Todd Harvey ''turned over the puck,'' on Briere's scoring play. After that goal, Harvey smashed his stick over the top of the Rangers' net. After the game, he trashed himself. ''The hand made it O.K.,'' he said of his injured right thumb, ''but it was everything else that was a problem.'' Harvey said it was his worst game as a member of the Rangers. The Rangers resume the trip on Thursday night in Denver against the Colorado Avalanche. ''It doesn't get any easier,'' said Adam Graves. Wayne Gretzky, who played more than 20 minutes, was held without a shot on goal. ''As the game went on, they got stronger and we seemed to fade,'' Gretzky said. ''It was a bad loss for us.'' The Coyotes held a 2-1 lead after two periods despite playing without all three members of their top line. Keith Tkachuk, the left wing with 17 goals, will miss three weeks with a broken rib. Jeremy Roenick, the center with 14 goals, will miss about a week with a concussion. Dallas Drake, the right wing with six goals, is serving a four-game suspension for a violent check of Doug Bodger of the Los Angeles Kings. Although Phoenix was the best team in the league for the first quarter of the season, it has had less success in recent games. Coming into tonight's match, the Coyotes had been 3-4 in their previous seven. Starting in goal for the Rangers, for the first time in more than a month, was Dan Cloutier, the rookie who is the backup for Mike Richter. Cloutier made several sharp saves in the first period as the Rangers were outplayed, often hemmed in their own zone by the aggressive skating and checking of the Phoenix players. Scoring for New York was Sundstrom, at 1:25. After Petr Nedved drew two checkers toward him at the blue line, he passed the puck to Mike Knuble, who moved it right to left to Sundstrom. Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin had committed far to the right-wing side, so Sundstrom had lots of empty net to fill with a long, backhanded shot from the left side. Phoenix tied the score at 1-1 at 6:48 of the second on a goal by Bob Corkum, who scored off a rush after Ranger defenseman Rumun Ndur was caught up ice, along the left boards. Corkum beat Cloutier with a wrist shot from the inside edge of the right-wing circle. Phoenix made it 2-1 at 18:16 on a goal by Rick Tocchet, who was uncovered in front on a play that began with Greg Adams winning a face-off from Gretzky. Back in the lineup for the Rangers was Harvey, a right wing who missed the last two games with an injured right thumb. At the morning practice today, Harvey still had the hand wrapped in a bandage and he treated it with ice after the skate. ''It's a bone bruise, and probably something with the tendons and ligaments,'' Harvey said. ''It's not 100 percent, but it's time to play.'' Despite the mistake on the first Phoenix goal, Ndur took a regular shift alongside Jeff Beukeboom. In the previous game, a 6-3 victory at Carolina, Ndur assisted on Stevens's goal for his first point in the National Hockey League. Ndur said he did not even know he was credited with an assist until the puck was handed to him on the bench. ''I was pretty pumped about it,'' said Ndur, who is 23 years old. ''First point! It really meant a lot to me.''

Dec. 31, 1998-> 3-> Hot Times in the Auld Country
CAROUSING chilled and inebriated in Times Square is a popular option for many people who usher in the New Year on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. In Scotland, an equally enthusiastic celebration called Hogmanay is observed. Several Web sites are devoted to an explanation of the holiday's customs, and a page on the Essential Scotland site (www.caithness-mm .co.uk/discover/essential/ esshogm.html) features personal observations about the celebration. The Hogmanay Web sites are just part of a growing number of sites devoted to Scotland and all things Scottish. Hogmanay is a traditional New Year's Eve celebration filled with dances, parties and plenty of alcohol. On the surface, it sounds like any other Dec. 31 party. But the history of the holiday, as explained on the Hogmanay page on the Helpful Brother's site (wkweb1.cableinet .co.uk/sbooth/index2.htm) is interesting. Because Scots often had to work on Christmas and right up through January 1, New Year's Eve naturally became the big event of the season. The origin of the curious name is also discussed by the Helpful Brothers site. ''It could be from the Anglo-Saxon 'haleg monath,' which means 'holy month,' '' the site says. ''It could be from the Gaelic 'oge maidne,' which means 'new morning.' Some people also think that it could be from an Old French word meaning 'gift,' as it was customary to give gifts at this time.'' One of the things that makes Hogmanay different from an average American New Year's party is the practice of ''first footing.'' After midnight, it is customary to leave one's house and visit friends and neighbors, carrying gifts of food and drink (like a bottle of whisky and a plate of shortbread) to insure a prosperous new year. It is also the convention to offer a small lump of coal along with the food to symbolize the hope that your hosts' house will have fuel throughout the coming year. Travelers in Edinburgh around the time of the holiday will discover that the city uses the occasion to throw a grand party. It also provides all the details at its Hogmanay site (www .edinburghshogmanay.org). New Year's Eve wouldn't be complete without a few heartfelt renditions of ''Auld Lang Syne,'' and in Scotland it is no different. The country also holds the bragging rights to the song lyrics, as it was Robert Burns who wrote them. The birth of Burns, in January 1759, is also celebrated less than a month later, on Jan. 25, in an observance known as Burns Night. The Bard of Scotland is also on the Web; two particularly good sites are devoted to him: the Robert Burns Tribute (www.rabbie-burns.com) and the Official Robert Burns Site (www.robertburns.org). The Tribute page has an attractive explanation of a Burns Night dinner, including the proper traditional graces recited and the arrival of the haggis -- a Scottish national dish of sheep's stomach stuffed with oatmeal and spices. If the thought of haggis does not upset your stomach and you want to know more about Scottish culture, odds are you can get your fill at the Scotweb site (www.scotweb.co.uk), a thorough collection of links for things like bagpipes, tartans, crafts and literature.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 4-> GAME THEORY; At Game Site, Chat Fans Find Their Voices
THE Internet is an orchard of unintended consequences. The network itself, with all its content and clamor and chaos, is an unintended consequence of Pentagon research. And like some kind of magic-realist garden plot, it is a place where every seed, whether carefully planted or heedlessly strewn, sprouts into a different species, blossoms into yet another species and bears unexpected mutant fruits. People bend it into shapes you wouldn't expect. And particularly gamers. ''I'll never forget one day, about three months after we launched the service, I went into this room and suddenly Van Halen started coming out of my speakers,'' said Brian Moriarty, co-founder and chief visionary of Mpath (www.mplayer .com), a digital playpen for two million on-line gamers. ''It turned out that one guy had decided that he wanted to play music while people were text-chatting, and so he turned on the CD and jammed his mike up against the speaker. ''Little did I know what this was going to turn into.'' From its inception, Mpath had built voice capability into its service so people could hurl epithets across the Internet as they decimated each other on Quake. But most game manufacturers weren't interested in using their limited available bandwidth for carrying voice data. It was more important to pump up the graphics or deliver more accurate positional information about bullets. Audio capacity was all but ignored in the game space. But it wasn't long before someone figured out how to use it in the chat rooms. ''There was a point,'' Mr. Moriarty said, ''when suddenly some kind of critical mass was achieved. You began to see a kind of chat regime. Maybe two talkers instead of one, or maybe three, and then the talkers started to outnumber the typers. Then social pressure began to be felt by these people because everyone was in on this conversation and the typers felt left out. So it snowballed very quickly, in a matter of a few months. And now, when you go in there, most of the users have got to have that microphone. If you go into the public chat areas, it's rare to find someone that doesn't have a microphone. In fact, a lot of users, when they create a chat room, it says, 'Mikes only.' '' Unlike Internet telephony, which has yet to find its feet, Mpath's voice chat spread in weedy profusion because the technology is cheap (the company's downloadable software is free, the service is free, and headset microphones sell for less than $40) and easy to set up, and because everyone was doing it. And because there is a richness in the human voice and its capacity for nuance: age, sex, social class, regional origin, cadences, rhythm, volume, tension, laughter. A sense of human presence. All of these subtleties, even the intake of breath, are amplified at a distance when you can't see, when all you can do is listen. That's why radio theater was so compelling. That's why the telephone is so compelling -- perhaps more compelling than a face-to-face conversation -- and why videophones are invariably disappointing. As Orson Welles said, the ear is more imaginative than the eye. Of course, people do some of the things one might expect. There are plenty of private chat rooms on Mpath with only two people in them. But there are also channels where far-flung relatives convene conference calls. And there is a sizable religious contingent of armchair preachers. ''They sit around and create their own Christian theme chat rooms and talk Christian and sing Christian and preach,'' Mr. Moriarty noted. ''On a good evening, you'll see three or four Christian rooms in chat.'' And then there's the singing. ''This is the fascinating thing that really caught us by surprise,'' Mr. Moriarty said. ''We have average Middle American kind of folks in the Southeast and into Texas who have discovered that Mplayer.com is a great way to get on line and sing. Hillbilly John is one of the ringleaders of the country singing group. He goes in there and organizes these live jamborees. Then there's this guy named Conway, and he runs a karaoke radio station on the service, pretty much every day as far as I can tell, and he sings a lot of Elvis in his own radio format. ''It kind of fell on us. All we did was give people the connection, and they discovered it. And now they're going crazy with it.'' Of course, a lot of the singing is horrible. But it is compelling in its horribleness. It is considerably more compelling than a personal home page, several times more compelling than any customized portal interface, and orders of magnitude more compelling than the whistles and bells of the media behemoths. The horrible singing is compelling because it is human. Because when someone gets up to sing, even in the dark, it involves a degree of risk, and it implies trust. ''Even when you hear people singing badly,'' said Brian Apgar, Mpath's co-founder and chief evangelist for chat, ''you can hear in their voice that they're trying. You can hear the feelings and emotions they're trying to communicate. And it makes you feel connected to them. It makes you feel for them. Because they're getting up there and expressing themselves. It's not phony, canned stuff from some major Hollywood conglomerate. It's coming out of somebody's trailer.'' No matter how fast the modems get, nothing in the overdesigned corporate infoglut can evoke the raw empathy of a butchered karaoke tune -- or ''Auld Lang Syne,'' for that matter. Because of all the fantastic things the Internet has on demand, the best thing it can deliver to us is one another. Happy New Year.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 5-> Rushing a Vaccine
To the Editor: The Food and Drug Administration's approval of a vaccine to fight children's diarrhea (Science Times, Sept. 1) is a positive development for the millions of children worldwide who are affected by rotavirus. However, I question giving approval to a vaccine marketed for children that, according to other reports, has been tested only on infants through age 6 months. Why would Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories receive early approval for a vaccine that it is still studying on children over 6 months of age? It appears that the vaccine will be most beneficial to people in developing countries who will not be able to afford the price scheduled by Wyeth. How is it that the rotavirus vaccine was developed by the National Institutes of Health, but there seems to be no way to control how much the laboratory will charge other countries?

Dec. 15, 1998-> 6-> About 30 Rebels Killed in Kosovo Fighting
A tenuous standoff between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo Province erupted in violence today in the worst clash since an October truce -- a five-hour gunbattle in which border guards killed more than two dozen guerrillas. In the pre-dawn clash along Kosovo's southwestern border with Albania, Yugoslav Army troops killed 30 and wounded 12 ethnic Albanians who were trying to enter the country illegally, the Serbian-run Media Center reported. Officials at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent a team to the site, said 31 ethnic Albanians had been killed and 9 others taken prisoner. Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence have often armed themselves in Albania. The violence cast further gloom on the diplomatic efforts to bring a lasting peace to the Serbian province, where many believe a resumption of full-scale fighting by spring is inevitable. Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since an Oct. 12 peace agreement brokered by the American envoy Richard C. Holbrooke halted months of fighting.

Dec. 30, 1998-> 7-> Vow of Neutrality In Indonesia Election
The head of Indonesia's armed forces has pledged that the military will be neutral and not try to influence national elections next year. The armed forces' chief, Gen. Wiranto, said the military, which has played a crucial role in Indonesia's politics, would ''keep an equal distance to anyone,'' including the governing Golkar party as well as opposition parties. At a news conference on Monday after meeting with President B. J. Habibie, he said the military's main role would be to safeguard security for all political parties to contest the first free elections since the end of former President Suharto's 32-year dictatorial rule in May. But General Wiranto reaffirmed an earlier promise to form a 40,000-strong civilian militia to help keep law and order before the elections on June 7. Voters are to elect a 550-seat House of Representatives. The election is to be followed in August by a meeting of the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, which will choose a new president.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 8-> Those Missing Magic Words
When it comes to duty and self-preservation, there is no question as to what the content of President Clinton's next speech should be. The question is whether Mr. Clinton will have the strength and wisdom to deliver it in the days before the House of Representatives votes to impeach him. The 20 or so Republican moderates who will decide that vote want to hear the President say that he lied under oath, in those words. But when he spoke yesterday, Mr. Clinton did not come close to saying the magic words. He has time to speak them between now and the House vote on Thursday. We hope that he will, but the odd passivity of the President and his legal team provides little foundation for such a hope. Mr. Clinton and his advisers have yet to understand that petulance is not a strategy, even when the opposition is behaving with partisan malice and distorting the Constitution. Robert Livingston, the designated Speaker, pondered for days whether to lead the House toward an honorable compromise around a censure resolution. But he backed down rather than face his tough-guy whip, Tom DeLay. If a future Speaker cannot defy ''The Hammer,'' as Mr. DeLay likes to be known, imagine how hard it is for Republican moderates on the back benches. That is why they were on the Sunday talk shows imploring Mr. Clinton to offer the concession that would provide the political cover for a vote against impeachment. As Representative Scott Klug of Wisconsin said on ''Meet the Press,'' there will be no leniency from this political court unless it hears ''an admission of guilt from the President.'' That admission would not be necessary if the House vote was conducted strictly on constitutional principle. As Lloyd Cutler, a Clinton defender, said on ABC, this President's ''low crimes'' do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. But politics and human nature enter into this matter as well. Mr. Clinton did lie repeatedly, in plain sight, while under oath. In the language of Lawyer World, where Mr. Clinton seems to live, it might be possible to label such behavior ''ambiguous'' and get away with it. But in the world of political reality, there has never been a Congress, Democratic or Republican, that would be willing to extend mercy and at the same time sign up as historic endorsers of multiple, bald-faced lies. By refusing to bargain with the House, Mr. Clinton seems to be betting that the Senate will not remove him. It could, in fact, impose the kind of censure that Mr. Livingston is refusing to allow the House to consider. But whatever happens in Congress, Mr. Clinton's defiance and his willingness to gamble on a Senate showdown look a lot like the behavior that got him into this mess -- irresponsible, self-destructive and dangerously out of place in the Oval Office.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 9-> H. E. Davis, 93; Transit Engineer
Prof. Harmer E. Davis, the founding director of the California Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, died on Dec. 24 at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 93. Professor Davis spent 45 years on the Berkeley campus. He was born in Rochester, graduated from Berkeley in 1928, earned a master of science degree in civil engineering in 1930 and was appointed an assistant professor in that discipline the same year. Shortly after World War II, the state Legislature decreed the creation of the institute at Berkeley to train engineers needed to upgrade California's roads and airports. Professor Davis was named as its director and led it until he retired in 1973. The program he developed combined research with teaching and left its mark on highway designs, traffic control, and airport layouts and lighting. His approach led other states to turn to academia for similar joint ventures. As director, he became involved in transportation issues around the country, especially in the areas of planning and financing highways and airports. His research focused on the engineering properties of concrete, asphalt and soils. Professor Davis is survived by his wife, Phyllis E., a daughter and two sons from an earlier marriage, Lynn Davis of San Diego, Eugene, of Union City, Calif., and Willard W., of Berkeley; a stepdaughter, Dr. Artha Shelley of Pretoria, South Africa; a stepson, Miguel Melbin of Calistoga, Calif.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 11-> A Final Fight for Censure
The White House regards 20 to 30 Republican House members as still in play on whether to vote against impeachment on Thursday. Even allowing for exaggeration, the numbers suggest that for reasons of political survival and principle, a significant bloc of moderate Republicans is refusing to cave for the designated Speaker, Robert Livingston, and Representative Tom DeLay, the whip who wags the future Speaker. These moderates should continue to hang tough, now that President Clinton has indicated he may devote tomorrow to lobbying, and the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, promises an all-out fight to force a censure vote. Oddsmakers might say that impeachment is a lock and censure is dead, but we are into territory where the usual bets do not apply. Even novel proposals like that on our Op-Ed page today by former Senator Bob Dole for a joint resolution of condemnation cannot be dismissed, for Washington is through the looking glass now. One reason some Republicans remain uncommitted is that while Mr. Livingston can play Henry VIII and threaten to punish moderates for the wacky sin of giving ''insult to the chair,'' he cannot stop them from reading polls. According to The New York Times/CBS News Polls, 64 percent of Americans oppose impeachment by the House, and 57 percent favor censure. The undecided Republicans are mainly from districts where Mr. Clinton ran well in 1996, so they cannot afford to be as cavalier as Mr. DeLay would like them to be about the public's correct conclusion that Mr. Clinton's shameless, calculated lying does not rise to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. But this is not the time for Republicans like Christopher Shays of Connecticut to go wobbly and move into the impeachment column. Here are some other key moderates who need to buy time for censure: Representatives Michael Forbes, John McHugh, Rick Lazio, Sherwood Boehlert, Benjamin Gilman and Sue Kelly, all of New York, and Representatives Nancy Johnson of Connecticut and Jim Leach of Iowa. Those who believe the House should not impeach need help from the White House to meet the demand that Mr. Clinton admit that he lied under oath, or at least signal that he would sign language to that effect in a censure. It is throwing gasoline on flames for Gregory Craig to condemn people who ''think one word is better than another'' in demanding that Mr. Clinton admit to lies rather than evasions. He represents a man who insists always on one word, not the other, and then argues that the chosen word does not mean what it has meant since the time of Shakespeare. Between now and the convening of the House on Thursday, words will take on tremendous importance. They ought to be on the table for negotiation tomorrow when Mr. Clinton has a chance to meet with Mr. Shays and other moderates who are trying to save him and also preserve a proper constitutional interpretation of impeachment. Although a President is always due respect, they should not be bullied by Mr. Clinton's self-defeating stubbornness. If he is determined to lose the impeachment vote, he should at least do so after hearing sounder advice than his lawyers have given him. As for Mr. Livingston, his unfounded position that the Constitution does not allow for censure has been refuted by the New York City bar association. Before even taking the oath as Speaker, he has proved that he cannot handle the intimidators he inherited from Speaker Newt Gingrich. Indeed, who could have guessed he would create nostalgia for Mr. Gingrich so quickly?

Dec. 31, 1998-> 12-> For Actors and Agents, On-Line Links to Casting Directors
Early this year, Bonnie Black, a Hollywood talent agent, got a call from a casting director who was working against a deadline that even the toughest cinematic hero might have had trouble beating. The casting director had less than 20 hours to find an actor to play the role of an F.B.I. agent on the television series ''Players.'' Such last-minute requests are common in Hollywood, where scripts can change with a moment's notice and actors are sometimes jettisoned just before filming begins. But technology helped solve the problem handily: Ms. Black told the casting director to log on to an on-line casting service, look up an actor's resume and photograph, and download the actor's digital video clip to judge if he was right for the part. ''In this case, the video took the place of the audition,'' Ms. Black said. ''The actor went straight to the producers and got hired on the spot for a recurring role.'' (The series has since been canceled.) Now that technology has transformed Hollywood's special effects, it is beginning to have an effect on how actors are discovered. These days, casting directors can go to electronic search services to seek ''extremely attractive young ladies with good hair, good teeth, good bodies,'' as one request put it, and to field electronic resumes and photographs from talent agents who are pushing their clients. They can also do keyword searches of databases, looking, for example, for an Asian woman who is 5 foot 6 and 25 to 30 years old and can speak French. So far, these on-line services have had a modest impact on Hollywood's traditional casting system. But many people in the entertainment industry predict that electronic casting will become dominant as younger, more computer-adept executives replace the veterans. The two major electronic casting services in Hollywood are Castnet (www.castnet .com), owned by Entertainment Internet, and The Link (www.submitlink.com), set up by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Breakdown Services. Both on-line systems provide similar services to clients but have subtle differences. They serve as a line of communication between casting directors and talent agents, who for years have used messengers to send out actors' portfolios and notices for acting jobs. With computers, organizing an audition for an episode of ''Diagnosis Murder,'' for instance, can be completed in minutes instead of hours or days. ''Casting directors have never had a tool like this,'' said Richard Horgan, the president of Castnet, which began in 1996. ''They can sit in an office with Oliver Stone and look up all of the Caucasian males under 30 who have appeared in his movies. And talent agents can submit hundreds of resumes and photos for a role much faster and without wasting so much paper.'' The Link has access to about 38,000 actors. Their portfolios are actually on The Link's sister service, the Academy Players Directory On-Line. To get into the directory, actors must be a member of a union and pay a $75 annual fee. Their photographs, agents' names and phone numbers are also included in the hardcover version of the directory, which, depending on whom you talk to in the industry, is either the Hollywood bible or is used primarily as a doorstop. The Link provides casting calls for nearly 500 acting parts per week but does not transmit video or audio clips. Nearly 10,000 actors have paid the $149.95 annual fee to get their resumes and one photograph on Castnet (26,000 actors are being listed by the service at no charge, on a trial basis). Posting video clips, audio clips and additional photographs costs extra. The actors also gain access to a chat room and audition scripts. In addition, they can send casting directors electronic postcards to tell them of their latest on-screen successes and can solicit talent agents for representation without spending money on stamps. One thing actors do not have access to is either service's list of available roles, known in Hollywood as ''breakdowns.'' Only talent agents can view those, since most studios do not want to be besieged by aspiring actors. Castnet generally posts a dozen or so roles each day, and The Link at least six times that number, but unlike Castnet, submissions for many of those roles must be hard copy. Security measures have been installed to keep out trespassers and to protect child actors from pedophiles. For example, clients usually get access to Castnet by dialing in to the service directly and using a password, instead of going through the Web. Recently, Taylor Jacobs, a talent agent in Burbank, Calif., was scrolling through the breakdowns on Castnet, as he does several times a day, when he came across a notice for a black actor, 40 to 50 years old, to play a ''smart, quick-witted'' political adviser ''with lots of energy'' on the PBS television series ''On Common Ground'' at a pay rate $200 to $375 per day. He went to the bottom of his computer screen where his clients were listed and clicked on one of the names. Within a few seconds, he had submitted the name electronically, with a resume and photograph, to the show's casting director. ''Actors who are submitted have a two- to four-hour advantage over those who are sent by hard copy,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''That can be incredibly advantageous.'' Casting directors can log on to their computers to look at the dozens and sometimes hundreds of files that are sent to them for each open acting role. And they can arrange auditions by E-mail. ''I've logged in while in Hawaii and Belize,'' said Billy Da Mota, a casting director who specializes in commercials. ''The point is that I don't miss a job. I can be on vacation and log in on my computer from wherever I can plug in my laptop.'' Often, talent agents encourage actors to post their portfolios on one of the major on-line services to improve their chances of being selected for an audition and to make it more convenient for the agent. Joan Messinger, a talent agent in Beverly Hills, Calif., pointed to the hundreds of files on actors in her office and said emphatically, ''If I can get away from not going to that shelf and pulling a picture, I'll do it.'' But on-line casting has yet to significantly reduce the amount of paper changing hands. After submitting actors' portfolios on line, many talent agents also send out hard copy, too, just to be safe. Castnet is free for the 130 talent agents and 240 casting directors who have access. Some use the service as much as possible, others only occasionally. In all, 39 percent of Hollywood's agents and casting directors use on-line casting services to send or receive actors' photos, according to a survey of 120 people published in November by Back Stage West/ Drama-logue, a trade publication. The movie industry has been especially resistant to on-line casting. Filmmakers are generally less rushed than their television counterparts and would probably have little chance of landing a star like Bruce Willis from an electronic posting. As a result, Rob Ash, an actor from Sherman Oaks, Calif., who is a member of Castnet, has only modest expectations. He said electronic casting still needed to gain acceptance in the film and television industry before it would have much effect on his career, which has been fairly limited partly because he is 6 foot 7. Mr. Ash said he had found an agent through Castnet after submitting an electronic resume. He also landed an interview on the dating show ''Change of Heart'' after seeing a talent search posted on Castnet's actors' forum, where small productions often post casting calls. ''I'm not foolish enough to think that I can get lots of auditions from this,'' Mr. Ash said. ''But it's great in an emergency situation. If an actor slips and breaks a leg, it's easy for casting directors to sign on and find a replacement fast.'' For some actors, paying to get on line may be more of a waste of money than a smart career move, said Sheila Manning, a casting director in Los Angeles. She said actors living outside the major entertainment centers had little chance of success on line, especially for commercials, which are sometimes cast in a matter of hours. ''Clearly, I'm not going to call someone from Norman, Okla., because I have to see them the next day for an audition,'' Ms. Manning said. And on-line video clips are often not useful, she said, because they take too long to download and are too small on a computer screen to be of much use in judging whether an actor is right for a role. In the end, on-line casting can help only up to a point. While technology may help actors get auditions, they must, in the end, be able to impress producers in person, at auditions. ''When choosing actors for audition, they are just buying an image: 'I need a balding guy,' '' said Gary Bolen of Valencia, Calif., a Castnet member who regularly works on commercials and soap operas. ''Once you're there, you have to deliver.''

Dec. 14, 1998-> 14-> TECHNOLOGY: Digital Commerce; On-line day traders are starting to have an impact on a few big-cap Internet stocks in what some call a 'feeding frenzy.'
THE Internet changes everything!'' has become the rallying cry for purveyors of the new digital economy. Their enthusiasm has proved sufficiently compelling that an increasing number of Internet-based companies -- many with no product, no profits and, often, no proven or sustainable business model -- are taking their companies public and hitting the jackpot with shares that are valued far beyond reason. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, for example, shares of Onsale Inc., a Web-based auction service, rocketed more than 60 percent. Books-a-Million Inc. and Connect Inc., both Web-based businesses, posted even more spectacular gains. Most professional investors and market experts are not overly concerned about this kind of activity. The volume of shares that such companies make available for trading is relatively small and thus has little effect on the overall health of the market. In addition, they say, Internet stocks are widely, and correctly, regarded as high-risk investments. But what was noteworthy about the trading action after Thanksgiving was that it was caused by day traders -- primarily individual investors, trading on line -- who rely on quick market fluctuations to turn a profit. And on the day after Thanksgiving, these individuals dominated the trading volume in at least a few high-technology growth stocks. The Internet changes everything, indeed. For the first time, anyone with a computer, a connection to the global network and the requisite ironclad stomach for risk has the information, tools and access to transaction systems required to play the stock market, a game that was once the purview of an elite few. For those who believe that this kind of decentralization of power is the primary benefit of an Internet-based economy, this is good news. But one has to wonder about the unintended consequences of such a fundamental shift. Some studies show that the number of individuals jumping onto the Internet increases by thousands every day; as technology improves, that number is likely to rise even faster. Information -- especially the kind of information that fuels stock trading, like real-time quotes and company data -- is on the verge of becoming ubiquitous. Couple that with the likelihood that as more individuals make money in a booming stock market, the word of mouth -- spread in chat rooms and news groups via the Internet itself -- is likely to attract still more day traders, and you end up with a model for exponential growth. Some market makers, in fact, are already projecting that they will have to double or triple their technology investments to keep up with increased volume from Internet traders. Though he believes that the volatility of Internet stocks is not itself a problem, William Hambrecht, co-founder of the investment banking firm Hambrecht & Quist, calls the day trader phenomenon ''a big thing.'' ''I've been amazed they've been able to have such an impact on some of these big-cap Internet stocks,'' said Mr. Hambrecht, who now runs W. R. Hambrecht & Company, an entrepreneurial investment firm. ''This isn't a few people with a few small stocks.'' He calls the current day trader phenomenon ''mob rule,'' and adds: ''In a free market, it plays itself out. Professionals are trying to tell these people that they're playing with dangerous stuff, but people don't listen when they're in a feeding frenzy.'' Some investors are anticipating the near-term effects of day trading on the Internet economy itself, which is fueled in large part by the hefty prices commanded by Internet-related stocks. ''These price effects have consequences,'' says Ann Winblad, a co-founder of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, a technology investment firm. A prolonged run-up in stock prices, she says, could prove to be a double whammy for Internet companies. For one thing, Ms. Winblad said, it will become increasingly difficult to hire talented managers if they believe that the shares are so overpriced that the stock options being offered them -- the pheromone that draws most executives to technology companies -- are likely to be considerably devalued when the market comes to its senses. If the company then resets the options at a lower, more attractive price, institutional investors, who hold most of the market's stock and tend to invest in assets rather than concepts, will balk. Today, it is only these institutional investors, as well as program traders who move large blocks of stock in a single, computer-guided transaction, who can affect the overall stability of the larger market. But if individual trading on the Internet continues to grow at its current pace, it is possible to imagine a situation where the market as we know it today cannot absorb the shock. Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a strategic planning firm in Emeryville, Calif., points to the fact that people around the world have access to the stock market through the Internet. What happens, he asks, when ''vast numbers of people from all around the world -- 50 million people in India, 5 million in Brazil -- are all trading?'' If the number of individual investors grows large enough to match the volume of shares held by institutional investors and program traders, Mr. Schwartz says, ''when herd behavior moves the larger market in these highly volatile ways, unrelated to the value of the assets themselves, that becomes highly problematic.'' Of course, there is no way to predict whether such a situation will unfold. Even if it does, Mr. Schwartz said, it will be a long time coming. But in the short term, the problem may solve itself. ''Not too many people have the stomach'' for day trading, Ms. Winblad said. ''The viral effect will eventually settle. Some industries are maimed, but they don't go away.''

Dec. 31, 1998-> 15-> Government in the Netherlands Thwarts Modern Pilgrim's Progress
Almost four centuries after the Netherlands gave the Pilgrims refuge from persecution in England, a leading American scholar on the Pilgrims seems to have been caught in the Dutch Government's crackdown on immigrants and has been ordered to leave the Netherlands by Jan. 15. The scholar, Dr. Jeremy Bangs, who founded a Pilgrim museum last year in Leiden, said the Dutch Ministry of Justice had rejected his application for permanent residency because, it said, he did not qualify for a work permit and it did not believe he could support himself. ''It is hard to get more ironic than to expel someone who is working on the Pilgrims, who were the most famous example of Dutch welcome and protection,'' Dr. Bangs said. At the time the Pilgrims fled to the Netherlands in 1608, he said, the government boasted that it ''refuses no honest people free entry.'' Dr. Bangs, 52, receives financial support from the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston to conduct research on the history of the Pilgrims while they were in the Netherlands before leaving for America in 1620 and founding Plymouth. He recently discovered the first contemporary painting showing the Pilgrims embarking at Delftshaven on their way to America. Jane Fiske, the editor of the Register of the Historic Genealogical Society, which will publish an article about Dr. Bangs's discovery in January, said of the deportation, ''He has done so well in his research and opening the museum that this whole thing seems ludicrous.'' The Ministry of Justice has been trying to deal with a record 50,000 illegal immigrants to the Netherlands, already one of the most densely populated countries, from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia this year. The immigrants contend that they are escaping political persecution, but the Dutch Government has been under pressure to treat them as economic refugees and expel them. A spokesman for the ministry, Wijnand Stevens, said Dr. Bangs could appeal the expulsion. Mr. Stevens also said the Government's crackdown and Dr. Bangs's case were not related. But the leading Dutch newspaper, NRC Handelsblad, poked fun at the ministry on Tuesday, suggesting that Dr. Bangs was a victim of bureaucratic stupidity. The problem for Dr. Bangs is that he may not apply for a work permit because he is both an employee of the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum and the director of it, the paper said. Under Dutch law, only an employer may apply for a permit for an employee, so, the paper said, Dr. Bangs ''falls outside bureaucratic definition.'' ''Bangs does not cost the Dutch state a single penny,'' the paper said. ''And his museum tells of a meaningful part of our history. Hillary Rodham Clinton who will visit the Netherlands in February has put the museum on her agenda. Perhaps she will arrive at a closed door because Bangs had to leave the Netherlands on Jan. 15. Can someone explain this to Hillary?'' At least one member of the Dutch Parliament, J. Th. Hoekema, has officially questioned the ministry's decision. Friends and acquaintances of Dr. Bangs say another part of his difficulty may be that he lives simply, on the small income from the Historic Genealogical Society and that the ministry may not believe he has enough means of support. Neither Dr. Bangs nor the society would say what he is paid, but Ms. Fiske said: ''He lives very frugally, in a small apartment in an old building, and it is hard to see how he gets by. I think he is putting much of the money we give him into the museum.'' Before moving to Leiden two years ago, Dr. Bangs lived in Scituate, Mass., and was curator of Plimouth Plantation. He holds a doctorate in history from the University of Leiden and has written 12 books and more than 40 scholarly articles. In his research, he has demonstrated that some of the people Americans today celebrate as the Pilgrims were not English. Several were French-speaking Walloons, or Protestants, and one even came from Danzig, in Poland. They had all come to Leiden because it was a center of religious tolerance at a time of warfare between Catholics and Protestants. Dr. Bangs said that if he was required to leave, the museum would probably close. If he does have to abandon Leiden, he may recall a passage written about the Pilgrims' departure in 1620 by William Bradford, later Governor of Plymouth: ''So they left that goodly and pleasant city which had been their resting place near twelve years; but they knew they were pilgrims, and looked not much on those things, but lift up their eyes to the heavens, their dearest country, and quieted their spirits.''

Dec. 31, 1998-> 16-> The Immigrant Lockup
Thousands of people who are not accused of any crime or who have completed prison terms for minor crimes spent this Christmas -- and may spend the next -- in jails around the nation. They are immigrants detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has filled its own detention centers and has now resorted to using local and county lockups. Hundreds of immigrants who are simply seeking political asylum share cells with people accused of violent crimes, and are often subject to abuse because they are foreigners. Keeping them in jails is cruel, unnecessary and a waste of money. The detentions have more than doubled since 1995 because Congress now provides money for the I.N.S. to rent beds in local jails. In addition, punitive new immigration laws kicked in this year that expand the categories of immigrants the I.N.S. must detain as they await possible deportation. Most of the 16,000 people in detention on any given day are immigrants, legal as well as illegal, who have committed crimes, including very minor ones such as marijuana possession or turnstile-jumping, even if their convictions were long ago. They are held by the I.N.S. after they have finished their prison terms. Another group comprises illegal immigrants rounded up in raids on workplaces. The third group is asylum-seekers. The new immigration laws provide that everyone who comes to America seeking asylum is detained before a first interview. Those who pass it are then often detained for months or even years as they wait for their asylum hearings. Many of them are victims of torture or other traumatic events whose problems are exacerbated by jail. The I.N.S. has not been able to assure decent conditions even in the centers under its control. In 1995 inmates at an I.N.S. detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., rioted over beatings and the use of shackles. The I.N.S. later criticized the private company that administered the center, Esmor, for ''inhumane'' conditions. Conditions in local jails are often far worse, and the I.N.S. cannot supervise them. Human Rights Watch has collected numerous allegations of beatings and other mistreatment. The I.N.S. has called for a government investigation of alleged torture of immigrants by electric shock in a Florida jail. Immigrants often have no access to lawyers or even someone who speaks their language. Worst off are the 1,800 people scheduled for deportations to countries that will not take them back, such as Cuba. They are jailed indefinitely, some for years. The main reason for I.N.S. detention is that the vast majority of people at risk of deportation skip their court dates and simply vanish, given the chance. The I.N.S. is beginning to study how to get people to keep their court appointments without locking them up. One pilot project run by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group, keeps immigrants who seem unlikely to flee out of jail if they check in regularly and receive home visits from supervisors. Preliminary results show that compliance has soared -- at one-sixth of the $20,000 per year that detention costs. The I.N.S. should expand its search for alternatives to detention, including the use of bail. The 5,000 children detained each year should be put in group homes or foster care, not juvenile jails. Some people will require detention, but it should be in centers for immigrants. Congress should allow the I.N.S. to build its own facilities, which must be strictly supervised. Above all, the I.N.S. and Congress must abandon their punitive mentality. It is hard not to suspect that they are trying to deter immigration by making the process as harrowing as possible.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 18-> HOUSE PANEL SAYS CHINESE OBTAINED U.S. ARMS SECRETS
A select House committee, in a classified report unusual for its bipartisanship, has found that over the last 20 years China obtained, sometimes through theft, some of the most sensitive of American military technology, including nuclear weapons design, Government officials and witnesses before the panel say. The committee's final report, unanimously approved by its five Republican and four Democratic members today, found that during Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, China acquired a range of technical secrets far beyond the satellite- and missile-related technology whose transfer by American satellite companies during the Clinton Administration prompted the start of the panel's inquiry in May. In a carefully worded statement after the report had been approved, the committee's chairman, Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, said that China's acquisition of American technology had harmed national security and that its ''acquisition efforts over the past two decades'' had been a ''serious, sustained'' activity. The panel's 700-page report is secret because so much of its six-month inquiry dealt with classified information, and it released no details from that report today. It promised to begin a process, in consultation with the Administration, to declassify as many of the findings as possible. But witnesses and intelligence officials who worked with the committee said it agreed with assessments by the Pentagon and the State Department that information shared with Chinese scientists by two American companies, the Hughes Electronics Corporation and Loral Space and Communications, had improved Beijing's ability to launch satellites and ballistic missiles. In addition, witnesses said, the panel's conclusion that China had stolen military-related American technology may prove to be the most explosive part of the report. The panel uncovered, for example, a pattern by the Chinese of stealing nuclear-weapons design technology from American nuclear laboratories, said one person who has read part of the report. It was unclear when or over what period of time any of these nuclear-related thefts might have occurred. The committee, officials said, faulted policies of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations but did not say whether the problems were worse in one Administration than in another. It made 38 recommendations for legislation or executive orders to address those policy failures. The recommendations covered policy categories like security at weapons laboratories, the handling of sensitive intelligence data and export controls. While the committee did not directly examine covert Chinese contributions to the 1996 American election campaigns, officials said, it did investigate the activities of a Chinese aerospace executive, Liu Chao-ying. Ms. Liu was a conduit for Chinese Government payments to Democratic fund-raisers and, with her father, Liu Huaqing, formerly the senior general in the Chinese military, has been involved in Beijing's effort to acquire military-related technology. The House committee began its inquiry in the spring after The New York Times had disclosed that American satellite makers had helped Chinese scientists rectify failures in their rocket programs, conveying information applicable to long-range ballistic missiles. Over the last six months, the panel held 33 hearings, all closed, taking testimony from intelligence officials, industry executives and nuclear-weapons experts. The committee's inquiry initially focused on the interaction between China and the American manufacturers whose satellites were carried into orbit on Chinese rockets. It soon branched out to examine the export of other American technology to China, including advanced computers and machining equipment. The panel hired outside experts to examine whether scientists from Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, and Loral Space and Communications had harmed national security by giving the Chinese lessons in rocket technology after the failure of two Chinese rockets in the mid-1990's. Both companies deny any wrongdoing, but earlier this month the Administration completed reports of its own that raised national security concerns about the assistance, especially help that Hughes provided the Chinese in 1995. The intelligence arm of the State Department found that the 1995 ''tutorial'' by Hughes ''resulted in significant improvement'' to China's rocket program and that the lessons were ''inherently applicable to their missile programs as well.'' In a news conference at the Capitol today, members of the committee said their analysis had gone far beyond the reviews of the failed Chinese rocket launchings involving Hughes and Loral. ''There was harm in some of the transfers of technology that occurred,'' said the committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Norm Dicks of Washington, ''but it's also fair to say this is not the only problem we uncovered. These are serious problems that must be addressed by the Administration and by the Congress.'' It is public knowledge that the Chinese have an aggressive military and economic espionage program and that they have long sought to acquire American technology, legally and illegally. But the House panel, formally the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns With the People's Republic of China, learned new details about the depth and scope of these activities as it completed the most comprehensive examination of the issue ever conducted by any part of the American Government. The witnesses before the panel included officials from American nuclear weapons laboratories, one witness said. Last year the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued a report that questioned the adequacy of security at the weapons labs, and touched on a decision during President Clinton's first term to reduce background checks of various foreign visitors there. (The visitors, most of whom are Russian and Chinese, are not allowed access to classified areas.) It is unclear exactly how much the American public will ever learn about the committee's findings. The issue of what to disclose from a classified report is usually resolved by the release of general conclusions and the withholding of details that might reveal how the sensitive information was acquired. Any process in which the report is ultimately declassified would involve the Clinton Administration, officials at various intelligence agencies like the C.I.A. and the House of Representatives. ''Certainly we look forward to reading the report and studying its recommendations,'' said David C. Leavy, a White House spokesman. ''In terms of declassification, we need to work with the committee and relevant agencies in an appropriate way to move forward.'' That the committee could find political unity in a year of divisive discourse was probably due to the serious national security concerns that were the panel's work. Other than Mr. Cox and Mr. Dicks, the members of the committee were Representatives Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, Porter J. Goss of Florida, James V. Hansen of Utah and Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, all Republicans, and John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Robert C. Scott of Virginia and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, Democrats. Most of the members have been active in national security issues.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 19-> A Tough but Responsible Solution
While no longer a member of Congress, as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding. Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of negative television advertising paid for with money raised through questionable fund-raising tactics by the President and Vice President. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in Congress will hold the Attorney General accountable and pursue the alleged illegal fund-raising activities. Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter. I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt that half the American people understand the complex impeachment process. Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small details would have to be worked out by Congressional leaders working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles. So, here goes: Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary Committee. Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution (numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the essence or ''guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the Senate majority leader. Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the joint resolution under a time agreement. The Vice President (President of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be in order. All points of order would be waived. Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be considered under a time agreement. Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the conference report would be considered under a time agreement in both the House and the Senate. Conditions, Etc. 1. The President announces his intention to support and sign the joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate. a. The President agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public signing ceremony attended by the Vice President, Congressional leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the President's Cabinet; the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and others as recommended by House and Senate leaders. b. White House, Senate and House media -- television, radio, print and photographers -- shall be present. c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority leader. d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate Presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet, members of Congress and heads of other Government agencies. This is to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution. 2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items: a. All Congressional action completed and the President's signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999. b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the President, Vice President and Democratic Congressional leaders fail to publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to be demonstrated by the President, Vice President and Democratic leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also agree to publicly and actively support it. c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the President's legal obligations upon leaving office. 3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. Summary These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have consulted with no one. They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 Senators would vote to convict the President on any of the four articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee, notwithstanding what the full House might do. I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress begins work in January 1999. It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority of Americans that Republican Congressional leaders will fulfill their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999. I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion. Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 20-> N.F.L.: WEEK 16; FALCONS CLINCH DIVISION
Dan Reeves wasn't on the sideline. He didn't need to be. Atlanta's coach had done enough by sending the Falcons off a day earlier. He walked out of the hospital to see us off, Jamal Anderson said. He's a good man. With Reeves recovering from quadruple heart bypass surgery, Anderson scored two touchdowns and Atlanta showed plenty of heart in a comeback victory against the Detroit Lions at the Silverdome, clinching the Falcons' first National Football Conference West title in 18 years and a first-round bye in the playoffs. It was just the second division title for the Falcons, who set a club record for victories in a season. The Falcons have won eight straight. Reeves, who returned to the hospital yesterday, was expected back for the playoffs. But he was not needed as the Falcons, with the defensive coordinator Rich Brooks acting as coach, rallied from a 17-10 third-quarter deficit with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against Detroit. Dan Reeves is responsible for where we are now, Brooks said. As they have done all season, the Falcons forced turnovers and made the opponent pay. A rare fumble by Barry Sanders, one of three Detroit turnovers, set up Atlanta's first touchdown. The Falcons have turned 38 takeaways into 126 points this season. Anderson, who rushed for 147 yards on 30 carries, has 1,743 yards for the season, breaking the club record of 1,719 set by Gerald Riggs in 1985.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 21-> Science Watch
Flying Solo, Minus One IT has taken seven decades, but the aviation world has at last done Charles Lindbergh one better: An airplane has flown nonstop across the Atlantic, not with just one person on board, but with no one. The airplane in question is a 29-pound propeller-driven pixie, with a 10-foot wing span and a gas-powered engine that is far tinier than the average car's. Its 1,900-mile flight last month, from Newfoundland to the Outer Hebrides, was the first Atlantic crossing by a civilian robotic aircraft. After being launched from the roof of a moving car, it made the trip in about 26 hours, flying well below commercial air traffic lanes. The plane, called an Aerosonde, was developed by Australian and American companies with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and researchers at the University of Washington. The developers hope robotic planes can be used as a relatively low-cost means of gathering weather data over remote areas like oceans. The flight was a major test of the Aerosonde's ability to function solo. It was out of radio contact for most of the journey, relying instead on a satellite's Global Positioning System to keep it on track. The developers acknowledge that the planes still have a few bugs; indeed, they launched four Aerosondes, fully expecting that not all would make it. And that's what happened: one crashed on takeoff and two, like Amelia Earhart, just disappeared. Tagging the Tuna Under the Atlantic, bluefin tuna are sporting a bit of satellite technology of their own these days. Scientists from Stanford University, the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California and the National Marine Fisheries Service have been using new ''pop-up'' tags since 1996 to track movements of giant tuna. The tags, which contain microprocessors to record water temperature and other data, pop free of the fish at a set time, float to the surface and send data to a satellite. The transmission also pinpoints the tag's location. Conventional tags are recovered only if a fish is caught and a tag is turned in by the fisherman. With bluefin tuna, only about one in eight conventional tags are ever recovered. By contrast, of 37 fish tagged off Cape Hatteras, N.C., with the new devices, data was collected from 35. The researchers, who plan to tag at least 600 tuna over the next two years, will use the information to help increase the tuna population, whose breeding numbers have declined greatly over several decades. Bluefin tuna are currently treated as two separate stocks, one in the western Atlantic and one in the eastern, with different catch quotas for each. Already, the scientists have discovered that some of the fish cross the line separating the two stocks, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the management strategy. Putting Bacteria to Work It's a lesson that every farmer knows: The roots of certain legumes like soybeans have bacteria capable of changing nitrogen in the air to a form the plant can use, enabling it to grow in poor soil. Now, Australian scientists have identified an enzyme that is involved in transferring the ''fixed'' nitrogen in the form of an ammonium ion from the bacteria to the host plant. The enzyme controls nitrogen transfer across what is called the peribacteroid membrane, which keeps the bacteria separate from the plant tissue. Still to be determined is exactly how the enzyme, a protein, creates a channel for the ions to cross. The researchers, reporting on the discovery in a recent issue of Nature, say its helical structure may play a role.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 22-> Sports of The Times; With Visions of 14-0, Denver Lost Its Focus
THERE was a peculiar symmetry between the locker rooms at Giants Stadium before and after yesterday's game. Before the game, the high-flying Denver Broncos were aspiring to make National Football League history, rumbling toward posterity. The young, struggling Giants were grasping for a slim playoff hope, but were really playing for respectability. Afterward, they occupied dramatically different worlds. In the Giants' locker room, wide receiver Amani Toomer basked in the glory of a game-winning 37-yard touchdown pass. Down the dark concrete corridor in the visitors' locker room, Tito Paul, the 26-year-old defensive back Toomer beat on the play, sat on a stool in front of his locker. Head down, chin buried in his chest, Paul blamed himself for everything from losing sight of Toomer to not going up more aggressively for the ball. Paul would sit there for 45 minutes, answering questions, trying to put the loss in perspective, as teammates came by and patted him on the back, whispered encouragement or simply ignored him. ''There's no consolation,'' he said. ''I know we have 11 guys out there, but everybody's expected to do their job. I didn't hold up my end.'' The Broncos' winning streak, which ended at 18 games over two seasons with their 20-16 loss to the Giants, had become part of their lives, their identity. ''You can't help it,'' said Tyrone Braxton, the veteran defensive back. ''Every day, every week people ask you about the streak, it becomes a part of you.'' Denver had not lost a game in nearly a year, not since a 34-17 loss to San Francisco last Dec. 15. Now Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, was asked about the play that ended Denver's dream of a perfect season. ''We all saw the same thing,'' he said. ''The guy threw it up in the air and their receiver made a play and our defensive back did not.'' For players, for a franchise -- and for television networks -- Paul's misplay looms larger than a mere bad play that loses a game. No team except the 1972 Miami Dolphins had gone undefeated. The Broncos needed three more victories to complete a perfect regular season. What a great encore to a Super Bowl championship. ABC was looking forward to next Monday night's game between Denver and Miami. Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos' tight end, admitted that he had not expected the streak to end at Giants Stadium. ''They're a good young team, a quality team,'' he said. ''But no, I wouldn't have thought it would end here. Not like this.'' Terrell Davis, the Denver running back, was so ill when he woke up yesterday that he thought he would not play. ''I thought there was a 90 percent chance I wouldn't play,'' Davis said. ''I couldn't lift my bag to get out of the room. It took so much energy just to pack my bag and carry it down to the team meeting.'' Still, Davis carried 28 times for 147 yards. The winning streak, which ended one game short of the N.F.L. record, might have been the underlying reason for the loss. Steve Atwater, the veteran safety, said the Broncos may have been seduced by the specter of setting a record. The Broncos had not played well the previous three weeks; Atwater said the team was preparing for the streak and not the opposition. ''That was the problem; we weren't focused on winning, we were focused on 14-0,'' he said. ''Sure you practice and all of that, but in the back of your mind, the only thing you're thinking about is the outcome of the game, not the job at hand.'' Atwater said he hadn't said anything ''because we were still winning, but play was getting a little sloppy on game day.'' Linebacker Bill Romanowski had noticed the same thing. ''The things you look for are, (a) how did we practice, and (b) how was our focus in practice, our attention to detail,'' he said. ''We had good practices last week. It didn't carry over into the game. There wasn't a sense of urgency out there. That's what it takes every single down. It wasn't there today.'' Atwater added: ''People are talking about the Super Bowl. We've still got two regular-season games to play and two playoff games. It's crazy to be talking about the Super Bowl.'' Nearly an hour after the game, the visitors' locker room was practically deserted. A member of the Broncos' media relations staff encouraged Paul, as compassionately as possible, to get dressed. He had given up the touchdown; don't compound the problem by holding up the team bus. Paul pulled on his shoes, then his tweed jacket. He checked to make sure he hadn't left anything more than hurt pride in his dressing stall. Defensive backs, like gunners in basketball, generally have short memories. ''I won't be forgetting about this soon,'' Paul sighed. He walked out, past the friends and family of the Giants he had made so happy. The streak was over. The Broncos had lost a bit of luster; now they're just another very good team trying to reach the Super Bowl. While Amani Toomer's world reverberated with cheers, all Tito Paul would hear was Shanahan's blunt analysis. ''Their receiver made a play,'' he said. ''Our defensive back did not.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 23-> OLYMPICS; Samaranch Says Host Cities May Be Picked in New Way
The president of the International Olympic Committee expects his organization to find a new way of selecting Olympic cities as a result of the widening accusations of bribery. ''After this scandal, I believe that the I.O.C. as a whole must accept that the system needs to change and that we can't continue like this,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch said today in the newspaper Le Matin. ''We are not happy with the way of selecting organizing cities for the games.'' The I.O.C. has been shaken by accusations of corruption and vote-buying masterminded by agents. A top I.O.C. member, Marc Hodler of Switzerland, has estimated that 5 percent to 7 percent of the 114 members are open to bribery. Samaranch said that the Olympics should follow the example of other major sports bodies, which leave significant decisions to their executive committees rather than the full membership. He told Le Matin that he had proposed this several times. ''But it's not easy to ask members to agree to cut off their own heads,'' he said. Given the circumstances, though, he said it was possible the I.O.C. members would give the 11-member executive committee special powers. Samaranch said the investigation into actions by Salt Lake City, the host for the 2002 Winter Games, should be completed by Jan. 23 and would be discussed at a meeting that day. Salt Lake organizers admit having a $400,000 scholarship fund for I.O.C. members' families and others but have said it was a humanitarian gesture rather than bribery. There is growing evidence of other favors for I.O.C. members, including free medical care and gifts in excess of the I.O.C.'s limit. Many of the accusations focus on I.O.C. members from Africa, particularly those from the Congo, Libya and Swaziland. Samaranch said the new selection procedure might be in place by next summer, when the choice is made for the host of the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 25-> PUBLIC LIVES
A Musician's Life, Now in Paperback CHARLES MICHENER was watching a violent storm blow through Litchfield County, Connecticut, yesterday afternoon and talking about his friend PETER DUCHIN, whose autobiography, ''Ghost of a Chance'' (Random House), he helped write two years ago. ''Before the book was written, he had a hard time being alone,'' said Mr. Michener, now a senior editor at The New Yorker. ''Since then, he's developed that capacity. It also brought him much closer to his children. He was discovering himself as he wrote it.'' The book, just released in paperback, is the story of a poor little rich boy, the son of the bandleader Eddy Duchin and his vivacious wife, Marjorie Oelrichs, a member of Newport and New York society, who died just days after giving birth, in 1937. The peripatetic father leaves him in the care of friends, Marie and Averell Harriman, in their many homes from Sun Valley, Idaho, to Hobe Sound, Fla. His companions were gardeners, gamekeepers and maids. When he wasn't running into JOE DIMAGGIO at the Broadway restaurant of his father's pal Toots Shor, he was hobnobbing at parties with Fred Astaire or dancing the night away with KIM NOVAK, who played his mother in the film ''The Eddy Duchin Story.'' And as soon as he was old enough, he was sent to boarding school -- first Eaglebrook, then Hotchkiss and on to Yale, where he was Class of '59 and Mr. Michener was Class of '62. ''Jackie Onassis made the original contact,'' Mr. Michener recalled. ''She said: 'You should do Peter's book. It's a very amazing kind of fairy tale, a strange story.' '' Mr. Michener said that after the book was written, Mrs. Onassis offered to be a kind of ''ghost editor.'' ''We spent a day with her,'' Mr. Michener said. ''She was very candid about the similarities with her own life,'' referring to the feeling that as a Roman Catholic and a child of divorce, she was somehow an outsider in her own circle. Mr. Duchin still travels a good deal and maintains a hectic schedule of orchestra bookings, but this weekend even Mr. Michener couldn't track him down, not in Newport at a cotillion or at the Whitneys' in Saratoga. He was at the wedding of his daughter COURTNAY DUCHIN, in Montana, where Mr. Duchin, an expert fly-fisherman, is more likely to be found in waders than in a dinner jacket. As the Song Goes, 'Think Pink' The lights on 14 of the city's most famous buildings will go pink this week in honor of the fight against breast cancer and the coming New York Race for the Cure. The fellow who figuratively -- and at times literally -- changes the fixtures is SCOTT THURM, the 40-year-old president of Universe Lighting. The longtime lighting consultant for the Empire State Building, the first building to go pink, back in '94, Mr. Thurm helped devise the pink glow of the Lincoln Center fountain and brought in his own crew to do the lights on the Chrysler Building, when it was bankrupt last year. (This year, with new owners, things are easier, Mr. Thurm reports.) This season's most difficult site? ''The Crown Building,'' Mr. Thurm said. ''They have high-pressure sodium fixtures that produce yellow lights. I'm not saying it's brain surgery to make the color pink come out of yellow light, but there's quite a bit of testing and sampling.'' And how did the Empire State Building happen to go pink? LYDIA RUTH, the spokeswoman for the building, said: ''I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was 22. I also almost lost a best friend. So many people look at the building as a barometer for what's going on in the city. I thought, what better way to bring attention to breast cancer research.'' Ms. Ruth's mother was PATRICIA RUTH of Harrisburg, Pa. ''She was tall, with black hair,'' Ms. Ruth said. ''She played the piano, painted and wrote poetry. When she was younger, people compared her to Hedy Lamarr. She lived one year after they discovered the cancer and died Nov. 8, 1969. Some dates you don't forget.'' CHARLES STRUM with Joyce Wadler

Dec. 30, 1998-> 26-> Under Prodding, 2 Apologize for Cambodian Anguish
A top leader of the Khmer Rouge muttered an apology on Tuesday, saying he was ''sorry, very sorry'' for the suffering he had caused the Cambodian people. His apology, in English, came only after aggressive questioning at a news conference. At the insistence of Cambodian reporters, he repeated it in the Khmer language: ''Knyom som tos.'' But the leader, Khieu Samphan, repeatedly urged Cambodians and foreigners to ''let bygones be bygones'' regarding the deaths of more than a million people between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia and he was head of state. Mr. Khieu Samphan, 67, who was welcomed back to society on Tuesday with an embrace from Prime Minister Hun Sen and a trip to Phnom Penh with accommodations at a luxury hotel, said Cambodia should focus on the problems of the present and ''forget the past.'' Today, however, King Norodom Sihanouk said he would not grant an amnesty to Mr. Khieu Samphan or other Khmer Rouge leaders. His decision leaves open the possibility that they could face trial in a Cambodian court rather the politically complex alternative, an international court. A second high-ranking defector, Nuon Chea, 71, was also asked if he had an apology to make to his countrymen. ''Actually, we are very sorry not only for the lives of the people of Cambodia, but even for the lives of all animals that suffered because of the war,'' he said. Some Cambodians said the remark reflected a Buddhist pacifist theology that values the lives of all creatures. They also noted that Mr. Nuon Chea referred specifically to Cambodia's long civil war, not to the ravages of the Khmer Rouge rule, when nearly a fourth of the country's population was killed or died of starvation, disease or overwork. Known as ''Brother No. 2'' to the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, Mr. Nuon Chea was the architect of the movement's brutal forced evacuation of cities in 1975. He later had command responsibility over a wave of purges in which many thousands of people were tortured and killed. Asked whether the Khmer Rouge were indeed responsible for large numbers of deaths, he said: ''Please leave this to history. This is an old story. Please leave it to the past.'' Mr. Khieu Samphan was similarly circumspect on the question of guilt, muttering at one point, ''To say who is wrong and who is right and who is doing this and who is doing that, et cetera,'' then rephrasing: ''The developments of history in our country are very complicated. Please don't keep stirring things up.'' He said he had listened on Tuesday to a foreign radio broadcast in which Cambodians had described the losses of family members at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. ''It is normal that those who have lost their families, that they -- what to say -- feel some resentment,'' he said, speaking in English. ''But I feel that most of our compatriots understand that we have much more problems to resolve at the present and in the future and we have to forget the past.'' He added: '' 'Let bygones be bygones' is the best solution for our country, because it is the only way to reach national reconciliation. It is the sine qua non condition for peace and stability in our country.'' Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge leader himself, said the same thing on Monday in somewhat less high-flown language: ''We should dig a hole and bury the past.'' Despite his past assurances that he wanted and would assist in setting up a tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity, Mr. Hun Sen said on Monday that those who surrendered should be greeted ''with bouquets of flowers, not with prisons and handcuffs.'' While they were indeed greeted with bouquets at their hotel on Tuesday, a Western diplomat said work was continuing at the United Nations to lay the groundwork for any possible future trial. The surrenders by Mr. Khieu Samphan and Mr. Nuon Chea virtually complete the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement, a process that began more than two years ago with widening defections. Only one major figure, the battlefield commander Ta Mok, has not given up or been welcomed back by the Government. Virtually all of his guerrilla fighters are gone. During the news conference, Mr. Khieu Samphan mostly maintained his smile, but he was clearly distressed by a drumbeat of harsh questions. Would he at least tell the Cambodian people he was sorry for their suffering, a foreign reporter asked. ''Yes,'' he said, barely audibly. ''Sorry, very sorry.'' In the audience, a Cambodian human rights worker could hardly contain himself. ''Sorry is enough? Enough? I want to beat these guys up,'' he said. A Cambodian reporter shushed him. But later the reporter, who had earlier said he agreed with Mr. Hun Sen's policy of forgiveness and national reconciliation, said he could not hold down a surge of fury when the two Khmer Rouge leaders arrived at a luxury hotel in their chauffeured sport utility vehicles. ''When I see them, it is difficult to forgive -- very difficult,'' said the reporter, who lost most of his family during the Khmer Rouge years. ''It is just like waking me up when I see them. But we have to forgive and move on.'' The two elderly leaders, who gave up their struggle four days ago, flew here on Tuesday morning by helicopter from the western town of Pailin, where they have begun new lives as self-proclaimed ''ordinary citizens.'' They were treated to lunch by Mr. Hun Sen before being driven to their hotel, where a manager said they and their families had been booked in by the Defense Ministry at a corporate rate of $105, including breakfast. The manager said welcome baskets of fruit and flowers had been placed in their rooms. The two men were joined at the lunch by Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge Foreign Minister, who defected more than two years ago. He is the chieftain of Pailin, which has become an enclave for the defecting killers. When a small group of Cambodian photographers was allowed to take pictures of their meeting with the Prime Minister on Tuesday morning, his aides instructed them in what they said was a threatening manner not to publish any photographs of a handshake or embrace. Mr. Khieu Samphan and Mr. Nuon Chea arrived in the capital in a strange political vacuum -- indeed, a vacuum of reality -- unnoticed and unremarked as the daily life of this threadbare city surged around them. Their defection and coming visit had been reported in the local press, although their schedule was not disclosed in advance. It was the first visit here by Mr. Nuon Chea since Khmer Rouge times, when Phnom Penh was a dead city, emptied of its citizens by his absolutist theory of a primitive agrarian revolution. He walked slowly, using a polished and ornamented wood cane, looking straight ahead and saying little. Mr. Khieu Samphan, one of the movement's chief diplomats, had dyed his white hair a rich chestnut brown and seemed to want to exude a suave urbanity. But as he left the heated news conference, surrounded by jostling, shouting reporters and struggling security men, his smile became fixed and even terrified.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 27-> TELEVISION REVIEW; Questioning Scientology: Persecuted or Persecutor?
Is Scientology a religion or a cult, and is there a difference? Are its disciples being helped to live happier, more rewarding lives, or are they being exploited? Is the organization out for power and wealth, or is it doing good works by contributing to drug and literacy programs? Is it the victim of persecution, or does it persecute its critics? Such are the main issues that have roiled around the contentious Church of Scientology, described somewhat ornately tonight by Bill Kurtis as seeking a place ''on the map of global emerging philosophies,'' since its beginnings a half century ago. The first hour is given to the shadowy, some say shady career of the movement's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the science-fiction writer who discovered or invented or conjured up the principles and tactics, which he labeled ''Dianetics,'' and which have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. The group's methods of operation, especially its aggressive treatment of those it deems insufficiently friendly have attracted the generally unfriendly attentions of the law and the media. The second hour pits disaffected Scientologists, who charge the organization with thought-control tactics, against its acolytes, who tell how their lives were enriched by techniques that they say clear them of bad thoughts and attitudes. Testimonials come from celebrity members like Isaac Hayes (''I felt great'') and John Travolta, who reports that he has found in Hubbard's teachings the answers to criminality, war and insanity. David Miscavige, the current leader of the organization, says that Scientology is ''the place where science and religion have truly met.'' Nothing heard tonight is likely to persuade you of that or of much else about the efficacy of its therapeutic approach, much less its spiritual provenance. But at the least, you may come away with an appreciation of the zeal that is still being churned up over the church or the cult, both among those who worship there and those who preach against it. 'NYTV: By the People Who Made It' PBS tonight (Channel 13, New York, at 9) Reality cannot match the glow of memory in tonight's fond reminiscences of the early years of television making in New York. But for viewers of the right age, the anecdotes and clips should be warming. ''NYTV'' brings back many of the people who did the making, along with glimpses of ''Howdy Doody'' and ''Marty,'' Milton Berle and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, quiz shows and talk shows and soaps and wrestling and much else that hooked the first set owners when television was still figuring out what it was supposed to be about. Al Roker links the vintage favorites with a quick history of the medium, including dark periods like the McCarthy-era blacklists and the quiz show scandals. But these two hours are mostly cheery as they celebrate the New York creative spirit, which at least in these recollections was free and daring, with innovators like Fred Coe and Pat Weaver encouraging writers like Rod Serling and geniuses like Sid Caesar to go for it. Some of tonight's veterans lament that things have only gotten worse, especially since most television producing moved West. Could the New York era have been as much fun as tonight's participants recall or as good as they tell us? Well, we were all a lot younger. INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS Inside Scientology A&E, tonight at 9. For Investigative Reports: Bill Kurtis, host and executive producer. For A&E: Michael Cascio, executive producer; Gayle Gilman, supervising producer. Produced by Tobin Productions for A&E.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 28-> GARDEN Q.& A.
1999 Award Winners The spotlights were dim and the movie stars stayed home, but the awards were given out nonetheless. The 1999 horticultural awards, that is. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society has given gold medals since 1988 to underappreciated trees, shrubs and woody vines that are hardy from Washington to New York City. And since 1997, several horticultural societies and professional groups in New England have presented the Cary Awards for outstanding woody plants that are hardy in New England. This year, each group picked three outstanding garden performers. One of them might be perfect in your garden. And the three Pennsylvania winners are: Acer palmatum Waterfall, a small, green-leaved Japanese maple with a cascading habit, which slowly reaches 12 feet by 18 feet. Brilliant gold-red, deeply cut leaves make it a center of interest every fall. Enkianthus perulatus J. L. Pennock, a graceful shrub, grows six feet high and wide. White flowers are out before the leaves emerge, but its real glory comes in fall. Beginning with a purple tinge, it gradually turns a spectacular red. Metasequoia glyptostroboides, dawn redwood, is a fast-growing tree that can eventually reach 100 feet. It has very fine-textured bright green foliage that turns a lovely burnt-orange before it drops in autumn. It has a neat, conical form and has a presence about it that makes it the focal point of any larger property. The three Cary Award winners are: Cornus mas, cornelian cherry dogwood, a 20-foot tree that is covered with tiny yellow flowers before the leaves emerge in spring. It ends the fall with ripening red fruit, and it has peeling bark when mature. Ilex x meserveae Blue Prince and Blue Princess share an award. Both of these hollies have glossy foliage and grow to about 15 feet, but can be pruned. Blue Princess sets a lot of fruit, but she needs a Blue Prince nearby. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, bearberry or kinnikinick, is a native New England evergreen ground cover. Slow growing, it has glossy green leaves that turn bronzy in winter. Complete descriptions and sources for all these winners are available by sending self-addressed envelopes bearing 55 cents in stamps to Gold Medal Plant Awards, Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, 100 North 20th Street, Fifth Floor, Philadelphia 19103; or to Cary Awards, Tower Hill Botanic Garden, P.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 29-> The Science of Silicone Implants
A court-appointed panel of experts has concluded that existing scientific evidence does not show a link between silicone breast implants and systemic disease. Federal Judge Sam Pointer Jr., who is overseeing breast-implant lawsuits in the Federal courts, convened the panel to advise him on medical evidence surrounding implants. His approach was unusual in that he sought expert testimony independent of either side in the litigation. That strategy may also be useful in other complex cases where juries and judges are forced to choose between battling experts who may be biased. Lawyers from both sides will now have the opportunity to question the expert panelists in depositions and to use that testimony in implant trials. The findings should make trials somewhat easier to conduct, and may cause more plaintiffs to settle their claims against the implant manufacturers. Well before the panel's report, thousands of cases had been settled. Last month, the Dow Corning Corporation, once the leading maker of silicone implants, and representatives of implant plaintiffs formally agreed to a plan that will pay some 170,000 claimants $3.2 billion over 15 years for suffering and the costs of implant removal. Both sides decided that it was better financially to make a deal than to fight out the science in court. The new report, which will not affect that settlement, puts forward solid conclusions based on multiple studies. But the panel's findings do not represent the last word on implant safety. A National Cancer Institute study of 13,500 women who have had implants is looking at the long-term health impacts. Results from that study will not be available until next year. A panel convened by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, is also continuing to review the medical evidence. The report from Judge Pointer's panel shows how much is known. Other scientists are still researching aspects of implants that are not yet known.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 30-> In America; Justice Confounded
Here we go again. Dana Garner is the compulsive liar whose fantasies and false testimony sent an innocent man to prison for murder in 1991. The man, Jeffrey Blake, was freed two months ago. By then it had become clear to authorities that Mr. Garner, who claimed to have seen Mr. Blake kill two men in a car in Brooklyn, was not even in New York when the murders occurred. Now it appears that Mr. Garner was lying in another case in which he claimed to have witnessed a killing. It seems, once more, that he was not at the scene at all. The defendant in that case, Rubin Ortega, was convicted of second-degree murder in February 1991, just a few weeks before Mr. Blake was convicted. Mr. Garner was the primary witness, but not the only witness, against Mr. Ortega. It is not possible to tell at this point whether Mr. Ortega, who is serving a sentence of 25 years to life, was guilty or innocent. What is clear is that Mr. Garner and his catalogue of false stories and bogus eyewitness accounts -- and the willingness of the police and prosecutors to use him as a witness in important cases -- are having a dreadful effect on the criminal justice system. In the Blake case, the real murderer or murderers went free. In the Ortega case, no one knows what's what. Mr. Garner reveled in his peculiar role as a police stooge and designated witness for the prosecution. How many other cases have his scurrilous imprint on them? The murder that Mr. Ortega is alleged to have committed occurred shortly before 4 A.M. on June 25, 1990. Mr. Ortega was 16 years old. Prosecutors said that he and two accomplices had opened fire on three men -- Lionel Diaz, Ricardo Betances and Angel Narvaez -- near the intersection of Livonia Avenue and Hendrix Street in the East New York section of Brooklyn. According to prosecutors, Mr. Ortega shot Mr. Diaz in the chest at close range, killing him. Mr. Betances and Mr. Narvaez were wounded but survived. This shooting occurred exactly one week after the June 18 murders that landed Jeffrey Blake in prison. In each case, Mr. Garner told investigators that he had just happened to witness the killings. The shootings on June 18 occurred between 1:30 and 2 in the afternoon. Mr. Garner said he had been out with his girlfriend, Margaret Allen, and that she had seen them too. It turned out that neither of them was in New York that day. Ms. Allen would later say, ''I would remember a murder if I had seen one.'' Mr. Garner told authorities he was waiting near a subway station for his mother on June 25 when the shooting broke out. He said he had been hanging around for nearly an hour, from about 3 to 4 A.M., waiting for his mother to arrive so he could walk her home. He said he saw Rubin Ortega shoot and kill Lionel Diaz. Now comes an extraordinary letter from the office of the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles Hynes. The letter was sent to a lawyer for Mr. Ortega by Jon Besunder, an assistant to Mr. Hynes. It noted that a number of Mr. Garner's relatives had been interviewed as part of the investigation of the Jeffrey Blake fiasco. The letter said: ''During the course of these interviews, information was received from Dana Garner's mother, which contradicted portions of his testimony at the trial of Rubin Ortega concerning the events of June 25, 1990. At that trial, Dana Garner testified, in substance, that his presence at the crime scene was the result of waiting for, and then meeting, his mother, in the vicinity of the shooting, and also to certain events and activity occurring in the presence of both he [sic] and his mother. ''In substance, Dana Garner's mother denies her presence in the area of the crimes on June 25, 1990, and she refutes several of Dana Garner's reasons for her presence at that time. In addition, several other members of his family claimed that Dana Garner's reputation for truthfulness was minimal.'' In short, the prosecution has been forced to bail out on its chief witness in the Ortega murder case. Complicating matters is the fact that the two survivors of the shooting disagree on whether Mr. Ortega was one of the gunmen. Mr. Betances said he was. Mr. Narvaez said he wasn't. But Mr. Betances did not finger Mr. Ortega until after Mr. Garner identified him as the shooter. And court papers indicate Mr. Betances may have been under the influence of crack when he was shot. What we have is a mess. No one would mistake Rubin Ortega for a solid citizen. But if he didn't commit this murder, then another horrible injustice has been done. On the other hand, if he did kill Lionel Diaz and his conviction is thrown out because a chronic perjurer was used as a key witness, then we are faced with the danger of setting a killer free, perhaps to kill again.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 31-> PLUS: ROWING -- WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; U.S. Eights Advance to Finals
The United States men's and women's eights qualified for the finals of the world championships at Cologne, Germany, yesterday. The American women had the fastest time of the two semifinal heats, 6 minutes 35.43 seconds, beating Canada by 3.97 seconds. Romania won the other heat in 6:35.90. In the men's eights, Germany recorded the quickest time, 5:54.05, while the Americans won their heat in 5:54.89. The other United States victory yesterday came when the women's lightweight double sculls team of Christine Collins of Darien, Conn., and Sarah Garner of Madison, Wis., took their heat in 7:36.36.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 32-> In Times Sq., a Dry Run for New Year's 2000
The half-million revelers expected to gather in Times Square tonight may not realize it, but they will really be attending a dress rehearsal. Yes, the brand-new music and sound effects, the 16-foot-tall puppet of Father Time, the three video screens, the 27 extra spotlights (including what is billed as ''the most powerful searchlight in the world''), even the extra half ton of confetti, are all part of a dry run in preparation for New Year's Eve 1999. Or, as the event's promoters like to put it, ''Times Square 2000, the Global Celebration at the Crossroads of the World.'' With a name like that, next year's event had better be an extravaganza, and no producers in their right minds would try to put on such a show without a trial run. Which is why tonight's festivities will serve as a rehearsal, said Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, which is organizing the festivities along with Countdown Entertainment. ''We're going to use it to test some things,'' he said. Take, for example, that giant Father Time, which was designed by Michael Curry, who made the puppets used in ''The Lion King'' on Broadway. The puppet, which is 24 feet long and requires eight handlers, is supposed to drift through the crowd carrying an illuminated hourglass. Basically, it will be taken though safety lanes that the police keep clear, and it is the police who will determine, in large part, if the experiment was a success, Mr. Sexton said. ''If it works out, maybe we'll have more than one'' puppet next year, he added. The biggest innovation is probably the music and sound effects, which will be broadcast starting a little after 10:30 P.M. from speakers mounted on 10 buildings. The tunes on the play list remain a secret. ''I can't tell you everything,'' Mr. Sexton said, relenting only enough to describe the selections as international and instrumental. But don't wait to hear ''Auld Lang Syne'' at midnight. The music is to be turned off by 11:45 to focus attention on the roar of the crowd. In hopes that the throngs will be able to see more than the back of someone's head, the producers are setting up three huge video screens, two more than last year, on which they will broadcast the festivities. The screens will be at Broadway and 50th Street, 43d Street at Eighth Avenue, and 43d and the Avenue of the Americas. Next year, the producers promise, such screens will dot the entire neighborhood. Organizers hope next year to use the music and video screens to mark the turn of the century in each time zone around the world, with appropriate local selections, sights and sound effects. Manhattan will represent Eastern Standard Time; the party will not conclude until Hawaii enters 2000, five hours after New York. Some calendar sticklers, nit-pickers and party poopers may insist that 2001 is really the start of the millennium, but New York will not wait to hold what Mr. Sexton called ''the biggest party ever in recorded history ever.'' This year's crowd may be smaller than the hordes expected next year, but nevertheless, 100,000 more people are expected to attend than showed up last year, the Times Square business group said. So the police intend to start closing the avenues around Times Square earlier than ever. Officers will begin banning traffic from the Avenue of the Americas to Eighth Avenue, from 38th Street to 57th Street, starting at 6 P.M., said the community affairs office of the Midtown South Precinct. More streets may be closed off by midnight. In some ways, tonight's celebration will be much like those of years past, only more so. Much more so. Last year, volunteers dumped only three tons of special Times Square confetti -- it is bigger, of course -- out of windows; this year, they will hurl three and a half tons down on the crowd (among those credited with this production is a ''confetti master'' named Treb Heining). And while balloons have long been a feature of the party scene, along with Mylar pom-poms and leis, this year, 15,000 of them will be distributed to the crowd, which is supposed to fling them into the air at midnight. Last year, a mere 16 spotlights lighted up the sky; this year, there will be 42, Mr. Sexton said, plus the ''space cannon,'' which can apparently be seen from other galaxies (hint to little green guys: focus your telescopes on 42d Street just south of One Times Square). And while pyrotechnic displays have added excitement to previous shows, this year they are to be longer (45 seconds, starting at the stroke of midnight) and bigger (atop three buildings: One Times Square, 1500 Broadway and 1501 Broadway). These are not real fireworks, but rather the theatrical explosions one might see at ''Beauty and the Beast,'' Mr. Sexton said, adding that though they were perfectly safe, ''the Fire Department does stand there while we do this.'' Why would New Yorkers want to spend hours jammed into a space with all the amenities of the Lexington Avenue subway at rush hour, especially with temperatures expected to be in the 20's? They don't, for the most part. About 85 percent of the revelers are from out of town, according to a study done in 1995 by the Times Square business district. Estimates are that those tourists spend almost $24 million, which helps explain why (in addition to bragging rights) the city is willing to play host to such a gigantic bash. The property owners around Times Square have an economic incentive, too; the more people who see their billboards, the more they can charge advertisers to use them. One Times Square, which is the chief sponsor of the event along with the business improvement district, has evolved into a billboard in building form. It is also where the ball drops, and Mr. Sexton has some reassuring words about that. When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sang Lan, the Chinese gymnast injured in the Goodwill Games last summer, push the button one minute before midnight, the ball will be the now-traditional one that looks like a huge disco light, not a big apple. (Nor will a new ball that has been commissioned for the new century look like a piece of fruit.) ''In fact, that was only one year, in the 1980's,'' Mr. Sexton said of the apple experiment. ''And everyone agreed it was hokey and tacky. We immediately reverted to the ball.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 33-> National News Briefs; A Hometown Welcome In Ohio For the Glenns
John and Annie Glenn returned on Saturday to the town they left more than 50 years ago so he could become a Marine pilot. People lined the narrow sidewalks of their hometown of 2,000 in eastern Ohio's hills to salute the Glenns with a parade, celebrating Mr. Glenn's second space flight, aboard the space shuttle Discovery. It was their second trip down the middle of Main Street. The first came in 1962 after Mr. Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. The Glenns rode a float featuring a replica of the Discovery, smiling and waving in the drizzling, windy, 40-degree weather. The crowd was estimated at 5,000 people, one-tenth of the crowd at their 1962 parade. After his return to space on Oct. 29, there were parades for Mr. Glenn, who is 77 years old, in New York and Washington. The Glenns, who both grew up in New Concord and began dating when they were classmates at the local Muskingum College, left during World War II so Mr. Glenn could become a fighter pilot. They will teach part-time at the college after Mr. Glenn's 24-year Senate career ends this month.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 34-> National News Briefs; Court to Hear Appeal Of Bombing Conspirator
A request by the convicted Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry L. Nichols for a new trial is scheduled to be heard on Feb. 1 by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. Mr. Nichols is seeking a new trial on the ground that a deal Federal prosecutors made with a star witness, Michael J. Fortier, amounted to bribery. Lawyers for Mr. Nichols also said the trial judge had erred on jury instructions, witness rulings, punishment and restitution. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Nichols had a scrupulously fair trial. In 1997, Mr. Nichols, 43, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy in the bombing of the Federal Building on April 19, 1995. It killed 168 people and wounded hundreds. He was acquitted of murder and weapons offenses in the case. Mr. Nichols is serving a life sentence and was ordered to pay $14.5 million in restitution. A former Army buddy, Timothy J. McVeigh, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the case.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 35-> Security Experts Assessing U.S. Embassies
Alarmed by evidence that terrorists are planning new attacks on American embassies, the Administration has dispatched counterterrorism experts to diplomatic missions around the world to determine if any are so vulnerable that they should be shuttered immediately, Administration officials say. The officials add that terrorists believed to be associated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of orchestrating the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa last month, are surveying other embassies in preparation for a new round of attacks. The officials are convinced that terrorists allied with Mr. bin Laden were prepared last month to bomb the United States Embassy in Tirana, Albania. The embassy was hastily closed on Aug. 14 as a result of intelligence reports showing that it had been selected by Muslim fundamentalists for attack. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the attack was foiled with the help of Albanian security forces. Last week the embassy in Kuwait warned Americans that terrorists may be planning attacks there similar to the bombings on Aug. 7 in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. American embassies in Ghana and Togo were also temporarily closed last week in response to perceived terrorist threats. Government officials have said that the White House and the State Department are expected to submit a formal request to Congress this week for between $1 billion and $3 billion to build new embassies to replace those in Kenya and Tanzania, and to pay for emergency security improvements at embassies around the world. Senior American officials have publicly predicted that Mr. bin Laden will try to retaliate for the American air strike on what the Administration has described as his terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. That attack and another in the Sudan were ordered by President Clinton in response to the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which he blamed on Mr. bin Laden and his followers. ''I think we can predict, with some certainty, that we will see a reaction by bin Laden and his organization,'' the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, said last week. He termed the threat of attacks on Americans by Mr. bin Laden's followers ''about as serious and imminent a threat as I can imagine.'' On Friday the State Department issued a ''worldwide caution'' to American travelers that ''terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, continue their threats against the United States and have not distinguished between military and civilian targets.'' Shortly after the East Africa bombings, the Administration sent counterterrorism specialists and other investigators from the State Department, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency to inspect embassies and consulates around the world to determine which were most vulnerable. Administration officials said the specialists are expected to report back to Washington shortly with suggestions on how to tighten security -- in some cases by abandoning embassy buildings that are considered especially dangerous and relocating employees. If an embassy is closed and no other suitable space is available, they said, American diplomats may be asked to work in mobile metal-framed structures that can transported from the United States aboard military cargo planes. ''We don't want to repeat Nairobi,'' said a State Department official. The embassy in Kenya was built in 1981 on a central thoroughfare in the heart of the capital. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell had considered the location so vulnerable that she had cabled the State Department twice in the months before the bombing to request that the embassy be relocated. The request was denied for budget reasons. The embassy in Tanzania had been considered less vulnerable, both because it is situated outside the center city and because of better design. Neither embassy, however, met current security standards. State Department officials said the specialists sent abroad last month would probably recommend that at least a handful of embassies and consulates be relocated immediately. Such recommendations, they said, reflect a change in the thinking of security experts within the Government. ''Once upon a time, you wouldn't worry so much about embassy security in a nation like Kenya, which has no history of terrorism,'' an official said. ''You worried about places like Beirut and Cairo. The bombings last month proved that we now have to worry about security everywhere. And we do have some embassies that are very exposed.'' Administration officials would not identify which embassies or consulates might be shuttered, although several large embassies around the world are well known among American diplomats as especially vulnerable because they are situated close to the street, making them easy targets for a car bomb. Other embassies are known to be at special risk because of their proximity to power plants or gasoline stations. The embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for example, which was temporarily shut down for routine operations last month because of a terrorist threat, is next to a gasoline station. After the East Africa bombings, the embassy paid the owner of the station to shut it down. Malaysian newspapers reported that the gasoline and diesel fuel stored in the station's underground tanks was drained out. Officials said that the State Department had not settled on a final figure in the request to Congress for new construction and security improvements, but that the total would come to between $1 billion and $3 billion. The money should allow security at some embassies to be raised to the standards set by the State Department in the 1980's. Over the years, the department was given less than one-third of the money needed to modify or build embassies meeting those standards, which were recommended in 1985 by a panel led by Bobby R. Inman, a retired admiral and the former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. The panel was formed in response to the bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut in 1984 and the bombing the year before of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut; the two attacks killed a total of more than 250 people.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 36-> Questions Surround Performance Enhancer
IN the 1940's, not long after the discovery and isolation of testosterone, the hormone in the body that can help build rock-hard muscles, it was learned that baseball players on the St. Louis Cardinals had loaded up on extra large doses of vitamins to try to enhance their performance. This led Paul de Kruif, a popular science writer of the day, to comment: ''We know how the St. Louis Cardinals have won championships supercharged by vitamins. It would be interesting to watch the productive power of an industry or a professional group that would try a systematic supercharge with testosterone.'' Was that statement, about the pennant-winning predecessors of Mark McGwire's team from St. Louis, also a highly prophetic description of an experiment being tested now more than a half-century later? For more than a year, Mr. McGwire has been taking androstenedione (pronounced andro-STEEN-die-own) or simply ''andro'' as the athletes call it, an over-the-counter supplement that converts to testosterone in the body. Though Mr. McGwire and others say it has helped him to a banner homerun season, surprisingly little is known about androstenedione, including whether it works at all. And other major questions remain unanswered: Is taking andro safe, and what are the long-term effects of using the supplement? Androstenedione is a ''pre-hormone,'' meaning that it is a precursor that is converted into testosterone. Testosterone is produced mainly in the male testes (and, to a lesser extent, in the adrenal glands and in a woman's ovaries) and is responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle, facial hair and a deep voice. Elevated levels of testosterone also enable athletes to work out harder and recover more quickly. Androstenedione was first developed in the 1970's by East German scientists to try to enhance their athletes' Olympic performances. The substance was introduced commercially in this country two years ago by Patrick Arnold, a chemist, as president of Seymour Bio-Organics of Seymour, Ill. Manufacturers assert that a 100-milligram dose of androstenedione increases testosterone levels by 300 percent and lasts for about three hours. Although androstenedione, which is in a class called C-19 steroids, is inactive when it first enters the body, it quickly becomes anabolic and converts into testosterone to produce muscle growth like other anabolic steroids. Unlike many anabolic steroids, which are widely banned, it is allowed in professional baseball. But it is banned by other sports governing bodies, including the National Football League and the International Olympic Committee. Anyone can buy andro as a result of 1994 drug deregulation laws. But some stores refuse to stock it because of possible risks. Dr. Linn Goldberg, professor of medicine and head of the division of health promotion and sports medicine at the Oregon Health Sciences University, sees little difference between androstenedione and the anabolic steroids that have ignited controversy in sports throughout the years. ''When androstenedione is converted to testosterone, it is no different than taking anabolic steroids,'' he said. ''It's an attempt to cheat to improve your performance, by unnaturally boosting your testosterone levels.'' Another reason some athletes may use androstenedione is its suspected ability to mask the illegal use of testosterone. To Jeffrey Brown, an endocrinologist at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, ''There's no question that androstenedione could be used very effectively to escape detection of testosterone use.'' Dr. Don H. Catlin, a professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, added, ''In today's world, athletes who are determined to cheat know that natural substances are the way to, because they are so difficult to detect.'' Other detractors point to possible harm in using androstenedione. Although scientists say there are insufficient data on this particular substance to draw definitive conclusions, the case against anabolic steroids and excess testosterone is clear. It is well documented that testosterone in excess amounts can be very harmful, especially to children and adolescents. Dr. Goldberg believes that supplement manufacturers and athletes who are using androstenedione play down the possibility of harmful effects. ''They keep saying androstenedione is no big deal,'' said Dr. Goldberg who is also a crew chief for drug testing for the United States Olympic Committee. ''But if it's not a big deal, why are athletes taking it? It is unhealthy.'' Steroid use can lead to a number of dangerous side effects including, lowered levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which benefits the heart, and lowered levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein; stimulation of prostate tumors; clotting disorders, and liver problems. Psychologically, anabolic steroids can make a person more aggressive and in some can cause uncontrolled aggressive behavior and psychosis. Cosmetic changes that can be set off by steroids include baldness, increased body hair, acne and breast growth in men. Women who are pregnant and men with prostate problems are specifically advised by androstenedione manufactures to avoid the substance. Teen-agers using androstenedione may also face increased risk of serious side effects. For instance, in adolescents, steroids trick the body into thinking it is older and can shut off bone growth, thus stunting height. Dr. Goldberg and his colleague Dr. Diane Elliot have completed a three-year study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, designed to persuade adolescent athletes to stay clear of supplements like androstenedione and other steroids. Their program, tested among 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington, reduced student-athletes' desire to use steroids and lowered new anabolic steroid use by a reported 50 percent. They used one of the lesser known effects of prolonged use of steroids -- reduction in the size of the testicles -- to drive the point home. In a video, a 275-pound high school football player, is shown holding a frying pan with two grapefruits. He points to the grapefruits and says, ''These are your testicles.'' Then he replaces the grapefruit with peanuts and says: ''These are your testicles when you use steroids. Any questions?'' Dr. Goldberg pointed out that the reduction to peanut-size testicles was factual. Despite the evidence against steroids in general, trainers and manufacturers of androstenedione say it is unfair to indict it, since there has been no clear-cut independent research on it. They insist that the data do not exist to conclude that androstenedione has the same adverse effects as excessive amounts of testosterone. Mr. Arnold, who introduced androstenedione in this country, contends that the supplement is ''a very safe way of performance enhancement, as safe as drinking a cup of coffee.'' Dr. Gary Wadler, a steroid authority at New York University, disagrees. He pointed out that the Federal Government considers testosterone a controlled substance and a user needs a triplicate prescription to acquire it. ''It would be foolish to delude anyone that this is an innocuous substance,'' he said.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 37-> Poor Students, Too, Can Serve the Community
To the Editor: Re ''School Work, Homework and Good Works in Chicago'' (news article, Sept. 1): The argument that students from poor families ''often work to help shoulder family financial burdens and have little spare time'' is cited to support opposition to required community service by Chicago's public school students. We have found in our research in New York City that students from poor families have been deprived of the benefits of providing service. However, one way to solve the problem is to have a broad menu of services that can be undertaken during the school day like peer tutoring, peer mentoring and peer drug education. These services are now provided on a limited basis and could easily be extended in a required program. AUDREY GARTNER Director, Peer Research Laboratory New York, Sept. 1, 1998

Dec. 14, 1998-> 38-> Sports of The Times; DiMaggio Draws Curtain of Decorum
THE doctor announced that he couldn't talk about Joe DiMaggio's health anymore, couldn't say if DiMaggio's condition had been upgraded from critical to serious. But the fact that his mouth had been zippered was the most reliable report we could possibly get that the arrow on the daily Joe D. stock exchange was pointing up. ''No more press,'' Dr. Earl Barron reported the 84-year-old DiMaggio to have growled yesterday from his hospital room in Hollywood, Fla., the best evidence that DiMaggio was alert enough to demand the curtain be drawn on what had become a sad spinoff of ''The Truman Show.'' If DiMaggio never beats the assault on his lungs and makes it out of Memorial Regional Hospital, at least he will have recovered sufficiently to reclaim his privacy, which to him always represented the measure of his dignity. What kind of man DiMaggio really is, where people may want to place him in the all-time congeniality rankings, is not what we're talking about. The issue here is that DiMaggio decades ago chose to conduct his life far away from the eye of the very camera his doctors had apparently fallen in love with over the last couple of weeks. Nobody had to ask where Joe DiMaggio had gone, or wonder how close he was to being gone, because what appeared to be his final hours had become just another energy source for the insatiable beast known as the hourly news cycle. With DiMaggio rendered unconscious or too weak to know, the doctors and even his friend and spokesman, Morris Engelberg, trampled on what surely would have been DiMaggio's last wish, to not have the details of his endgame disseminated like so many canned post-game quotes. Suddenly, there was a clear window into the life of a man who for 47 years after his retirement from baseball had chosen to keep the shades drawn. Did we really need to have a play-by-play on the level of sedation, on the amount of fluid in his lungs, on the variety of tubes in his throat? Did we have to be in the middle of his family's anguished decision on how long to continue with life support? To whose benefit was the constant rating of DiMaggio's chances of survival, as if the country were keeping score, on the scale of 1 to 10? Barry Halper, more than most, knew how DiMaggio would have detested the news-flash frenzy, which produced a pitiful cliche of a zipper report regarding DiMaggio's health that Halper came upon in Times Square the other day. ''Last of the ninth,'' it screamed, ''two out.'' All that was missing was the free distribution of rally caps and a heartfelt request for rhythmic applause. ''Joe, I guess, was gravely ill, and he couldn't possibly know what was going on,'' Halper said yesterday from his New Jersey home. Known for his collection of baseball memorabilia, as well as a minuscule share of Yankees ownership, Halper in recent years had served as driver and companion when DiMaggio made his infrequent trips to New York. Always, the object was to take care of business, stay out of sight. ''We'd go out to dinner, they'd put him in a back room where no one would bother him,'' Halper said. ''Once in a while, a drifter would come over, ask for an autograph. But it wasn't as difficult as people think.'' There are times now when athletes like Michael Jordan talk about their fame as if it were an uncontrollable curse. Can't go here, can't go there. Most of the time, it sounds very convincing until the subject of DiMaggio comes up, and to the whining stars you just want to pose the following question: ''Ever heard of the back door?'' Some of these premature DiMaggio eulogies, casting him as the last pure American icon, have been a bit much. On the scale of relative sports fame, Jordan himself rates a global 9.5. But DiMaggio does epitomize the increasingly rare surviving celebrity never nourished by the sight of a television camera. He has presented himself only when he wished to, defiantly unwilling to live by the sound bite. He apparently set the same rules for those who wanted to remain his friend. ''When Joe first went in the hospital, people started calling me up for interviews about his health,'' Halper said. ''I didn't know anything, so I couldn't say much.'' Whatever he said was already too much. He soon received a letter from DiMaggio's lawyers, asking that he ''cease and desist.'' In the early weeks of his confinement, DiMaggio succeeded, the way he always did, in keeping a lid on his illustrious life. As the circumstances worsened, then grew grave, maybe the doctors figured they owed more to the public than they did to their patient. What the heck. In Ken Starr's America, the most salacious grand jury testimony is the centerfold of the daily newspaper. DiMaggio, no more the man of mystery, had become another phenomenon of the Internet. But when he awoke the other day and learned the whole country had been in his room, surveying his struggle, that was enough. ''No more press,'' he said, having come back to life to live it his way.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 39-> A Pilgrimage to Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Estate
The auctioneer had planned a small open house here for special clients who had expressed an interest in buying some of the belongings of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. But word of the auction preview went out over the Internet on Saturday and was published in newspapers in Taiwan and in Chinese communities across the United States on Sunday, complete with directions on how to make the 30-mile trip east from mid-Manhattan to Hillcrest, her former estate here on Long Island. By midday Sunday, tens of thousands of people of Chinese descent converged on the narrow winding lanes of Lattingtown and the nearby village of Locust Valley on the North Shore of Long Island, hoping to catch a glimpse of the 36-acre estate that was Madame Chiang's home for more than 50 years. The local authorities, including Clarence Michalis, the Mayor of Lattingtown; fire marshals and the Nassau County police became so concerned that they ordered the estate closed at 11 A.M. on Sunday, but the cars still kept coming. At one point, the lines of vehicles tied up traffic to Exit 39 of the Long Island Expressway more than six miles away. The outpouring of Chinese families who came here by car and van on Sunday, from as far away as Boston and Virginia, stunned the auctioneer, Gary Braswell, president of Braswell Galleries in Norwalk, Conn. ''It was frightening and sad all at the same time,'' he said. ''We had room to handle 150 cars, but they parked everywhere and rushed to the house. Only when people got inside did they suddenly become calm, almost reverential, like they were on a religious or historic pilgrimage.'' ''The people really didn't come with the idea of buying anything,'' said Mr. Braswell, who spent Sunday night in the house along with the caretaker, out of concern that some people might try to enter after dark. ''They just wanted to look and see where and how Madame Chiang lived her life. ''They would sit on a couch or a chair in her bedroom while other members of the family took pictures,'' he said. Madame Chiang fled to the United States in 1949 from Taiwan after forces led by her husband, Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, the former Nationalist leader of China, were driven from the Chinese mainland by the Communists. She is now 100 years old and lives in Manhattan. Mr. Braswell said that most of the important valuable pieces of furniture and paintings had already been removed from the house by Madame Chiang's family and that there were few pieces of Chinese art or furniture left. He said that while searching the house from basement to attic, he nevertheless found a dozen pieces of value that he planned to auction on Jan. 3 at the Braswell Galleries in Norwalk. He said the items would include matching crystal chandeliers and some large oil paintings. He said the rest of the household goods and furnishings, including Madame Chiang's bedroom set and other items, would be sold at a special auction of her things in Norwalk on Jan. 24. And he hoped that by Friday a catalogue of the items would be available on an Internet site still being set up (braswellgalleries.com). Irwin Stillman, the president of the Stillman Organization, a Manhattan construction company that bought Hillcrest and its contents for $2.8 million, said he attended the open house early Saturday ''when everything was calm.'' ''We were all overwhelmed by the turnout,'' he said. ''Never in a million years did we expect anything like this. It's as if we're showing a home that belonged to the Queen of England and everyone came.'' ''We're builders and developers and that's what we intend to do with the property,'' Mr. Stillman said. He bought the property in August from descendants of Madame Chiang's sister, Soong Ailing. Joan Helen de Kay, a real estate broker handling the property for Prudential Long Island Realty, said the mansion and the entire 37 acres were for sale for $6.5 million. Otherwise, she said, the estate would be sold in four pieces -- the house and 12 acres for $3.2 million, a cottage, carriage house and 12 acres for $1.75 million, and the remaining 6-acre and 7-acre parcels for $750,000 each. Among the people turned away at the entrance of Hillcrest this morning was Charlie Tsai, a computer engineer who came with his wife from Holmdel, N.J., after reading about the open house in a Taiwan newspaper on the Internet. ''We're very disappointed,'' he said. ''This is a part of our heritage and we are sorry that it is all being sold, piece by piece. It all has meaning to Chinese people everywhere. ''It's as if someone sold Mount Vernon and all of George Washington's things to a developer. What would Americans think when all their history was taken away from them?''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 40-> PRO FOOTBALL; Giants Stiffen Defense After an Early Letdown
It was early in the second quarter on Sunday, and the Washington Redskins' offense was pushing the Giants' defense around, advancing down the field play after play. In the wake of the Giants' 31-24 season-opening victory, it is hard to remember the moments when a Giants victory hardly looked assured, when the Giants' defense -- even its vaunted defensive line -- was losing the battle. But it was happening. The Giants were trailing by 4 points and on the verge of falling further behind. ''We were on our heels,'' the Giants' defensive coordinator, John Fox, said of the Redskins' second-quarter surge. ''They suckered us a couple times. The coaches, we were on our heels, too. There was some adversity there; you become a little out of sorts.'' It appeared to get worse when Washington quarterback Gus Frerotte threw a touchdown pass to Michael Westbrook. Now, Washington was an extra point away from going ahead by 14-3. But the Westbrook touchdown was negated by a holding penalty, and on the next play, defensive tackle Keith Hamilton sacked Frerotte. Defensive end Chad Bratzke, whom the Redskins had run past three times in the same drive for 18 yards, made it consecutive sacks of Frerotte on the next play. Suddenly, the Redskins had gone from a potential 11-point lead to a third-and-39 from their own 40-yard line. A punt followed. For most of the rest of the game, the Giants' defensive front four controlled the line of scrimmage. Washington moved the football, but only in spurts and usually when the Giants held a two-touchdown lead. In the end, a harassing Giants defense -- a trademark of the team a year ago -- had left its imprint on another victory. ''Relentless,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said today. ''Hopefully, that will always be our signature. Those guys don't stop.'' It is a dominant, confident and combative unit, one with a cocky style of play and an even more cocksure operating philosophy. In essence, the Giants' defense accepts that some success by the opposing offense is inevitable. The Giants will wait for the turnover that masks any of the blemishes exposed earlier. On Sunday, the Giants once again had an edge in the biggest statistic of most games: turnover ratio. The Giants forced two interceptions and a fumble, while the offense turned the ball over once. It has been said all summer that the 1998 Giants cannot duplicate the performance of a year ago, when they forced 44 turnovers and had a turnover ratio of plus-25. But when your defensive line is combining for eight sacks, as the Giants' line did Sunday, then turnovers will be an unavoidable byproduct. Sacks cause fumbles, and they cause the quarterback to pass in a hurry, which leads to interceptions. After one game, the Giants' turnover ratio is plus-2. It's an excellent start, even if it didn't seem very likely early in the second quarter. ''Bad things happen for you in every game,'' Fox said later, recalling the defense's troublesome start in Sunday's game. ''You just kind of hold your breath. You don't panic.'' Fox also trusted a group that is young yet experienced and very deep. The eight Giants sacks were spread among five players: Bratzke, Hamilton and Michael Strahan had two each, while Christian Peter and Robert Harris had one apiece. And on a hot day, being able to rotate the tackles Peter and Bernard Holsey into the lineup was of great value. Additionally, there is linebacker Scott Galyon, who brings speed and tackling ability in from the sideline. Safety Percy Ellsworth, who plays in the team's nickel packages, is 6 feet 2 inches and 225 pounds and has a knack for finding the football. ''We don't get nervous,'' Bratzke said. ''We don't get caught up in the moment. We just play.'' Or, as Strahan said: ''We really don't get rattled. We just get mad.'' EXTRA POINTS Giants running back TYRONE WHEATLEY said he was not happy about not dressing for Sunday's game, but he added, ''You can't fight the system.'' Wheatley, who now seems to have no significant role on the team, would not say if he wanted to be traded. Coach JIM FASSEL said Wheatley still figured in the Giants' plans. From a numbers standpoint, the Giants need Wheatley at least as insurance against injury to the other backs. But he could still be made inactive for several games this season. . . . The Giants appear close to signing cornerback CARLTON GRAY, a six-year veteran who started 13 games for the Indianapolis Colts last season. Gray, 27, was at Giants Stadium on Monday to meet with the Giants coaches and doctors. One snag in the Giants' pursuit of Gray is whether they have enough money under the salary cap to pay him. Gray was released by the Colts last week after he lost his starting job. To make room for Gray, the Giants would most likely waive the rookie tight end ANDY HAASE. . . . The veteran tight end AL PUPUNU (strained knee ligaments) is ready to play this weekend against Oakland. The Giants are less certain about the status of linebacker MARCUS BUCKLEY. He was limping Monday from a deep hip bruise he got in the Redskins game. . . . The new artificial turf at Giants Stadium caused major abrasions on the hands and arms of several Giants.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 41-> ROCK REVIEW; From Blake and Wagner to the Teletubbies
The guitarist Gary Lucas gave a 10th-anniversary concert at the Knitting Factory on Friday night, summing up a higgledy-piggledy performing career that all started with a one-man show at the Knitting Factory's old space on East Houston Street. The marathon retrospective took four hours to go from solo guitar fantasias to jokey, low-impact duets to a highly organized rock trio, and there was something extremely collegial -- maybe even domestic -- about the whole thing. The evening felt like a long visit to Mr. Lucas's apartment, while he stood on a chair and reviewed his accomplishments. That's partly because Friday night's audience was a small gathering of friends and followers. (Mr. Lucas has a greater constituency in Europe, where he is more widely known and appreciated as one of the better sidemen in Captain Beefheart's early-80's band, and for his perfect embodiment of the downtown New York, genre-hopping musical mindset.) But the show also felt small because Mr. Lucas doesn't have a guitar god's requisite sense of self-confidence; rather than spawning proteges by wrapping his technique in accessible packages, his music aims for a rarefied, literary crowd. His songs needed a bit of critical apparatus in order for the audience to be in on the references, and Mr. Lucas provided it with nudges and winks, whether he was detailing the provenance of his National steel guitar, explaining the significance of songs like ''Breath of Bones'' (something to do with a novel version of the film ''The Golem'') and ''Poison Tree'' (a William Blake image), or defending his decision to render the theme from ''Teletubbies.'' (''It's my favorite TV show -- currently the finest effervescence of English culture,'' he said, smirking, and typically ambiguous about whether he meant it.) The solo-guitar section of his set went two ways: pyrotechnic overkill with an electric guitar and a digital-delay machine, and intelligent vindications of the unified-field approach to music. He played Wagner's ''Ride of the Valkyries'' and ''Tannhauser'' Overture, fingering with rapid accuracy and raising storm clouds of distortion to no particular end; but he also played a beautiful Chinese song from the 1930's on his steel guitar, making it sound like a back-country blues. Of a string of duets, with the singers Danielle Gerber and Richard Barone and the multi-instrumentalist Peter Stampfel, the best were those with Mr. Stampfel, who, like Mr. Lucas, has the air of a song collector gone mad. As the Du-Tels, they have performed quite a few times before, and their performances of ''God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen'' (with all its verses) and Johnny Cash's ''Ring of Fire'' were charmingly loose and deviant. The debut of Mr. Lucas's new band, whose concept is to play children's songs with Jewish themes, was a lukewarm experience; with two nonsingers, a jazz bass player, a drummer, and John Zorn bleating squeals on an alto saxophone, it had fun with spooky songs about the Sandman and ''the Mensch in the Moon,'' but too often devolved into blunt slapstick. Finally Mr. Lucas gave a reprise of his long-running band Gods and Monsters, a band that never had a fixed personnel but has served to showcase all of his directions at once -- film and television music, psychedelia, Delta-blues fingerpicking and rock-guitar interpretations of classical music scores. This was the part of the show worth waiting for; with a practiced band (Jonathan Kane on drums and Ernie Brooks on bass), Mr. Lucas could connect his considerable talents to something greater than his own intellect. And something happened: the band rocked, needing no explanatory footnotes.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 42-> Santa Monica Seeking a Return To On-Line Civic Forum of Yore
When Santa Monica City Hall first offered on-line forums nine years ago, the major topic in this upscale community was the homeless. Donald Paschal, who was logging on from a public terminal, offered advice from a unique perspective. He would like to get a job, Mr. Paschal wrote, but he was dirty, he had nowhere to wash his clothes and nowhere to store his belongings. He was, in fact, homeless. People were astonished. They organized to help their on-line compatriot. Soon, they created a program called Swashlock, for showers, washers and lockers. That was in 1989. It was the first major civic initiative of the on-line group, officially known as the Santa Monica Public Electronic Network, or PEN. It was an experiment in electronic democracy that after nine years has become a widely studied model for scholars and municipal officials searching for ways to use on-line tools to foster citizenship. PEN started as an electronic bulletin board, a pre-Internet technology that allowed owners of computers with modems to read material posted by others and to send and receive text messages. The rapid spread of the Internet since 1994 expanded those early efforts. These days, however, local officials are struggling to recapture the enthusiasm that surrounded the network in its early days and to stimulate dwindling on-line discussions. They have a strong incentive: Santa Monica lost a major public forum last March, when the Copley Newspapers chain shut down The Outlook, the only daily newspaper in this city of 90,000 people. Santa Monica, city officials say, is uniquely suited to fill that void with on-line forums. Fifty percent of the households here have Internet access, and nearly 1 in 10 residents is a registered user of PEN. ''Everyone in Santa Monica politics got up first thing in the morning and read The Outlook's letters to the editor,'' said City Councilman Ken Genser. Discussion also faded in PEN partly because the city's forums became plagued by personal attacks and ranting. City officials announced a test solution on Sept. 1. They said the League of Women Voters had agreed to moderate the PEN forums on candidates and issues through the November election. The next step, city officials say, depends on what happens with the moderated forums. Many residents say they hope that interest in the city election will revive the on-line forum. Its early successes in creating equal access to policy makers on line have not been forgotten, nor has the homeless man who so influenced PEN's early days. Mr. Paschal left the city years ago and became a cable talk-show host, but in 1995, he logged on and left a message on PEN for his old friends in Santa Monica. ''Just call me EX-homeless,'' it said.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 45-> The Political Crisis in Moscow
Russia has had more than its share of malevolent or inept political leaders over the years, but the latest Kremlin cast is setting a new standard for incompetence and self-absorption. With the country in an economic meltdown, the lower house of Parliament yesterday once again rejected President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, leaving the nation without a working Government. With the ruble's purchasing power tumbling and shortages of food and other vital commodities developing, Russia is rapidly slipping into conditions that breed unrest and demagogy. Viktor Chernomyrdin may not be the ideal choice for prime minister, but at this moment of political and economic peril he would be better than the volatile vacuum of power that now exists. His rejection for a third and final time in the days ahead would most likely lead Mr. Yeltsin to dissolve Parliament and call new elections later this year. Given Mr. Yeltsin's unsteady leadership, Russia cannot afford several more months of political paralysis. The Communists and their allies may be bluffing, since many members of Parliament fear the loss of their seats and the privileges that come with them. But unlike earlier confrontations with Mr. Yeltsin, when the Communists backed down, this time they may sense electoral advantage in the growing economic turmoil and Mr. Yeltsin's unpopularity. It would not be the first time that the Communist Party tried to exploit economic hardship for its own advantage. Lenin perfected the strategy in 1917.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 47-> Political Briefing; A Favorite Son: In Nevada, 'None'
How turned off is the American voter this year? If turnout is any measure, there is a lot of ''disaffection, disinterest and disengagement'' out there, says Curtis B. Gans, the director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. When Mr. Gans took a look at turnout in the first 16 states to hold primaries this year, he found that only 17 percent of all citizens old enough to vote had shown up at the polls. Ten of the 16 states had record lows, with Texas the lowest of all at 7.6 percent. If that trend continues, Mr. Gans says, 1998 will end up being the worst year ever for voter participation. But turnout is not the only measure of turnoff. Consider the primaries held last Tuesday in Nevada, a state that has a ballot line like no other. Since 1975, it has offered any voter willing to turn out the option of choosing ''none of these candidates.'' Of the 33 actual candidates for statewide office last Tuesday, 17 finished behind ''none.'' And while ''none'' never came up a winner, it did come up with a solid 24 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, enough for a second-place finish behind Rose McKinney-James, who won with 49 percent. The third-place candidate captured only 16 percent, and the fourth-place finisher 11 percent. ''None'' finished third in four other Nevada primaries, some of them with half a dozen or more contenders, getting 16 percent of the vote in the Republican race for comptroller, 15 percent in the Republican race for state treasurer, 12 percent in the Democratic race for governor and 11 percent in the Republican race for lieutenant governor. In none of those races did ''none'' trail the field. Under the Nevada law that established the ''none'' ballot line (all efforts to repeal it have failed ), votes for ''none'' are counted only as expressions of dissatisfaction: should ''none'' run first, victory goes to the second-place finisher. So while ''none'' has actually finished first in some minor races over the years, under the law ''none'' can never be a winner -- except with the dissatisfied.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 48-> THE NEEDIEST CASES; Helping Out A Mother Fighting A Disability
Olive Cesar, 35, felt chest pain on the morning of Aug. 13, but she ignored it and drove from her apartment in Brooklyn to her nurse's aide job on Long Island. After all, Ms. Cesar, 35, had rent to pay and four children to feed. But the pain had been signaling a heart attack, and later that afternoon Ms. Cesar was hospitalized. She recovered from the heart attack, but an incorrectly placed intravenous tube damaged the muscles and nerves in her right arm, leaving it numb and useless, she said. Now, instead of working 86 hours a week, as she used to, Ms. Cesar cannot work at all. She cannot pay the rent on her apartment in East New York, and when Frantz, her 3-year-old son, hugged her and asked for a glass of milk on a recent afternoon, she could neither return the hug nor provide the milk -- there was none in the refrigerator. With no income, she relies on emergency help from the Community Services Society, one of seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Cesar has applied for disability benefits, she has filed a lawsuit against the hospital, and she has applied -- twice -- for public assistance. Her first application, filed in October, was denied because she had a car. Ms. Cesar had bought the car, a heavily financed 1995 Toyota Camry, for her three-hour daily commute to work. But she had to let it go this fall because of her situation. She called the dealership where she had bought the car and asked them to come and repossess it. ''You should have seen me standing outside with tears running out of my eyes just watching the car go up the street,'' she said. Ms. Cesar is right-handed, and she said that the numbness and limited ability to move her arm now make it impossible for her to even hold a pen to sign her name. She can no longer care for her children the way she used to. She cannot bathe Frantz, or braid the hair of his older sisters, Georgia, 8, and Chamise, 6. Her doctors have told her not to cook, because when she tried, she burned herself and did not notice until blisters appeared later. Alecia, Ms. Cesar's 16-year-old daughter, now cooks the family dinners. The younger children wash the dishes and sweep up the kitchen. ''I expected to be dating and having fun now that I am 16,'' said Alecia, a contestant in this year's Miss Teen New York competition. ''But in this family, we take care of each other.'' Ms. Cesar has begun rehabilitation at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. She is gaining back limited motion in her arm, but the nerves have been slow to recover. She said that she rarely feels actual sensations, but sometimes she feels shooting pains. Ms. Cesar said she hopes her hand will heal within a year so that she can go back to work at the hospice where she used to bathe, shave and change AIDS patients who were too sick to get out of bed. For now, though, Ms. Cesar is stuck at home. On a recent afternoon, Christina Veroutis of the Community Services Society stopped by to leave Ms. Cesar grocery money for the week. The youngsters, feeling the relief of a relative abundance, asked, ''Are you Santa Claus?'' HOW TO HELP Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to P.O.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 49-> PUBLIC LIVES; Part Pit Bull, Part Teddy Bear, All Appetite
IN the course of an afternoon, Al Goldstein has his secretary book a prostitute as his dinner companion at Nobu, a chic downtown restaurant, and, for his cable television show, ''Midnight Blue,'' he tapes a vicious attack on New York magazine for leaving him out of its 30th-anniversary issue. But at the moment, as a father, Al has got to brag. ''My son, Jordan, I'm so proud, he starts Harvard Law School today,'' the publisher of Screw magazine is saying. ''What's the Jewish word? I'm kvelling. He graduated No. 1 in his class in Georgetown out of 781 students. When I met the president of Georgetown he couldn't believe he was standing next to America's No. 1 pornographer, that I was the father. My son is embarrassed by me on occasion, but he loves me. He came to me a year ago and said, 'Dad, I can go to N.Y.U. free, or I can go to Harvard.' I said, 'Jordan, I live for you to go to Harvard. The money isn't a problem.' But I was so moved he asked.'' Screw celebrates its 30th year this fall. It may, as Al likes to point out, be fighting for freedom of the press for everyone, but they have not been pretty fights. When a Federal judge, Kimba M. Wood, ruled against Screw in a libel suit some years ago, Al ran composite photos purporting to depict the judge in sex acts. The magazine, based in New York, is mostly escort service ads and pornography. If you think you've seen the pictures before, you have. ''I paid $1 a picture back in the 60's,'' says Al, who has a $3 million home in Florida but loves a bargain. ''They've been in the paper hundreds of times. Those women are so old they're in nursing homes.'' Al -- how can you call a man who wore a ''Death Before Marriage'' T-shirt to a divorce hearing by anything other than his first name? -- is a compendium of traits rarely found in the same body: insightful, irrational, generous, self-absorbed, vindictive, funny, obnoxious, eloquent. None of these are repressed. Al rages against what used to be called the Establishment but complains that he has never been invited to appear on ''Good Morning America.'' He has appeared in pornographic movies but is reluctant to divulge his weight. ''Oh, all right, you shamed me into it. Close to 300 -- 286,'' says Al, finally, a number that looks low. Puffing on a Cuban cigar, surrounded by young staffers he alternately jokes with and bullies, Al is videotaping what you would diplomatically call editorials for the X-rated ''Midnight Blue.'' ''I'm going to Nobu tonight,'' Al calls out to his secretary between takes. ''Is the girl joining me?'' THEN it's back to what's eating him. ''I do not take rejection well. And New York magazine in their anniversary issue never once mentioned Screw. And we are, truly, the most extraordinary chronicle of sexual change, but their editors'' -- and here he launches into an obscene attack on women. Why these attacks? ''I am mean,'' says Al, who has had 35 years of psychoanalysis and has apparently come to accept his flaws. ''I love my hatreds. When I go to my shrink I feel good.'' The Goldstein resume: 62 years old; raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; grew up a fat kid. First sexual experience at 16, when his mother tells Al's uncle to take him to a prostitute. Nineteen arrests at Screw, mostly for obscenity; sued for libel ''probably 10 or 15 times.'' A six-year relationship with a 51-year-old lawyer named Rosie. One son, who, Al has stated in his will, is not to inherit the business. Four marriages. ''I call my last wife an Irish cleaning lady,'' Al says. ''That is what she really was. My limousine would take her to jobs. It cost $40 an hour and she was making $8. She'd written me a letter. My mother was dying, I was very lonely. I wanted to be like the professor in 'Pygmalion.' '' Marriage is high among Al's hatreds, but the list is long. If Al is not happy, he attacks. Often, he attacks himself. ''I'm a Jew boy, I cannot pay retail,'' Al says on ''Midnight Blue.'' Why, with his all his analysis and his obvious insight, give vent to such ugliness? Al is asked again. ''So I should be a nice, reasonable human being like all the other human beings who have ulcers and boil inside? My father worked for The Daily Mirror. He was a timid little man who said 'sir' to elevator operators. I was humiliated by his fear. My rebellion is not to be my father. When I was 14 years old, my mother tells me she's having an adulterous relationship with my diet doctor. Many years ago, I did the Tom Snyder show on network TV and my mother said, 'Your dad isn't much of a lover.' I was mortified.'' Al talks a lot about freedom of speech, regardless of the consequences. Didn't his mother have a right to exercise hers? ''I don't question it, but I could react to it,'' Al says. One hears the echo of analysis. ''I was never validated,'' Al says. ''Think psychic abuse. There had to be a precursor. Why else would I be such a crazy human being? My father beat me. I stuttered till I was 15. I was a bed-wetter. You know what it is, the feeling of powerlessness when you're 13 and you can't go to another house, the sense of impotence? One of my great fears is not having an erection. New York magazine was despicable in making me invisible. My father was despicable in his indifference. My mother was insensitive and hurtful. You ask me why I do what I do. Because I can.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 50-> N.H.L.: ROUNDUP; Turek Remains Unbeaten
STARS 3, SENATORS 2 Dallas needed a lucky break and some good goaltending to keep its unbeaten streak alive. Tony Hrkac scored the winner late in the second period and Roman Turek stopped 27 shots to remain undefeated this season as Dallas won at Ottawa by 3-2 yesterday. Turek (4-0-2) helped the Stars win their third straight and extend their unbeaten streak to 6-0-2. Dallas has lost only one of its last 10 road games (7-1-2). KINGS 4, BLACKHAWKS 1 Glen Murray scored two goals and Donald Audette contributed on offense as Los Angeles won in Chicago. Audette, who came in a trade from Buffalo over the weekend, scored at 1:38 of the first period to give the Kings the early lead. Aleksei Zhamnov scored the lone goal for the Blackhawks. LIGHTNING 2, FLYERS 2 Wendel Clark scored at 10:39 of the third period to help visiting Tampa Bay earn a tie. Philadelphia had taken a 2-0 lead on goals by Rod Brind'Amour and John LeClair. The Lightning got as close as 2-1 when Sandy McCarthy scored at 18:35 of the second period.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 51-> Richardson Reflects on His U.N. Days
For the last few weeks, Bill Richardson has been trying to do two apparently unreconcilable jobs as the Clinton Administration's new Energy Secretary and the Government's representative to the United Nations. That should end formally on Friday when Mr. Richardson -- a politician turned diplomat who has been about the most relaxed and genial envoy this diplomatic hothouse has seen in a generation -- resigns his United Nations assignment. But informally, he said over breakfast early one morning before catching yet another shuttle, there is no rupture involved. ''One of the major goals I have is to give the Energy Department more international visibility,'' he said. ''I'm going to do a lot of travel, a lot of retail energy diplomacy, beef up my international department there.'' He has new friends to help him. ''There are a lot of issues in the energy area that involve the Russians: plutonium disposition, uranium agreements and nuclear safety, nuclear weapons safety,'' he said. ''A lot of the Energy Department relationship is Russian, and I got to know a lot of the players.'' Two years of experience -- on Iraq and the Persian Gulf area, the source of much of the oil the United States uses; on the spread of nuclear weapons; on reactor safety; on trying to bring North Korea into an agreement on nuclear energy, on global climate -- can be applied in his new job, he said. At the United Nations, diplomats who were initially frosty at having a politician -- a former Democratic Congressman from New Mexico -- thrust on them by Washington seem to have come to appreciate a style that is zany by United Nations standards. He is known to have referred to a distinguished diplomat as ''what's his name'' and to wear khakis and a blazer into the Security Council. At a dinner that he and his wife, Barbara, gave for the financier George Soros, Mr. Richardson began his toast by admitting cheerfully that he had never met Mr. Soros before. In contrast to Madeleine K. Albright, who was rushed through the corridors of the United Nations with an important-looking phalanx of protective aides when she represented the United States here, Bill Richardson ambles around, joking in English and Spanish with reporters. The faces of other American diplomats reveal a flicker of panic when he steps up to a microphone. Twenty-eight nations have lined up to give him farewell dinners. He admits that he gets a lot of attention because he is perceived as being close to the President. Ambassadors also know that he may be Al Gore's running mate in two years. But people genuinely like him. ''One should not confuse two things of a different nature,'' said Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative and president of the Security Council during Mr. Richardson's last month here. ''For one thing, Bill Richardson, everyone would agree, is a very good communicator. He listens and understands. He remembers the subject of a previous conversation. ''The other thing is the variety of diplomatic initiatives -- that may or may not originate with him.'' In the ''other thing'' department, Mr. Richardson has had a tough tenure here. Respect for the United States, which is crippling the organization by withholding its dues, is at an all-time low. Americans are losing good positions within the organization, and Washington may forfeit its General Assembly vote if it falls too far behind in payments. Mr. Richardson's replacement, Richard C. Holbrooke, has not yet been formally presented to the Senate by the White House for confirmation. In this environment the Administration, supersensitive to political swings, has thrown proposals at the Security Council without prior consultation and changed policies without warning, most recently on Iraq. Sir John Weston, who retired this summer as Britain's representative, pointed to a sudden announcement by Washington early this year that the Security Council would be asked to set up a Cambodian war crimes tribunal. ''It's a bit silly to come out with this one fine day without having thought through the idea,'' he said. ''This requires talking in the corridors. Launching the idea cold is to court problems.'' Sir John also recalled the surprise of Mr. Richardson's trip to Afghanistan in April, made at President Clinton's behest. It was a critical moment for the United Nations in Afghanistan, the British envoy said, and Mr. Richardson ''didn't tell anyone he was going.'' For Europeans now trying to think as one within the European Union, the Lone Ranger behavior of Washington is easier to criticize. Europe's brightest diplomats are often steered into careers in international organizations, and prime ambassadorial assignments like the United Nations do not go to political appointees. Mr. Richardson says he understands and appreciates this after his experiences here. ''The United States needs to better train its diplomats to participate in multilateral fora,'' he said in diplomatese, ''because the multilateral fora for the challenges that lie ahead for the United States are going to be very important: nuclear proliferation, ethnic wars, international terrorism, the plight of women, global climate change, refugees. It would make sense to give American diplomats tours -- almost a requirement -- to serve in a multilateral framework to learn the give and take of multilateral diplomacy.'' Mr. Richardson said he has enjoyed everything about United Nations life, including nonstop dinners. ''U.N. diplomats and U.N. Secretariat people are quality people, good people,'' he said. ''This perception that the U.N. has a lot of deadbeats is totally false. I've met some of the more talented, intelligent and interesting people here. ''To achieve our objectives, you have to engage in the social life of the U.N. That's why I spent a lot of time in the Delegates' Lounge. That's why I spent a lot of time at the cafeteria. That's why I spent a lot of time giving parties and attending parties, because you get business done there.'' Mr. Richardson, who often seemed to other diplomats to be impatient with the pace of Security Council work, said he liked a lot of it. ''I love Security Council meetings,'' he said. ''Not the big formal ones but the internal ones, which you don't see. I love the give and take, the fact that there the traditional postures of diplomacy are put aside and personality politics dominates, and skill at finding solutions or evading solutions by knowing U.N. rules comes across, and where a weak country with a strong ambassador can many times play a broker role.'' He said he found that certain personal relationships were crucial: with Secretary General Kofi Annan; with Richard Butler, chairman of the disarmament commission for Iraq, and with the other envoys of the five permanent members of the Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. ''I found Kofi to be one of the most skillful political animals in the world,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''His ability to maneuver is incredibly good. He always makes you leave your meeting with him thinking that you've made your point. That's a master skill.'' ''Butler is a very independent, very proud, passionate person who has to trust you,'' he said of the chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, who is now caught in a political battle in Washington over how tough a policy the United States should have on Iraq. ''That was one of my more satisfying relationships.'' ''I particularly enjoyed my relationship with Lavrov,'' he said of Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative. ''It was one that bordered on friendship, serious friendship.'' There have been many unpublicized compromises worked out behind the scenes with the help of Mr. Lavrov. ''He uses his enormous knowledge of the U.N., combined with personal charisma and his strength within the Russian bureaucracy, to get things done.'' Mr. Richardson said he also leaves with warm feelings for Alain Dejammet of France, an impassioned critic of American policy in Africa and Iraq. ''Dejammet and I have sort of a special relationship,'' he said. As for the Chinese, against whom he has made at least two tough speeches on human rights, they will be giving the first and one of the largest farewell dinners. ''Despite policy differences at the U.N., you have to maintain strong personal relationships,'' he said. ''Otherwise you can't do business.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 52-> A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., Federal Judge, Is Dead at 70
A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who called himself ''a survivor of segregation'' and became one of the country's most prominent African-American judges, died yesterday in Boston. He was 70 and died after a stroke for which he had been hospitalized on Saturday. Judge Higginbotham, a legal scholar, author and historian, was an influential Federal judge for 29 years until he retired in 1993. He often used the story of his own life, which began in an era of discrimination in Trenton, as an example of how what he called voiceless and forgotten people could overcome obstacles if they had help. From 1990 until his retirement, Judge Higginbotham was Chief Judge of the Federal appeals court in Philadelphia, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He was only the third black jurist to have directed any one of the country's circuit courts, the 12 Federal appeals panels that are second in importance only to the United States Supreme Court. Some historians say Judge Higginbotham was one of a handful of black jurists President Lyndon B. Johnson considered as candidates to integrate the Supreme Court before he named Thurgood Marshall the first black Justice in 1967. In a career of energetic accomplishment and unambiguous liberalism, Judge Higginbotham received much recognition as a legal scholar and civil rights advocate, including the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1995. But he persistently said that many of the advances for black Americans that he had applauded over a long legal career were endangered by cutbacks in affirmative action and reduced opportunities for black lawyers and judges. ''I witnessed the birth of racial justice in the Supreme Court and here now, after 45 years as a lawyer, judge and law professor, I sometimes feel as if I am watching justice die,'' he wrote in an article in The New York Times Magazine in January. After his retirement from the bench he taught at Harvard University, practiced law in New York and Washington and served on various corporate boards, including that of The New York Times Company. In 1996 he published ''Shades of Freedom'' (Oxford University Press), the second of four books he planned to write on the law and race. His earlier book, ''In the Matter of Color,'' published in 1978, dealt with the evolution of legal and racial attitudes in the era of slavery. At the time of his death, he was at work on an autobiography. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a friend and fellow professor at Harvard, said yesterday that Judge Higginbotham would be remembered most as an influential legal thinker who championed affirmative action and civil rights. ''Once he succeeded,'' Professor Ogletree said, ''he was one who didn't hesitate to let the rope drop back down and help others who needed it.'' Only days before his death, Judge Higginbotham's voice was still influencing the issues of the day. On Dec. 1, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry. He joined other legal experts in expressing the view that there were no grounds for impeachment of President Clinton. In his testimony, he said that even if President Clinton had committed perjury, not all perjurious statements were equal under the law. He suggested that Mr. Clinton's misstatements about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky were more like lies to avoid a speeding ticket than like lies about selling the nation's security secrets to a foreign enemy. Judge Higginbotham often took strong positions. In recent years he was one of the most bitter public critics of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, saying that Justice Thomas's conservative opinions had injured black Americans. Last summer, after Justice Thomas addressed a group of black lawyers and judges, Judge Higginbotham said he did not deserve the honor of being keynote speaker because his rulings ''have done more to turn back the clock of racial progress than any other African-American public official in the history of this country.'' Judge Higginbotham often cast his commitment to the law as a commitment to social justice. He said it had come from hard experience. In emotional speeches, the judge, who was a commanding 6 feet 5 inches tall, described how a white college president at Purdue University had flatly told him when he was a college freshman in 1944 that the school was not required under the law to provide black students with heated dormitories and, therefore, never would. He said that experience had persuaded him to become a lawyer, because he did not believe that the law should sanction such injustices. But even as an award-winning graduate from Yale Law School in 1952, he said in speeches, he could not escape the sting of bigotry. When he accepted an invitation for an interview at one of the premier Philadelphia law firms after law school, he said, a secretary seemed puzzled when he arrived. He soon realized that the firm's lawyers had assumed that the Yale student named Leon Higginbotham was white. The interviewing lawyer told him his resume was impressive. But then he added: ''Of course, you know there's nothing I can do for you,'' Judge Higginbotham said. By the time he reached the lobby of the law firm's building, he told a group of Yale Law School alumni years later, he was in tears. Ernest Rubenstein, a New York lawyer and Yale classmate who was in that crowd in 1989 when Judge Higginbotham described that experience, said yesterday that there were few dry eyes in the audience. But the speech, Mr. Rubenstein said, also included ample descriptions of teachers who had encouraged the young black scholar, and of the struggling parents who had insisted that he be given the chance to rise out of their troubled Ewing Park neighborhood in Trenton. ''I think he understood,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ''no one ever does it alone.'' Judge Higginbotham's most passionate opinions often dealt with social or racial issues. He was sometimes criticized by conservatives who said his liberal views were so evident that he could not project an impartial appearance. In one nationally noted opinion, he held in 1987 that local governments must pay for abortions for prison inmates if no other public or private financial aid was available. In an interview in 1989, he suggested that his accomplishments had come at some personal cost and described himself as a workaholic. Judge Higginbotham's wife, Dr. Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, is a professor of history and Afro-American studies at Harvard, where the retired judge had been a professor at Harvard College, Harvard Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He was also associated with the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. In addition to his wife, Judge Higginbotham is survived by two sons, Stephen and Kenneth of Philadelphia, and two daughters, Karen of Denver and Nia, a college student in Massachusetts. His first marriage, to Jeanne Higginbotham, ended in divorce in 1988. In the account of his life that Judge Higginbotham gave to audiences, he told of his journey from the segregated Trenton schools to his days as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and then as a partner in a black law firm. He was president of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1960 to 1962. He was named to the Federal District Court in Philadelphia in 1964, at age 36, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter elevated him to the United States Court of Appeals. When Judge John J. Gibbons, the only judge who was his senior on the bench, stepped down in 1989, Judge Higginbotham automatically moved up to the chief judge's position. The other two black jurists who had held similar posts were William H. Hastie and Spottswood Robinson 3d. Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court suggested in an interview then that the time for measuring ''firsts'' for black judges should be drawing to a close. ''There is no more significance to it than anybody else becoming chief judge,'' Justice Marshall said. ''I think he is a great lawyer and a very great judge. Period.'' That was an optimistic assessment of racial progress that Judge Higginbotham seemed not to share over the last few years as he expressed increasing alarm at what he described as an erosion of hard-won progress on racial issues in the law. But when he spoke to young people, the judge sometimes dwelled more on the opportunities for continued progress than on the problems he had seen in a long career. ''I will make two requests of you,'' he said to graduating seniors at Wesleyan University in 1996. ''They are that you always attempt to see those human beings who become invisible to most people, and that you always try to hear the pleas of those persons who, despite their pain and suffering, have become voiceless and forgotten.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 54-> Political Briefing; Polling Confirms It: Fritz Is Still First
One of the main worries that Democrats have about heading off further Republican gains in the Senate this fall is Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. Hailing from a state that has been turning more Republican with each election, Senator Hollings, a moderate Democrat in his fourth decade in the Senate, only narrowly won re-election in 1992 and this year faces an even tougher challenger, Representative Bob Inglis, a hard-right conservative from Greenville. But a new Mason-Dixon poll offers some fresh hope for the Senator. Conducted at the end of August for The Charleston Post and Courier, it found Mr. Hollings leading Mr. Inglis by 48 percent to 40 percent, a slight increase over the 47-to-42 lead the Senator held in June. While the increase may be small, political analysts say it looms large, because it indicates that the momentum Mr. Inglis built earlier in the year is slowing. The analysts also note that the gain came, significantly, after Senator Hollings had opened a major television and radio advertising campaign and at a time when Democratic candidates everywhere were trying to duck fallout from the Clinton-Lewinsky investigation. ''You'd figure that with everything going on with Bill Clinton, and South Carolina being an increasingly conservative Republican state, it would have been the opposite,'' Del Ali, the director of the poll, told The Post and Courier. The Senator attributes his larger lead to an increasing awareness among voters that he can bring home the bacon, whereas Representative Inglis, he contends, has a habit -- one he boasts about -- of voting against most Federal programs. Mr. Inglis, a three-term member of the House, counters by saying the Senator is a ''slow-moving 32-year incumbent who's limping.'' He predicts he will soon overtake Mr. Hollings, having saved most of his energy and money for a final dash to November. Perhaps. But in the most recent campaign finance reports, Mr. Hollings had $1.78 million in the bank, Mr. Inglis only $440,000. There is other good news in the new poll for Mr. Hollings, and it may be even more important in the long run. In the June survey, the Senator's favorability rating was 49 percent; in the new poll, it had increased to 53 percent. Similarly, in the June survey Mr. Inglis's unfavorability rating stood at 8 percent; by the end of August, it had jumped to 14 percent. Finally, the new poll, which surveyed 806 voters and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, found that blacks preferred the Senator over Representative Inglis by 76 percent to 7 percent. In a state whose population is almost one-third black and whose Democratic Party membership is considerably more than one-third black, heavy black turnout in November would clearly be a boon to the incumbent.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 55-> Soweto Journal; That Little White Ball Is Suddenly Colorblind
The golf course at Soweto's Country Club has come a long way since the days when players putted on greens that were just smoothed-over dirt and the holes were buried tin cans. The course -- like Soweto itself -- is coming up in the world. It has a new wrought-iron fence, three specialized mowing machines, a sprinkler system and a campaign to remake its image, which has managed to attract dozens of white players, at least for the day. Next year, the club plans to more than triple its annual fees -- though at less than $100 it will surely remain the best deal around. And there are blueprints for much more -- a pool, a tennis court, a bowling green. There are lots of changes these days in South Africa's most famous black township. The dusty streets that used to snake all over Soweto -- home to perhaps four million people, most of them living in shacks or Government issue matchbox houses -- are almost a thing of the past. Hundreds of miles of roads have been paved since the African National Congress came to power in 1994. Some 2,000 street lights have been installed. Garbage is collected. Water is far more reliable. And everywhere there are signs of the kind of ambition driving the remake of the country club. Under the former Government, commerce was strictly controlled to force Sowetans to buy from white-owned stores in downtown Johannesburg. These days, however, Soweto has several new shopping areas of its own and a mall. There are dozens of new restaurants -- including a pizza parlor, an art gallery, two bed-and-breakfasts and a cafe where you can eat brunch and drink cappuccino under pink umbrellas. Soweto has always been an afterthought of urban geography -- a centerless bedroom community for black South Africans set up just close enough to downtown so they could get to work, but just far enough away so that tanks could close off the roads if unrest broke out. Even the golf course, some say, was built to create a buffer zone between black and mixed-race areas. But many here hope that the township, which nurtured great anti-apartheid leaders like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu and was the setting for some of the liberation movement's most brutal confrontations, will someday be a vibrant city of its own. ''Eventually, we are going to get there,'' said Stella Dubazana, who opened Soweto's first pizza parlor, Palazzo di Stella, two years ago in a former police station. ''We have a lot of hope.'' More than 1,000 tourists visit each day, but most spend only a few hours on guided tours and return to the lush hotels of the northern suburbs to eat and to shop. Mrs. Dubazana and others would like them to stay a little longer. More than a dozen Soweto business people have gotten together to offer a tour of Soweto's ''shebeens,'' the illegal taverns that blacks used to run in the townships. The tour includes stops like the pizzeria and the art gallery as well. Michael Nompula, the golf club's president, would like to see the tourists play golf too. ''Why not?'' he says. ''They could meet people here and really talk to Sowetans.'' There are a few problems however. The greens don't stay green all year -- wrong kind of grass. The sand traps don't have any sand -- too expensive. And the players must remove branches from the holes before they putt. The club has flags, but they come out only on special occasions. The club lost 72 flags last year. Soweto's poorer residents steal them for curtain rods. But Mr. Nompula's dreams see past all this. ''Maybe in another five years,'' he says, ''people will look at this golf course and they'll say: 'What a beautiful club. We didn't know what you were talking about.' '' To be sure, crime and unemployment remain major issues in Soweto. The township has the highest rate of car hijacking in the country. Just last month, President Mandela apologized to the visiting head of the West Indies Cricket Board after he, his wife and two escorts were robbed while visiting Soweto's only cricket oval. Gunmen forced them to lie down in the parking lot and stole their cash, jewelry and car. And many who can now afford it are leaving Soweto for the white suburbs, often because they want better schools for their children. The golf club once had 800 members. But these days blacks can play on any course if they have the money, so membership has dwindled to 200. The club has attracted some white members of late. But in many cases they have no intention of playing here -- they only want to get an official handicap cheaply. So they pay their dues and play as guests at fancier clubs. ''It would be nice to see some of them become active members instead of just using it as a bridge to the milk and honey,'' said Martin Pinto, who just finished his term as the president of the South African Golf Association. Mr. Nompula says that even some black players do the same -- running to him at the last minute to get their handicaps because they want to enter a tournament at some other club. But in recent years, the club has been able to make some improvements, in part with Government funding. But Mr. Nompula says the club cannot ask the Government for more when so many people lack housing, schools and water. He wants private investors. He doesn't like to harp on the past. Bygones should be bygones, he said, although he will go this far: ''It did have a certain effect on us and we could use some help.'' On a recent weekend, there were foursomes all over the course, though no white players were to be seen. In the afternoon, the men gathered on the pink leatherette sofas to watch soccer. Some of the players have recently found good jobs and can only now afford a game like golf. Others have been playing for years and remember the early days when they could not play in the white clubs. Nowadays, they have all at least tried the plush ''white'' courses. ''There,'' said J. J. Motha, who at 77 has been playing for 40 years, ''when you play badly, you have only yourself to blame.'' In three years, Mr. Nompula says, if all goes well, the South African Open could be played here. ''This is a lovely place, relaxed,'' he said. ''No hooligans here. We just need a little help.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 56-> Political Briefing; A Tennessee Traveler Sees the Country
When Senator Fred Thompson was on ''Larry King Live'' the other night, Mr. King asked him whether he planned to run for President in 2000. ''I don't know,'' the Tennessee Republican replied in his gravelly drawl. ''Haven't had a chance to give it much thought.'' Maybe this is the place to recall that besides being a politician, Mr. Thompson is an actor. He does mainly movies, but in this run-up to Election 2000, any stage will do. In the last 18 months, the Senator has made appearances in no fewer than 25 states, prominent among them Presidential campaign hot spots like Iowa and California. And in coming months, aides say, he plans even more appearances around the country, including several return trips to California, followed by stops in Virginia, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana. He's thinking about something. It's all part of the testing-the-waters process, of course. And Mr. Thompson is just one of some two dozen who are currently doing it, insisting all the while, in most cases, that they're not truly concentrating on it, not yet, not really, not seriously. So when will Mr. Thompson get serious? ''At the end of the year,'' he told Mr. King, ''after these next campaigns -- first of next year -- I'll sit down and take a look at it.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 59-> PRO FOOTBALL; Harbaugh Says His Injury Won't Sideline Him for Jets
Baltimore Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh is not about to let a painful finger on his throwing hand keep him out of Sunday's game against the Jets at Giants Stadium. The injury, which sidelined Harbaugh during the Ravens' season-opening 20-13 loss to Pittsburgh, was initially diagnosed as an acute fracture. But a CAT scan yesterday revealed only ligament damage -- an injury that is perceived to be less severe. Harbaugh is intent upon practicing this week -- if he can grip a football. ''I'm going to do everything to get ready to play Sunday,'' Harbaugh said yesterday. ''Hopefully I'll be able to hold a football Wednesday or Thursday and get out there Sunday.'' Harbaugh left last Sunday's game midway in the second quarter and did not return. He tried several times to throw on the sideline but never felt comfortable. Harbaugh was not the only Baltimore player hurting. Cornerback Rod Woodson was experiencing back spasms and wide receiver Michael Jackson, who had a team-high six catches, has bruised ribs. Both are expected to play against the Jets. Redskins to Start Green Washington quarterback Trent Green, who emerged from obscurity with a fine performance against the Giants on Sunday, will make his first National Football League start at home on Monday night against the San Francisco 49ers. ''I prepared myself like it could happen, but to think this was going to happen, especially the second week of the season? No,'' he said yesterday. Gus Frerotte, the Redskins' starting quarterback, threw consecutive interceptions Sunday that helped the Giants gain a 31-24 victory. Bills' Smith Defers to Injury Bruce Smith is not happy about being the third-highest-paid player on the Buffalo Bills. But he says that is not the reason he sat out Sunday's season opener. A 10-time Pro Bowl defensive end, Smith denied speculation yesterday that his contract situation -- he will earn less than Ted Washington and Rob Johnson this season -- was the reason for his absence in the team's 16-14 loss to the San Diego Chargers. Instead, Smith said, he sat out because of an off-season knee surgery. Bengals' Carter Out for Year Cincinnati running back Ki-Jana Carter was placed on injured reserve and will miss the rest of the season after breaking his left wrist during Sunday's 23-14 loss to Tennessee. Surgery Sidelines McGlockton Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Chester McGlockton is out indefinitely after undergoing back surgery, but is expected to return this season. McGlockton, a four-time Pro Bowl player who missed the team's last four exhibition games, had back surgery Saturday in Los Angeles. Browns' Buyer to Be Chosen It's hard to say which is more anticipated, the name of the new Cleveland Browns owner or the amount he will have to pay. N.F.L. owners will decide both today in Chicago when they add the latest member to their exclusive club.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 60-> The Science of Art
To the Editor: As an instructor of linear perspective and drawing, I read with great interest Dan Rockmore's Sept. 1 Science Times essay, ''Mathematical Metaphors in Art and Fiction.'' Mr. Rockmore's observation that there seems to be a link between art and science is an old and respectable one. Leonardo da Vinci wrote that painting is a science because its ''philosophical and subtle speculation considers all manner of forms: sea, land, trees, animals, grasses, flowers, all of which are enveloped in light and shade.'' The reason why painting was not considered a science, he postulated, was ''because writers had no access to the definitions of the science of painting.'' PATRICK CONNORS Philadelphia, Sept. 1, 1998

Sept. 8, 1998-> 61-> RUSSIA IN TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW; YELTSIN'S NOMINEE REJECTED 2D TIME; BANK CHIEF QUITS
Russia's Parliament again spurned President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister today after last-minute negotiations between the Kremlin and a defiant Communist opposition broke down. Mr. Yeltsin gave no signs of backing down tonight over his nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister. That set the stage for another debilitating round of political wrangling as the economy continued to reel out of control. Sergei K. Dubinin, the beleaguered chairman of the central bank, resigned today after increasing criticism of his role in managing Russia's financial crisis. His parting shot was a blistering letter assailing the Government for failing to collect taxes and maintain financial discipline. The going rate for dollars at local exchange counters hovered around 20 rubles, and the value of the ruble fell much more at the national currency exchange before trading was suspended, an ominous sign that the currency may be in for another round of devaluation. A month ago, a dollar bought about six rubles. Many stores in Moscow were virtually picked clean by shoppers who raided the merchants as imports dried up. Toothpaste, butter, toilet paper and soap powder have become hard to find. Lines at gas stations grew as motorists raced to beat price increases of as much as 40 percent. Outside the capital there were shortages and skyrocketing prices as well. In the Siberian city of Omsk, the price of kielbasa, the spicy sausage that is a Russian staple, has doubled since the crisis began two weeks ago. In Novgorod, 300 miles northwest of Moscow, the cost of medicine soared. Some regional governors are trying to institute price controls. As the panic has spread, Mr. Chernomyrdin warned Parliament today that the country was not merely approaching the danger zone. ''We are already crossing it,'' he said. ''Russia has never been through a crisis like this.'' His appeal fell far short. Mr. Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes to win approval. The vote was 278 to 138 against his nomination. Not even Mr. Yeltsin's offer to install Mr. Chernomyrdin on a kind of six-month probation softened the opposition. Nor was the opposition influenced by an offer from Boris G. Fyodorov, the Kremlin's top economic strategist. Since the Communists have been demanding that the Government crank up the presses to print rubles, he announced that the presses would be turned on -- but not until Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has been Acting Prime Minister since Aug. 23, was confirmed. The main opposition to Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has already served a term as Mr. Yeltsin's Prime Minister, came from the Communists, who dominate the legislature along with their leftist allies. Casting the crisis as a chance to take power back from the executive branch, the Communists have demanded that Mr. Yeltsin agree to a new plan to share power with Parliament and that he scrap Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination. The liberal Yabloko party, led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, has broken completely with Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Yavlinsky today incongruously proposed Yevgeny M. Primakov, the hard-line Foreign Minister, for Prime Minister. Mr. Yavlinsky, who broached the idea with President Yeltsin today, appears to see a Primakov Government as an opportunity to gain a place for himself in a governing coalition. Mr. Primakov's name was not the only one bandied about. Opposition members of Parliament have also talked about Yegor S. Stroyev, the head of the upper house, and Yuri M. Luzhkov, the pugnacious Mayor of Moscow. Chernomyrdin supporters insisted that Mr. Yeltsin was determined to stick to his guns and would renominate Mr. Chernomyrdin on Tuesday, paving the way for a third and final showdown with Parliament. A third rejection of Mr. Chernomyrdin's nomination would lead to the dissolution of the legislature and new parliamentary elections within three months. Anticipating possible parliamentary elections, Mr. Yeltsin's Justice Ministry has issued a ruling that would block the Communists, Yabloko and other political parties from taking part in a vote this year. The ministry acted on procedural grounds relating to when parties can get on the ballot under a 1997 right-to-vote law. But individual Communists would be able to run on their own. As the infighting continued, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said tonight that he planned to resume talks with Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin on Tuesday. With its leaders preoccupied with political intrigue and with no new Government in place to deal with the collapsing economy, Russia these days is like a storm-tossed boat whose captain and crew are below deck and whose engine has just quit. The parliamentary debate was punctuated with bitter recriminations. A glum Mr. Chernomyrdin warned that a nuclear-armed Russia would be engulfed in Indonesian-style riots if the crisis continued to intensify. ''What happened to your memory?'' he asked the Communists. ''Were shop counters full at the beginning of the 1990's? It took us six years to land on our feet, and now you want to throw it all away.'' ''Indonesia reached the point where the country went up in flames,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin added. ''Is this what you want?'' The Communists and their leftist allies were not impressed. Yelena Panina, a member of the pro-Communist Power to the People Party, blamed Mr. Chernomyrdin for leading the country into the financial crisis during his first term as Prime Minister, from December 1992 to March of this year. ''When King Louis XIV wanted to know what people thought about him, he disguised himself as a commoner and walked the streets of Paris,'' she said. ''I suggest you try this and find out about what people say about you and your reforms in Moscow. But you'd better disguise yourself really well. You'll be in trouble if they recognize you.'' The squabbling produced some bizarre role reversals. After the liberal Mr. Yavlinsky endorsed Mr. Primakov for Prime Minister, the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky delivered a tirade against the Foreign Minister, who has made his mark as a bitter foe of NATO expansion and an opponent of American dominance. Mr. Zhirinovsky charged that Mr. Primakov had encouraged the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in an earlier era. And he complained that Mr. Yavlinsky had cut a cynical deal to support Mr. Primakov in return for appointment as the top Kremlin aide in charge of the economy. There were few voices of moderation. But as the acid debate intensified, Galina V. Starovoytova, a liberal legislator, finally burst in. She laid the blame for Russia's travails at the feet of the Communists, who have repeatedly sought to frustrate the Government's market reforms. ''You would like to bring us back to the pre-perestroika time,'' she said, referring to the reforms ushered in by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ''Congratulations. You managed to do it. Look at the empty shop counters. It's the result of your activities.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 62-> N.F.L.: WEEK 16; Plummer's Heroics Keep Cards in Hunt
SAINTS 17, CARDINALS 19 Jake Plummer led the Cardinals on another desperation drive, setting up Chris Jacke's final-play, 36-yard field goal to give host Arizona a 19-17 victory against the New Orleans Saints yesterday. We showed them all over again that it's never over, Plummer said. The Cardinals, who last made the playoffs in the 1982 strike season after a 5-4 record while playing in St. Louis, can claim the final National Football Conference wild-card berth with a home victory against the San Diego Chargers next Sunday. The Cardinals have not been to the playoffs in a nonstrike year since 1975. The loss eliminated the Saints from contention, leaving only Tampa Bay and the Giants alive in the conference. If the Cardinals lose, they can still make the playoffs if Philadelphia beats the Giants. The Buccaneers advance if they and the Giants win and Arizona loses. Plummer passed for 394 yards and threw the final block to spring Adrian Murrell on a 21-yard scoring run -- Arizona's only touchdown -- with 8 minutes 16 seconds left in the third quarter. The victory was Plummer's eighth in 10 games when Arizona was tied or trailing in the fourth quarter during the last two seasons. He directed the 73-yard drive in the final 1:16, hitting Frank Sanders with passes of 25 and 28 yards and scrambling for 21 yards on another play. Before his game-winning field goal, Jacke had three field goals, from 21, 38 and 46 yards, and missed a 51-yard attempt in the first quarter. Saints free safety Sammy Knight returned an interception 39 yards for a touchdown that gave the Saints a 7-3 lead in the second quarter. The teams exchanged field goals, and the Saints held a 10-6 halftime lead. I felt like we could stop them, New Orleans defensive end Joe Johnson said. But if you don't cover people, you can't stop anybody. Knight recovered a fumble by Murrell on the Arizona 18-yard line with 12:28 to play. But Cardinals linebackers Mark Maddox and Jamir Miller stopped Lamar Smith for no gain on fourth-and-1 at the 9 to preserve a 13-10 Arizona lead. Saints Coach Mike Ditka had no second thoughts about going for the touchdown. You got a half-yard to go, he said. If you can't make it, you don't deserve to win. OILERS 22, PACKERS 30 Behind a record-setting day from Brett Favre at Lambeau Field, the playoff-bound Green Bay Packers dimmed Tennessee's playoff hopes. But unless the Packers beat Chicago and San Francisco loses to St. Louis next week, they have to go on the road in the playoffs. As for the Oilers, they must beat Minnesota next week and hope New England loses its season finale and Miami loses its last two games beginning tonight against Denver. The Oilers' loss helped Jacksonville, Buffalo and New England all qualify for the playoffs. Reggie White has almost certainly played his final game in Green Bay, where he helped restore greatness to a storied franchise. I didn't want to just walk off the field, said White, who, when he got to the tunnel after a victory lap, gazed out toward the crowd of 59,888 and looked like a man who didn't want to say goodbye. Favre's three touchdown passes gave him five seasons -- in a row, no less -- with 30 or more touchdown passes, breaking the National Football League record he shared with Dan Marino. BENGALS 25, STEELERS 24 The Bengals, losers of nine in a row, squandered a 13-point lead but rallied to eliminate the host Steelers from playoff contention behind a rejuvenated Jeff Blake's 367 yards passing and a touchdown. Fittingly enough in a game matching the A.F.C.'s worst defense (Cincinnati's) and worst passing offense (Pittsburgh's), three of the five touchdowns were scored by the defenses or special teams. Jeff Blake won the game, Bengals Coach Bruce Coslet said. What else can you say? Blake found Darnay Scott behind Lee Flowers and Carnell Lake for the go-ahead 61-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, immediately after the Steelers' Jerome Bettis scored on a 4-yard run. Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart, who threw a tantrum upon being pulled from last week's loss in Tampa, was benched again after going 5 of 13 for only 30 yards in the Steelers' fourth straight loss. EAGLES 9, COWBOYS 13 The Cowboys' kick holder Eric Bjornson scored a touchdown on a fake field goal, and safety George Teague made a saving fourth-down tackle late in the game as the host Cowboys outlasted the Eagles and clinched the N.F.C. East. Dallas's first-year coach, Chan Gailey, flipped Dallas around from a 6-10 record under Barry Switzer to a 9-6 mark that enabled the Cowboys to win their seventh division title in eight years. This team has hearts as big as Texas Stadium, said an emotional Gailey, who was Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator last year. It was not easy. The Cowboys beat the Eagles, 34-0, in November, but they gave Dallas heated competition, although Coach Ray Rhodes appears on his way out. Dallas had to resort to trickery to gain a 7-3 advantage over Philadelphia at halftime. Bjornson took the snap on an apparent 25-yard field goal attempt. Instead, he jumped to his feet and followed a block by left tackle Larry Allen to score untouched. COLTS 23, SEAHAWKS 27 A year of losing finally caused Jim Mora's temper to erupt. That was a lousy job of coaching and playing out there today, the Indianapolis Colts' first-year coach said after watching his team squander a 23-10 lead in the fourth quarter of a loss to the Seahawks in Seattle. We had it, they didn't care about winning it and we gave it away. The Seahawks came back and won on touchdowns in the fourth quarter by Ricky Watters and Shawn Springs after finding out early in the day that they had been eliminated from the playoffs. The elimination is expected to cost Coach Dennis Erickson his job after the season ends. Watters, who set a career high with 178 yards on 32 carries, scored on a 33-yard run with 9:19 to go to make it 23-17. Then the Seahawks used their defense to get their winning touchdown. On a first-down play from the Colts' 26, Phillip Daniels caused Marshall Faulk to fumble and Springs picked up the bouncing ball and ran 14 yards for the score. Seattle held Faulk, a Pro Bowl selection, in check. He didn't start because he arrived late for a meeting and finished with 19 yards on 13 carries. He caught 4 passes for 16 yards and needs 122 yards receiving against Carolina next Sunday to become the second player in N.F.L. history to eclipse 1,000 yards rushing and receiving. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was 23 of 39 for 335 yards with an interception. He threw one touchdown pass and set up another with a long pass for the Colts. RAIDERS 17, CHARGERS 10 Minutes into their game, the Oakland Raiders found out their slim playoff hopes were dead. That didn't stop them from picking on the San Diego Charger's pass defense, the weak link in a unit that allows the fewest yards per game in the N.F.L. Wade Wilson, who turns 40 on Feb. 1, threw touchdown passes of 45 yards to James Jett and 12 yards to Tim Brown on consecutive possessions in the second quarter, and host Oakland beat the Chargers. The Raiders snapped a four-game losing streak, but the victory came much too late. New England's victory over San Francisco ended Oakland's hopes of making it to the playoffs for the first time since 1993. RAVENS 3, BEARS 24 James Allen's two-year wait for his break in the N.F.L. ended against the listless Baltimore Ravens at Soldier Field. Given the chance he has long sought, Allen responded with the Chicago Bears' best single-game rushing performance of the 90's. I knew if I got a chance I'd produce, Allen said after gaining 163 yards in his first N.F.L. start to lead the Bears in a victory that ended a six-game losing streak. With Curtis Enis out for the season following knee surgery and the veteran Edgar Bennett limping on a sore knee, Allen was given the ball 23 times. He broke off runs of 57 and 54 yards in a 135-yard first half as the Bears bolted to a 24-0 lead. RAMS 13, PANTHERS 20 The Panthers, responding to reports that Coach Dom Capers was about to lose his job, put together a winning fourth-quarter rally for the first time this season. Steve Beuerlein's 68-yard touchdown pass to the backup tight end Luther Broughton with 2:44 left put Carolina up for the first time, and the host Panthers went on to a victory.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 64-> NEWS SUMMARY
INTERNATIONAL A3-13 U.S. Says It May Need More Strikes on Iraq The Clinton Administration warned that Iraq might quickly try to rebuild its programs to develop chemical and biological weapons after the air strikes last week, and that additional American strikes might be needed soon. But Administration officials said that if additional air strikes were required, they would probably not occur until early next year. A12 Baghdad appeared to avoid heavy damage in the raids, and life there was barely disrupted. Most of the attacks were on positions elsewhere in Iraq. Although preliminary Western assessments suggested that the bombing was effective, it also appeared that President Saddam Hussein emerged at least as powerful as he was before the attacks. A1 The United Nations Security Council plans today to begin assessing the damage done to the three legs on which it bases its relations with Baghdad -- economic sanctions, arms inspections and a relief program designed to aid Iraqis suffering under an economic embargo. A13 Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered a tough-talking assessment of the air attacks on Iraq, urging doubters and critics to understand the new ''global reality'' that modern diplomacy must be backed up by force. He used a televised address both to list the mission's accomplishments and to put forth an earnest justification of the raids and the need to be prepared to stage more. A13 Chinese Dissident Sentenced A Chinese court today sentenced Xu Wenli, a prominent dissident, to 13 years in prison, accusing him of trying to subvert state power by organizing an opposition party to challenge the ruling Communist Party. A11 Germany Extradites Suspect Germany handed over Mamdouh Mahmud Salim to American officials in Munich. Federal officials say Mr. Salim, 40, is a top aide to Osama bin Laden, who has been accused of being the leader of the group that bombed two American Embassies in Africa in August. A7 Zambia Sells Stake in Copper A deal to sell state-owned copper mines in Zambia has been reached after two years of negotiations, the Finance Minister announced. The Anglo American Corporation of South Africa will take over the important Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, but Zambia will retain a 20 percent interest. A9 Dissident Soldiers in Mexico Several dozen dissident Mexican soldiers, led by a lieutenant colonel, have emerged to issue public criticism of Government economic policies and civilian control of the military, as well as of reputed abuses by military courts. A5 German Jew's Grave Vandalized A bomb destroyed the gravestone of Heinz Galinski, the former head of Germany's main Jewish organization, the police said. Politicians condemned the act and expressed concern about anti-Semitism. A6 NATIONAL A14-27 Parties in Senate Split On Issue of Need for Trial Senators from both parties pledged to restore civility to the impeachment proceedings even as they quickly divided largely along party lines over whether President Clinton must face a Senate trial or could be subject to censure. A1 President Clinton has adopted a two-track approach to his pending impeachment trial in the Senate, preparing to mount a vigorous legal defense while seeking to reach a compromise on a resolution of condemnation that would let him keep his job, White House officials said. A1 A New York Times/CBS News Poll found that a majority of Americans believe that President Clinton should not have been impeached. But now that he has been, they believe that impeachment is punishment enough and the matter should be dropped. Most also want the Senate to resolve the case without a trial and without removing Mr. Clinton from office. His popularity is as high as it has ever been, while the standing of Republicans continues to plummet. A23 Thirteen Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have been appointed managers -- or official prosecutors -- for the Senate trial. A22 Saving Rate Declines Consumers have recently been spending all of their incomes and then some, Government data show. In September, the personal saving rate slipped below zero for the first time since the Great Depression, and in October it was more of the same, alarming some economists. A14 First Surviving Set of 8 Babies A 27-year-old woman in Houston became the mother of the first known surviving set of octuplets. A16 City's Homeless Deaths Rise A review of medical examiner's data has determined that 157 homeless people died in San Francisco in the last 12 months, more than in any year since tracking began in 1985. A18 2 Charged as Sea Search Ends The Coast Guard called off the search for 6 people missing since a speedboat carrying 21 Cuban refugees capsized near Miami on Thursday. The bodies of eight people have been recovered. Two men have been charged with alien smuggling. A18 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Democrats Plan to Use Impeachment as a Weapon Democratic strategists in the Northeast believe that the near party-line vote to impeach President Clinton -- coupled with public opinion polls showing that the President, or at least his policies, remain in favor among voters -- will provide the Democratic Party with a powerful weapon that could win back control of Congress in the 2000 elections. B1 Fire Alarm Was Delayed A 67-year-old woman who dropped a cigarette onto her couch and started a fire in Brooklyn that claimed the lives of three firefighters delayed calling the Fire Department for as long as 20 minutes while she tried to douse the flames with teapots full of water, investigators said. B3 NEEDIEST CASES B3 ARTS E1-8 Wanted: Poet Laureate Some of Britain's higher-profile poets are not interested in becoming poet laureate, though others are gently letting it be known that if appointed, they would serve. The most frequently mentioned candidate is Andrew Motion, a professor, poet, critic and biographer.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 65-> HOUSE PROUD; For Some, Decorating Starts at 80
THE words ''fresh start'' may be among the most delightful in the English language. And where furnishing a new home is concerned, it is a delight for which age is no barrier. Some residents of Logan Square East, a luxury retirement high-rise in Philadelphia, have exploded the myth that all older people who move into smaller quarters try to cram in as many old pieces of oversize furniture as possible. These people, all 75 or older and with the desire and budget to rethink their lives, approached the move with a pioneering spirit. Their new homes become opportunities to express new attitudes about life. ''I don't look back,'' said Barbara Rex Darsey, a 75-year-old silk-screen artist who moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Logan Square East from a large house in suburban Philadelphia six months ago. ''I got rid of most of my furnishings when I moved here, because I wanted to move on.'' She uses her second bedroom as a studio and the second bathroom as an inner sanctum -- where she meditates a half-hour a day in a specially padded bathtub. Standing in her school-bus-yellow living room, Ms. Darsey said, ''Now my walls throb.'' ''In my apartment, I can assert my aggressiveness,'' she continued. ''I can go against conventions.'' She was inspired by colors she saw on a trip to Rome just before she moved in. ''The green on my studio walls is singing -- it's an exciting color,'' she said. She brought with her only an Eames side chair, her cat and a family of doll puppets made from her own silk-screened fabric. ''The garden became a pain in the neck and I was too isolated,'' she said. ''I decided to make an 'early' move at 75.'' Dr. Rose Dobrof, a professor at the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College, sees redecorating as an affirmation of the future. ''It's sort of like moving to Florida to stay active and involved,'' she said. ''It's a second chance. The kids are grown and now there's some money available. For some, it's a need to get away from the loss of a partner. And don't forget, the widows are often looking for some visitors.'' Dr. Robert Butler, the director of the International Longevity Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, is fond of quoting John Glenn's reminder that old people dream and have ambitions, too. Last year, Florence Fink moved from a 17th-century house in Sag Harbor, N.Y., to a one-bedroom apartment at Logan Square East. ''I moved with four Le Corbusier chairs and 12 white T-shirts,'' she said. ''I felt I was going on an adventure.'' Widowed many years ago, Mrs. Fink, 80, said she wanted to be rid of the responsibility of a house. ''The one thing you can't take when you move are your friends,'' she said. ''But then again, moving to a place where you don't know anyone gives you a tremendous amount of freedom, since friends are a big responsibility.'' When she sold her house, most of her books and even some paintings went, too. She headed to Ikea for small-scale, reasonably priced furniture. ''Maybe the things were meant for young people living in small places,'' she said. ''But so what? I figured the furniture would be fine since my apartment is small, too.'' She ended up with two small red chaises for the living room to replace the built-in banquettes she was used to in her old house. She then had her red chaises slipcovered in beige linen to suit her sophisticated, minimalist taste. She also found two $15 floor lamps for the bedroom and an inexpensive bookcase for the 50 books she had kept. She admits now to suddenly feeling youthful. ''In Sag Harbor I felt old,'' she said. ''My old things didn't mean much to me. I left the house, I left the fixtures, but I took my memories. Those you can put in your pocket.'' Dr. Murray Schane, a psychiatrist in Manhattan, said he was not surprised that, as a group, these older redecorators seemed so positive about the future. ''Decorating is not only accumulating new things,'' he said. ''It's an active process that you engage in with other people, often younger people. It gives you a sense of renewal and makes the present feel more alive.'' The decorator Mario Buatta said, ''Eighty-year-olds are different than they used to be -- they just don't seem old nowadays.'' One older client in Atlanta has just moved into a smaller home. ''She's one of those women -- definitely over 80 -- who has totally redecorated,'' he said. ''The living room is bright yellow.'' Admittedly, most older people prefer to stick with their old furniture. ''People like to keep their pleasant memories around,'' Mr. Buatta said. ''The most important thing is to make a new place look happy.'' Sara Pildes, who referred all questions about her age to Sherlock Holmes, wanted something light and airy at Logan Square East. She moved there six years ago from a nine-room Victorian house in Brooklyn. She happily gave her collection of antique furniture to her granddaughter and bought herself contemporary upholstered chairs and kidney-bean-shaped sofas, all covered in smooth black fabric. As an artist, Ms. Pildes said she chose white walls and black furniture as background for her hard-edge geometric paintings. ''For me, the main thing was not to take too many of my old things when I moved,'' she said. ''I only brought one tiny chair for my bedroom and two folding tables for my studio.'' Often, it's not just the residents who find that a move in later years can give a new lease on life: Norman and Sylvia Gordin managed to lure their decorator, Donald Stanley, out of retirement when they sold their large house on the Main Line. Mr. Gordin, 84, a self-described eternal optimist, appealed to his wife's shopping instincts in proposing the move. ''I knew that if I promised she could buy all new furniture, it would be a done deal,'' he said. Mrs. Gordin, 75, recalled, ''The one thing I hated to give up was my bedroom set.'' Her husband jumped in: ''I said, 'Unload it, Sylvia -- we're starting on a new adventure.' ''

Dec. 14, 1998-> 66-> With a Vote for 'None of the Above,' Puerto Ricans Endorse Island's Status Quo
Puerto Ricans today rebuffed for a second time in six years their Governor's efforts to win statehood. They gave the most votes in a status referendum to a ''none of the above'' option that was promoted as a protest by those who want to maintain the current commonwealth relationship with the United States. The five options on the ballot were commonwealth, ''free association'' (a form of independence that delegates certain powers by treaty to the United States), statehood, independence, and ''none of the above.'' The fifth option won 50.2 percent of the vote, compared with 46.5 percent for statehood. Independence received 2.5 percent of the vote, and the commonwealth and free association options each received less than 1 percent. Historically divided over whether to seek a closer association with the United States through statehood or to remain distinctly self-governing as a commonwealth, the electorate this time was split among options that confused some voters and angered many others. The small vote for the option to maintain commonwealth status was evidence of this, reflecting a boycott by the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, which claimed the definition of that option was misleading. The party had urged its followers to vote for ''none of the above.'' The referendum drew a turnout of 71.1 percent of registered voters, compared with 73.6 percent in a similar referendum in 1993. Some leaders of the independence movement had urged a boycott of the voting altogether because the options were not defined by their proponents and because the results of the vote would not be binding on the United States Congress. In the 1993 vote, statehood lost to the commonwealth option by 46.2 percent to 48.4 percent, while 4.4 percent supported independence. Tonight, commonwealth leaders, who say the status quo needs enhancements but remains sound, said the vote reaffirmed the wish of Puerto Rico to continue its existing relationship with the United States a century after the Spanish-American War brought the two together. ''This vote means that we have here people who are proud of their history, proud of their relationship with the United States, proud of their American citizenship but, above all, proud of their Puerto Ricanness,'' Anibal Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party, told supporters at a victory rally. ''This has been a reaffirmation of the commonwealth.'' The loss for the statehood option appeared to be a major setback for efforts by the ruling New Progressive Party to sway Congress into authorizing a future binding vote on the incorporation of Puerto Rico as the 51st state. Gov. Pedro J. Rossello has made the pursuit of statehood for this island of 3.8 million residents his main priority since taking office in 1992, and has counted on the resources of incumbency to promote statehood here and in Washington. For this referendum, leaders of the statehood movement tried to divide the opposition among the four other options. They crafted the entire ballot measure as a petition to the United States Government ''to resolve the current territorial problem of the island,'' seeking to make each vote count as a mandate for change. Tonight, the Governor, too, claimed victory at his own rally, saying that since the commonwealth option had garnered few votes, ''the commonwealth is finished'' and that statehood had won overwhelmingly among the four ballot options that called for a specific status. Governor Rossello said he recognized the winning ''none of the above'' vote as a protest vote against him and his policies, but not necessarily against statehood itself. ''I will inform Congress and the President of the United States that among four options statehood surpassed 90 percent of support by those who want a change for Puerto Rico,'' the Governor said, calling statehood ''the best future for Puerto Rico.'' This year Congress, where opponents of statehood have cited objections over issues of language and cost, reached the farthest point on the question of self-determination for Puerto Rico when the House passed a bill that would have set the terms for a vote to seek a final status choice. The proposal stalled in the Senate. It is not certain how Washington will interpret today's vote. Some members of Congress have said they will disregard the ''none of the above'' votes because those votes convey no message. A White House official said today that President Clinton was committed to respecting the choice of more than 50 percent of voters and to take action to help implement it, but that the vote did not give Washington a clear direction. ''The Administration is going to work with members of Congress and the people of Puerto Rico and their leaders to enable Puerto Ricans to clarify their choice.'' Popular Democratic leaders said they were forced to protest the referendum because the Government denied them participation in crafting the ballot definition of commonwealth and that it ended up unfairly portraying that status as one that does not even guarantee American citizenship, which Puerto Ricans have had since 1917. But leaders said their protest was against the ''undemocratic'' way the ballot language was developed, not against a vote on self-determination itself. Tonight, the Mayor of San Juan, Sila M. Calderon, a major Popular Democratic Party leader, said ''the Puerto Rican people has given a mandate for dialogue, for consensus and for clean politics.'' The two main camps -- commonwealth and statehood -- waged advertising campaigns full of negative ads and scare tactics in which both sides accused the other of gross distortions. Pro-statehood ads, for example, said voting for an option other than statehood could endanger Puerto Ricans' American citizenship. Pro-commonwealth ads said a vote for statehood could turn the island into ''an incorporated territory'' under which residents would pay Federal taxes but not get full Congressional representation. Despite the barrage of ads, interviews with voters indicated that as veterans of several status referendums, many were able to sift through the rhetoric for the real issues. The main pro-commonwealth leadership says the status needs tinkering, not gutting. They say it is a unique relationship that accommodates the island's considerable sense of nationhood -- it can field its own Olympic team and beauty pageant contestants, for example -- and gives Puerto Ricans the benefit of American citizenship. The United States, in turn, gets a major market for American products and American companies to invest in, and a major contributor to the nation's defense.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 67-> PRO FOOTBALL; Parcells Sees Good and Bad, But Dwells on the Ugly
A day after the Jets' agonizing 36-30 overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Bill Parcells responded like a typical coach. He was disappointed. He said he didn't talk to anyone on the five-hour plane ride home. After watching game tapes this morning, he said he found a few good things but quickly found negatives to offset them. ''We were able to move the ball fairly well and we caught the ball fairly well,'' Parcells said. ''But we've got to block better on the run, for sure, and we've got to stop the run better. The last play aside, we missed an awful lot of tackles.'' The last play, of course, was Garrison Hearst's 96-yard run on a trap play that gave the 49ers their winning touchdown. ''We missed a tackle in the hole,'' Parcells said. ''We missed a tackle 3 yards downfield. I couldn't count them after that. They had already run that play three or four times in the game. We had experienced players in there. We had about six chances to get the guy down. ''I was very concerned to see a couple of things I don't like. On the other hand, I did see some things I do like. But we are a little too erratic.'' Parcells had to like his passing game. Glenn Foley, in his first regular-season opener since becoming the starting quarterback, posted better numbers than any other National Football League quarterback Sunday -- 58 attempts, 30 completions, 415 yards. He passed for three touchdowns and one interception. The wide receivers had big days. Keyshawn Johnson caught 9 passes for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, Wayne Chrebet 6 for 125 yards and a touchdown, Dedric Ward 5 for 96 yards. That helped the Jets amass 465 yards in total offense. (They yielded 557 to San Francisco.) But Parcells indicated that the Jets' offensive imbalance -- 58 passes and 24 runs -- was a one-time thing. ''San Francisco was in dire straits for cornerbacks,'' Parcells said. ''They were down to two, and they didn't have enough guys to play. They were having problems covering as well.'' Chrebet explained it by saying: ''We saw in tapes that if we went to three wideouts, we would have had an advantage. We moved the ball. I think we definitely have weapons on offense.'' Johnson said: ''I didn't know we would throw that much, and maybe it was just for this game. In the next game, maybe we get 250 yards on the ground.'' Parcells said he hoped this game would serve as a springboard for Ward, a second-year pro, who may be the fastest player on the team. For Foley, the endless passing was a quarterback's dream. ''It was a lot of fun, wide open, throwing the ball all over the place,'' he said. ''That's what you play the game for. It was an exciting game.'' Foley had started only five games in his four previous pro seasons. His teammates had high praise for him. ''Glenn was a great leader in the huddle,'' Ward said. Chrebet gave this example: ''On the last drive, he was very bossy. He wants it run this way, run your route that way. You want that. He showed that he's a big-time quarterback. He's the guy.'' Perhaps, it was suggested to Foley, he had something to prove. ''I don't think so,'' he said. ''I think everybody in this locker room knows what we're capable of doing. We have a pretty explosive offense.'' For Johnson, who played a game worthy of his idol, Jerry Rice of the 49ers, Foley did prove something. ''To me,'' Johnson said, ''Glenn proved his worth as a quarterback.'' EXTRA POINTS The 49ers game left the Jets with one injury of consequence (to JAMES FARRIOR's right knee) and one apparently not serious (to LEON JOHNSON's bruised right quadriceps). Farrior sprained his medial collateral ligament, and Coach BILL PARCELLS said that the starting weakside linebacker would miss Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens and probably the following Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts. The injury leaves the Jets with only five linebackers -- PEPPER JOHNSON and DWAYNE GORDON in the middle, MO LEWIS and BRYAN COX on the strongside and CHAD CASCADDEN on the weakside. Parcells said that Cascadden, who played inconsistently against the 49ers, would probably move up to start. The coach said he did not expect to work Cox there and would look for free-agent help. The best-known outside linebacker available is QUENTIN CORYATT, a seventh-year pro cut loose by Indianapolis. He was the second choice over all in the 1992 draft. Lewis said if Cascadden started, it would be no big deal. ''Chad has to move up,'' Lewis said. ''That's what he's paid to do.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 68-> METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY; Man Gets Life in Prison For Murdering Sealy Heir
A Paterson man has been sentenced to life in prison plus 69 years for the robbery and killing of a man whose father was a founder of the Sealy Mattress Company. A state Superior Court judge sentenced Edwin Torres, 23, on Friday for his role in the November 1995 murder of Howard Lewis of Teaneck. Mr. Torres will not be eligible for parole until 2058. Mr. Lewis, 49, was a co-owner of Sealy, based in Paterson, but did not manage the company. Prosecutors said Mr. Torres, who had worked for Sealy in 1994, and another man, Afrim Tairi, attacked Mr. Lewis on Nov. 8, 1995, in his garage. A third man, Felix R. DeJesus, waited outside, the authorities said. Mr. Lewis was pistol-whipped, had duct tape placed over his mouth and around his ankles, and was dragged upstairs to a bedroom, the authorities have said. He choked on his own vomit, an autopsy found. Prosecutors said Mr. Tairi and Mr. Torres went into the house, handcuffed and bound Mr. Lewis's 86-year-old mother, and left with $2,600 and a credit card, prosecutors said. The woman was able to call 911 three hours later and spent the night in a hospital. Mr. Torres and Mr. DeJesus, who were roommates, were arrested in July 1996. Mr. Tairi is believed to have fled the country. Mr. DeJesus, 33, faces trial next month. Mr. Torres was convicted of 17 charges last month, including burglary at a business in Englewood Cliffs in 1995 and a 1996 home invasion on Staten Island.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 69-> Networks Battle Nielsen as Young Viewers Turn Up Missing
Reports of a drastic falloff in the 18- to 34-year-old television audience this season, costing the broadcast networks tens of millions of dollars, have touched off an angry debate between the networks and the company that provides the measurements they live by. Broadcasters' relations with Nielsen Media Research, always tense, have degenerated to the point where an NBC executive accused Nielsen of ''something approaching fraud'' for reporting that the young-adult viewing audience has plunged 6 percent this fall, compared with its level a year earlier. Nick Schiavone, the senior vice president of research for NBC, made that accusation in an interview on Friday in which he described Nielsen's measurements as seriously flawed. ''If we don't get an answer soon'' about how Nielsen intends to correct its data, Mr. Schiavone said, ''then they are in breach of their contract with us.'' With the economics of network television already at a crisis point, a reported decline in viewing by the young adults highly prized by advertisers has enormous financial implications. Mr. Schiavone estimated that NBC has lost $66 million in advertising revenue since September because of Nielsen's audience data. That loss comes at a time when NBC's profits are already in steep decline because of the departure of ''Seinfeld'' and the enormously inflated cost of other shows, like ''E.R'' and ''Mad About You.'' Nielsen's reports of a 6 percent decline in television viewing throughout the day by adults between the ages of 18 and 34 applies to all channels, not just network channels, both in broadcast and cable television. The latest data mean that the average young adult viewer is watching a little over half an hour less each day, according to Barry Cook, the senior vice president of research for Nielsen. The networks argue that such a drastic change in viewing habits is simply not plausible. But Nielsen, without venturing a reason for the shrinking audience, argues that a separate study it has conducted not only validates its initial findings but suggests that the falloff may be even worse -- as much as 10 percent. Mr. Cook dismissed the networks' accusations of flawed data. ''They are losing focus on what is happening,'' he said, citing what he described as a long-term trend line that shows diminishing viewing by younger adults that goes back to 1991. But Mr. Schiavone's contentions at NBC have been backed by research executives at the other networks, all of whom dispute Nielsen's findings as outside the realm of statistical probability. ''A change in viewing habits this radical just doesn't make sense,'' said Alan Wurtzel, the senior vice president of research for ABC Inc. Mr. Wurtzel noted that a similar problem in 1990, later corrected by Nielsen, wound up costing ABC $30 million. David F. Poltrack, the executive vice president of research for CBS, said, ''The problem with this is that even if Nielsen eventually corrects the problem, in the interim you're losing money, big money.'' One potential outcome of this dispute is renewed hope for a rival ratings service, Smart, which has been mounted on an experimental basis by Statistical Research Inc., a company based in Westfield, N.J., that is best known for measuring radio network audiences. Smart -- which stands for Systems for Measuring and Reporting Television -- is still seeking a partner with the financial power to establish a full-fledged national rating service to compete with Nielsen, which has held a monopoly on television measurement for most of the history of the medium. As a bit of evidence contradicting Nielsen's data, Mr. Poltrack cited results from the Smart experimental system now operating in Philadelphia. Smart's ratings there show a slight increase this fall among viewers in the 18-to-34 category. He also pointed to the fact that viewing levels for other age groups tracked by Nielsen have not demonstrated a comparable one-year collapse. Mr. Poltrack and other network research executives contend that the problem lies in Nielsen's methods. They say that young viewers are notoriously resistant to the daily button-pushing required in the Nielsen ''people meter'' system and argue that Nielsen has consistently had trouble keeping acceptable numbers of young adults willing to participate in its survey. The Smart system is designed to streamline the button pushing while also using program codes that automatically track each show that the television tunes in. But Mr. Cook, of Nielsen, said that this season's fall-off simply looked excessive when compared with an uptick in viewing reported by Nielsen last fall. And he suggested that last year may have actually been the the anomaly. He said a ''unified study'' that measured the same young viewers known to be in the Nielsen sample both last year and this year indicated a full 10 percent drop-off in television viewing in the 18-to-34 group. He declined to offer any theory for the dropoff. But he dismissed suggestions that it might be related to higher use of the Internet, because another Nielsen study had previously indicated that Internet users were already light viewers of television -- and so would not account for such a significant change from last fall. The network researchers attacked Mr. Cook's unified study, saying the sample included viewers who had been participants for as little as a single day in the month measured during both years and that it did not include the same number of viewers from one year to the next. Mr. Cook acknowledged that ''billions of dollars are at stake'' for the networks and for every television channel that sells commercial time in advance to advertisers. The sales are based on audience forecasts, and the networks have to give away free commercials to make up for any shortfalls. But Mr. Cook suggested that the networks should have made their estimates to advertisers on the basis of the longer-term trend, not on the uptick recorded last fall. He also noted that it was not surprising that NBC was leading the charge against Nielsen, because the network's ratings have taken a particularly precipitous fall this season -- 25 percent fewer households, compared with last year, he said. ''This is most alarming to some people who sold the audience ahead of time,'' Mr. Cook said. ''They should have hedged their promises.'' That suggestion only added fuel to the outrage among some of the network executives, who accused Nielsen of trying to glibly explain away a serious problem with its measurement methods. Among other things, Mr. Wurtzel noted that Nielsen's first response to network complaints earlier this month about younger men falling out of its survey was to suggest, in a letter sent to ABC, that the cause was lower interest rates for home buyers. (If more young people were moving, Nielsen argued, there was a higher rate of turnover in its sample.) NBC does clearly seem the most willing to take the fight with Nielsen to an active stage. Mr. Schiavone said the network intended to challenge Nielsen's credibility. He said the company may decide to file suit for breach of the network's $12-million-a-year contract with Nielsen, on grounds that the company is not conducting accurate measurements. And he said it was not out of the question that NBC might turn to Smart. ''If I put the $12 million we pay to them in with the $66 million we've lost, then paying $7 million for an alternate service starts to sound cheap to me,'' Mr. Schiavone said. A lawsuit is certainly more likely to come from NBC than from any other network. NBC, according to another senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was very close to filing a breach-of-contract suit against the ratings company in 1996. One thing NBC promises will not happen, Mr. Schiavone said, is a decision to shrug Nielsen off as a necessary evil. ''Every Nielsen client is a hostage assumed by the Nielsen management to be either stupid or forgetful,'' Mr. Schiavone said. ''Whether Nielsen is demonstrating active negligence or passive negligence, their actions are unforgivable.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 70-> PRO FOOTBALL; Broncos Have Plenty of Pop to Defeat the Patriots
The New England Patriots were under attack before the game even started. During pre-game ceremonies, a parachutist, aiming for near midfield, went crashing into the Patriots' bench, knocking over buckets of water, his parachute spilling into the stands. Then the real hits came. The Denver Broncos were leading by 10-0 in the second quarter when John Elway dumped off a pass to fullback Howard Griffith. Patriots linebacker Chris Slade was closing in for the tackle when Shannon Sharpe, Denver's Pro Bowl tight end, delivered a stunning block sure to make the highlight tapes. Sharpe hit Slade so hard, he knocked himself out of the game with a mild concussion as the 245-pound Slade was bounced clean off his feet. ''I didn't remember my name, I didn't know where I was, I didn't remember anything about the whole first half,'' Sharpe said. ''It was lights out.'' Sharpe was fine afterward, and he was alert enough to remember the final score: Broncos 27, Patriots 21. If there was any question that the Broncos would be complacent after beating Green Bay in last season's Super Bowl, there should not have been. The Broncos were not flawless, but they played smart, intense football before a raucous crowd of 74,745 at Mile High Stadium. The Patriots played one of their best offensive games in recent years, gaining 339 yards against one of the best defenses in the American Football Conference. While quarterback Drew Bledsoe (20 of 32 for 289 yards and two touchdowns) was under pressure all night (three sacks) and the Patriots could barely muster a running attack after losing Curtis Martin in the off season to the Jets, they were able to cut a 17-7 halftime deficit to 17-14. They did it on a 24-yard Troy Brown touchdown catch on their first possession of the second half. The Broncos responded with a 42-yard field goal by Jason Elam to increase their lead to 20-14 at the end of the third quarter. Then Elway, who flirted with retirement in the off season, worked his typical magic late in the game. Deep in New England territory, he threaded a pass to wide receiver Ed McCaffrey between three defenders. That put Denver at the 1-yard line. From there, running back Terrell Davis punched it in for his second touchdown of the night. The Broncos led, 27-14. ''I'm used to being on the other side of Elway sticking a dagger in your heart,'' said Broncos defensive end Neil Smith, who for years had many sleepless nights going against Elway when he played for Kansas City. ''It's fun to watch him do that to someone else.'' The Patriots were able to close the gap after an impressive 90-yard, 11-play drive in which Bledsoe showed that he was not so bad with a dagger himself. He zipped a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Brisby to make the score 27-21. But the Patriots' onside kick was recovered by Denver at the 40-yard line, and the Broncos ran out the clock. The Patriots had squandered all three of their second-half timeouts with 6 minutes 16 seconds remaining in the third quarter. ''That was a great team we played tonight,'' said Davis, who finished with 75 yards on 22 carries. ''They played hard and came with blitz packages we had not seen before.'' It is the fourth consecutive time a Mike Shanahan-coached team has beaten the Patriots and the 11th consecutive victory against New England here since 1968. The Broncos have also reeled off seven straight victories against A.F.C. East teams. Denver beating New England should have come as no surprise for a variety of reasons. Shanahan has worked his team hard both in the off season and in the preseason, making sure they aren't complacent. It worked as the Broncos took control of the game immediately, throwing to McCaffrey (7 catches for 97 yards) after a stutter step faked out the entire Patriots secondary. That one went for 44 yards and led to a 53-yard field goal by Elam. After the Patriots' Adam Vinatieri missed a 39-yard field goal, the Broncos later scored on a 12-yard pass from Elway to Sharpe for a 10-0 lead. Then Vinatieri had a 37-yard kick blocked by Trevor Pryce. Later in the game, Elway's scrambling acrobatics led to two catches by Rod Smith of 12 and 14 yards that put Denver on the 9. Davis scored from there, squeaking into the left corner of the end zone. Over all, Elway completed 22 of 34 passes for 257 yards with no interceptions. The Patriots scored after a 55-yard pass from Bledsoe to wide receiver Terry Glenn -- rookie running back Robert Edwards went in two plays later from the 1-yard line to make the score 17-7 at halftime -- but New England was still in a familiar, mile high haze. ''Somehow, we haven't been able to come up with a way to beat these guys,'' Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson said. ''They showed us things we weren't prepared for and beat us ways we weren't expecting.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 74-> Personal Health; Weighing the Pros and Cons of Hormone Therapy
MAKING an informed decision about whether to take replacement hormones during and after menopause is hard enough for women with no prior health problems. It is far more difficult for a woman who has had breast cancer or who has a strong family history of this most common cancer in women. Because estrogen can stimulate the growth of a breast cancer, women and their doctors are understandably reluctant to consider hormone replacement for someone at high risk of developing a new or recurrent cancer. But this means that such women may miss important health benefits of estrogen after menopause, among them a reduced risk of heart disease, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease as well as diminished menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. Last week's announcement that an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration is recommending approval of the drug tamoxifen to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer provides another, though imperfect, hormone replacement option for high-risk women. Though it has drawbacks, this so-called ''designer estrogen'' also offers women who take it an opportunity to glean some of the benefits of estrogen replacement, such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease But these questions remain: Can some former breast cancer patients safely take hormone replacements, and if so, which ones? Are there reasonable alternatives that will grant women at least some benefits of estrogen without adding to their concerns about developing a new or recurrent cancer? The answers concern 2.4 million American women, and millions more worldwide, who have survived breast cancer, as well as those at high risk of the disease. At a consensus conference last fall sponsored by The Hormone Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and others, experts and patient advocates concluded that treating menopausal symptoms and long-term health risks in breast cancer patients should be ''tailored to individual patients' needs'' and employ strategies that ''would avoid the use of estrogen while providing its benefits.'' Why Worry About Estrogen? Estrogen plays a critical role in the initiation and promotion of breast cancer. Many studies have shown that the longer a woman's breast is exposed to high levels of estrogen, the greater the chances of eventually getting breast cancer. The cells of most breast cancers have receptors for estrogen and respond to the hormone's growth-stimulating effects. Patients with these cancers are typically given treatments to block the effects of their own estrogens. Recent findings strongly suggest that this increased risk extends to postmenopausal women who take replacement hormones, either estrogen alone or estrogen with progestin (the latter is added to protect the uterine lining from estrogen's growth-stimulating effect). For each year that women take these hormones, the risk of developing breast cancer rises slightly, by roughly equal to the increase associated with a one-year delay in the onset of menopause. After 10 years on hormone replacement, according to the experience of 80,000 nurses, the increase in risk is about 30 percent. Further evidence of estrogen's influence on breast tissue comes from the effects of designer estrogens like tamoxifen. These substances act as weak estrogens and block the action of natural estrogen in some tissues. Tamoxifen has been shown to help prevent a new or recurrent breast cancer apparently by blocking the stimulating effects of natural estrogen on breast tissue. Early evidence presented recently shows a similar effect by a second designer estrogen, the bone-building drug raloxifene. The Choices Though not ideal substitutes for the real thing, designer estrogens offer high-risk women some estrogen benefits. Tamoxifen, for example, does reduce cardiac risk, but not to the extent that estrogen does. But tamoxifen, like estrogen, also stimulates cell growth in the uterus and increases the risk of uterine cancer. Raloxifene, marketed as Evista to help prevent osteoporosis, also has some of estrogen's cardiovascular benefits and, unlike tamoxifen, it does not stimulate uterine cell growth. Ongoing research should lead to the development of better designer estrogens, perhaps one that protects the heart, bones and brain as well as the breast and uterus and diminishes menopausal symptoms. Meanwhile, what are the options for a menopausal woman who has had breast cancer or is at high risk of getting it? First and foremost, she needs to adopt the healthy habits known to or strongly suspected of reducing the risk of heart disease, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. This familiar list includes quitting smoking; achieving and maintaining a normal body weight; doing regular weight-bearing exercise like brisk walking or strength training; reducing consumption of meat and dairy fat, sugars and refined starches; and eating more vegetables, whole grains, beans and fish. Also, a postmenopausal woman, even if she takes hormones, should consume at least 1,500 milligrams of calcium a day (from nonfat dairy products like yogurt and skim milk, calcium-rich vegetables and calcium-enriched orange juice supplemented, if needed, by calcium tablets). She might also take a daily supplement of vitamin E (200 to 800 international units, to protect against heart disease and Alzheimer's disease) and vitamin D (to bring her daily total to 800 international units, for proper absorption and use of calcium). The Soy Story Many menopausal women have recently turned to the lowly soybean as a substitute for replacement hormones, but the jury is still out on how effective it is. Soy contains weak estrogens called isoflavones, which may mimic some of the effects of natural estrogen. Despite glowing testimonials for soy foods like tofu, tempeh, soy milk and soy-based candy bars, properly designed studies have found that soy is only slightly more effective than a look-alike placebo in controlling hot flashes, a common and easily assessed symptom of menopause. Researchers suspect that soy may help some women substantially, others slightly and still others not at all. Still, experts say soy is worth a try for women with bothersome symptoms. But, when it comes to the long-term benefits of natural estrogen, the data on soy are preliminary, findings are inconsistent and the amount of soy needed to gain significant benefit is far more than American women are likely to consume. Dr. Mark Messina of Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, Calif., who consults for the soy industry, said the ability of soy to protect against breast cancer, osteoporosis and heart disease is at best speculative. If there is an effect on breast cancer risk, it most likely operates during the teen and young adult years rather than after menopause, when a woman's own estrogen production is minimal. Most researchers believe that soy consumption is not the primary reasons Asian women have much lower rates of breast cancer than American women do.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 77-> Abroad at Home; A Dangerous Invitation
Some Republicans have been saying that moderates might vote against impeachment if only President Clinton would admit that he lied. But it is not so simple. For the President to say that he knowingly made false statements might well put him in greater jeopardy of impeachment -- and in due course, of criminal prosecution. Kenneth Starr did not use the word ''perjury'' in telling the House of Representatives that there were 11 possible grounds for impeaching the President. Neither did David P. Schippers, counsel to the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry, when he expanded the list to 16. The committee went up a notch to perjury. Three of its four articles of impeachment charge the President with ''perjurious'' statements: in his testimony to the grand jury, in his deposition in the Paula Jones case and in his answers to the 81 questions put to him by the committee. Perjury is defined by title 18 of the United States Code, section 1621, as stating ''willfully'' under oath ''any material matter'' that the person ''does not believe to be true.'' To violate that law, then, a person must know when he testifies that his statement is untrue, deliberately violating his oath. Mr. Clinton has said that his Jones deposition testimony was ''difficult and ambiguous and unhelpful'' -- but that he did not believe he was lying when he said he had not had ''sexual relations'' with Monica Lewinsky because what they did was not within the judge's definition of ''sexual relations.'' And, he said this week, ''I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not do.'' If he now said that he knew his testimony was false when he gave it, would that lead some moderate Republicans to vote against impeachment? He certainly cannot count on it. To my knowledge, no moderate Republican has actually undertaken to oppose impeachment if Mr. Clinton says he lied. The ultra-conservatives who are driving the impeachment process might well use any such admission in the opposite way: to argue that President Clinton should be impeached because he is an admitted perjurer. The same is true of the other counts charging ''perjurious'' statements. Any admission by the President might intensify the right-wing attack. Many criminal lawyers think the President's statements would not support a prosecution for perjury. Two Republican and two Democratic prosecutors told the Judiciary Committee that the prospects were too dim even to launch a prosecution. But if the President now admitted a knowing falsehood, that admission would probably be admissible in evidence against him if in future he is prosecuted for perjury. And I think Kenneth Starr will bring such a prosecution -- staying in office until after Jan. 20, 2001, if necessary. It is often said that the President should not be above the law. But in this case he has been, and is, under disadvantages that would never be suffered by any ordinary citizen. No ordinary citizen would be hunted by a prosecutor with no limit of time or money -- one who, after failing to find reason to prosecute serious crimes after years of investigation, trapped him in an attempt to conceal wrongful consensual sex. No ordinary citizen who is a prosecutor's target would effectively be forced to testify to a grand jury despite the jeopardy of self-incrimination. No ordinary citizen would then be asked 81 questions that would put him in peril however he answered: guilty of perjury if he admitted past lies, guilty in the denials if he denied them. No ordinary citizen would face an indictment that made sweeping charges of perjury without identifying the supposedly perjurious statements, as is the case with the impeachment articles. And no ordinary citizen would face a prosecution reeking of ideological zealotry and a desire for vengeance. Perhaps Republicans can still work out a rational agreement with the President to rebuke him for his wrongdoing without putting him and the country to a trial in the Senate. But short of that, we can hardly expect him to commit legal suicide.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 79-> Quest for Frozen Pandemic Virus Yields Mixed Results
DIGGING in a cemetery on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen, Norway, medical scientists found the seven coffins they were looking for, but the coffins lay in shallow graves, which was not what they wanted to find. They had hoped they would be six feet deep, in permafrost, where the bodies would still be frozen and well preserved 80 years after dying in the terrible influenza pandemic of 1918. The scientists would not describe the condition of the seven bodies after years of seasonal freezing and thawing. But they said the victims, young coal miners, appeared to have been buried in haste, probably out of fear of the contagion that had claimed their lives. Their bodies had been buried without clothes, wrapped only in newspapers. The graves were no more than three feet deep, above the permafrost line. Even so, members of the exhumation project said last week that they got what they came for: samples of tissues from six of the flu victims (they did not have permission to sample the seventh). They denied earlier published reports that the coffins contained only bones and no retrievable tissue specimens. Dr. Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian medical geographer who directs the project, said the pathologists were able to get more than 100 soft tissue samples, including several from the lungs. Biologists will be examining the lung tissues in particular for traces of the mysterious flu virus that killed more than 20 million people worldwide in 1918 and early 1919. They are looking for clues to why that contagion was so much more virulent and lethal than any flu virus before or since. ''We got good stuff, really good stuff,'' Dr. Duncan, a professor at the universities of Windsor and Toronto, said in an interview by telephone from her office in Toronto. ''Virologists on the team are very hopeful.'' Dr. Robert Webster, a member of the team who is a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, reacted more cautiously. ''The samples were not exactly what we thought we were going to get,'' he said in an interview. ''How much we're going to find out from them remains to be seen.'' Research over the last five years by Dr. Duncan had pinpointed these seven graves in Longyearbyen -- the principal community on the island of Spitsbergen, some 700 miles from the North Pole -- as the most promising place to look for well-preserved specimens of the 1918 virus. With new techniques in molecular biology and genetics, perhaps such long-frozen specimens could now reveal why that virus was one of the most lethal organisms that ever attacked humans. The knowledge might then help fight future outbreaks. The state of the specimens has not altered the overall plans for laboratory testing. The samples are being shipped to London for the first round of analysis by scientists at the National Institute of Medical Research and the London Hospital Medical College. Specimens will later be distributed to scientists in Canada, the United States and Norway. Scientists said they could know in three months if the samples are likely to yield significant results, after which they might spend another three years on further analysis. ''It will be harder work than if the tissues had been frozen,'' Dr. Webster said, explaining that the degraded tissues probably contain only scraps from the genetic material of the flu virus, which may present problems in reconstructing the structure of genes critical to the virus's infectious behavior. ''We might get less out of the samples than we initially hoped,'' he added. Dr. Webster said the lung tissues would probably be the most useful, because flu viruses spread by infiltrating the cells lining the respiratory system and thus should have left traces there. They were not able to take lung samples from all six bodies, he said. This suggests some bodies were badly decomposed. Some samples were also taken from other organs. Researchers have speculated that the 1918 variant of the flu virus might have been especially virulent if it somehow attacked throughout the body, not just in the respiratory system. Dr. Charles R. Smith, the project's pathologist and a forensic pathologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, said he wanted to extract brain tissues to investigate any possible relationship between the 1918 flu and the widespread incidence of sleeping sickness in the 1920's. The scientists said they were confident that the exhumed bodies were those they were looking for. The bodies were clearly once strapping young men. The seven victims were 18 to 29 years old when they came to Spitsbergen from the Norwegian mainland to work in the coal mines, but they contracted flu on the boat. All of them died in the first week of October, at the height of the global pandemic. Surveys with ground-penetrating radar had led the team to think the coffins were six feet deep. The radar detects differences in subsurface densities and textures, indicative of disturbed conditions or buried objects. In this case, suggested Dr. Duncan, the team leader, the gravediggers in 1918 might have used dynamite to break up the permafrost down to six feet below the surface, which would have left radar traces of disturbed ground at that depth. Then, in haste, they might have buried the coffins in shallow graves without clearing out the dynamited rubble. The Spitsbergen exhumations are only part of a quickening scientific quest to identify the 1918 flu virus and determine its lethal power. The team that has made the most progress is led by Dr. Jeffrey K. Taubenberger, a biologist at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington. Ann Reid, a molecular biologist working with Dr. Taubenberger, said Friday that the team had completed a significant step in understanding the 1918 flu virus by decoding the sequence of units composing one of its important genes. This is the he-magglutinin gene, which directs the production of proteins that enable the flu virus to attach itself to a cell in the respiratory system. Ms. Reid said that the decoding of a second critical component of the virus, the neuraminidase gene, may be completed in two or three months. Neuraminidase is the substance that enables the virus to penetrate a cell and, like a parasite, to use its new home for making more viruses that spread to invade more cells -- and leave a person miserable with the chills and aches of flu. An understanding of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase is central to preventing and fighting flu. When attacked by flu or in response to flu vaccines, the body's natural immune system produces antibodies that cover the outer part of the virus, disabling the virus's mechanisms for invading cells. Asked if the genetic decoding of the 1918 virus had revealed anything to make it clear why it was such an unusually deadly strain, Ms. Reid said, ''Nothing I would call a smoking gun.'' So far, she added, it appeared to be similar to a swine flu virus isolated in 1930. The research by Dr. Taubenberger and Ms. Reid is based on tissue specimens preserved from two American soldiers who died in 1918 and from an Alaskan woman whose well-preserved body was exhumed last year. Tissues from another American flu victim, also a soldier, are being scrutinized because he died in the summer of 1918. ''There was an outbreak in the spring that year, and then something took place in that summer that made the virus more lethal,'' Ms. Reid said. ''Maybe this will give us a clue.'' Two researchers at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine in Madison have also looked into possible reasons that some flu strains are more deadly than others. Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Dr. Hideo Goto, whose work was described in the Aug. 18 issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studied a laboratory-altered virus descended from the 1918 strain. They identified a molecular mechanism involving neuraminidase that jump-starts hemagglutinin replication and could be a means, they wrote, ''by which influenza viruses, and perhaps other viruses as well, could become highly pathogenic in humans.'' Dr. Taubenberg called the new findings ''another potential explanation of the virulence of the 1918 flu'' that needs to be explored.

Dec. 31, 1998-> 80-> HOCKEY; It's None Too Pretty, but the Devils Will Gladly Take It
The Devils had already missed on a penalty shot in the first period and had given away a goal on an unforced turnover in the final seconds of the second period. And in the final seconds of the game, Brian Rolston skated into the Washington Capitals' zone and stared down an empty net. When he got off his shot, it ricocheted off the post and headed the other way as the Capitals mounted one final threat. A shot was deflected away and as the bodies and the puck were cleared from in front of the New Jersey net, the Devils had survived for a 3-2 victory over the Capitals at the MCI Center. Just how they could be high-fiving after a game that included these sorts of mistakes had even the Devils at a loss to explain. ''We had some breakdowns,'' goalie Martin Brodeur said. ''But we played pretty good and luck was on our side all the way through. We never got behind in the game and that makes a big difference. When it was 1-1 and 2-2, I made saves and we were able to come back.'' The victory sent the Devils into the new year with a 21-9-4 record and an Eastern Conference-best 46 points. It also gave them a 2-0 record on a three-game road swing that concludes in Ottawa on Saturday. ''I certainly didn't mean to miss the empty net,'' Rolston said. ''When it comes back on the other end and they almost got a good shot there, you have to really think about it.'' Bobby Holik, who has been the hottest player in the National Hockey League in December with league bests of 12 goals and 18 points, gave the Devils the lead at 7 minutes 14 seconds of the third period. Dave Andreychuk directed a pass through traffic to Holik, skating alone near center ice along the left boards. Holik skated in, faked a pass to his rear that held the defenders and then slipped the puck around goalie Rick Tabaracci. The Devils never trailed, but had seen the Capitals match them every time they scored in the first two periods. The Capitals entered this game missing six players, including Adam Oates, but their spirit, which may have been broken in the second period, was resurrected when the Devils gave away the tying goal. With a 2-1 lead after a short-handed goal by Rolston, with help from Vadim Sharifijanov, the Devils had killed off a five-on-three power play for two minutes, frustrating the Capitals. And now they were just trying to play the final seconds of the second period when Scott Stevens picked up a puck alone behind his own net. But as Stevens attempted to send the puck back out of the Devils' zone, Peter Bondra closed in from behind, and in a rush Stevens inadvertently directed it right to the stick of Washington's Steve Konowalchuk, who was alone inside the blue line. Konowalchuk fired immediately and Brodeur stopped the slap shot's initial thrust, but the puck trickled softly and slowly behind him. As he tried to dive back in vain, he collided with Sheldon Souray and the puck just went over the line to tie the score at 2-2 with 14.7 seconds left in the period. The Devils jumped out in front at 7:36 of the opening period with Sharifijanov converting a pretty wrap-around goal. But the Capitals tied the score on a two-on-one break after Bondra cleared the puck to center ice, with Konowalchuk swooping in from the right side and swinging to the left, then feeding Michal Pivonka as he darted to the right post and one-timed the shot over Brodeur. The Devils squandered an opportunity to take a lead when Jay Pandolfo took off on a breakaway at 14:20 of the first period. Pandolfo was taken down from behind by Dmitri Mironov and awarded a penalty shot. But as he faked left and then tried to slip the puck into the right side of the net, Tabaracci, who did not fall for the fake, forced him to shoot wide right.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 81-> Scandals Cool Japan's Democratic Party
What has happened to Japan's Democratic Party? Just two months ago, the country's largest opposition party and its dynamic leader, Naoto Kan, were ascendant. Voters handed them the ability to control the upper house of Parliament in June, and they united with other parties to thwart the governing party on several fronts. Now, though, Mr. Kan and his Democrats have been flattened by scandals, dithering and internal dissension. Some opposition partners have abandoned them and made deals with the governing Liberal Democratic Party. And just last month, Ichiro Ozawa and his Liberal Party turned from friend to foe, signing a tentative agreement to form a coalition with the governing party that will greatly frustrate the Democratic Party's ability to hold legislation hostage to its demands, its most potent weapon. ''Popular support for the Democratic Party is on the decline -- they have no clear strategy and there's the whiff of scandal about them,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political science professor at Tokyo University. Even Yukio Hatoyama, Mr. Kan's deputy, is feeling glum. ''We pushed too hard right after the election,'' he said in an interview. ''There are a lot of things for which we owe hansei'' -- a word that can mean reflection, contrition or self-examination. He blamed his party for stealing too much of the thunder when the opposition successfully forced Democratic plans for fixing the banking system into law in September, the first time legislation has been crafted by legislators rather than bureaucrats. He said the party should have shared credit with its partners. ''We pushed the Liberal Party from us toward the L.D.P.,'' Mr. Hatoyama said. ''We rejoiced too much when we were successful in getting the banking law passed.'' Contrite as he may be, Mr. Hatoyama is confident that if a general election were called today, his party would score big. He calculates that the Democrats would win 170 seats in the powerful 500-seat lower house, an estimate the governing party does not dispute, and Komeito, the second-largest opposition group, would probably win 50. That is not enough to secure a majority, but it would probably rob the governing party of its grip on the powerful Lower House. But the Democratic Party has so far fielded candidates for less than half the seats that Mr. Hatoyama expects to win, and general elections must be held by October 2000, although most expect them next year. Moreover, the party's most prominent representative, Mr. Kan, is mired in a sex scandal that threatens to shake his bedrock support among women. He began his political career by managing the parliamentary campaign of one of Japan's leading feminists. But a conservative weekly magazine has asserted that Mr. Kan spent the night in a hotel room with a former television anchor, a woman 20 years his junior who has been a consultant to the Democratic Party. Mr. Kan denied the story, but in an extensive interview published recently, he conceded that his actions could have been misconstrued. The scandal is being blamed for a significant drop in the Democrats' popularity. A recent poll taken by the Kyodo News Service showed support for Mr. Kan's party at 16.8 percent of the 1,911 respondents, a drop of 6 percentage points since September. The governing party gained the favor of those the Democrats lost, with its support level rising 6.1 percentage points, to 32.5 percent. The sex scandal followed news reports asserting that Mr. Kan had accepted a $4.2 million payoff from Hiromu Nonaka, the powerful chief Cabinet secretary and a senior member of the governing party, to guarantee the passage of legislation to overhaul the banking system. Mr. Kan has also denied that accusation, and Mr. Hatoyama said both scandals were cooked up by Liberal Democrats frightened by the prospect of an opposition party with real teeth. Traditionally, Japanese opposition parties have been little more than opposition voices, offering little in the way of alternative policies. But the Democrats do offer distinctly different views on national security, electoral reform and fiscal policy, giving voters a clear choice. Many suspect that there are divisions within the party about how vigorously those policies should be pursued. Mr. Kan was reportedly angry with Mr. Hatoyama for refusing to yield on banking reform, arguing that the hard-line stance would give the governing party the opportunity to blame the Democrats for holding up legislation while the world was pressing Japan to move quickly.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 82-> WINTER SPORTS: ROUNDUP; Maier Dominates in the Fog and Rain
SUPER-G The Olympic champion Hermann Maier won for the first time since the start of the season, capturing a men's World Cup super-G yesterday in fog and drizzle in Val D'Isere, France. Maier, who was in an early-season slump after winning the inaugural giant slalom in October, rebounded from 36th place in Saturday's downhill to claim his 13th career World Cup victory. It was another dominating performance from Maier, who charged down the course in 1 minute 18.73 seconds, more than a second ahead of his nearest rival and teammate, Stephan Eberharter, who was second in 1:19.91. It was once again a good race starting with the No. 8 bib, said Maier, who has always been superstitious about starting eighth, and won both the Olympic super-G and giant slalom titles from that position. CROSS-COUNTRY Daehlie Reaches Top Bjorn Daehlie moved atop the World Cup cross-country skiing standing yesterday by dominating a 15-kilometer classical race in Dobbiaco, Italy, for a second straight victory. The Norwegian finished the race in 38 minutes 30.5 seconds to beat his countryman Espen Bjervig by eight seconds. Jari Isometsa of Finland was third in 38:39.3. Bente Martinsen, another Norwegian, stormed to an easy victory in the women's 10-kilometer event, beating the runnerup, Nina Gavriljuk of Russia, by nearly 25 seconds. Mathias Fredriksson of Sweden -- seventh yesterday in 38:57.3 -- dropped out of the top spot and is now second over all with 231 points. Per Elofsson is next with 202. NORDIC COMBINED Norwegian Cruises The Olympic champion Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway shook off Finland's World Cup leader, Hannu Manninen, in the final half-kilometer yesterday and went on to win a 15-kilometer Nordic combined World Cup event in Steamboat Springs, Colo. Vik, sixth in the 112-meter jumping Saturday, finished 15.4 seconds ahead of Manninen, who was third in the jumping. SPEEDSKATING Sweep Is Prevented A minor mishap kept the Olympic gold medalist Catriona LeMay Doan of Canada from sweeping the women's sprints yesterday at the World Cup speedskating competition in Nagano, Japan, opening the way for Tonny de Jong of the Netherlands. In the 1,000-meter event, LeMay Doan was forced to slow down to let Eriko Sanmiya of Japan switch into the outside lane. Sanmiya acknowledged she was at fault, but no complaint was filed by the Canadians with the organizers over the mishap.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 83-> Advancing On Line
To the Editor: The article ''Soaring Prices Spur a Revolt in Scientific Publishing'' on Dec. 8, did not mention the main force changing academic publishing: the Internet. In many fields, research is published first on the Internet, in the form of preprints and technical reports posted to scientists' Web sites. By the time an article is published on paper it is often already old news. Academic journals serve important roles as archivers, editors and enforcers of academic standards. But these functions can be replaced by on-line publishing, cheaper and more efficiently. NELSON MINAR Cambridge, Mass.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 84-> Sports of The Times; The Sacking of Marino in the 6th Borough
FOR a pass rusher, trying to sack Dan Marino isn't much different from trying to knock the gun out of a mugger's hand while the trigger is being pulled. But it can be done. And last night the Jets did it five times. Marino would complete 30 of 57 passes for 321 yards, but with less than two minutes remaining, Ernie Logan not only sacked the Dolphins' 37-year-old quarterback, but also stripped the ball. Chad Cascadden scooped it up and hurried 23 yards for the clinching touchdown in the 21-16 victory that assured the first-place Jets of at least a wild-card berth in the Super Bowl XXXIII tournament. ''It's a new one for me,'' Cascadden said of his touchdown. I've never been there before.'' And if the Jets defeat the Bills at Buffalo on Saturday afternoon, they will be where they have not been since the 1970 merger realignment -- atop the American Football Conference East when the playoffs begin on the weekend of Jan. 2-3. ''We had a wonderful defensive scheme,'' linebacker Bryan Cox said. ''We did some blitzing, we had some three-man rushes. We did a good job on third down.'' Midway in the second quarter, Cox burst between the Dolphins' pass blockers, slammed Marino into the green grass for an 8-yard sack on third down, leaped high, waved his arms at all those ''Dolfans'' in Pro Player Stadium and tap-danced to the Jets' sideline. The Dolfans weren't waving back, but the Jet fans were. Whenever the Jets or any New York team is on display here among the palm trees, several thousand New York expatriates turn Miami into the sixth borough. Cox was delighted at the Dolfans' silence. Three seasons ago he was Miami's most exciting linebacker, but he was also their most excitable linebacker. When the 1995 season ended, and Don Shula decided to stop coaching, Cox decided, he has said, to depart as a free agent out of loyalty to Shula. Others wondered if Jimmy Johnson, imported to succeed Shula, would have wanted Cox, who moved to the Bears for two tempestuous seasons before Bill Parcells hired him last summer after Marvin Jones was lost for the season because of a damaged knee. Whatever the reason for Cox's departure, he appeared to be playing about a foot off the ground in harassing Marino last night. Despite being double-teamed on a third-and-3 during the third quarter, Cox used his left arm to deflect one of Marino's bullets. Asked if he enjoyed haunting the Dolphins, Cox shrugged. ''Not really,'' he said. ''I'm just glad I'm playing for a coach that understands players.'' Parcells, meanwhile, was glad for his pass rushers, who harassed and hurried Marino. ''Our pass rush is underrated,'' the coach said. ''As a group, I think we're pretty good.'' In addition to the Cox and Logan sacks, linebackers Mo Lewis and Cascadden soon collaborated on another. In the second half, defensive tackle Jason Ferguson and linebacker Pepper Johnson each knocked the gun out of Marino's hand. Until last night, Marino had been sacked only 16 times this season, including a high of three in one game by the Jets (in their earlier 20-9 victory), the Patriots and the Bills. Over the years, Miami has often been a nice place for the Jets to visit. Miami is where the 1968 Jets fulfilled Joe Namath's ''guarantee'' in Super Bowl III. Miami is where the 1982 Jets got stuck in the mud against the Dolphins in the American Conference championship game, alias the strange case of the missing tarpaulin. Miami is where Raul Allegre's overtime field goal lifted the 1991 Jets into the playoffs in their season finale. And last night, Miami is where the 1998 Jets were playing the Dolphins for first place in the A.F.C. East. In each of these crossroad games, palm trees swayed in the breeze -- outside the Orange Bowl for Super Bowl III and the muddy A.F.C. championship game, outside Pro Player Stadium for Allegre's field goal and, last night, for Parcells's stomping on the sideline. The story line of each game has mirrored the various emotions of Jets' history: celebration, frustration, expectation, and aspiration. All season Parcells has talked about aspiring ''to get there,'' meaning the playoffs. He would prefer to get there with a bye through the wild-card weekend into the divisional playoffs. ''It was a tough game on both sides'' Parcells said, ''but we finally put them away. That puts us in the tournament.'' And if the Jets were somehow to get through the A.F.C. playoffs to Super Bowl XXXIII, they would be down here again in the sixth borough.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 85-> PLUS: GOLF; Woods to Play Match-Play Event
Tiger Woods will join Mark O'Meara, Vijay Singh and Ernie Els in the field for next month's world match-play championship in Wentworth, England. Woods, who will be a partner of O'Meara's on the United States team at the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews the previous week, was confirmed as a starter yesterday. O'Meara, who won the British Open and the Masters; Singh, the defending world match-play champion and winner of the P.G.A. Championship, and Woods are expected to be among the top four seeded players, who will automatically qualify into the second round of the tournament. Els is a three-time world match-play champion. He was beaten by Singh in last year's final.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 86-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; For Clinton, a Vacation With No Golf, No Sailing, No Parties, No Kennedys
Some vacation. President Clinton fled Washington on Tuesday after the most excruciating day of his public life, seeking solace and solitude on Martha's Vineyard. But instead of the relaxation he had found on previous summer vacations on the island, this time he confronted the unpleasant job of trying to repair the damage done to his marriage by his now painfully public affair with a young White House intern. Meanwhile, his staff in Washington was trying to find a way to heal the breach of trust with the public from his Monday night revelations. And the opinion industry was debating whether Mr. Clinton was the first figure in history to try to obstruct justice with a necktie. Then, in the small hours of Thursday morning, he gave the final order to launch 75 cruise missiles against terrorist targets in the Sudan and Afghanistan. President once again, and not just the prodigal husband in the doghouse and supplicant for national absolution, Mr. Clinton donned a deep blue suit and flew back to Washington to oversee the aftermath of the attacks. He could concentrate on bomb damage assessment rather than on personal and political damage control. The President Is 'Pooped' Mr. Clinton returned to the Vineyard on Friday night, spent a quiet evening at home and slept late today. The President is ''pooped,'' said his press secretary, Michael D. McCurry. ''He's had a long week,'' Mr. McCurry said. Except for a quiet birthday dinner with Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and his wife, Ann, on Wednesday, the Clintons have not ventured from their borrowed estate on Oyster Pond on the south shore of the island. No golf, no sailing, no parties, no Kennedys. ''The President had a very busy week and a somewhat stressful week,'' Mr. McCurry said today. ''He's had a lot on his mind this week on multiple fronts. Today is the day he's finally doing what he came up here to do, which is relax and enjoy himself a bit. He is definitely in vacation mode.'' As for the family fence-mending that is on the President's agenda for this vacation, Mr. McCurry said, ''he is working at it.'' ''My guess is they still have work to do,'' Mr. McCurry said. But, he added, ''they are doing it in private and I'm not going to give you a play-by-play account.'' The First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was described by friends as embarrassed and humiliated by her husband's extracurricular behavior and the damage he has done to his Presidency. No one outside the family really knows what is going on inside the walls of the summer White House. But a close friend of the President's who has witnessed previous family crises said that Clintonian family ''healing'' is a quiet affair, with a somewhat sheepish President and a frosty First Lady warily circling each other, waiting for an opportunity to engage. As the Clintons left the White House on Tuesday, their daughter, Chelsea, walked between her father and mother, holding each by the hand. Isolated in the Vineyard In his address on Monday night, Mr. Clinton said he was ''prepared to do whatever it takes'' to atone to his family. It is not yet known what that will be, but The early evidence is that Mr. Clinton is being kept on a tight leash on the island. Prominent summer residents who have socialized with the Clintons in past summers have not yet heard from them and none will say they are prepared to call the First Family, given the circumstances. ''I don't sense there's a feeling among people that he's persona non grata or a pariah or anything else,'' said Ron Rappaport, a Vineyard native who has attended parties with the Clintons. ''I think he's a welcome visitor who needs his vacation and needs his space.'' There may be a reason the Clintons have been reluctant to venture out. Virtually everyone here with access to a word processor and an op-ed page has hashed over the President's behavior in the past seven months. Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist who has skewered the President repeatedly this year, does not expect to be invited to any events involving the Clintons. ''For some strange reason,'' Mr. Feiffer said, ''he doesn't come near me.'' Alan Dershowitz, lawyer and author, had the chutzpah to show up at the airport to greet the Clintons on Tuesday, even though he has second-guessed Mr. Clinton's response to the Starr investigation in several opinion articles. ''I was there for one reason, to show I'm not a fair-weather friend,'' Mr. Dershowitz said. ''I've been somewhat critical of the President in print. I've not followed the White House line. I don't think he should be impeached, but I don't agree with everything he's done.'' A Word in a Puzzle Given that kind of support, it is not surprising that Mr. Clinton is lying low, reading thrillers and working crossword puzzles. But even the puzzles do not provide a complete respite. As Mr. Clinton was flying to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday doing the crossword puzzle in The New York Times at warp speed, as is his wont, he was stopped cold by clue 46 down. ''Meal for the humble?'' read the clue, calling for a four-letter answer. The President laughed ''in a bemused way,'' said an aide sitting nearby. ''Here's one appropriate for today,'' the President said, and inked in the answer, ''Crow.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 87-> OLYMPICS; Perquisites And Total Autonomy
The International Olympic Committee has 102 male members and 12 female members. It has princesses, princes and a sheik. It has four generals from Africa, two brothers from Mexico and a lot more bona fide businessmen and lawyers from all corners of the world than bona fide Olympic heroes like the French skier Jean-Claude Killy, the Dutch judo athlete Anton Geesink and the Czech gymnast Vera Caslavska. It also has a potentially serious problem. It is under internal and external scrutiny because of allegations of bribery in the awarding of the Games to host cities, and though the I.O.C. has never been eager to allow more than glimpses into its workings, curiosity is now rising rapidly. Just what is the I.O.C.? How does one become a member? How does one become an influential member? And who are the members of this organization that has existed since June 1894, when Baron Pierre de Coubertin called a meeting in a Paris auditorium appropriately decorated with neo-classical murals? The I.O.C., which calls itself ''the supreme authority of the Olympic movement,'' runs the Summer and Winter Olympics; most significant, it chooses the host cities, decides which sports will be included and negotiates the television contracts and sponsorship deals that pay for it all. NBC will pay $3.5 billion to broadcast all the Games from 2000 to 2008, money that will finance the nonprofit I.O.C. and also, through subsidies handed out by the I.O.C., go to sports federations and commissions around the world. Only two members are Americans: Anita DeFrantz, a sports administrator and former Olympic rower, who is the highest-ranking woman in an organization that did not elect women until 1981, and James L. Easton, a sporting goods manufacturer and president of the International Archery Federation. Italy, with nowhere near the population or commercial clout of the United States, has four members. They include Ottavio Cinquanta, president of the International Skating Union; Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, and Mario Pescante, who recently resigned as president of the Italian Olympic Committee because of a scandal involving a discredited drug-testing laboratory in Rome but remains a perquisite-enjoying member of the I.O.C. And there are perquisites: first-class flights to, and first-class treatment in, the cities that bid for the Olympics every two years; choice seats and choice lodging at the Olympics themselves, and at least one annual meeting, called ''the session,'' in a major city that rarely represents a hardship journey. Though their travel and I.O.C. business expenses are reimbursed, members do not receive salaries. They are volunteers, if remarkably coddled ones, and even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Spaniard who has been president for the last 18 years, does not receive a paycheck for his work, although his life style in Lausanne, Switzerland, the I.O.C.'s base of operations, is undeniably pleasant. De Coubertin moved the I.O.C. to neutral Switzerland from France in April 1915 in the midst of World War I. It remains in Lausanne because Samaranch decided to keep it there after becoming president in 1980, despite offers from Paris, Madrid, Samaranch's native Barcelona and another Swiss city, Zurich. The I.O.C. has its headquarters in the Chateau de Vidy, which is on the shores of Lake Geneva. The Chateau is hardly as grandiose as its name suggests: there is a trailer park across the street, and a public park surrounding the headquarters is routinely filled with joggers, bikers and Olympic tourists hoping to get a glimpse of Samaranch as he emerges from his Mercedes. (The German automaker is an official sponsor of the I.O.C.) There is no clear track to becoming a full-fledged I.O.C. member. A handful of international federation presidents, like Cinquanta and Nebiolo, hold their seats for as long as they remain in office in their federations. Some members, like Gerhard Heiberg of Norway and Killy of France, have joined the organization after running successful Winter Olympic organizing committees. Heiberg headed the Lillehammer Games in 1994; Killy was co-chairman of the Albertville Games in 1992. Alex Gilady of Israel joined after helping NBC negotiate television contracts. Shamil Tarpishev of Russia was once Boris Yeltsin's private tennis coach and later became minister of sport in Russia. Prince Albert of Monaco is a former Olympic bobsledder and provides a bit of glitter for Samaranch, a former diplomat who still has a weakness for aristocrats and holds the title of marquis himself. Other royal members include Princess Anne of Britain, no Samaranch fan; Prince Faisal Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, and Prince Henri of Luxembourg and the crown prince of the Netherlands, who became members in February. There is no official nomination process from outside for new members, although the Soviets did once essentially impose a member, Konstantin Andrianov, in 1951. The I.O.C. relishes its independence -- it was one of de Coubertin's primary concerns, because he believed the ancient games had been destroyed by outside influences -- and the Olympic charter states that I.O.C. members are ''its representatives in their respective countries and not delegates of their countries within the I.O.C.'' ''It's true that the I.O.C. has always seemed very anachronistic,'' said Maurice Herzog of France, an honorary member who retired in 1994 after 24 years on the I.O.C. ''It lives among itself. The members are like cardinals in the Vatican. Governments come and go, it doesn't matter to us.'' Of the 114 current members, 48 are from Europe, 21 from the Americas, 20 from Africa, 20 from Asia and 5 from Oceania. ''We function as a state,'' Samaranch said. ''We have a president, a government in the form of the executive board, a parliament in the form of the general membership and an administration which is rather youthful and works well.'' The executive board, known within the I.O.C. as the E. B. and created in 1921, is essentially the organization's board of directors. Composed of 11 members, including Samaranch and four vice presidents, it meets four times a year and manages the I.O.C.'s affairs, overseeing finances, presenting any proposal for rule or bylaw changes at the annual meeting and, perhaps most important, deciding which new members to propose to the membership as a whole. These new members are generally approved by acclamation and not by a formal vote, which is a clear indication of Samaranch's and the executive board's influence. Executive board members are elected at the annual meeting in a secret ballot. Terms last four years, and the current executive board includes long-influential members like Dick Pound of Canada; Pal Schmitt of Hungary; Judge Keba Mbaye of Senegal; Kevan Gosper of Australia; Kim Un Yong of South Korea, a former embassy intelligence officer and head of the World Taekwondo Federation, and Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who made a series of allegations about corruption in the Olympic site-awarding process at an executive board meeting in Lausanne this month. DeFrantz is also on the board, as are two increasingly prominent Europeans and former Olympians: Thomas Bach of Germany and Jacques Rogge of Belgium. The average age of I.O.C. members is 61 1/2 years, although members may now serve until they turn 80, thanks to Samaranch, now 78, who successfully raised the mandatory retirement age from 75 so he could run for a fourth term as president. Four men are life members, including Hodler and the former FIFA president and I.O.C. doyen Joao Havelange of Brazil, because they were elected before age limits were instituted in 1966. Despite the continuity that characterizes the I.O.C., Samaranch has reshaped the body dramatically in the last five years, adding 42 new members and bringing the total membership well above 100. Many of the new members are sports administrators or federation presidents, whom Samaranch wanted in the fold to insure the I.O.C.'s continued relevance. ''The mass of new members has changed the family feeling within the I.O.C. quite a bit,'' Herzog said. ''I think it's positive because we have to be associated with the international federations, but the discreet side, the Vatican side of the I.O.C., has changed a lot. These are sports professionals coming in.''

Dec. 31, 1998-> 88-> GARDEN NOTEBOOK; A Lost Canyon Beckons, And Pasadena Responds
THOUSANDS of visitors jet here to see the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl, and tens of thousands ply Southern California's freeways to get to New Year's Day events. But then there are the happy few who simply step out of their Craftsman bungalows to head down the hiking trails of Arroyo Seco and walk to the game via the city's majestic river canyon. The ritual trip down boulder-lined stairways set among the oaks and sycamores and into the fabled wash is not a short cut but a pleasure, known primarily to residents of Pasadena. This New Year's Day, however, Pasadena's best kept secret is different. Though the picturesque wash that Teddy Roosevelt once said should be a national park is one of the great natural features of this city, it was neglected for decades. Where the wide canyon wasn't actually barren or covered in weeds, it was invaded by flora foreign to the arroyo -- exotics like eucalyptus, acacia, castor bean and flowering plants that drove out native fauna. But since the early 1990's, the arroyo -- one of the largest open natural areas in an urban setting in Los Angeles County -- has been undergoing an extensive restoration. For the first New Year's Day in memory, Pasadenans will encounter a landscape of willows, toyon, coffeeberry, elderberry, and laurel and lemonade sumac, all California natives, in a lush riparian habitat. The habitat restoration, among the most ambitious in Southern California, extends 1.8 miles from the old Colorado Street Bridge, just south of the Rose Bowl, toward the border Pasadena shares with South Pasadena -- an area of 52 acres. Pasadena was founded in the late 19th century as a winter resort for those seeking the good life in a warm, dry climate and a healthy environment. Houses were designed with sleeping porches and terraces open to the San Gabriel Mountains and arroyo views that gave Pasadena its character. House and extended garden were at one with each other. Many of California's plain-air painters lived in homes and studios along the arroyo, which was one of their favorite subjects. ''Historically, the arroyo has been of great importance to Pasadena -- it's one of the reasons the city is where it is,'' said Adam Schiff, a California State Senator, on a recent tour of the arroyo. ''Philosophically, the restoration of its natural beauty speaks volumes about where Pasadena is, and was.'' The degradation of the natural environment was gradual. The Army Corps of Engineers rushed in after the devastating flood of 1938 and built concrete water channels down the arroyo, which controlled floods but denied water to the rest of the riverbed, drying out the vegetation that sustained native animals. In the 1950's, Pasadena went through an economic downturn and smog invaded greater Los Angeles. The city lapsed into shabby gentility. Rumors of Pasadena's demise were exaggerated, however, and residents rallied around its historic architecture. Restoring the city's turn-of-the-century houses preserved entire neighborhoods. (Despite its humble bungalows, Pasadena was once one of the wealthiest cities, per capita, in the United States.) Meanwhile, with better emissions controls, the smog lifted and the regal San Gabriel Mountains came out of the haze. The step from architectural restoration to the restoration of the arroyo was logical: one implied the other. ''They are separate but intertwined strands of the same rope,'' Mr. Schiff said. The restoration of what was in effect Pasadena's Central Park began with an environmental trade-off. In the early 1990's, Browning-Ferris Industries, the waste-disposal company, began filling a canyon about 20 miles away in the San Fernando Valley. Browning-Ferris was required by state and Federal regulations to create a comparable riparian habitat elsewhere. The company spent $5.5 million to recreate the Lower Arroyo between the Colorado Street Bridge and La Loma Bridge (two of seven magnificent concrete viaducts that span the canyon). The Arroyo Seco Foundation restored habitat south of La Loma. ''Before the concrete channel there was a whole meandering stream system working through the arroyo,'' said Michael Zander, head of Zander Associates, a Marin County environmental consulting concern that designed the new habitat. ''What we didn't have was water.'' Just under the Colorado Street Bridge was a small dam. Mr. Zander designed culverts to channel the water above the dam into streams that irrigated about eight acres of the arroyo, turning arid expanses into marshland. ''We took out all the exotic grasses, flowering plants and the weeds and trees that were in the way,'' said City Manager Cynthia Kurtz, who oversaw the project as Pasadena's director of public works and transportation. ''After a lot of research, we came up with a mix of seeds for reseeding.'' Willows and cattails dominate the center of the stream, and toward banks and edges, there are alder, California black walnut, sycamore, poplar, cottonwood and elderberry. Beyond the edges are native centenarian live oaks. (The designers also left full-grown exotic trees, especially the stands of eucalyptus.) ''Within a month of opening the floodgates, the birds came as if attracted by a magnet,'' said Rosa Laveaga, supervisor of Arroyo Seco Park. ''They're drawn to the water, and to the willows and alders, which provide great nesting areas. We had an overpopulation of gophers and squirrels, which made it difficult for plants to survive, but the increase in the number of birds helps keep the rodent population down. The hawks help police the area.'' From her wisteria-draped Craftsman porch overlooking the arroyo, Dianne Philibosian, president of the Arroyo Seco Foundation, witnessed the transformation. ''Whole families of mallards come to the streams, and the killdeer birds have returned to nest,'' she said. ''We've had great blue heron and egrets, and one day my niece saw a kingfisher.'' With the success of their new wetlands, Pasadenans are now hoping that the remaining concrete channels can be either removed or redesigned, so that the deep, wide gash through the wash can be transformed. ''We've looked at leaving the channel in place, planting the channel beds, removing and grading one of the walls, or blending the channel with the new habitats,'' said Tim Brick, emeritus director of the Arroyo Seco Foundation. '' 'Arroyo seco' means dry river in Spanish,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''But the Gabrielino Indians called it Hahamongna, which means 'flowing waters, fruitful valley.' What we do now will determine whether the Indian or Spanish term is more accurate. I'd like nothing more than to see the arroyo completely returned to the Hahamongna.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 90-> Off-Peak New Yorkers
To the Editor: Re ''New One-Day Metrocards to Be Aimed at Infrequent Riders'' (news article, Dec. 18): The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's decision to limit the sale of a new $4 one-day Metrocard to locations outside of subway stations is mistaken. Making these one-day passes more widely available will only be good for the M.T.A. and the city. Fewer people will take extra trips during rush hour. And the pass will allow them to do more in a day for a single $4 fare: see a friend for lunch downtown, go to a museum across town after work, or stay late and have dinner with friends in the Village and see a late movie in Times Square. We will have fun with the pass, use the subways and buses more during off-peak hours and add to the city's economy. What's the problem with that? PAUL SHERIDAN Brooklyn, Dec. 18, 1998

Dec. 14, 1998-> 91-> TECHNOLOGY; On the Supply Lines of the Copier Wars
The copier wars are full upon us. Canon U.S.A., declaring ''X no longer marks the spot,'' is trying to convince corporate customers that its digital copiers can do anything the Xerox Corporation's can do, and more. The Hewlett-Packard Company, which has generally stuck to printers, is pushing hybrid printer-copiers called Mopiers. Xerox, meanwhile, keeps spewing forth new versions of its own digital copiers. But despite hugely expensive advertising campaigns that promote each product's features, the war will not be won on the product battlefield alone. Instead, whoever locks in the best distribution network may well push up to the head of the line. ''We've said our sales will grow from $7.1 billion now to $10 billion in 2001, and that's not going to happen without strong distribution,'' said Tim Andree, a Canon spokesman. The question mark is the fate of Ikon Office Solutions and of Danka Americas, a unit of Danka Business Systems of Britain. Although together they distribute only about 9 percent of the copiers sold in the United States, they are the primary outlets for Canon and other Japanese copier companies. And, they are the road that most industry watchers once expected Hewlett-Packard to travel, as well. But Danka and Ikon are having severe growing pains. Both have been on acquisition binges and each is having a tough time turning its hodgepodge of acquired dealerships into a cohesive whole. Both swept their chief executives out of office in 1998 and brought in new management teams. Danka Americas, which is based in St. Petersburg, Fla., and had domestic sales last year of $2.1 billion, is still choking on the huge copier business that it bought from the Eastman Kodak Company in 1996. As a result, the company is in severe financial straits, and most analysts expect it will soon sell off huge chunks of assets. In contrast, Ikon, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., and has revenues of $5 billion, is profitable. But Ikon has been distracted as it weeds out secondary suppliers like Sharp and concentrates on being the main distributor for Canon, Ricoh and Oce. Industry watchers say the uncertainties surrounding the distributors have thrown wrenches into the plans of copier makers. ''H-P saw Danka and Ikon as potential allies, and their implosion has definitely retarded H-P's advance into this market,'' said Charles LeCompte, president of Lyra Research, a market research firm in Newtonville, Mass. Nor can Canon, which sells extensively through Ikon, be happy right now, said John L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''It's never great when your main distributor is trying to increase profitability rather than sales,'' he said. Not surprisingly, copier companies are scrambling to find new outlets. Canon, which has become a fierce competitor to Xerox in the American copier market, is beefing up its sales subsidiaries in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Chicago, and is concentrating more on direct sales to government offices. ''When you are not getting the kind of orders you expect from Ikon and Danka, you have to focus elsewhere,'' Mr. Andree said. Hewlett, meanwhile, is scouring the country for independent dealers. ''Our strategy was always to go after worldwide accounts, and Ikon and Danka seemed to fit in with that,'' said Tim Haney, general manager of Hewlett's mopier division. ''But neither of them can meet our needs now.'' All of which is good news for Xerox, which controls most of its own distribution, and whose well-known brand is the one to beat. ''Xerox has a 12-month window in which to gobble up even more market share,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. The company is exploiting that opportunity to the hilt, said Lynn S. Ritter, a copier industry analyst at Dataquest, the market research firm. ''You can bet Xerox is asking Danka and Ikon accounts, 'Hey, are you sure you want to buy from these people when you don't even know if they'll be in business tomorrow?' '' she said. Indeed, the sales representatives of Xerox, newly trained on how to sell products that can be connected to computer networks, are doing just that. They are holding firm on prices that are, in general, the market's highest. But they are offering rich trade-ins for non-Xerox equipment, they are promoting the interactivity of an all-Xerox line of printers and copiers, and they are not so subtly pointing out Xerox's financial stability. ''It's not that we have a big 'Kill Ikon and Danka' program going,'' said David Myerscough, Xerox's senior vice president for corporate business strategy. ''But we figure we have 12 to 18 months before they are back to full strength and sure, we'll be more aggressive until then.'' Clearly, both Danka and Ikon have a distance to go before either can again be a power player in the copier sales game. In good part because of the troubles in its American unit, Danka lost $13.4 million last quarter alone. Under a 1996 deal, Kodak continues to manufacture copiers, but Danka must pay for much of Kodak's research and development. And Danka must buy Kodak's output whether the copiers sell well or not. Danka has paid Kodak for tens of millions of dollars' worth of copiers that are gathering dust in its warehouses and is in arrears for millions of dollars more. ''It's a tremendous cash squeeze for us,'' said Brian L. Merriman, who left Toshiba to become president of Danka Americas in August. Danka has hired the investment banking firm of Wasserstein Perella to solicit offers for its European operations and for its facilities management and fax units. It has submitted a new business plan to suppliers and creditors, and they seem to approve. Kodak and other vendors have given Danka breathing room on its bills. And Danka's banks, which were threatening to call in loans, have extended $75 million more in credit. Mr. Merriman said that Danka America's revenues were up 6 percent in the last quarter, ''because our folks are finally refocused on selling.'' He said Danka was poised to introduce some ''very exciting'' new Kodak copiers and would continue to blanket the country with Canon color copiers. ''People forget that despite all the troubles, we've got more than 200 locations in 48 states that are selling and servicing customers every day,'' Mr. Merriman said. Ikon's executives display a similar combination of regret and optimism. ''We bought a lot of second-tier dealerships that didn't have much synergy,'' said Dennis P. LeStrange, Ikon's senior vice president for marketing. ''But we're in 95 percent of the country, and we're stressing consistency and integration.'' Ikon has dropped all but a few high-volume suppliers and is juggling sales territories so that sales people in charge of large corporate accounts are not distracted by smaller ones. And, Mr. LeStrange emphasizes, Ikon's 10,000-strong service staff has not been affected by the turmoil. ''Yes, Xerox is gaining momentum,'' he said. ''But we offer more flexible terms; we offer financing; we offer a broad range of technology, and absolutely no one offers service like we do.'' Xerox might disagree with that; Hewlett-Packard cannot. Of the top-tier copier makers, it may be fighting the worst headwinds. For one thing, it buys most of its printer engines from Canon. But now both companies are chasing the copier market, and Canon is unlikely to give a competitor exclusive rights to its latest models. And service is a big obstacle for Hewlett. When printers break, customers usually take them back to the store. Corporate copier customers are used to on-site installation and repair service. Since most of the latest copiers are plugged into computer networks, such on-site service is essential. Xerox, whose roots are in the copier world, already has an extensive field service organization; Hewlett, coming from the printer side of the business, is only now developing one. Hewlett has been busily signing on copier dealers large enough to service corporate accounts. ''There are lots of qualified resellers who can offer a full gamut of services,'' Mr. Haney said. Hewlett's competitors call that wishful thinking. They say that the best dealers have been snapped up by Danka, Ikon and Canon, and that companies like Sharp, which Ikon has dropped, will have first shot at the remaining ones. Hewlett is distributing some mopiers through Danka, which has an extensive service group. But neither side seems happy. ''They expected us to move more product, and we expected people to like the product better,'' Mr. Merriman said. The distribution battlefield may shift again before any clear winner emerges. The new arena may well be the Internet. ''Computer-savvy buyers will go to a company's home page and configure exactly the product they want,'' Mr. Myerscough of Xerox said. ''They won't want a skewed pitch from anyone's salesman.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 93-> On Their Own
To the Editor: Lynn Karpen is entitled to her opinion of Marcelle Clements's ''Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life'' (Books in Brief, July 26), but at least she should get her history right. The book, she snaps, ''would have been a blockbuster some 20 or 30 years ago.'' On the contrary, it could not have been written at all at that time. Only now is it possible to see what single women have created for themselves. In the 1970's and 80's, when Karpen thinks it was all over, the reinvention of single life that Clements etches so sharply was just a gleam in women's eyes, its fruition coming only after two decades of exhilarating and terrifying risk taking. It would be a great shame if Karpen's historical myopia dissuaded this book's audience of single heterosexual women from reading Clements's subtle and wise account of the banquet of possibility, with its sweets and its sours, that is now spread before them.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 94-> Social Security Is No Failure
To the Editor: A Dec. 9 letter writer argues that Social Security is morally bankrupt and a failure. For two-thirds of this country's elderly population, Social Security is the major source of income. For one-third of this country's elderly population, Social Security is virtually the only income. Nearly 6 percent of workers in private industry receive no pensions from their employers. Social Security is, in effect, their only pension. About 11 percent of America's senior citizens live in poverty; without Social Security, nearly half would. Ninety-eight percent of all children under 18 can count on Social Security if a working parent dies, and 90 percent of all workers can count on Social Security if they have a severe and prolonged disability. Some failure! SAWL WOOLFSON Public Affairs Specialist Social Security Administration New York, Dec. 9, 1998

Dec. 14, 1998-> 95-> Union Spending Inquiry Tries to Separate Lavish From Illegal
Every year at this time, Charles Hughes, the longtime president of one of New York City's largest municipal union locals, would stage a Christmas party so lavish that certain details lingered for months in the minds of his guests. Roast pig, sides of beef, eye-level mounds of shrimp and an unlimited bar -- all in the refined setting of a hotel in midtown Manhattan. Mr. Hughes paid for the annual feast with the dues of the 22,000 low-paid school cafeteria aides and crossing guards who belonged to his local. For the most part, they were not invited; this party was intended for hundreds of politicians, union executives and people who just knew people. And when these people headed for the exits, they were handed a small gift: a teddy bear with a ribbon bearing the name of their generous host. The teddy bears are now relics; there will be no Christmas party at the Sheraton New York for Local 372 this year. Mr. Hughes was expelled a few months ago after an internal judicial panel concluded that he had defrauded the union of more than $1.7 million. In addition, District Council 37, the umbrella organization overseeing his local and 55 others, is the focus of investigations by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, into allegations of kickbacks, vote fraud and embezzlement. Expensive travel and various perquisites have been a part of the district council's culture for years, former and current union officials say, but there always used to be a level of restraint. But in recent years, they say, the boundaries of propriety became blurred. More and more, flamboyance and excessive spending came to define the city's largest municipal union; more and more, it was all right to travel first class, hold $1 million conferences and jet around the world. Now investigators are trying to identify the line at which spending by union officials crosses from profligacy into illegality. Mr. Hughes hired a circus and well-known rock bands for his many union-related gatherings at a resort in the Catskills, including one conference that union officials say cost $1.4 million. Several union leaders and their friends spent a week in the Caribbean on a cruise ship for a conference sponsored by the council's education fund. Albert A. Diop, a union leader best known these days for using a penthouse paid for with union dues, frequently took union-related trips to destinations that included Japan, Italy and Zimbabwe. There are many other examples. Robert Taylor, the former president of a local representing motor vehicle operators, spent $92,000 for a surf-and-turf Christmas party in Great Neck on Long Island. The district council sent more than 700 people to a recent convention in Hawaii. And all these perquisites came on top of ample salaries for union executives; Stanley Hill, the council's longtime executive director, was paid $292,000 a year, Mr. Hughes, $241,000 and Mr. Diop, $209,000. ''The whole thing is sickening,'' a cafeteria worker named Douglas Murrell said about his local's leader, Mr. Hughes. Unions have had a history of corruption, he said. ''But for someone to be dishonest with the little people, the people who don't make much. . . .'' He did not finish the thought. This extravagant spending was often financed with the dues of 120,000 city employees, who on average are paid $25,000 a year. In Mr. Hughes's local, the typical member works part time and receives just $10,000 to $12,000 a year. Many pay about $600 in annual dues, an amount that Lee Saunders, the trustee recently named to run the district council, said was clearly excessive. Mr. Saunders said he was taking steps to end the lavishness. ''Let's say I put a moratorium on it,'' he said. ''Conferences are important, but they don't need to be excessive. And I've reduced the travel of members going to conferences. It is going to be within reason.'' Some union officials compared this spending to that by any large corporation. Out-of-town trips improve the morale of dedicated employees, they contend, and lavish parties create relationships that can help in future business dealings. Whatever his failures, they say, Mr. Hughes was a master at exploiting the political contacts he cultivated to the advantage of his members, who have received unusually good benefits for part-time workers. Mr. Hughes's lawyer adds that he was doing good deeds that have been misunderstood. But Herman Benson, the secretary-treasurer of the Association for Union Democracy, dismissed the argument: ''You develop a certain culture that the thing to do is to live high on the hog, just like corporate executives might do. But the thing that really counts at the bargaining table is the ability of the union to have some power -- the power to rally your members.'' Mr. Benson said parties like those sponsored by Mr. Hughes are intended to send one message to the employer: ''I'm the man in charge, so you and I can decide these things. Don't worry about these jerks that I represent.'' For many years, Victor Gotbaum was the district council's executive director, but that title somehow undersold his considerable influence and intimidating style. He frightened the presidents of his local unions as much as he annoyed city officials, all the while maintaining a reputation for integrity. But Mr. Gotbaum and his allies acknowledge that they took union-related trips to other states and countries; it was part business, part pleasure. And when he stepped down in 1986, the district council hired him for several years as a high-paid consultant. His successor, Mr. Hill, employed a decidedly different management style: more laid-back, more accommodating to the desires of Mr. Hughes and other local presidents. For example, he approved $685,000 in overtime for Mr. Hughes, who claimed to have worked 35 hours of overtime every week for four consecutive years. Mr. Hill later maintained that the overtime had been approved by the executive board of Mr. Hughes's local. In fact, he has often said that he could do little about the spending practices of the council's 56 locals, noting that they had extensive autonomy and that he did not have the power to audit them. The Job of Restoring A Union's Reputation Two weeks ago, the district council's parent union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, forced Mr. Hill to take an unpaid leave, giving his replacement, Mr. Saunders, the task of restoring the reputation of a union once revered as a model of enlightened unionism. ''Our primary responsibility is to work for the betterment of our members,'' Mr. Saunders said. ''You've got to be very, very careful that you don't cross the line into thinking that the institution is you.'' John Socha, the president of a local representing 900 workers at the Queens Public Library, agreed. ''My members are mad as hell,'' he said. ''It's like the film 'Network.' They're opening up windows and yelling: 'I'm mad as hell. I don't want to take it anymore.' '' At the root of some of that anger is the lack of any strong connection between the union's members and how their money was often spent. For example, several years ago Mr. Hughes began to champion the cause of Ethiopian Jews in Israel. He contributed an estimated $30,000 from his local's treasury to Bar-Ilan University in Israel and raised money from other sources for scholarships and cultural programs. In 1995, the university gave Mr. Hughes an honorary doctorate, allowing him to refer to himself as Dr. Hughes. The school also established the Charles Hughes Center for Ethiopian Academic Advancement. Over the years, Mr. Hughes developed a reputation for having a global view; he went on a ''peace mission'' to Nicaragua, developed a ''sister cities'' arrangement with Rome, and went on disaster-relief assignments to the Caribbean. Gerald L. Shargel, a lawyer for Mr. Hughes, defended his client against charges of extravagance. ''Charlie traveled a great deal, but Charlie traveled for the purpose of doing good deeds and good work,'' Mr. Shargel said. ''He was deeply involved with bringing Ethiopian Jews to Israel. He helped bring children out of the former Soviet Union.'' The way union officials traveled often depended on their personality and the input they received from their members. In August, the parent union held its convention in Hawaii. Although the choice of locations may sound exotic, union officials say it made sense: the parent union's members there could use help in their fight with state government, and Hawaii's weak economy could use the extra business. Ray Markey, the president of Local 1930, which represents 1,850 library workers in Manhattan and the Bronx, said his local usually authorized sending six delegates and six alternates to the annual event. ''This time we didn't send the alternates,'' he said. But Mr. Diop, the president of the local representing 23,000 clerks working in the city's agencies and hospitals, sent 300 people to the conference in Hawaii. Costly Conferences At a Catskill Resort For all the globe-trotting, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Diop and their guests and supporters spent a lot of time at the Friar Tuck Inn, a resort in the Catskill Mountains two hours northwest of New York City. How the union came to choose the Friar Tuck as its home away from home is unclear, but the relationship goes back many years. The resort has a medieval motif; its Robin Hood lounge has an offtrack betting teletheater, and its Abbey dining room can seat 1,500 people. Mr. Hughes routinely invited politicians, other union executives and hundreds of his local's members and their families to the resort for weeklong educational or political conferences. ''Nothing was more lavish than a Charlie Hughes party,'' said one high-ranking union executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''There were all sorts of entertainment. They'd have five or six name acts, people you've heard of. They'd have circuses.'' Only later did people learn how costly these conferences actually were. One of the Friar Tuck conferences cost $1.4 million. Free Spending And Growing Debt The free spending became all the more glaring when it was revealed that the debt of Mr. Hughes's local soared to $10 million in 1997, from $5 million the previous year -- in part because of the conferences and the $1.7 million he was found to have taken for his own use. That spending included $329,000 for credit card purchases at Victoria's Secret and Bloomingdale's, among other stores. Defending Mr. Hughes's use of the Friar Tuck, Mr. Shargel said: ''This conference was designed in part to benefit inner-city children. It also had educational purposes. It helped shop stewards and union activists. The sad irony is Charlie now finds himself scorned for doing what he thought was God's work.'' Past and current law enforcement officials say that when labor leaders spend extravagantly in ways that do not benefit union members, they might be vulnerable to charges of embezzlement or fraud. Walter Mack, former director of the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force in Manhattan, said it was important to determine whether the board rubber-stamped the union president's desires and whether it scrutinized the expenditure -- maybe it determined after careful consideration that an official could take his girlfriend on a trip because every one else was bringing a spouse. ''You have to look at: was this a reasonable expenditure?'' Mr. Mack said. ''Does this show the union is being run in the interest of its members or its officers? It could be embezzlement. It could be mail fraud. It could be violation of the Federal statute requiring that officials keep the members informed on what's going on in the union. It's a very fact-specific type of situation.'' Now, while investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney's office pore over the travel and expense records that have been subpoenaed from the union, Mr. Saunders has ordered that audits be conducted in each of the 56 local unions. Meanwhile, a much more modest Christmas party is planned this year for Mr. Hughes's local. ''I don't think you have to have a party at the Sheraton,'' Mr. Saunders said. ''There's plenty of space at the union headquarters.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 96-> On Capturing Genius
To the Editor: ''The Photos That Changed Pollock's Life'' (Critic's Notebook, Dec. 15) refers to the suggestion that has been made that Hans Namuth's photographs and films were in part responsible for the death of the artist Jackson Pollock. The Pollocks and the Namuths were friends, and they were friends of mine. Jackson Pollock was not someone to let photographs or filming ''go to his head,'' nor was he camera-shy. Hans Namuth was an honorable man and a creative photographer. Since I attended the first showing in Namuth's studio of his film of Jackson painting on glass, I can only say that Hans's motives were to record Pollock's unique process: How Jackson's hand, mind, gift and invention all synchronized into his magic. The photographer was amazed by and appreciative of Pollock's genius. HELEN FRANKENTHALER Darien, Conn., Dec. 17, 1998

Dec. 14, 1998-> 98-> THEATER REVIEW; Fool's Gold in the Kingdom of Desire
A distinct chill emanates from the hottest show on Broadway. ''The Blue Room,'' the David Hare play that New Yorkers would seemingly sacrifice their firstborn to get into, opened last night at the Cort Theater for a 12-week run with an advance sale topping $4 million and all but the tiniest percentage of its tickets spoken for. How, really, could it have been otherwise, with its promised catnip cocktail of sex, culture and celebrity? Not to mention such drum-beating phenomena as last week's Newsweek cover, with the show's star, Nicole Kidman, in a sultrier-than-thou pose, and drooling advance notices from London, where the production originated. One phrase, from a review in The Daily Telegraph of London, has already attached itself to the show like a sandwich board: ''pure theatrical Viagra.'' Yet those who take their seats expecting a highbrow equivalent of a blue movie (remember ''Emmanuelle''?) may wind up donning their overcoats. Blue, in Mr. Hare's reworking of ''La Ronde,'' Arthur Schnitzler's fabled portrait of love as an erotic relay race in turn-of-the-century Vienna, is a cool color, a shiver-making shade signifying, if not exactly nothing, then the loneliness, emptiness and futility of human encounters. Blue is what you see, in the words of a song in the play, when you step aside from life and realize that ''the earth looks kind of circular and hollow.'' Accordingly, the metaphoric room of the title, given fluidly changing life by the set designer Mark Thompson, has no need of an asbestos lining. The carnal couplings among the play's 10 characters, all dexterously played by Ms. Kidman, the Australian-born movie star, and the English stage actor Iain Glen, ignite a few ephemeral sparks but no roaring flames. Each coital vignette ends in an exasperated but philosophical shrug in the soulless neon glow of Hugh Vanstone's lighting. A shrug, and an occasional worldly chuckle, is pretty much all that ''The Blue Room'' elicits. As staged by Sam Mendes, the fast-rising director behind the hit revival of ''Cabaret,'' this 100-minute, intermissionless evening is a deft, efficient and sometimes amusing piece of work. Its thematic thrust is so self-evident, and so familiar, as to preclude lively post-theater debate, and it doesn't stir you emotionally. The show is best appreciated as a range-stretching exercise for actors. It is not unlike a darker version of Neil Simon's comedies set in a single hotel suite. That one of the performers is Ms. Kidman, the wife of Tom Cruise and the star of the films ''Practical Magic'' and (most memorably) ''To Die For,'' has much to do, of course, with what has made ''The Blue Room'' a must-see event. Theater ghouls who thrive on watching big stars from another medium stumble onstage have nothing to dine out on here. Ms. Kidman gives a winningly accomplished performance, shifting accents and personae with an assured agility that never stoops to showing off or grandstanding. It is also a performance that obviates prurience, despite the fact that she often wears very little and at one point, only briefly, nothing at all. (And yes, as one of Mr. Glen's characters observes, feasting on the vision of the nude Ms. Kidman, she has nothing at all to be ashamed of.) Her roles range from a Cockney streetwalker to a Continental au pair girl, from a teen-age American model to a grande dame of the theater. Her comic timing is effortless, and she provides the evening with its biggest laugh. That comes when the coked-out model responds to a lover's question as to whether his particular brand of sexual stimulation satisfies her. Her dazed answer: ''I don't know what you're doing.'' She also generates the play's only glimmers of real pathos, letting her face fleetingly betray an irritation that shades into despair when her characters realize that the expectation of sex is as good as sex gets. ''It would have been better on the bench,'' says the prostitute, after a brusque copulation on a riverside quay, with a mixture of defiance and forlornness. That, of course, is Mr. Hare's main point, that sex would always have been better somewhere else, at some other time, with another person; erotic satisfaction is a chimera, the elusive quarry of an eternal and fruitless hunt. The male characters, being more intellectual than the women here, give fuller voice to this poignant if less than original theory, especially the foppish, self-infatuated playwright and the wistful, intellectual aristocrat of the concluding scenes. Mr. Glen has the harder row to hoe of the two stars, since the men of ''The Blue Room'' tend to be blind and fatuous, swaggering macho jokes with little redeeming self-consciousness. But this actor, who leaned toward caricature when I saw him in London, has definitely improved, modulating his performance in welcome ways. There's little depth in any of his portrayals, but that may be built into the quick-sketch nature of the play. Like Ms. Kidman, he is comely and willowy, and he gamely performs an adroit cartwheel in the altogether. That moment isn't especially titillating, but then ''The Blue Room'' isn't a titillating play. Though the actors work well together, there's little erotic chemistry between them; you never feel that in any of their incarnations, they are truly lusting for each other. This is a work, after all, in which the exact time it takes to perform each of the play's acts of copulation is projected in a supertitle, a witty touch that palls by the evening's end. That's what sex comes down to here: a quantifiable, mechanical activity that doesn't, according to the evidence at hand, even seem especially pleasurable. Despite Ms. Kidman's presence, ''The Blue Room'' isn't glamorous either. There is none of the visual sumptuousness, set off by swirling waltzes and equally swirling camera movement, of the famous French film version of ''La Ronde'' by Max Ophuls. In a sense, Mr. Hare comes closer than Ophuls did to the tone of Schnitzler's original play, originally titled ''Reigen'' (''Round Dance''), and not intended by its author for public performance. Schnitzler, a doctor as well as a writer, cast a clinical eye on the delusions of the society he inhabited. But in mixing members of different classes in a rigidly stratified Vienna into a shifting waltz of desire, he illuminated the plaintiveness of high but vain hopes for something better in life, for love as a transformational force. In Mr. Hare's universe, those hopes have been bleached out by the sexual and social revolutions of the succeeding decades. Dashed expectations have always been this playwright's specialty, and in works like ''Plenty'' and ''Skylight,'' he has brought an angry, vivifying passion to the subject. In ''The Blue Room,'' however, his characters stride onto the sexual playing field all too aware of the rules of a no-win game. This means that they never seem to be risking very much, even in terms of what one character delicately labels ''hygiene.'' (AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are not a topic of conversation.) People get bored or vaguely anxious, but they're all wearing too much psychic armor to be bruised anymore; disappointment is a donnee. In only one of the scenes, in which the feckless model and her politician lover pop one mood-altering pill too many, do things threaten to get nasty. Ms. Kidman and Mr. Glen are at their strongest in this vignette, growing ever more animalistic in ways that suggest that passion can indeed push people into dangerous terrain. It's a startling, uncomfortable moment, and it gives off a quality that nothing else in the evening does: spontaneous life. Otherwise, everything remains in control in ''The Blue Room,'' from its jokes (occasionally a shade too obvious) at its characters' expense to its calculated flashes of nudity. The entire evening is not unlike Ms. Kidman's much-discussed body: smooth, pale and slender. THE BLUE ROOM Freely adapted by Dave Hare from ''La Ronde,'' by Arthur Schnitzler. Directed by Sam Mendes; sets by Mark Thompson; lighting by Hugh Vanstone; original music by Paddy Cunneen; sound by Scott Myers; general management, Stuart Thompson; technical supervisor, Gene O'Donovan; production stage manager, David Hyslop.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 99-> With Obesity in Children Rising, More Get Adult Type of Diabetes
On a recent Friday, 13-year-old Tyshon Young and a nutritionist strolled the aisles at Fairway in Harlem for a little comparison shopping. He picked up a box of butter cookies. She pointed to graham crackers. He picked out Frosted Flakes. She said Special K was a better choice. He picked ice cream. She told him to get the low-fat brand. He wanted a mango. She said he could only have half of one, once or twice a week. By the time they made their way to the dairy section, Tyshon turned defensive. ''I love cheese,'' he said, pointing to a package of sliced American. ''I usually eat a whole pack of crackers, about four or five slices of cheese, and a drink, like fruit punch.'' Snacks like that, with high fat and carbohydrate levels, have made Tyshon obese, which has triggered a form of diabetes once considered rare among people his age. The trip to the supermarket was part of an elaborate effort to coax him into a new regimen of exercise and healthy eating that could save his life. At 5 feet 6 inches and 216 pounds, Tyshon represents an alarming new health trend: the sharp increase in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney failure, blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to amputation. Doctors long believed that the disease occurred mostly during middle age or later. Although there have not been any national surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say they have observed similar trends among their own patients. In the last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force. ''Ten years ago, we were teaching medical students that you didn't see this disease in people under 40, and now we're seeing it in people under 10,'' said Dr. Robin S. Goland, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, which opened in October at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights in Manhattan. Dr. Goland said Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 10 to 20 percent of the center's new pediatric patients, compared with less than 4 percent in the hospital's clinics five years ago. ''With the numbers we're starting to see,'' Dr. Goland said, ''this could be the beginning of an epidemic.'' Many Have Relatives Who Have Diabetes Children with Type 2 diabetes look a lot like their adult counterparts. Most are African-American and Hispanic, with a particularly high rate found among children of Mexican descent. Most of the Type 2 children have close relatives with the disease, and almost all are obese. In fact, doctors said, the spiraling rate of childhood obesity in America -- declared an epidemic last month by the United States Surgeon General, David Satcher -- is the most significant factor in the rising numbers of children with this form of diabetes. A common definition of obesity is when a child's weight exceeds 20 percent of ideal weight, based on age, height and frame. According to the most recent statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the number of obese children has doubled in the last two decades. One in five children in America is overweight, researchers found. Poor, minority children, who often eat a lot of junk food and have few neighborhood recreation programs, are at greatest risk, doctors said. Obesity, by itself, does not always lead to diabetes, doctors say, but it is a major risk factor. ''If you want to make someone a diabetic, then make them obese,'' said Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, head of molecular genetics at Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center. Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2 diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care physicians. Until the last few years, Dr. Goland said, the correct diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children. Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar. Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose use. These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting their sugar intake. In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it. Many people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the disease because it can occur in the body for years without symptoms. If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however, life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels, can develop within 10 to 20 years. ''If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we aren't looking for it,'' Dr. Goland said, ''then we are going to start seeing complications in people in their 20's that we would normally associate with people in their 60's and 70's.'' Complications Led To 2 Heart Attacks At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart attacks -- complications from Type 2 diabetes. The diabetes has also caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses. Ms. Wilson, 5 feet 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told that she had Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors suspect that she probably had the disease for years. The delayed diagnosis, doctors said, probably contributed to her health problems. ''I got old too fast,'' said Ms. Wilson, the mother of two daughters. ''My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me.'' Like adults with Type 2, many children with the disease can control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet modification. But eventually, most people require oral medication and insulin. ''These are children who likely would have developed the disease at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it out early,'' said Dr. Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. ''Losing weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly.'' Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2 diabetes. Often, they have parents who work long hours and cannot be home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods where fast-food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber supermarkets. Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes's home in Queens, there is a McDonald's and a Burger King. ''She used to eat at McDonald's every night,'' said her mother, Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons. By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet 6 inches tall, weighed more than 145 pounds. Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first began gaining weight, the doctors told her that the girl would outgrow the ''baby fat'' after she passed puberty. That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and began losing bladder control -- common symptoms of adult-onset diabetes -- and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor. By adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to a normal range. But this year, Nuribel started at a new school. Her mother said her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her health. Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about her disease. She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes, Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she. ''The sugar in her blood is getting high again,'' Mrs. Reyes said, crying. ''I worry all the time that one day, she is going to be at school and eat something that will damage one of her organs.'' Several small studies in cities across the country -- including Cincinnati and San Antonio -- provided the first data about the rise in cases like Nuribel's. A 1996 study at a Cincinnati diabetes center by the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine showed that among pediatric patients, 16 percent had Type 2 in 1994, compared with 2 to 4 percent from 1984 to 1992. The study also found that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19. And Dr. Kenneth L. Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area reported that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes had increased tenfold in the last five years. ''We used to maybe see one case a year,'' he said. ''Now, we see one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three cases a month. It's pretty scary.'' Looking for Symptoms Of Risk for Children Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy. In addition to obesity and a family history of the disease, researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis nigricans, with dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the arms or behind the knees. Symptoms of the disease include frequent urination and chronic thirst. Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed. He had pains in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision. But, his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong with him. They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him on Prozac and urged her to insist that he stay in school. ''They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle-cell,'' his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, ''but no one tested him for diabetes.'' Then, Nigel, 5 feet 8 inches and 250 pounds, began vomiting two or three times a day. One morning, he could hardly stand and his vision was completely blurred. Emergency-room doctors discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to eight times higher than normal. He spent nearly a week in intensive care. Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter. He takes two insulin shots a day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores. Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hoped to get the teen-ager off insulin soon. At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of worries about what lies ahead. ''This disease is probably going to really mess me up,'' he said. ''Eventually, everyone succumbs to the disease.'' Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral medications, and sometimes the same pills are used in children, but none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric patients. In the next month, several clinics across the country will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2. In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center. The Berrie center is different from many other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy. Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff members. They make house calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating. And they make regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday afternoon trip with Tyshon. ''If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment, we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,'' Dr. Goland said. In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin. At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds. Tyshon, his mother and his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled. ''Nothing is off limits to you,'' Ms. Almeida said, urging Tyshon to stick with his new eating habits. ''But you have to eat in moderation. Small changes can make a big difference.'' How Two Types of Diabetes Differ Type 1 diabetes, also called juvenile diabetes, occurs most often in children and adolescents when cells in the pancreas stop producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose use in the body. It is treated with daily insulin shots and diet modification. Type 2 diabetes, also called adult-onset diabetes, occurs when organs become resistant to insulin produced by the body. It is a progressive disease, and often in its final stages, the body stops producing insulin. The disease is often treated in its early stages with a healthy diet and exercise. Later treatment often involves oral medications and ultimately, insulin shots. Gestational diabetes is a condition much like Type 2 that develops in 2 to 5 percent of all pregnancies and ends when pregnancy is over. Treatment often involves a strict diet and exercise.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 100-> Police End Jakarta Protest With Bayonets
At least two Indonesian students were stabbed with bayonets and five were hospitalized after inhaling tear gas as security forces cleared Parliament of protesters today, news reports and witnesses said. The official Antara news agency said two students were hospitalized with bayonet wounds after a brief clash with troops. Witnesses said the Parliament building in the center of Jakarta was cleared by 3 A.M. (4 P.M. Monday, Eastern time), but troops maintained a blockade of streets leading to the building. More than 1,000 students massed at the legislature on Monday to demand the ouster of President B. J. Habibie in one of the largest rallies seen at Parliament since former President Suharto resigned in May as public unrest over the country's economic crisis grew. Many students left as dusk fell but about 300 remained late into the night. Witnesses said the clash broke out when the police, troops and marines tried to evict the students. The protesters threw stones and bottles at the troops, who fired several rounds of tear gas in response.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 101-> Sharing Software, I.B.M. to Release Mail Program Blueprint
Adding momentum to the open source movement for the free sharing of software, I.B.M. plans today to make available the original programmer's instructions for a new mail program that can be used to store and forward E-mail messages with a high level of security. The program, Secure Mailer, serves as an electronic post office for server computers connected to the Internet. It was developed by Wietse Venema, an I.B.M. researcher and computer security specialist. Executives said they were using the free open source model of software distribution to insure that the program would be widely available on the dozens of kinds of computers that are used to route Internet mail traffic. The open source model of software development, pioneered by a loosely affiliated group of expert programmers, is built on universal sharing of the programmer's original written instructions to the computer. In traditional, proprietary development models, those instructions are hidden because they have been compiled into the binary 1's and 0's that computers understand. The open source model has been gaining popularity in the last year based on the success of the free Linux operating system, and in recent months several major technology corporations have endorsed part or all of the idea. ''This is I.B.M.'s Christmas present to the Internet,'' said Abner Germanow, a computer security analyst at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. ''For these are core pieces of software, and we're going beyond trying to make money off of them, to the idea that by freely sharing them it will make the world a better place.'' Like many big companies, the International Business Machines Corporation seems to be cautiously feeling its way toward an open source strategy. Secure Mailer follows by just a week the company's release of the source code for a compiler, the tool used by software developers to transform instructions written in a programming language into the computer's binary machine code. In addition, I.B.M. is making its software compatible with Apache, a popular open source Web server program, and earlier this year it announced plans to make a version of its DB2 relational data base program available for the open source Linux operating system. ''We're still trying to understand exactly what open source means,'' said Paul Horn, vice president for research. ''It obviously plays an important role where standards are critical, but what it means to I.B.M. is still under formulation.'' Secure Mailer offers an alternative to several other freely available programs that route Internet mail, including Sendmail and Q Mail, as well as to commercial programs like Microsoft's Exchange. Currently, about 70 percent of all E-mail worldwide is handled by Sendmail, a program that has been developed over more than a decade and supported by a programmer named Eric Allman and a loose group of colleagues. Recently, Mr. Allman started a company to develop a commercial version of the program. I.B.M. researchers said that one of the drawbacks to Sendmail was that it had been written as a large, monolithic piece of software. As a result it has both performance and security limitations. In contrast, Mr. Venema has developed Secure Mailer as a cluster of modules, all of which distrust each other. This creates a more secure program. The program could be compared to a ship that has many independent compartments and therefore is harder to sink, he said. Charles Palmer, who manages a computer security research group at I.B.M.'s T. J. Watson Research Laboratory, said that enabling other programmers to look at all the original instructions written by the program's author would give them a high degree of confidence in the security of a program.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 102-> Accountants Insist on Quarterly Company Reviews
The nation's five largest accounting firms have agreed not to audit a company's books unless management allows them to review the financial statements every quarter. Faced with a market that reacts harshly if quarterly earnings differ from Wall Street estimates by a penny, companies may be tempted to stretch the rules at the end of a quarter, with the intention of fixing any problems by the end of the year when the auditors walk in the door. Partners at the Big Five accounting firms say that the quarterly reviews can help auditors find and correct any accounting problems before they get out of hand. ''It's better for the auditor to be involved sooner rather than later,'' said Jerry Serlin, the director of auditing standards at Arthur Andersen, one of the accounting firms. If a company will not allow the auditors to review the books at the end of the quarter, he said, Arthur Andersen partners will insist that management explain their reasons to the board of directors' audit committee. Currently, companies can have auditors wait and review the quarterly financial statements at the end of the year, before the annual report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Every year, the fourth quarter is laden with announcements of multi-million-dollar charges to the bottom line. Just yesterday, Citigroup Inc., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation each announced charges of hundreds of millions of dollars. All the Big Five accounting firms have agreed to adopt the policy on Jan. 1, said Daniel W. Jones, national director of assurance and advisory services for Deloitte & Touche. ''We've all arrived at the same conclusion,'' he said. In addition to Andersen and Deloitte, the firms are Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG Peat Marwick. Last week, Lynn E. Turner, the chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, praised the firms for their decision and called on the smaller accounting firms to change their practices, as well.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 103-> TENNIS: ROUNDUP -- PILOT PEN; Ivanisevic to Face Kucera in Final
Goran Ivanisevic shook off an aching shoulder and continued his dominance over Yevgeny Kafelnikov, eliminating the defending Pilot Pen champion, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday in New Haven with a dominating service game. Ivanisevic leads the head-to-head series, 9-2, and has beaten the Russian in their last seven matches. His powerful serve, clocked as high as 131 miles an hour in the tournament, kept him in control through most of the 1-hour-5-minute match. The left-hander had a dozen aces to Kafelnikov's four and won 87 percent of his first service points. In the hunt for his first tournament victory in the United States, Ivanisevic will play seventh-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia in today's final. Kucera advanced by beating fourth-seeded Richard Krajicek, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4. DU MAURIER OPEN Seles Upsets Hingis Monica Seles upset top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 semifinal victory yesterday at the $1.3 million du Maurier Open women's tennis championship in Montreal. Seles advanced to today's final against third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, who beat second-seeded Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, in the second semifinal yesterday. Seles, 24, seeded fifth, has won the last three du Maurier tournaments. Her only previous loss at the event was to Sanchez Vicario in the 1992 final. Seles's record in the du Maurier Open is now 23-1. R.C.A. CHAMPIONSHIPS Agassi vs. Corretja After posting two-set victories over their respective foes in yesterday's semifinal round, Andre Agassi and Alex Corretja predicted a tight battle in today's final of the R.C.A. Championships in Indianapolis. Agassi, seeded fifth, advanced with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-3 victory over Ramon Delgado of Paraguay. Corretja, seeded sixth, eliminated 15th-seeded Todd Martin, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Their respective victories set up what promised to be an outstanding serve-and-volley match between players who are not afraid to run. Agassi has won the four previous matches with Corretja, including a 5-7, 6-3, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2 victory in the 1995 United States Open. G.H.I. BRONX TENNIS CLASSIC Black Advances Cara Black of Zimbabwe, the second seed, beat third-seeded Christina Brandi, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-1, yesterday to gain a berth in the final of the $75,000 G.H.I. Bronx Tennis Classic at Crotona Park. In eliminating the last American in the field, Black earned a spot opposite top-seeded Sarah Pitkowski of France in today's final. Pitkowski advanced with a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Anne Kremer of Luxembourg. Miles Maclagan of Britain beat Goichi Motomura of Japan, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, to advance to the men's final against Oren Motevassel of Israel, a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) winner over Mose Navarra of Italy.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 105-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE LAW; Rulings in Clinton-Starr Bouts May Hinder Future Presidents
President Clinton's defense of his private conduct this year has endangered more than his reputation and credibility. The legal battles he has fought to avoid acknowledging that his behavior with Monica S. Lewinsky was inappropriate may have eroded Presidential power and prerogatives for future Presidents, legal experts, constitutional scholars and political scientists say. The precedents set by court decisions rebuffing Mr. Clinton's efforts to halt a sexual misconduct suit by Paula Corbin Jones and prevent close aides and bodyguards from testifying before a Federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter have profound implications, the experts say. Among them are these: *Presidents can now be sued for private conduct while still in office. *Government lawyers may be compelled to disclose advice they provide to Presidents. *The notion that executive privilege protects a President's conversation with his advisers has been restricted. *Members of a President's personal security force can be called to testify about his or her movements, actions and habits. And Mr. Clinton voluntarily set a precedent, as the first President to testify before a grand jury investigating his own actions. One potential battle, over the possibility that a prosecutor can require a President to appear by issuing a subpoena, was avoided -- at least for now -- when Mr. Clinton agreed to testify. But Mr. Starr has told the President that he still might subpoena him to compel testimony about matters Mr. Clinton declined to discuss. Not lost on students of the Presidency is that these legal precedents did not flow out of Mr. Clinton's efforts to protect conversations involving national security or sensitive law-enforcement or economic policy. They resulted from the President's effort to hide an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that he later acknowledged. Executive privilege protects conversations about sensitive Government matters between the President and top advisers. Now, many of those who ponder the impact on the institution fear serious consequences, including the potential for more lawsuits against Presidents in office, an inhibition to give Presidents candid advice, a disinclination to write memorandums or diaries, and difficulty recruiting quality advisers because of the risk of large legal fees. ''It's just been a disaster for the Presidency,'' said Harold Bruff, dean of the University of Colorado Law School. The President's legal battles continue. The White House asked the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn a lower court ruling requiring that some of Mr. Clinton's legal advisers testify in the Lewinsky case. Mark Rozell, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on executive privilege, said: ''I think much of the Clinton strategy has weakened traditional Presidential power with respect to executive privilege. In part, that's because they have sent up losing argument after losing argument for what appears to me to be attempts to delay the Starr investigation.'' Not everyone lays the blame for erosion of Presidential power at the feet of the Clinton White House. Several scholars and lawyers also fault Mr. Starr for disregarding potential damage to the Presidency in his aggressive pursuit of Mr. Clinton. Though concepts like executive privilege and attorney-client confidentiality, which protects the conversations between lawyers and their clients, often have an abstract or theoretical air to the public, the loss of these prerogatives to Presidents can have real consequences. Legal experts say the erosion of such powers may make it harder, for example, for Presidents to recruit competent and trusted advisers. A host of Clinton advisers have been subpoenaed by Mr. Starr and appeared before grand juries investigating accusations of Presidential misconduct, even conduct that took place before the President was elected. Most have had to pay their own legal bills. Mr. Bruff said he once turned down a job in the White House counsel's office. ''One of the reasons for rejecting it,'' he said, ''was that I can't risk my family's life savings for potential legal bills.'' Some lawyers also lament the Supreme Court decision in the Jones lawsuit that permitted sitting Presidents to be sued, a precedent some consider potentially damaging. ''The Court assumed that because there were so few civil suits against the President in the past, that there would not be many such suits in the future,'' said Walter Dellinger, a Duke University Law School professor and former Solicitor General. ''But the future is a different world, because no litigant will ever have to go to the Supreme Court again to commence a lawsuit against the President of the United States. All a litigant has to do is file suit in any Federal or state court.'' Ms. Jones's lawyers, among others, say the case reached the High Court only because Mr. Clinton declined to settle. ''There was no real desire on their part to settle; they wanted to wait until the Supreme Court finished,'' said Joseph Cammarata, one of Ms. Jones's lawyers at the time. Robert S. Bennett, Mr. Clinton's lawyer in the Jones case, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Some scholars dismiss the notion of any permanent damage to the Presidency and dispute assertions that court decisions will constrain Presidents from confiding in advisers. What is there to fear, they say, as long as discussions do not involve illegal acts or abuse of power? Charles O. Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, also does not buy the argument that compelling the President's bodyguards to testify will mean that he will seek to avoid them as much as possible. ''Why would he place his life in jeopardy?'' Mr. Jones asked. The concept of Presidential prerogatives is an elastic one, scholars say. It is not mentioned in the Constitution and is mainly defined by case law and by whether a President feels confident that if he asserts it, he will not pay a political price. It is the latter area, some experts say, where the Clinton Administration has done the most harm, by making it likely that future Presidents will be more hesitant to evoke a principle of prerogative like executive privilege for fear of political accusations that they are trying to hide questionable actions. ''When it turns out that the President was only covering up his own embarrassment, it becomes easy for people to say, this wasn't about principle at all,'' said Peter M. Shane, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School who is a former Justice Department lawyer. ''Now when the next President comes along and tries to do the same, politically it becomes much harder. People are going to say, 'Wait a minute, this is just another stonewall.' ''

The Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy and Human Rights, John Shattuck, and former Senator Bob Dole delivered a stern warning to Mr. Milosevic today about the prisoners and refugees in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The Government cracked down on separatists in the largely ethnic Albanian province, causing thousands of civilians to flee their houses. Many are hiding in the hills, leading to concern as cold weather approaches. Over the weekend Mr. Shattuck and Mr. Dole visited Kosovo, where many people are sympathetic to the separatist guerrilla insurgency of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Mr. Dole accused the police officers and troops of ''waging war against civilians for political purposes.'' He described a ''humanitarian catastrophe in the making'' and added, ''Slobodan Milosevic says it will not happen, but if it does, the repercussions will be dramatic.'' International mediators are pressing the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian leaders to agree to a cease-fire to let refugees return to their houses before the winter. Mr. Shattuck said Mr. Milosevic had agreed to give the International Red Cross access to suspected guerrillas, 450 of whom were seized last week. Reports today from Kosovo said that almost 400 were released over the weekend after questioning and that the rest remained in custody. Mr. Shattuck said that it was important to test the validity of charges against arrested men and that those who were cleared should be returned to their families. Mr. Milosevic was also considering whether to allow independent forensic experts into Kosovo to investigate allegations of atrocities and mass graves. Mr. Milosevic has given similar promises of cooperation in the past and reneged. Mr. Dole said that ''nothing encouraging'' had come out of the meeting. Mr. Milosevic says 16,000 refugees are living in the open compared with international estimates of 80,000 to 120,000. -------------------- Tribunal Denies Role in Death THE HAGUE, Sept. 7 (Agence France-Presse) -- The war crimes tribunal here that is holding trials on the war in Bosnia said today that it had no responsibility for the death of a Bosnian Serb defendant, Milan Kovacevic, 57, who died in prison last month while on trial for genocide. ''Milan Kovacevic, who was a very sick man and whose poor health condition was being constantly monitored, died of natural causes,'' said a spokesman for the tribunal, Christian Chartier. ''The death of Milan Kovacevic was actually caused by the spontaneous rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.''

DEAR DIARY: Ten minutes before curtain on a sold-out Saturday night, I stood outside ''The Lion King'' and flashed a small scribbled sign that read ''Need one ticket.'' Instantly, a couple approached, saying: ''Our friend has an extra ticket. And he paid $225 for it.'' They held out a bona fide ticket for orchestra center. We quickly negotiated a very modest price, and in minutes I was happily seated next to the man who was stuck with the extra ticket and the financial loss. Feeling that I at least owed him pleasant company, I said, ''Gee, this is lucky for me, but what happened to the person who was supposed to have this ticket?'' ''My wife and I had to buy these so far in advance that while we were waiting, we got a divorce,'' he said. ''The show ran longer than the marriage.'' JUDITH SILLS The painless New York way to do Christmas cards: The woman sat at a table by the window in a Rockefeller Center cafe, a perfect view of the tree about 30 yards away. On the table in front of her were four boxes of Museum of Modern Art cards, two sheets of self-adhesive stamps, her address book and a large coffee. Harvard Hollenberg was strolling along Second Avenue with a friend who is a lawyer. A boy of about 14 on a bicycle was trying to hitch a ride by grabbing on to the rear of a moving truck. The friend whipped out his card and handed it to the boy. ''If you're going to do that, you may need this,'' he said. Five-year-old Adam finished eating his chocolate cake at dinner. His mother, Susan Kushner, told him she was proud of him. ''Why are you proud of me?'' he asked. ''It isn't even healthy.'' The class at Marymount College was discussing esthetics, and Lewis Burke Frumkes, who teaches critical thinking, asked the students to write about how important they thought appearance was. Meredith Long, a freshman, wrote: ''Would Prince Charming have saved Sleeping Beauty if her name had been Sleeping Great Personality?'' Metamorphosis It seems my dear That year by year You're more like me And I like thee. I finish sentences you start You speak my mind, and for your part You conjure up the missing phrase My tongue can't form, my brain can't raise. We always lie the same at night I on the left, you on the right. One evening in our double bed We'll roll together head to head And pass the spirits right on through Then you'll be me, and I'll be you.

Woman No. 1: ''So how are things going with your new French husband?'' Woman No. 2: ''Everything is fine, except for one problem. When I die, he wants me to be buried in France. And I don't even speak French.'' Marvin Heffner and his wife, Anita, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., were recently on a Shop Till You Drop bus trip to Manhattan. After doing all the stores, Mrs. Heffner and a friend strolled on Fifth Avenue and stopped in front of a Tiffany's window, where they stood beside a ''very young thing arm in arm with an older gentleman.'' Mrs. Heffner was delighted with the exchange she overheard. ''That bracelet is what I've always wanted,'' said the very young thing. ''Try something not so expensive,'' the older gentleman said. ''We just met last week.'' It was late afternoon before the tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center when the real N.Y.P.D. Blue merged with the fictional. The crowd was large and good-natured, the weather was balmy, and Stanley Adelman was standing next to a large policeman, stern of visage. A tall, gray-haired man came up to the officer and held out his hand. ''I'm sorry for your loss,'' he said. ''We all cared for Bobby Simone,'' he added, referring to the character that had been played by Jimmy Smits on the television show. The officer broke up laughing as he shook the man's hand. The older man went on to repeat his condolences to another officer, with the same results. Dear Diary: We had been waiting a long time, several of us lamenting the dearth of M14 crosstown buses. When one finally arrived, it was crowded. We settled into available seats, lowered our eyes and kept our once talkative mouths shut. An eerie silence fell. After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker: ''This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights. Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed, angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a nice ride.'' People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers left the bus smiling. MARELEYN SCHNEIDER Don Dellair was on an M104 bus seated next to two young Asian women. One was telling the other a long story in Japanese. The second woman continued nodding as her companion droned on, seemingly interminably. After five or six minutes, she looked up. ''Whatever,'' she said. The box office personnel at the 47th Street Theater Development Fund TKTS booth were flummoxed recently when a woman asked for a ticket to ''the Princess Di show.'' It took a minute for them to decipher the request. She had seen an advertisement for ''Dinah Was,'' the musical about Dinah Washington, and immediately made the broad jump to British royalty. Diana/Dinah -- whatever.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 108-> Reformer Spared, for Now
In a gain for cleaner politics, Senate Republicans have dropped their effort to oust a top official at the Federal Election Commission who has been a vigorous foe of campaign fund-raising abuses. As a result, at least for now, Lawrence Noble, the commission's general counsel, will be able to continue his outstanding work trying to end the practice of using unregulated ''soft money'' raised by the national political parties for costly ad campaigns for candidates in clear violation of the election laws. The attempted lynching of Mr. Noble was mounted by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who argues that lawmakers have a constitutional right to take money from special interests, especially the tobacco industry. This summer, he attached a measure cutting off Mr. Noble's term to a Treasury spending bill. On Thursday, however, he accepted a deal in which term limits would apply to future general counsels, with Mr. Noble keeping his job until 2008. The latest word on Capitol Hill is that Mr. McConnell may now try to cheat the reformers of their victory with another sneak attack as early as this week. He has not ruled out working with like-minded Republicans to get the Noble ouster put back on the Treasury measure in conference with the House, even though it was never in the House version. That move would betray the spirit of last week's deal. Proponents of clean elections must do all they can to stop it.

Dec. 14, 1998-> 109-> Women Allege Betrayal by Rabbis' Talk; Rare Lawsuits Complain Reputations as Jews Were Damaged
For Chayie Sieger, the sense of powerlessness came when she learned that 100 Orthodox rabbis she had never met had granted her husband of 26 years a Jewish divorce without her knowledge. For Chani Lightman, the sense of shock came when she confided in two rabbis about marital problems and then discovered that they had revealed those secrets to her husband and others in their tight-knit religious community. Stunned by what they saw as betrayals and seeking to restore reputations they say were virtually destroyed, the two women have taken an unheard-of step: they are suing rabbis in American courts of law, their complaints based on the way they were treated by religious courts. What makes these cases remarkable is that Mrs. Sieger, 45, from Borough Park, Brooklyn, and Mrs. Lightman, 38, from Cedarhurst, on Long Island, remain devoted to their religion, even as the communities around them openly question their bold and, some say, heretical challenges. ''I am religious and feel very strongly about Judaism,'' Mrs. Lightman said. ''But I don't feel this is a representation of what Judaism or religion is. This is simply an abuse of power by some men.'' While Orthodox Jews who want a divorce in civil law still have to observe the same procedures as any other Americans, obtaining a Jewish get, or divorce, is necessary to remarry within Orthodoxy. Women have long complained that Jewish courts, which act like binding arbitration panels, have favored men, particularly on matrimonial issues. In many instances, men have refused to grant their wives a get, leaving the women unable to remarry. Men, conversely, face no such consequences. But as both Mrs. Sieger and Mrs. Lightman learned, men sometimes obtain a get without their wives' consent or knowledge. The two women seem unlikely candidates to challenge rabbis in court. Both were born into strictly observant Orthodox families, Mrs. Lightman in the modern Orthodox wing of Jewry, Mrs. Sieger in the Bobover Hasidic sect, where, in many ways, women are subject to the command of men. Mrs. Lightman, a nurse and the mother of four daughters, won a first-round victory on Nov. 18 when Justice David Goldstein of State Supreme Court in Queens handed down a summary judgment against a Long Island rabbi, David Weinberger of Temple Shaaray Tefila in Lawrence. Mrs. Lightman had gone to Rabbi Weinberger for marital counseling, and complains in her suit that he violated clerical confidentiality by revealing secrets to her husband, Dr. Hylton Lightman, and his lawyer, information that then showed up in papers filed in a custody dispute. As a result, she said, unfounded rumors began to circulate, including a rumor that she was failing to live by Jewish law and ''seeing a man in a social situation,'' stories that shook her community. Now, she said, she is largely ostracized there and attributes the loss of temporary custody of her daughters, ages 6 to 12, to the suspicions planted about her. ''I am portrayed as an irreligious woman not eligible to be the custodial parent to my children,'' she said. Mrs. Lightman would not say how much she was seeking in monetary damages, only that it was ''in the millions.'' Justice Goldstein sharply condemned Rabbi Weinberger's revelations, which included the fact that Mrs. Lightman had stopped going to the mikvah, or ritual purification bath, so that her husband would refrain from having sex with her. ''In my view, this was not only improper, it was outrageous and offensive, especially considering the status and stature of these defendants within the community,'' he wrote in his opinion. A second rabbi in whom Mrs. Lightman confided, Tzvi Flaum of Congregation Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway, Queens, may face the same claim, depending on the results of a hearing on Jan. 6. Franklin H. Snitow, the lawyer for Rabbi Weinberger and Rabbi Flaum as well as for Dr. Lightman in the couple's civil divorce case, said he planned to appeal the judgment. ''Rabbi Weinberger was basically providing information to both sides, and there was no expectation of confidentiality.'' Mr. Snitow said. As for government jurisdiction over religious matters, he said: ''The clergy is not licensed by the state, and the law does not deal with their activities within the community; therefore, we believe there is interference with their discharging their religious obligations.'' The Sieger case involves different legal and religious issues. Mrs. Sieger, who is a nursing home administrator, filed suit last month in Supreme Court in Manhattan against the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada; the Bet Din Zedek of America, a rabbinical court, and five individual rabbis for libel and slander. She is seeking $13 million in damages. Her lawsuit revolves around an unusual instrument of Jewish divorce, called a Heter Meah Rabonim, that the defendants got for her husband, Chaim Sieger, on the grounds that she had repeatedly refused to accept a routine get. But Mrs. Sieger insists she was the one who first requested a divorce. She said she left Mr. Sieger in 1995 when their two children were grown and married with their own families, hoping to quickly dissolve the 26-year marriage. She said that she consented three times to appear before a rabbinical court, but that she was never called and was rebuffed when she inquired about the status of the case. ''I kept responding that I would go and nothing happened,'' she said. ''Then I got a letter from Chaim's attorney, Abe Konstam, stating, 'As you are aware, a rabbinical divorce has already been granted.' '' Without informing her, the rabbis had used the Heter Meah Rabonim, which was introduced centuries ago to give men whose wives are mentally incapacitated, unconscious or unwilling to accept a get the right to take a second wife. It is not technically a Jewish divorce but is a way of releasing a man in an untenable situation from the bonds of marriage. It requires the signatures of 100 rabbis in three countries attesting to the woman's inability to accept the get. Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who specializes in Federal litigation on religious liberty issues and who is representing several of the defendants in the Sieger case, maintains that Mrs. Sieger refused to appear before the Bet din. ''The courts have repeatedly refused to get involved in second-guessing rabbinical courts,'' he said. ''If the rabbis follow procedure, you can't say the result is defamation.'' Moreover, he continued, ''There was no obligation to tell her about the Heter.'' Christopher Sullivan, a lawyer with the New York firm of Herrick, Feinstein, who represents Mrs. Sieger, said his client was treated unfairly. ''One hundred rabbis who never met her and knew nothing about her signed a Heter accusing her of two specific crimes under Jewish law,'' he said. ''One is that she failed to go to the mikvah or ritual bath while living with her husband. If she engages in sex while in a state of uncleanliness she places him in a state of mortal sin, and a woman who does that cannot serve or prepare food and is not to be trusted in the raising of children.'' The second crime, he said, was the alleged disregard for the summonses to appear before the Bet din. ''The Heter was really devastating,'' Mrs. Sieger said. ''I am strangled by stigma. The choice was, do I remain branded for the rest of my life or do I try to clear my name?'' Denying that he had ever stood in the way of a divorce, Mr. Sieger said he found the defamation suit to be a profound embarrassment. ''Why didn't she take them to a higher Bet din and let them be sanctioned by their peers?'' he asked. ''Every organization has a policing mechanism.'' But Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, professor of Talmudic law at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanon Theological School, affiliated with Yeshiva University, said: ''There is no such thing as a higher Bet din. In addition, it is virtually impossible to convince one Bet din to sit in judgment of another.'' Whatever the outcome of the suits, the anguish and hostility in both cases are palpable. Mrs. Lightman says she believes a severe beating she received in her bedroom when she was asleep in September 1997 is somehow connected to the divorce. The Nassau County police say the case is still under active investigation. She also said her husband had obtained a get without giving it to her or telling her about it. ''I learned about it,'' she said, ''when my sister-in-law called to tell me that her divorced sister was introduced to Hylton as being 'the cream of the crop' as a potential date. I was shocked because I had been asking him for a get for three years and he always refused.'' Dr. Lightman, a pediatrician from South Africa, said he was taken aback by the judge's ruling and described the resulting publicity as ''a total desecration of Jewish Torah values.'' Asked if he had, in fact, obtained a get, he said: ''That is so complex a question that it goes beyond explanation. I cannot answer.'' Despite the sting of rejection they say they feel from friends, neighbors and, in Mrs. Sieger's case, business contacts, neither woman intends to abandon Orthodoxy. Both were raised in insular communities and both married men they met through matchmakers. Mrs. Sieger, who grew up and still lives in the Hasidic world of Borough Park, says that in fact, she supports the very mechanisms that have hurt her. ''The provision for the Heter is very important,'' she said. ''I am happy it is in the system, as opposed to other religions that have nothing like it. My only problem is that it was used to abuse me.'' Whether other women will take up the cudgels remains to be seen. ''I don't think this will open the floodgates,'' said Susan Aronoff, co-director of Agunah Inc., which helps women whose husbands refuse to grant them a get and is organizing a fund to help Mrs. Lightman pay her legal expenses. ''But maybe it will make rabbis more careful of their conduct.''

Dec. 14, 1998-> 111-> REVISIONS; When Wondering About Wonder, Hear John Donne
''Wonder''is an interesting word. But whether as verb or noun, we use it pretty tepidly most of the time. Is he telling the truth? I wonder. Or, consider the wonders of modern science and technology. The more primal meaning is pretty hard to come by, as in to marvel, to be awestruck, possibly to be terrified, seized by delight and disbelief simultaneously. Overwhelmed by something new to everything you have ever experienced. You don't master the source of wonder; rather, you grow still in its presence and let it take you over. It asks a lot of us. No wonder we let ourselves experience it so seldom. Still, we can't help feeling wonder in the presence of death. (Don't worry, I'm not about to recite that litany intoned by the wise old doctor at the beginning of every ''Ben Casey'' episode, ''Man, woman, birth, death, infinity.'') And we can't help feeling wonder in the presence of great art. Both death and art drive Margaret Edson's play ''Wit.'' ''Wit'' was denied a Broadway house (the subject matter didn't have legs, one producer explained), but it has moved into the Union Square Theater and will doubtless move on to the regional theaters. Death be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe, For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow, Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee. These lines are from the ''Holy Sonnets'' of the 17th-century poet John Donne. The character who speaks them in ''Wit'' is Vivian Bearing, Ph.D., a literary scholar whose work on Donne, she declares, was groundbreaking. A sonnet is theater at its most condensed. You have one speaker who is of two minds, you have a rigorous structure, and you have language that can go from the most airborne and elegant to acute, even wanton emotional extremes. (Ms. Edson is not the only writer to understand this. For last season's ''Love's Fire,'' the Acting Company commissioned short plays by seven playwrights, each taking a sonnet by Shakespeare as its point of departure. I'm also told that sonnet snatches drift through the new film ''Shakespeare in Love.'') Now Vivian is battered by cancer and chemotherapy: the disease and the cure fight for her body as salvation and damnation fought for Donne's soul. And as the poet turned his struggle into verse, the professor turns hers into theater. (Don't forget that a ''theater'' isn't only a place for staging plays: it is a lecture hall, a surgical clinic or a center for war operations.) Ms. Edson doesn't try to compete with Donne's volatile brilliance. Who can compete with lines like: Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I Except you'enthrall mee, never shall be free, Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee. What she and the masterly actress Kathleen Chalfant provide is a prose correlative. When Vivian Bearing speaks in her high-handed, high-minded way, she shapes and controls her revelations as surely as any poet. And, like Donne, she deploys wit, not so much to make us laugh (though we do sometimes), but to make us see the grace of paradox and contradiction under pressure. Watching Ms. Chalfant as Vivian, I realized we've come to believe that dying and death are much more convincing on film than on stage. We think verisimilitude is everything: the shadowed face, the hollowed eyes, the close-ups of suffering. (Think of Meryl Streep in ''One True Thing'' or Tom Hanks in ''Philadelphia.'') But if you've ever watched someone die over a long period of time, physical decay isn't always the first thing to get to you. It's the way death ambushes, wears down the person you know, the way she or he becomes nothing more than certain extreme traits or moods. Furious one day, benign the next, terrified then uncannily brave. But always growing farther away from you. To sit watching in a dark theater as we might in a hospital room is hair-raising. Film absorbs you at moments like these, but theater implicates you. And that sense of being implicated -- drawn despite yourself, even against your will to something that unsettles or frightens you -- is what the audience shares with the young female protagonists of ''Stop Kiss,'' the romantic comedy by Diana Son playing to such eager audiences at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. I said romantic comedy, but this one is threatened by tragedy. When the two people falling in love belong to one sex, a kiss is a very dangerous thing. Romantic tragedies are about what's forbidden. A couple break society's rules and at least one of them pays with death. Romantic comedies are about the unplanned. A couple thwart social expectations and don't so much change the rules as change who plays the game and how. Society accommodates them. Life goes on. Contemporary writers are having a hard time with romantic comedy. The energy that draws two people together and the circumstances that push them apart aren't combustible enough. Your average scenario involves two people who quarrel, maybe in the office, maybe on a blind date. Since they're both attractive we know they're going to fall in love. And the world they live in is too flat. The best romantic comedies (''It Happened One Night,'' ''The Lady Eve'') didn't just have stars, they supplied great minor characters and reasonably complicated settings. This particular one includes whites, blacks and Asians, who don't, for the time we see them, talk race. I have no problem with that. My world includes all those groups, and we spend a lot of time talking about other complicated things. The old roles and rules are pretty much gone now. The desires are all still there, but we (writers and citizens) don't know how to combine them with new uncertainties and possibilities. This is what ''Stop Kiss'' does so well. It is a small, well-wrought play with nary a false move except for occasional too-cute banter. Now here is wonder on a smaller scale, for surely it is wondrous strange, as the Elizabethans would say, when two people who have no intention of falling in love find themselves unable to do anything else. Callie and Sara aren't thinking about love or lesbians when they meet. Romance takes them by surprise, and this time it's not the verbal sparring but the camaraderie that fools them. (We see the signs before they do.) Romance requires the sense that one's feelings are very strange yet very familiar. All of that is intensified here by sexual unease -- the audience's as well as the characters' -- and outright violence. Callie and Sara do want to delay acknowledging what they feel, but they don't want to feel any other way. For all its dangers, it's too pleasurable. Or, as Ira Gershwin said, '' 'S Wonderful.'' There's a fine line here between what we might call the universal (romance whatever the specifics of gender and sexuality) and the particular (two women in love). What threatens Callie and Sara is very particular. But it makes you ask yourself more general questions, like: What am I willing to risk for love? What is the bearable ratio of fear to delight? What does the person I love make me think and feel about the world and about myself? And am I willing to live with that?

Aug. 23, 1998-> 112-> TELEVISON; A Gallery of Human Oddities That Are, After All, Human
HEIDI COMFORT is 8 years old and has a round nose, starry eyes and a large, animated mouth with teeth that don't look quite right. She can chatter affably in a manner far beyond her years and put even shy adults immediately at ease, but in other skills she is devastatingly impaired. Ask her to arrange a set of blocks into the simple pattern of a cross, and she can't do it, and she can't even see that she can't do it. She has a poor grasp of size, time and numbers. She veers wildly from being impatient, uninterested and unable to concentrate on anything for more than a moment to suddenly focusing in on a task, like feeding a barnacle at the local aquarium, to the sustained exclusion of anything around her. Heidi has Williams syndrome, a rare genetic condition that leaves people, in the words of Dr. Oliver Sacks, with ''a curious contrast of abilities and disabilities'': social gracefulness and musicality mixed with extreme spatial, numerical and other cognitive deficiencies. Their faces are distinctive, too, elfin and elastic: Jim Carrey as a Cabbage Patch doll. They look and act more like one another than they do like ''normal'' people, and they know it. ''When people stare at me,'' a boy with Williams syndrome tells Dr. Sacks, ''I feel like a weird medical specimen.'' Yet here we are, the television multitude, staring at the boy and his fellows in utter fascination, wanting to hear more about Williams syndrome, to watch it in action. We are equally enthralled by the other stories in the four-part PBS series called ''Oliver Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' which begins Tuesday at 8 P.M. -- stories of people with autism or total color-blindness or Usher's syndrome, another rare genetic condition, in which a person is born deaf and then gradually goes blind in young adulthood. We are enthralled partly because Dr. Sacks, the world's most famous literary neurologist, is a gifted and compassionate tour guide, who never takes the pat route and who tirelessly flings out new ideas and angles on his topics. But in truth, we are also fascinated because the medical conditions he describes, in his many best-selling books as well as in the PBS series, are so, yes, weird. We like weird; we always have. Doctors even have a term for a condition that is weird enough to be frankly fascinating: a fascinoma. So it is fair to ask, as we watch Heidi fumble with her toy blocks or Jessica Park, an autistic artist who paints somber, uninhabited houses, explode in rage at her interviewer, what are we looking at, anyway? How is what we are doing different from going to a circus sideshow to gawk at Siamese twins and hermaphrodites? And if there is an element of voyeurism to Dr. Sacks's appeal, is that necessarily bad? ''I do think there is something of the old-style freak show'' in Dr. Sacks's work, said Dr. Alice Dreger, a medical historian at Michigan State University who has written about public perceptions of disabilities. ''By that I mean it involves the exhibitor as a willing participant. People obviously enjoy telling their fascinomas to Sacks.'' And with his insight and his artistry, she adds, ''he turns their story into something extraordinarily beautiful.'' In one sense, Dr. Sacks's mining of life's aberrations follows standard scientific protocol. Biologists can learn how things work only by seeing what happens when they go wrong, or when they at least stray from the opacity of the norm. Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle and other early men of medicine all described in considerable detail a host of human and animal deformities, the better to elucidate by contrast the dimensions and performance of the triumphant average. Today, cell biologists study cancer cells to understand normal cell growth, and brain researchers rely on patients with head injuries or hereditary neurological disorders to give them windows on the brain. Case studies are also enormously useful in explaining science and medicine to a large audience. Yet Dr. Sacks's goal has never been straight didacticism, and he is not a conventional science writer. He doesn't use his subjects as a springboard for a course in basic neural anatomy or human genetics. The hourlong segment on Usher's syndrome, for example, doesn't bother theorizing about why the gene for the disease causes deafness first and blindness later. Instead, Dr. Sacks spends most of his time delving into the humanity of his characters, their specificity. Would Danny Delcambre, who is fast losing his sight to Usher's, want it back if he could have it? Yes, most certainly. He was born deaf, but would he want hearing if it could be given to him? ''No. I'm a deaf person. I like a quiet world.'' What exactly does Knut Nordby, who is stricken by a rare and complete color-blindness called achromatopsia, see when he looks at an ancient stone temple or a pair of loud striped socks? All of which makes Dr. Sacks's stories that much more irresistible, but also takes away the old cod-liver-oil excuse for liking him: ''I learn so much about science!'' OF course, Dr. Sacks doesn't stop at telling stories. He also engages in a kind of cerebral yoga, asking questions about the deep meaning of the conditions he describes. If you lose your ability to perceive the world through ear and eye, can life be properly narrated through touch? What is the link between color and emotion? He forces his audience to identify with the people he portrays, to parse themselves and find the threads of autism, confusion and blind-sight within; alternatively, he makes his audience wistful, realizing that the people on the syndromic outposts possess perspectives and talents -- the genius of necessity -- that those on the lazy hump of the bell curve utterly lack. Such empathy, though, can go only so far. In the end, many viewers may feel quietly grateful that they are not the subjects portrayed: They're not going blind. They're not trapped in an obsessive fixation on electrical outlets. In that sense, too, Dr. Sacks's work may echo the appeal of the sideshow or even the horror film: you encounter anomalous people, immerse yourself in their predicament, thrill to the extremity of it and its intimations of helplessness, loss, sorrow, death -- and then walk away. ''We all live with fears about bodily integrity, about being disfigured and becoming hideous,'' said David A. Gerber, professor of history at the State University of New York in Buffalo, who has studied the images of the disabled in American films. ''One of the ways to deal with those fears is to live them at a remove. That's part of the psychological attraction of freak shows and horror movies. They allow us to act out dangers to our physical integrity and security without having to experience them.'' Even Dr. Sacks's philosophical bent, his effort to divine the subtext or revelatory gist of a syndrome like autism or Tourette's, harks back to an ancient practice, that of ascribing profound symbolic or religious significance to the oddities among us. In the Middle Ages, the deformed were seen as examples of either God's wrath or the glorification of His power. Dwarfs kept company with princes; hermaphrodites were considered seers. In a not dissimilar vein, Dr. Sacks asks the question about Williams syndrome: ''Should we try to force them into our own categories or see them as unique, distinctive forms of life?'' But perhaps what should be questioned, in exploring the sum of Dr. Sacks's allure, is whether one species of curiosity is purer or more tasteful than another. Not long ago, I wrote an article about conjoined, or Siamese, twins and the debate over whether separation surgery was always the best course. In reporting the article, I met with Lori and Reba Schappell, sisters in their mid-30's who are joined at the head. I felt justified, almost smug, in my use of them for the story. I wasn't exploiting their condition for its lurid value, I told myself; I was giving the Schappells a chance to have their say about wanting to stay conjoined. The three of us walked around a Pennsylvania shopping mall and ate lunch at Ruby Tuesday's. Everybody we passed stared, jaws practically agape. And I remember thinking: ''Don't these people have any manners? Do they think they're at the circus? How can they be so cruel?'' But when I later talked about my experience with Dr. Dreger, who has written about conjoined twins, she pointed out that part of why people stared was to try to make sense of what they were seeing, which admittedly wasn't obvious on first glance. ''The brain is used to categorizing, and when something doesn't fit any of the day-to-day boxes, you pause,'' she said. ''There's a wonderful rush in that, of being alive. It's like seeing an incredibly beautiful painting, or something completely new. It's interesting; it's exciting; it's literally mind-blowing -- it blows up the mind, it expands it.'' In his restless quest to understand the Other, that rebel box whose lid will not stay shut, Dr. Sacks makes the alien familiar and the familiar new, and if we thrill at the sight of a stranger, that is surely better than to turn away in revulsion or fear.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 113-> Q&A
Bright Venus Q. Why is Venus so much brighter in the sky than Mercury, which is closer to the Sun? A. Venus is brighter because it is much larger, because it has a reflective atmosphere and because it makes close approaches to Earth, said Joe Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History. First, Mercury is about 3,100 miles in diameter, compared with about 7,700 miles for Venus, Mr. Rao said. ''Second, there is no atmosphere surrounding Mercury, while Venus does have a thick atmosphere, composed chiefly of clouds of carbon dioxide,'' he said. ''These clouds have a very high reflectivity, causing Venus to appear to shine with great brilliance. ''And third, Venus can approach the Earth much more closely than Mercury,'' he said. ''In fact, Venus periodically can come closer to Earth than any other known celestial body, except for the Moon, as close as 25 million miles. All of these things allow Venus to shine more brightly than not just Mercury, but than any of the other planets in our solar system.'' Because Mercury and Venus are ''inferior'' planets, or planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is, they can show phases like those of the Moon, Mr. Rao said. ''When Mercury shines at its brightest for us, it appears through a telescope as a gibbous or nearly full phase,'' he said. ''When Venus appears to shine at its most brilliant for us, it appears in telescopes not as a nearly full phase, but rather as a slender crescent.'' C. CLAIBORNE RAY

Falcons Coach Dan Reeves returned to Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta yesterday, three days after being released following quadruple heart bypass surgery. A nurse administrator, Stacey Wheeler, said Reeves was admitted about 2 P.M. He just wasn't feeling well; he's resting, she said. Reeves was in stable condition, Wheeler said.

The Dell Computer Corporation, the top direct seller of personal computers, said yesterday that it would use America Online Inc.'s on-line service as the default Internet provider on its consumer computers sold in the United States and Canada. Dell began to ship America Online's software on computer disks with its Dimension and Inspiron computer systems yesterday. Early next year, Dell's computers will be pre-installed with the America Online service. Terms were not disclosed. America Online has signed agreements with other PC makers like the Compaq Computer Corporation to feature it as the default Internet provider. Dell said America Online would feature links to Dell's World Wide Web services.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 116-> COMPANY NEWS; MOTOROLA BUYS PHONE RESEARCH UNIT FROM LUCENT
Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest phone-equipment maker, said yesterday that it had sold its cellular phone research division, which it had planned to close, to Motorola Inc. for an undisclosed amount. About 300 of the original 500 workers at the unit, based in Piscataway, N.J., went to Motorola, while 160 will be dismissed and 40 resigned, Lucent said. Motorola took over the division, which conducts research and development on wireless phones, a week ago. The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal yesterday. The unit was left over from Lucent's joint venture with Royal Philips Electronics N.V., which ended in October.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 117-> Challenging the Conventional Stance on AIDS
From the very first hours of the AIDS crisis -- especially the confusing interval between 1981, when the first cases were reported, and 1982, when the mysterious blight was given a name -- there have been wild conspiracy theories. One theory fingered the Central Intelligence Agency for a failed biological war against Cuba that inadvertently backfired (scuba-diving operatives were said to have fumbled a lethal vial and broken it against a rock in Haiti). Another theory held that this was no new virus at all, but African swine fever, a deadly danger being hushed up by the powerful pork industry. Still another theory was that the virus had been engineered by Government scientists. Over the years, much of this early suspicion fell away. Or so it seemed. In fact, conspiracy peddlers still abound, especially among blacks. ''There's a whole host of African-American people who believe that H.I.V. is not the cause of AIDS,'' said Mario Cooper, founder of Leading for Life, an initiative to draft black and Hispanic leaders into the AIDS battle. Leading for Life is a project of the Harvard AIDS Institute. That fact was vividly demonstrated on Saturday at the Harlem AIDS Forum sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network. Throughout the afternoon, to thunderous applause and heartfelt approbation, speakers presented a score of assaults on AIDS orthodoxy. Of the dozen or so speakers, only one subscribed to the theory that H.I.V. was what was making people sick -- and he argued that it was being transmitted intentionally to blacks through World Health Organization vaccine programs, part of what he described as a genocidal project. ''Our goal was to allow people to hear the disparate perspectives, and do their own follow-up research,'' said Curtis Cost, who organized the event, attended by more than 150 people drawn mostly from Harlem. ''These are things that the public needs to hear, and you can't hear them on television and read them in the papers.'' While health care experts are frustrated by such entrenched fears, they acknowledge that African-Americans have a unique reason for distrusting health care providers. The notorious Tuskegee experiment, in which poor blacks were denied treatment for syphilis and then monitored by Federal researchers, was the most egregious example, but many older American blacks can recall segregated doctors' offices and hospitals, or have experienced substandard medical treatment they attribute to discrimination in the years since. In a survey of African-Americans conducted last year by the Institute of Minority Health Research at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, 74 percent of blacks believed they were very likely or somewhat likely to be used by doctors as guinea pigs without their consent. In the survey, 18 percent said they believed H.I.V. was an engineered microbe, and nearly 1 in 10 said AIDS was part of a plot to kill blacks. ''It's almost a gut reaction,'' said Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School who writes widely on African-Americans and the health care system. ''When people don't know science, and most people don't, it's not hard to convince them that something unsavory may be going on. And this becomes a conspiracy to get black people. That's how much they believe that doctors in the system want to kill them.'' The AIDS epidemic has been especially cruel to blacks. Although they make up only 13 percent of the nation's population, blacks accounted for 57 percent of all new infections last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual AIDS case rate among African-American women is 16 times that of white women, while 1 out of 50 of the nation's black men is believed to be infected with H.I.V. There has also been good news. In the past two years, infections that occur as complications of H.I.V., have sharply fallen, thanks to powerful new AIDS drugs. But over all, fewer blacks than whites with H.I.V. are taking these drugs, which are expensive and require complicated schedules. Since 1995, AIDS death rates for whites have dropped by almost 70 percent. By contrast, black death rates have only fallen 58 percent. Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of AIDS programs at Harlem Hospital, said blacks with H.I.V. were more likely to demand evidence that a drug worked before taking it. ''Building trust takes time,'' she said. Mr. Cooper said AIDS was just now coming to the top of the community's political agenda, and said the Harlem Forum was part of a productive ''catharsis.'' Dennis DeLeon, director of the Latino Task Force on AIDS, agreed -- though he and Mr. Cooper both steered clear of the forum. ''I think it's a community trying to come to grips with the fact that this is an African-American epidemic,'' Mr. DeLeon said. Dr. Poussaint was less forgiving. ''This is destructive, very destructive,'' he said. ''If it gets people to stop getting tested, and engaging in safe sex, it's just very sad. Because this is a crisis situation in our community.'' Among the theories advanced throughout the afternoon, the only common thread was that AIDS was a hoax. Keidi Obi Awadu, an electric speaker on public health issues who also goes by the name ''The Conscious Rasta,'' advanced a fantastical scenario in which everything about AIDS was in question. It is not caused by H.I.V., he asserted. Indeed, it is no epidemic at all, only a series of unrelated health concerns that must be treated individually, he said. And the condoms that are supposed to safeguard instead cause illness, he said. ''Guess what,'' he told the rapt crowd, ''latex causes allergies. Latex causes antibodies. The more condoms you're exposed to, the more likely you are to test H.I.V. positive.'' Other speakers suggested that blacks in Harlem and Africa were being used as guinea pigs in some mysterious experimentation, or that the ultimate goal was depopulation of Africa in order to get to the deposits of precious metals there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took most of the heat, having been renamed by one speaker ''the Centers for Control by Diseases.'' Mr. Cost held the Federal agency partly responsible for perpetrating what he called a great myth: that viruses exist at all. ''Nobody can see them except for a handful of scientists with their microscopes, so we have to take their word for it,'' Mr. Cost said. When Mr. Cost asked for a showing of hands from people who thought H.I.V. caused AIDS, not one hand rose. Then he asked people to raise their hands if they believed AIDS was transmitted through sex. Nobody did. At times, the thrust of the six-hour gathering seemed to be an emotional plea to anyone with H.I.V. to stop taking their medication. Lynn Gannett, who identified herself as a data processor on an early research trial of the AIDS drug AZT, spoke in a quavering voice as she beseeched the audience. ''Please,'' she said, ''if you are on these pills or if your baby is taking them, stop. I beg you. The drugs can kill you.'' One of those at the forum, Bill McDougald, 49, a chauffeur, sought to make sense of it all. ''The Harlem community collectively feels that the information coming in is suspect,'' he said. Mr. Sharpton, summing it up, said: ''I don't agree with everything they may say, but I think people should hear it. There are in my community a disproportionate amount of victims.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 118-> Case Job Cuts Grow to 3,400 as Profit Falls
The Case Corporation, which eliminated 1,000 jobs in September because of weakening world demand for its farm equipment, cut an additional 2,400 jobs today and reduced its earnings forecast for 1998. The company said the worsening global slump had forced the manufacturer to take the additional action. The 3,400 job cuts now planned through the end of 1999 amount to nearly a fifth of the company's worldwide work force of 18,000. Factories in Hugo, Minn., and Hamilton, Ontario, will shut down by the end of next year, William Masterson, a Case spokesman, said. Earnings in 1998, previously forecast to decline by 25 percent, are expected to drop by almost 60 percent from last year's $396 million, Case said. Earnings in 1999 are expected to decline as well. The company said the reductions should save $95 million to $100 million a year, with two-thirds of the savings coming by 1999. Case shares fell 25 cents today, to $20.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 119-> Superbugs
It is shocking to learn that bacterial microbes have now adapted to our best available medical defenses, and shocking also to uncover a strain of paternalism that continues to infect the medical profession (''Superbugs,'' by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Aug. 2). According to your article, public-health professionals, privy to knowledge of consequence to all, unilaterally decided what to reveal of the truth and what not -- even to those people at immediate risk of infection. The rationale -- to stem public panic -- is tacitly accepted as ethically and pragmatically sound. Empowering alternatives to paternal attitudes that condone lying for the good of the public might be considered instead: developing stronger partnerships between professionals and nonprofessionals; committing resources to more effective public education.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 120-> Susan Graham Puts Pep in a Languid Past
LIKE Proust, his sometime lover, the composer Reynaldo Hahn was a figure of his time; and like Proust's writing, Hahn's music has a flavor so distinctive that for some listeners a little goes a long way. The title of Susan Graham's new recording of Hahn songs, ''La Belle Epoque'' (Sony Classical ASK 60168), accurately indicates that the music is the expression of a particular period in history. But Ms. Graham approaches this past in the spirit of the present, bringing an element of robustness to an inherently dainty table: a happy illustration of the best that can happen when an American singer interprets European music. Taking the songs at face value rather than seeking to capture a period style, Ms. Graham sings with a freshness and pep that ward off the incipient languor of Hahn's ''pastiche'' explorations of the idioms of bygone eras (like the opening ''A Chloris'') and filter some of the saccharin from his forays into a more operettalike idiom (''Mai''). In fairness, the recording does present a broad selection of Hahn's songs, more than half of them written before the composer, a prodigy, was 21. (He wrote his best-known song, ''Si Mes Vers Avaient des Ailes,'' which concludes this recording, at 13.) Having established a fin-de-siecle mode with the nostalgia of ''A Chloris'' (its accompaniment derived from the bass line of Bach's ''Air on the G String''), ''Le Rossignol de Lilas,'' another pretty evocation of the past, and the romantic effusions of ''L'Enamouree,'' Ms. Graham continues with a wide range of material. Thus, the predominance of languid, arpeggioed accompaniments (as in the lovely ''L'Heure Exquise'') or repeated chord progressions of 18th-century pastiches is offset by bursts of exuberance (''Le Printemps'') or moments of buffo drollery (''Quand Je Fus Pris au Pavillon''). Ms. Graham manages the feat, difficult for a foreign singer, of maintaining both vocal color and accurate French vowels. Here, as on the opera stage, she produces a warm tone without artificially ''darkening'' the voice; and it's commendable that she avoids the overly melodramatic. In fact, she sometimes errs in the opposite direction, pulling back too far (although this tendency is not to be confused with a mannered and deliberate lightness, which she also avoids). Because she sometimes leans into the notes, her delicate high notes, like the G on ''parmi'' in the last line of ''Fetes Galantes,'' can sound on first hearing as if they weren't in line with the rest of the voice, although they are. Her diction is generally good, if smacking a bit of the textbook in places; and her vibrato is rapid. But these are nitpicking observations about a recording that will bear repeated hearings and shows a singer making a worthwhile foray into a less-known repertory. Musically and temperamentally, Roger Vignoles, the pianist, is a good match for Ms. Graham, playing with firmness and subdued energy to bring a spark to potentially precious pastiches.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 121-> Can 'the Coach' Change Tactics?
Battered by the resignations under fire of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston in just two months, House Republicans have picked a little-known, untested Midwesterner to serve as their next Speaker. J. Dennis Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach, has a reputation as a conciliator and technocrat who can work with members of both parties. Such qualities could do much to help the next Congress rise above the partisan rancor of the last year -- but only if Mr. Hastert shows his independence from the mean-spirited tactics of his chief backers, especially Tom DeLay, the Republican whip. In his 12 years in Congress, Mr. Hastert has been a shrewd and popular backbencher with strong positions on only a handful of issues. Few say he has a clear philosophy like that of Mr. Gingrich or knowledge of government like that of Mr. Livingston, who served as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee before his designation as Speaker a month ago. As chairman of an oversight committee on national security, Mr. Hastert devoted himself almost exclusively to combating drugs. In the last budget, he unapologetically won a $250,000 subsidy for the maker of a caffein-laden chewing gum in his district. He has also championed some patient rights in health care reform. It is rare for the country to have someone with such a limited background vault into the position of third in line of succession to the Presidency. Even so, Mr. Hastert's potential as a successful Speaker should not be dismissed. He is getting this chance because House Republicans were rocked by public reaction to their insistence on impeaching Mr. Clinton instead of censuring him. The Republicans are at least showing some sensitivity by reaching beyond the Southern hard-liners for this leadership position. The trouble with Mr. Hastert's sudden emergence is that his most recent service has been as deputy whip under Mr. DeLay, whose scorched-earth tactics forced Mr. Livingston to abandon an initial promise to let the House vote on the censure option. If Mr. Hastert hopes for reconciliation, he needs to renounce such partisan tactics, especially since Republicans have only a six-vote majority in the next Congress. The other challenge facing Mr. Hastert is to restore a measure of maturity and stability to his party. He can set an example for his House and the White House in avoiding what Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader, called the politics of personal destruction. The important business of the next Congress, including rescue of Social Security and steps to insulate the United States from the global recession, cannot succeed without bipartisan support. There will be no room for partisan solutions rammed through the House, accompanied by demands for party loyalty. Mr. Hastert is known as ''the coach'' to his colleagues. He should remember that his team will include all House members, not just the few who plucked him from obscurity to serve as Speaker.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 122-> Taking the Wild Kingdom for a Spin
TWO years ago, the judges at Paris's Concours Bagatelle classic car show were considering two finalists: One was an obsidian-black 1937 Alfa Romeo 8C2900 B Corto Spider, owned by John Mozart of San Francisco, that had won the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Its seats were slathered with glove-soft red cowhide. The other was also an Alfa Spider, belonging to a Mexican businessman, Arturo Keller, that flaunted luridly blue two-tone upholstery made from stingrays. The judges sniffed disdainfully at the stingrays. One of them, Uwe Bahnsen, said, ''We decided that we had never seen blue stingrays.'' Mr. Keller is said to have responded indignantly, ''Well, I have never seen a red cow!'' Welcome to the technicolor charnel house of exotic automotive leathers. While cowhide is now seen as a luxury, in the early days of the automobile it was virtually the only choice for seats. The unpretentious Ford Model T snuffled off the assembly line with hide-covered benches. In the 20's and 30's, custom coach builders availed themselves of a menagerie of hides, from anteater to zebra, to distinguish their artworks from assembly-line hoi polloi. ''You could special-order anything you wanted from coach builders like Hispano-Suiza or Saoutchik.'' said Ken Nemanic, owner of Vintage Automotive Upholstery in Walnut Creek, Calif., and the premier needle-and-thread man in the billion-dollar classic car restoration industry. ''Saoutchik used all kinds of exotic skin.'' Mr. Nemanic recently added brown alligator skins to the seats of a 1938 Bugatti Type 57 SC with a Corsica body. The Bugatti, owned by Mr. Mozart, won the overall best-in-show award at the Pebble Beach concours last weekend. Perhaps you'd be interested in cranberry lizard, burgundy frog or taupe wildebeest? Practically anything that swims, flies or crawls can be turned into colorful leather to tart up that plain-jane Duesenberg. There are exceptions. Many vintage race cars used elephant hide, which is no longer available. In fact, about a quarter of exotic skins are poached, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Another drawback to these rare skins is their size. ''If you're talking about frogs,'' said Sid Chavers, a renowned hot-rod upholsterer, ''you need a whole bunch of them.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 123-> Q. & A.
Adding To a Patio In a Condo Q: I live on the second floor of a two-story condominium. The first-floor unit owners have a patio of about 6 feet by 8 feet, or 48 square feet. Some first-floor owners have increased their patio area by 400 square feet by adding a 20- by 20-foot addition. I believe this was done with the approval of the board of managers. As a unit owner, however, I own part of the common ground these patio extensions were built on. Can I use this new patio area for my family gatherings? . . . Salvatore Coppola, Brewster, N.Y. A: Andrew S. Berkman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said it was likely that the board of managers of the letter writer's condominium had sanctioned an ''unlawful'' surrender of common land. Mr. Berkman said that the state's Condominium Act addresses the issue of common elements in condominiums including common land, yards, gardens and recreational and community facilities. The law, he said, provides that such common elements -- which are generally described in the declaration of condominium -- shall have a permanent character and shall not be altered without an amendment to the declaration and the consent of all unit owners affected. ''I assume that Mr. Coppola has not so agreed,'' Mr. Berkman said. Moreover, he said, the law also provides that no individual unit owner may encroach on the rights of other unit owners. Accordingly, Mr. Berkman said, it would appear that the first-floor unit owners have enlarged their existing patios at the expense of other unit owners without following the dictates and requirements of the Condominium Act. As a result, he said, it is unlikely that those unit owners have any exclusive right to use the extended patios. At the same time, however, Mr. Berkman said, unless the declaration of condominium permits ''family gatherings'' on common property, Mr. Coppola would not have any legal right to use the property for such purposes either. Paying Off A Co-op Loan Q: In New York City, a home owner who pays off a mortgage should file a satisfaction of the mortgage in the county where the property was situated. Does a co-op shareholder who pays off a co-op loan (without selling the apartment) have to make a similar filing? After paying off a co-op loan, does a shareholder have to do anything besides keep the documents that the lender returns? I am wondering, for instance, whether the co-op corporation is notified that the shares are no longer encumbered by the loan and that the recognition agreement between the co-op and the lender is no longer valid. . . . Eric R. Wirth, Manhattan. A: Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that shares to a co-op apartment are considered personal property and that loans to a shareholder are typically secured by a pledge of stock certificates and the proprietary lease. Mr. Greenstein added that when a lender provides a borrower with money to purchase or refinance a co-op apartment, the lender usually requires the shareholder to sign a document known as a UCC-1 financing statement. That document is then filed with either the county register or county clerk where the co-op is situated. The document provides notice to the world that the loan is secured by the shares to the apartment. When the loan is paid in full, another form is filed -- a form known as a UCC-3 termination statement -- terminating the UCC-1 lien. Mr. Greenstein said that when a shareholder borrows money, another document is also required -- a recognition agreement. That document is signed by the shareholder, the lender and the co-op corporation, and it outlines the respective rights and obligations of the parties. When the share loan is satisfied, he said, the recognition agreement ceases to have any force or effect. Generally speaking, Mr. Greenstein said, the co-op corporation does not receive notice of the satisfaction of a loan, except when a shareholder sells an apartment or refinances a loan and needs a new recognition agreement.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 124-> COLLEGES: MEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP -- PUERTO RICO HOLIDAY CLASSIC; Sooners Win on Forfeit After Elbow Spurs Fight
A vicious elbow that knocked an Oklahoma player to the floor was followed by some pushing and shoving and then a rare forfeit victory was declared yesterday in San Juan, P.R. Ramon Gomez of American University of Puerto Rico hit Oklahoma's Tim Heskett in the head with an elbow with 5 minutes 2 seconds left in the first half of the opening-round game of the Puerto Rico Holiday Classic yesterday. When Oklahoma coaches ran to Heskett, who was on the floor in front of American's bench, some pushing started among coaches and players, and Referee Eric Harmon, intent on keeping order, declared the 23d-ranked Sooners, who were leading by 39-10 at the time, 2-0 winners by forfeit. Our kids had been coming back to the huddle saying there were some cheap shots going on, Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson said. When that happened at the five-minute mark, the kid swung at Tim and missed him, then stopped and turned around and premeditated the next one. He really connected. Sampson said that Heskett, a 6-foot-1-inch sophomore guard, might have a concussion and was under the care of the team physician, Dr. Brock Schnebel. The incident occurred when the Sooners (7-1) were in transition, with Heskett trailing the play on the left sideline. Gomez, a 6-1 guard, then hit Heskett in front of the American bench. Sampson quickly went to his player's side, with assistant coaches and several reserve players in tow. Screaming quickly escalated to shoving, as Heskett lay dazed on the court. American's Oscar Chiamarillo, an ineligible player from last year's team and now a student assistant coach, went after Sampson but the sides were separated without further scuffling. But Harmon had seen enough. The coaches were about to get into it, Harmon said right after the game. The American Coach Rafael Torres said that there had been some jostling between Gomez and Heskett before the elbow. On the other side of the court, their player was hitting Gomez and the referee saw that but didn't do anything, he said, referring to Heskett. Gomez was mad at him. When they were coming down court they were very close together, and Gomez hit him with the elbow. Then the coach from the other team came to our bench and was going after Gomez. All of their team came to our bench. Torres said that Gomez would not play in today's consolation round game. I don't teach my players to fight, Torres said. He acted out of frustration. Oklahoma will play Mississippi in today's semifinals. American (0-6) plays St. Joseph's. The National Collegiate Athletic Association said that its statistics department does not keep records of games that were forfeited because of fighting. It is, however, highly unusual for such a thing to happen. Mississippi 66, St. Joseph's 61: Keith Carter scored 13 of his 17 points in the second half and Mississippi (8-2) shot 60 percent for the game in a victory over St. Joseph's (3-4) in another opening-round game. Ohio State 71, Alabama-Birmingham 64: Michael Redd had 28 points and 12 rebounds to lead Ohio State (8-2) to a victory over Alabama-Birmingham (7-4) in the opening round. The Buckeyes will play North Carolina State in tonight's semifinals. Redd hit consecutive jumpers to give Ohio State a 30-28 lead and then added two free throws for 18 points as the Buckeyes took a 34-31 halftime lead. North carolina State 91, Middle Tennessee State 59: The freshman Adam Harrington scored 17 points, leading North Carolina State (8-2) to a victory over Middle Tennessee State (2-7) in the opening round. The Blue Raiders started the game with an Ali McGhee 3-pointer, but never led again after a Tim Wells jumper and Harrington layup gave the Wolfpack a 4-3 lead. STANFORD INVITATIONAL stanford 82, Elon College 58: Kris Weems hit six 3-pointers and scored 20 points as No. 6 Stanford (8-2) eased to a victory over Elon College (3-6) in the first round of the Stanford Invitational. The Cardinal will face William &Mary or Santa Clara in the championship game tonight. With his six 3-pointers, Weems moved into second place on the school career list with 159. He surpassed Terry Taylor, who had 156 3-pointers from 1985-89, and trails the 241 hit by Dion Cross from 1992 to 1996. David Moseley hit four 3-pointers and scored 15 points for Stanford, which also got 15 from Tim Young. NEW MEXICO 90 MCNEESE STATE 46 No. 11 New Mexico (8-0), finishing up one of the softest early season schedules in school history, dismantled cold-shooting McNeese State (1-7) behind the combined 50 points of Lamont Long and Kenny Thomas in Albuquerque, N.M. PEARL HARBOR CLASSIC Michigan State 79, Pepperdine 67: Mateen Cleaves and Charlie Bell keyed a 19-8 run at the start of the second half, enabling No. 15 Michigan State (7-3) to run away from Pepperdine (6-4) in the opening game of the Pearl Harbor Classic in Laie, Hawaii. With the Waves leading, 36-35, at halftime, the backcourt tandem for Michigan State took over the scoring load from Morris Peterson, who finished with 18 points. SETON HALL 85, ARMY 44 Gary Saunders scored 11 of his game-high 22 points in the first half as Seton Hall (8-3) raced to a 28-point lead and went on to its sixth straight victory, over Army (2-9). The Pirates have now won eight of their last nine. Seton Hall, which led, 43-17, at halftime, held Army to 5 points over the first 15 minutes. Earlier, the Pirates announced that center Damian Dawkins would miss the rest of the season after experiencing dizziness and headaches. The 6-10 freshman has not played since fainting during practice on Dec. 4. Doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York said that the problem might be related to an irregular heartbeat or an enlarged heart. CLEMSON 72 SOUTH CAROLINA STATE 47 Harold Jamison scored a season-high 19 points on 8-of-8 shooting and No. 16 Clemson (10-1) continued its lopsided series against visiting South Carolina State (4-5).

''ESCAPE to Tanglewood,'' advertisements have beckoned this season with determined optimism and perhaps a touch of defiance. Escape? After all the turmoil in the wake of the last season? Tanglewood is, to be sure, many things: first and foremost, a festival and retreat of the Boston Symphony Orchestra here in the idyllic Berkshire Hills, at the opposite end of the state, seemingly the opposite end of the planet, from its urban base. So when several respected teachers at the orchestra's venerable training institute, the Tanglewood Music Center, loudly and angrily resigned late last year in response to a redirection of the center's activities by Seiji Ozawa, the longtime music director of the Boston Symphony, it was not clear how much the average festivalgoer's experience would be affected, if at all. Then a new book, ''Tanglewood: The Clash Between Tradition and Change,'' by Andrew L. Pincus, the music critic of The Berkshire Eagle, in nearby Pittsfield, Mass., questioned not only the recent handling of the music center but also what Mr. Pincus saw as heightened commercialism at the festival as a whole. Tanglewood, he suggested, was caught in the grip of a worsening identity crisis, as ''one of the most ambitious music festivals in the United States and one of the most staid, . . . the home of the East Coast's most important contemporary-music festival and the purveyor of stars and easy-listening fare for tourists, . . . a highly pressurized school for the cream of the world's young musicians and . . . a theme park of classical music.'' Yet as the Boston Symphony season winds down, ending next weekend in a series of collaborations with the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, the orchestra has managed to put a good face on most things. Indeed, virtually every veteran of past seasons encountered in visits here throughout the summer attested that with Mr. Ozawa, who studied at the center in 1960, more closely involved in its activities than ever before, this has been one of the most rewarding festival seasons in recent memory. ''This year is noticeably better than previous years in musical results, attendance and enthusiasm,'' said Andre Previn, who conducted the Boston Symphony on two weekends and coached conducting at the music center. The youthful Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra produced spectacular performances in works by John Adams, Elliott Carter, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and others at the Festival of Contemporary Music, two weeks ago, as it had in several concerts of more standard fare. The Boston Symphony concerts have by and large been well attended (though the record set last year may be safe) and favorably received. The interaction between the music center and the parent orchestra seems to have developed fresh synergy and generated excitement on both sides. Even the weather has usually cooperated. (But blast those infernal mosquitoes!) ''Overall, it's going well this summer,'' said Daniel R. Gustin, the assistant managing director of the Boston Symphony and the manager of Tanglewood, in one of the more grudging assessments. MR. GUSTIN'S restraint is understandable; he was personally and professionally close to administrators and faculty members now departed, including Richard Ortner, who was fired as administrative director of the music center two years ago and was recently named president of the Boston Conservatory; Gilbert Kalish, the pianist, who resigned as chairman of the faculty last November, and Leon Fleisher, the pianist and conductor, who resigned as artistic director of the music center in December. Mr. Gustin's role has also been curtailed. Ellen Highstein, who was named director of the music center last November, reports not to him, as Mr. Ortner did, but to Mark Volpe, who took over as managing director of the Boston Symphony a year ago. ''It has been a difficult summer,'' Mr. Gustin said with obvious understatement. Difficult on some level for everyone, it seems. Last year the Juilliard String Quartet introduced its newest member, Ronald Copes, the second violinist, at Tanglewood, and this year it presented an intensive two-week quartet seminar at the start of the music center season. Meanwhile, Joel Krosnick, the group's cellist, also resigned from the center's faculty in sympathy with Mr. Kalish, a longtime friend and collaborator. But Joel Smirnoff, the first violinist, stayed on to coach chamber music. ''The break has been painful,'' Mr. Smirnoff said. ''It's hard for us all. But great things are happening, and the biggest thing is that Seiji Ozawa has taken a hold.'' Obviously, those still connected with the festival have little to gain from speaking ill of current trends or dwelling on persisting problems. And of course, the Boston Symphony was eager to put forward players, faculty members and others who would give developments a positive spin, as they almost invariably did. Still, the unanimity as to the depth and quality of Mr. Ozawa's involvement in the music center season, which ended on Wednesday, was striking. ''It's been wonderful,'' said Phyllis Curtin, the soprano, who directs the vocal program. ''His decision to become more involved was perfectly reasonable. This place becomes a part of you, and now that he has reached the top of his profession here and abroad, he wants to become a part of it.'' Others, too, have speculated that a concern with his legacy has helped drive Mr. Ozawa's increased attention to the music center in recent years. Ms. Curtin's program, in any case, has been a particular beneficiary, with acclaimed productions of Britten's ''Peter Grimes'' in 1996 and Poulenc's ''Mammelles de Tiresias'' last summer, both conducted by Mr. Ozawa. This year, before he left, two weeks ago, to take up his other major summer commitment, the Saito Kinen Festival in Japan, Mr. Ozawa was by all accounts omnipresent at the music center. He hovered over registration at the start and often ate with the students in the cafeteria. He led or sat in on coaching sessions, rehearsals and performances. He conducted at the contemporary festival for the first time. And with him, Boston Symphony players have established a much stronger presence at the music center, harking back, some say, to the time of the sainted Serge Koussevitzky, who founded the festival in 1934 and the Berkshire Music Center, predecessor to the Tanglewood Music Center, in 1940. This season, symphony players coached at the center and sat in on orchestral rehearsals and performances; some even drew their young charges into rehearsals and performances of the Boston Symphony. Some 40 symphony players were involved; 10 or 12 more were turned away, too much for the system to accommodate. To judge from the evident excitement of several of the symphony players, this initiative may be just the shot in the arm needed by an orchestra whose individual members not infrequently look and sound bored with their work. ''I've never been more tired or more fulfilled,'' said Lawrence Wolfe, a double bassist from the symphony, who had just spent most of his waking hours for two weeks at the center and had joined its orchestra on electric bass in a performance of Bernstein's ''Songfest.'' It would go too far, no doubt, to see in the orchestra's early and amicable contract settlement, reached last month at Tanglewood, a nascent era of peace and good will. But many see the spirit of this summer, extended into the future, as a big part of the solution to whatever morale problems may exist in the orchestra. ''It's been a huge change,'' said Douglas Yeo, the bass trombonist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. ''The whole flow of Tanglewood is much more B.S.O.-centric.'' Mr. Yeo and others said that for a decade or more, they had felt shut out of the music center, with its great emphasis on chamber music. ''Yes, they were shut out,'' said Mr. Ortner, the former administrator of the center. ''Seiji Ozawa always said that he wanted a better orchestra. There is general agreement that the way to improve an orchestra is to beef up the string players, and the best way to do that was through chamber music.'' There was a widespread feeling at the center, too, that symphony players were not eager to become involved, any more than their music director was. ''Perhaps we could have reached out more, but they never asked to be included,'' Mr. Kalish said. ''And as for Ozawa, it was hard to get him to commit time to the music center. He was great with young people, and we wanted him involved, but he never stayed for the new-music festival. So there was a separation, not chosen by us.'' Mr. Ozawa became music director of the Boston Symphony in 1973 and always had the option to take full control of the center. Three years earlier, with an infirm William Steinberg as the orchestra's music director, Mr. Ozawa had been appointed artistic director of the Tanglewood Festival, with Leonard Bernstein as artistic adviser, and the composer and conductor Gunther Schuller as co-director of the Berkshire Music Center. Mr. Schuller was given full control in 1974. Mr. Fleisher succeeded Mr. Schuller as artistic director of the center in 1984. A restructuring and diminution of his responsibilities was being discussed before he resigned last year. It would have resulted in a largely honorific position in which he would have reported to Ms. Highstein, the new director of the music center. Mr. Fleisher did not return repeated phone calls. ''This is something Mr. Ozawa could have done, and arguably should have done, in 1984, when Gunther Schuller left,'' Mr. Ortner said of the maestro's taking control of the music center. Or if not then, perhaps in 1990, after the death of Leonard Bernstein, suggested Mr. Volpe, the managing director of the Boston Symphony, who was the executive director of the Detroit Symphony while the Tanglewood troubles were brewing. Bernstein -- with Koussevitzy and Aaron Copland, the other great historic figurehead at Tanglewood -- maintained a connection at the center in relatively brief jaunts and conducted his final concert at Tanglewood, with the Boston Symphony. ''There was a vacancy here,'' Mr. Volpe said, referring to a gap more spiritual than material left by Bernstein's death, ''and it was a missed opportunity.'' As it happened, the fracas generally cited as a watershed in Tanglewood's time of troubles had Bernsteinian overtones. In 1994, Mr. Ozawa involved himself and the Music Center Orchestra in ''Marsalis on Music,'' a major video project with the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and Sony Classical. A series of tapes of an innocuously educational sort, it was vaguely modeled on Bernstein's Young People's Concerts. ''It was the kind of thing Lenny would have grabbed at in a minute,'' said Ms. Highstein, who was the executive director of the Concert Artists Guild in New York before becoming director of the music center. ''Everybody would have been on the bandwagon.'' When Mr. Ozawa grabbed at the project, he reaped a whirlwind of faculty complaints that the two-week recording project had left students exhausted and the music center schedule in a shambles. ''I felt strongly about the Marsalis thing,'' said Mr. Krosnick, of the Juilliard String Quartet. ''I said to Richard Ortner, 'This is not healthy.' But he and Dan Gustin defended Mr. Ozawa to the hilt. They were unfailingly loyal. 'Seiji wants this,' they said.'' It did not help that the videos ran into production problems and were from the outset widely judged a failure as either art or entertainment. ''Nobody had any complaints beforehand,'' said Richard Dyer, the music critic of The Boston Globe. ''The uproar all started after the project was underway, when everyone saw that it was eating up time and wasn't very good. If it had turned out well, there would have been no complaints.'' Mr. Ozawa, for his part, declined to say much about the troubles of the recent past. As for his failure to take a hand sooner, he explained that for a long time he did not feel comfortable teaching conducting, so he did not see a clear-cut role for himself at the music center, and withdrew. But more than five years ago, he began to feel that a complacency had set in, that major changes were needed. ''It would take great energy, and I wasn't sure it was possible,'' he said. ''But when colleagues took me aside and said the same thing, I realized it had to be done, and I was the only one who could do it.'' Those departed from the music center cite evidence, often at second or third hand, that Mr. Ozawa read faculty complaints as disloyalty rather than honest professional disagreements. Those close to Mr. Ozawa say that what finally moved him to action was a sense that too much power had concentrated in Mr. Ortner's hands, partly because others were slacking off on their jobs; that Mr. Ortner had developed a sense of ownership, and that a clubby atmosphere had grown up around him. Either way, Mr. Ortner, the would-be peacemaker, became a lightning rod. Mr. Ozawa fired him in 1996, and prominent faculty members began to see the handwriting on the wall. Matters only worsened last summer, when Mr. Ozawa continued to press for change, however well or ill defined, and met with resistance. ''The idea that change was needed was laughable,'' Julius Levine, a veteran double bassist and yet another faculty member who resigned, insists to this day. ''The program needed absolutely no changes.'' TO hear some of the students tell it, insurrection against the administration was in the air, over an issue whose complexity well represents the quagmire of miscommunications and contradictions that awaits anyone trying to get to the bottom of the controversy. Orchestral programming, the students said, left many of them, especially brass players, with little to do but chamber music (where there is also relatively little for brass players to do). This year brought Valhalla, with big pieces like Mahler's Sixth Symphony, Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' and Bernstein's ''Songfest.'' The root of the problem, Mr. Ortner and Mr. Kalish both argued, is that Mr. Ozawa decreed years ago that the center's orchestral programming should remain squarely based in the Classical repertory: Mozart and Beethoven, mostly. ''It was out of my hands,'' Mr. Kalish said. What was a poor brass player to do? ''I don't believe that this story has villains,'' Ms. Highstein said. That theory is convenient, but it may also be accurate. Even those most strongly opposed to the outcome of Mr. Ozawa's actions grant that he had every right to take them and that if he keeps up his level of commitment, he will undoubtedly succeed. Nor are there unblemished heroes. Even those most strongly in agreement that actions like Mr. Ozawa's were necessary grant that the matter was handled badly, especially in the peremptory, inadequately explained firing of the popular Mr. Ortner. ''One good thing that will come of this is that there is no way now that they will let it fail,'' said Mr. Gustin, the Tanglewood manager. ''The staff of the music center has been doubled. The budget has been increased. The Boston Symphony Orchestra will not let this be diminished in any way, and that's good and healthy, however painful.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 126-> Surviving Desperation Weeks Without Making a Fool of Yourself, or Worse
JIM CRAINE has a number of remedies for Desperation Weeks, but only one cure. ''That's to go to the beach every day, stay all day and enjoy the heck out of it,'' he said. ''Sure, it gets hot, it gets cold, but it never gets old. Why do you think I've been a lifeguard for most of my life? I tell people: 'You should see my office. What a view!' '' Born and reared in Atlantic City, Mr. Craine, 43, has been a member of the Beach Patrol there for 24 of his 43 years. In the colder months, he performs as a singer and comedian in casino lounges in Atlantic City and in Nevada at Lake Tahoe, and on Caribbean cruise ships. These are some of his suggestions for beating the end-of-summer blues: * Go to a lifeguard bar. ''Locally, it's Moloney's in Margate. The guy who owns the place is an ex-lifeguard, and so we go there because it's like family. You see that all over the shore: a lifeguard falls in love with the beach and opens a bar that automatically becomes cool because anybody who has been a lifeguard is permanently cool.'' * Start conversations with the worst pickup line you can think of. ''When a good-looking lady came up to me at the end of the summer and asked me where was a good place to go at night, I'd say my house. That line worked with everybody but the girl I married.'' * If you must binge . . . ''The bars in Atlantic City never close. My favorite is the Irish Pub. They have free parking, the food's cheap and they have rooms upstairs where you can sleep it off for less than $25 a night.'' * Best way to win in a casino: ''Don't gamble.'' * Best way to handle the police: ''Say 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir' and 'I won't do it again.' Shore cops are fierce at the end of the summer. I had a friend who got pulled over for drunk bicycle riding. He hit three parked cars. He said it wasn't his fault.'' * Go to a restaurant that doesn't have a line. ''They're out there, and not hard to find. I like the Black Forest, a German restaurant on the third floor of the Ocean One Mall. It has a great view of the beach, imported beers, bratwurst to die for.'' * Don't give in to despair. ''Go on the Great Nor'easter roller coaster in Wildwood, and I guarantee it'll take your mind off whatever was bumming you out. It's cheaper than Prozac.'' * Visit public libraries. ''They're quiet when nothing else is.'' * Avoid trysts under boardwalks. ''We call it the Underwood Hotel in Atlantic City. Every room is oceanfront, but you have to watch your bag at night.'' * Where to go when you've had one too many: ''The Boardwalk, where nobody walks a straight line.'' * Remember, the best souvenirs are free. ''Remember that seashell collection you had when you were a kid? There are plenty more shells where they came from.'' * If you must spend money: ''Pick up an 'I Lost My Shirt in Atlantic City' T-shirt. You'll be glad you did.'' * Take the back roads home. ''Who wants to get stuck in traffic at a toll booth on the Garden State Parkway for a half an hour just to pay for the privilege of getting stuck at the next toll booth 20 miles up the road? The back roads might be slower, but at least you feel like you're going someplace. Stop and buy some Jersey tomatoes from a produce stand, and just try not to eat them all on the way back.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 127-> COMPANY NEWS; DOCUMENT MANAGER RENEWS PACT WITH HOSPITAL ALLIANCE
The Standard Register Company, a provider of document-management products and services, said yesterday that it had renewed a five-year contract worth $700 million with Premier Inc., the nation's largest hospital purchasing alliance. Under the agreement, Premier will receive business forms and the option of using Standard's Internet-based electronic commerce and document management service. Standard Register, based in Dayton, Ohio, is a business data management company with 12-month revenue of $1.28 billion. Premier, based in San Diego, handles a total of about $10 billion in purchases annually for about 1,800 hospitals around the United States.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 128-> SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1998; TRANE SPOTTING
Thirty years ago this month, when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia, the American sculptor Bradford Graves was in the country finishing up a sculpture honoring John Coltrane, a fave of the jazz-loving Slovaks. Graves returned to New York, leaving behind his 8-ton ''Trane'' (pictured), which the Slovaks pragmatically renamed ''Spirit of Comradely Love.'' Before Graves died earlier this year, Scott Rogers, an American living in Prague, went looking to see if the work survived. He found it in Vysne Ruzbachy, a spa town in eastern Slovakia. ''We put a photo of three of Trane's favorite sidemen at its base,'' Rogers says, ''with flowers.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 129-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Schools Make International Effort
Tom Green is a well-respected basketball coach who guided Fairleigh Dickinson to the Northeast Conference tournament championship and an appearance in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament last season. But six of his players graduated, leaving a void at forward and center. ''If we're just going to recruit in New Jersey, in the metro area or in the East, it's impossible for me to get a 6-10 player that can play a little bit,'' Green said Sunday after practice at the Rothman Center in Hackensack, N.J. ''He's going to be over-recruited, especially if he's a good student.'' Fairleigh Dickinson, seven miles from Manhattan but far away from college basketball's elite, must fight Seton Hall, Rutgers and St. John's for local talent. It usually loses. ''We've been knocking our heads out for years trying to get that caliber of player,'' Green said. ''So to look across the water, so to speak, and to bring somebody over who has some size to him is something that you'll probably see a lot more of as the years go on.'' Green added five international players this season to the two he already had. Four have received substantial playing time, leading F.D.U. to a 4-3 record entering tonight's game at St. John's. Colleges have been recruiting foreign players for decades, but lower-profile schools such as Fairleigh Dickinson are taking their global search to the extreme. St. Francis of Brooklyn has eight foreign-born players, and George Washington University has 11. All three are in urban areas where more prestigious rivals lure the better local players. ''You don't have to confine yourself to America to find the talent you need,'' said Wim Van de Keere, a 6-foot-7-inch Belgian who was recruited with his twin brother, Tom, to F.D.U. Green said a few alumni objected to not allocating more scholarships for local athletes, but he explained to them that basketball's borders were torn down long ago. He said that his foreign athletes were excellent students and were often more worldly than their American teammates. St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis built a winner at George Washington using many foreign athletes. ''It was a chance to be creative and a way to level the playing field,'' said Jarvis, who directed the Colonials to a 24-9 record and the N.C.A.A. tournament last season with 10 foreign-born players. F.D.U.'s Green recently hired Rob Orellana, an international recruiting specialist who helped Coach Ron Ganulin work a minor miracle at St. Francis. The Terriers went from a record of 1-26 in 1993-94 to last season's 15-12 mark, their best in 20 years. St. Francis, whose roster includes Spanish, Latin American, Estonian and Cameroonian players, is 5-3 and is expected to contend for the Northeast Conference title. Dr. James Adams, St. Francis' dean of students, has given Ganulin carte blanche to recruit internationally, as long as the prospects are solid students and Ganulin stays within the school's $2 million operating budget for basketball. (Maryland-Baltimore County, a new entrant in the Northeast Conference, has a budget of $9 million, according to Adams.) Adams said he felt stung by the departure of Venezuela's Roque Osorio, the team's best player, to a professional league after just half a season last year. But he has accepted the practice of recruiting overseas and praised Ganulin for his ambition. ''Personally, I have mixed feelings,'' Adams said. ''I'm somewhat reluctant to see the nature of the team different than the nature of the student body it represents. If I had my druthers, I'd love to see everyone coming from Brooklyn.'' But he conceded that the school had no realistic alternative to remain competitive in Division I. Adams predicted that the trend of smaller colleges stockpiling overseas talent would continue. Orellana agreed, saying it is cost-effective. He does most of his work through an extensive phone network and buys cheap off-season airline tickets abroad that are less expensive than trips to California, he said. Many of Europe's high school stars now attend the summer basketball camps scouted by college coaches. And Fairleigh Dickinson can sell its proximity to New York. A pickup game at the United Nations could not have more diversity than F.D.U.'s roster. Guard Jesper Rasmussen (13.1 points a game), the team's best shooter, and center Jonas Sinding (6.7 points, 5.6 rebounds) are from Denmark. Center Chris Ekwe (12.4 points, 6.1 rebounds) of Cameroon and forward Wim Van de Keere (5.7 points) of Belgium are the two other large contributors. The Knights are hoping for future production from center Baldur Olafsson of Iceland, the swingman Tom Van de Keere and the freshman 7-footer Joern Grundmann of Germany. ''Players are players, whether they're white, black, red or blue,'' Green said. ''Regardless, people like to win.'' But Green will spend his only two scholarships next season on home-grown recruits because there are enough smaller, quicker players to go around, before looking overseas again. So far, F.D.U. has signed foreign players who match the Knights' level of competition. ''I'm hoping to hit gold one day,'' Orellana said. ''That one guy nobody knows about in the world. He's out there somewhere.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 130-> TELEVISION; Past Jonathan Swift To Linda Tripp (Yeah. Whatever.)
I WATCH a lot of television in the summer, a bad habit from my childhood. My therapist would tell you that it was a strategy for defending my then-tenuous self-esteem. I was a chubby little monkey and often stayed indoors rather than suffer the pokes and taunts of the slenderer neighborhood children. My therapist would tell you that these children were simply projecting and neutralizing their own insecurities, that their thin sarcasms were manifestations of their own psychic pain. She would tell you that we were thus caught in conflicting systems of pre-emptive self-avoidance and fear management, all of which hardened into the pathologies of our emotional adulthood. My therapist would tell you all this, but she can't right now because she's on a Boogie board somewhere in the Fire Island surf with a blender drink jammed into each fist and cannot be reached, so I'm watching a lot of television again this summer. One of my favorite entertainment discoveries of the season so far is a commercial for the Y.M.C.A. It features the usual public-service-announcement style footage of happy multiculti kiddies running and jumping. What distinguishes it from a thousand other dimly earnest spots of the same kind, though, is its audio track: a sound-alike version of the Village People hit ''Y.M.C.A.'' The producers rewrote the lyric from ''It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.'' to ''It's fun to play at the Y.M.C.A.'' Sort of misses the point. It doesn't really change things any if you understood the goofy hetero-subversiveness of the original, and further, however unintentionally, leaves one to picture a vigorous playground dodge-ball game as might be supervised by a cowboy clad in a gunbelt and bicycle shorts. Weirdly, I found this little nugget of oblivious anti-irony embedded in an afternoon rebroadcast of ''The Daily Show,'' America's most perfect rendering of comedy post-modernism. Running, well, nightly at 11 P.M. on cable's Comedy Central, ''The Daily Show'' is what happens when you give the kids who used to make fun of you their own television show. It is a not-quite parody of a not-quite newscast. The Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtain ''Weekend Update'' sketches on ''Saturday Night Live'' (circa late 70's, post-Chevy Chase) were a parody of a newcast. A thing done in character with the intention of mocking the absurdities of the genuine article. ''The Daily Show,'' however, is a thing in itself, a comedy show built on the premise that the day's headlines and their sidebars can be made funny. While borrowing the trappings of a newscast (the I Like Ikea rosewood and stainless set, authoritative desk, zippy graphics, etc.), the show doesn't present itself as a comment on television news so much as an ironic adjunct to it. A much hipper, completely ironic adjunct. The content of each show varies in proportion, but the main ingredients seem to remain these: four or five lead stories headlined at the top of the show, an offbeat videotape package, a live interview with a visiting celebrity, a few quick-hitting trims and ends, quirks of the kind that used to be found filling up the last inch or two of column space in a newspaper. All of which are read, wrangled or introduced by Craig Kilborn, the show's anchor. The way the lead stories get handled doesn't much vary. Imagine the three cruelest, cleverest things you could ever say about Linda Tripp on the day she appears to defend her, um, appearance, for example, and those will be the three jokes that accompany the photo of her that hovers over Mr. Kilborn's shoulder as he attacks her appearance, too. It's like making fun of the people in line at Epcot: too easy, but darned satisfying when you're cranky. Again, the stories derive from the news of the day, so Mr. Clinton and Mr. Starr get a consistent working over, as do Ms. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky and all the other folks currently mired in our national infotainment hog wallow. Mr. Kilborn delivers this material with the requisite smirks and deadpan charm that it needs, helped in no small measure by the fact that he is blond and boyish and perhaps innocent-looking enough to be the male host of ''A.M. Norway.'' Coincidentally, Mr. Kilborn shares the stylish cowlick-conk Huck Finn hairdo first popularized by NBC's Conan O'Brien. This was, apparently, incentive enough for CBS to hire Mr. Kilborn recently to replace the departing Tom Snyder. Conan and Craig will go forelock to forelock in late night, beginning early next year. Replacing Mr. Kilborn will be Jon Stewart. Clear? The show's correspondents, notably Beth Littleford and Stephen Colbert, likewise present their taped features with the stoicism and affectless expressions that we require of our big-time news reporters or our comedy straight men. Ms. Littleford, who possesses a remarkable resemblance in looks and bearing to the actress Joan Allen, is especially gifted when it comes to the timely cocking of an eyebrow or the grave nod of the head so integral to all television news interviews. The packages themselves are devious little concoctions wherein the central characters seem to have no idea that they'll be savaged when the piece is edited, their interviews rejiggered to suit a rewritten set of questions, their sincerity juxtaposed against the comic premise of the piece. In short, it's much like any videotaped network news feature, a manipulation through misrepresentation, except that it's intentionally funny. A recent piece, slugged ''Grandfatherland,'' drew a smart comic parallel between the growth of the Leisureworld retirement community and the expansionism of Nazi Germany. THE on-set chat with the daily celebrity done by Mr. Kilborn is a similarly cockeyed few moments of re-engineered television boilerplate. He does his best, it would seem, to make his guests uncomfortable: asking questions that stump or incriminate them, awkwardly goading them to play along with his not-so-respectful assessments of what has happened to their careers lately, posing to each a list of five questions that often have no real answer but are vaguely referential to the celebrity on the hot seat (e.g., to Yasmine Bleeth, Dairy Council swimsuit pinup and actress, ''Other than chocolate chip, what cookie goes best with milk?''). Mr. Kilborn's disappointment when a guest turns out to be less of an idiot than he hoped is palpable. Therein lies the problem. In the world inhabited and delineated by ''The Daily Show,'' everyone is an idiot. There's no denying that the show is smart and often funny, but in an annoyingly self-conscious way that constantly sets out to reaffirm its own moral and intellectual superiority. It has about it the glib, tinny ring of a college lampoon in which the sophomore writer's cleverness is deployed in service of nothing grander than impressing the writer's freshman friends. Bereft of an ideological or artistic center, the show is precocious but empty. That it mistakes irony for an end rather than a means is a distressing reflection of where we find ourselves. Irony was once a comic device, a delivery system for a reformative idea, a challenge to the status quo. The ancient Greeks and Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift and Voltaire and Lenny Bruce all understood that the joke was simply where you kept the idea hidden from the authorities. That idea in most cases being one of human betterment, that we could improve ourselves and our world if we all realized the truth about our common condition, that we were stuck in this together. Instead ''The Daily Show'' looks at the world, shrugs and says, ''Whatever.'' This kind of hollow, self-heroic irony is a product of the same us-versus-them post-modernism that gave us unreadable metafictional novels and the zany architecture of the uninhabitable. I don't recall asking for office buildings that looked like glass grain elevators with exoskeletons, but for a while that's what I got, because that's what architects thought was hip. Same with music, dance, poetry and anything else you could study in graduate school. Having expanded and then deconstructed the possibilities of creative expression to the point of absurdity, though, the great cycle of common sense seems to be leading us back to lyricism and story and little brick houses. Show business is slow on the uptake, however, like always, and the grim wisecracks of Comparative Hip are still the vogue. A couple of notable exceptions: ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' succeeds in part because she's goofy, self-deprecating and unironic. And the summer's hottest comedy film, ''There's Something About Mary,'' has been systematically overpraised by critics for two reasons: its best moments are simple slapstick, and it has a happy ending. It used to be that David Letterman was our national barometer for pained expressions of ironic futility. Every quip is still a cry for help, certainly, but he at least understands that there's a world outside his studio, even if he hates living in it. Television's latest generation of comic emcees -- Bill Maher, Dennis Miller, John Henson et al. -- make their bones by reconfiguring the common wisdom in a vacuum, in a way that's almost entirely mean-spirited and self-referential. Comedy like this, at its worst, is supercilious and uncharitable and airless, finally institutionalizing our sense of civic paralysis with its underlying hopelessness. ''The Daily Show'' isn't really to blame for any of this, of course. It does what it can to eke out a few laughs in a time and place that is at once ridiculous and tragic. That it does so without sweetness or hope or a sense of humor about itself has more to do with the futility we all feel lately about our future than it does with anything else. This is the comedy of fear, the comedy of the insecure, the comedy of the powerless. When you're scared, your first impulse is to hurt someone else. To mock that which you are most afraid of becoming. Which, if I recall correctly, is where I came in.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 131-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER; Easing the Way On Two Wheels
SEEING the world from the seat of a bike has always appealed to a certain kind of traveler, but advances in technology have opened the road to the less rugged, even the less rugged toting children. When my daughter turned 4, we got her a bike: a metallic blue two-wheeler with an alligator horn that seemed to signal the end, for a while, of our days riding en famille. Before she had her own bike, she would perch in a molded plastic seat that attached to the rack of my bike or my husband's. That seat went up the East Coast and down, and out West more than once. It made bike touring with a small child possible, and it was a sad day when she outgrew it. But, as I found one day in Tahoe City when I was looking longingly at a rack of rental bikes and noticed among them an ungainly contraption called an Alley Cat -- a one-wheeled cycle with handlebars, a seat and an extremely long, horizontally curved front end -- bike touring with a child not yet strong enough to power her own craft is still an option. We rented the Alley Cat. (We were lucky it was available; we hadn't called in advance to reserve it, which is advisable as such instant tandems can be hard to come by.) We attached it to the seat post of the mountain bike my husband chose to ride, and suddenly we were looking at a kid-friendly tandem. My four-year-old climbed on -- her feet just reached the pedals -- and off we went on an impromptu 15-miler to Squaw Valley and beyond. That was a few hundred miles ago. There are three Mongoose Alley Cat models: the Shadow ($170), with a 20-inch wheel; the Shadow II ($200), which is the same as the Shadow but has a folding front mount that makes it easier to transport, and the Speedy ($270), a six-speed cycle with grip shifters, a 24-inch alloy wheel and the folding mechanism. If you can afford it, the Speedy is the way to go. It's the most versatile of the three, more likely to hold a child's interest as she gets older, and ultimately more suited for the long haul. The Alley Cat is recommended for ages 5 to 12, up to 80 pounds. L. L. Bean, (800) 221-4221, sells the Alley Cat, as do many bike shops. Mongoose, a division of Brunswick Bicycles, (800) 257-0662, makes them. Lightening the Load Though attaching half a bike and carrying a passenger adds significantly to the lead rider's freight, the weight is offset by the fact that the passenger is pedaling. Poundage, which is a serious bicyclist's nemesis, is a given for the bike tourer, who may carry clothes, shelter and food along for the ride. But there are easy ways to lighten the load -- products that make traveling by bike a comfortable way to go. Years ago, when a couple of friends and I went up to Vermont's Northeast Kingdom to ride for a week, we took a bulky, 20-pound tent that could barely fit on a bike rack. When we finally got it strapped securely, it was so heavy it threatened to topple the bike. On the second day of the trip, after an all-night downpour that soaked our bivouac, we retired the tent and checked in to a rustic inn, defeated by our equipment. Never again. Lately I've been packing Sierra Design's Clip 3 CD tent ($249); (800) 635-0461. At just over four pounds, it is one of the lightest three-person tents on the market. It is simple to set up and take down, airy and durable. It also comes in a two-person version, the Clip Flashlight CD ($185). Typically, a tent and a sleeping bag are carried on a rack that also supports a set of panniers like Mountain Smith's roomy, thoughtfully designed Paragon ($130); (800) 426-4075. Clothes and other gear go into the panniers, which can add 30 or more pounds to your bicycle. (For long trips it's often necessary to have a set of panniers in the front and a pair in the back.) But not all bikes can take racks -- mountain bikes with full suspension systems, in particular, are unable to accommodate them -- and not everybody likes the feel of a packed bike. Another option is a Yak trailer, a 12-pound device that rides low to the ground behind your bike, looks like a scooter and enables you to lug up to 70 pounds of stuff off road and on. The Yak, which is made by BOB Trailers, (800) 893-2447, takes some serious engineering time to assemble, but once that's done, the trailer connects (and disconnects) in about the same time it takes to recite BOB's corporate mantra: ''Question internal combustion.'' Though the Yak, at $265, is not cheap, the cost is comparable to two sets of panniers and two racks, and it comes with its own safety flag. Helmets: Fancy and Basic Safety, which is always an issue when you are sharing the road with cars and trucks, is even more of a consideration when you are navigating in unfamiliar places. Helmets are crucial, of course, and recent innovations in helmet construction have made them both more protective and less onerous to wear. Giro's new Boreas helmet ($150), (800) 294-6098, for instance, which was developed for Tour de France cyclists last year, has 22 vents to keep the air circulating. All those holes do not compromise the helmet's structural integrity, though they do make it look like Swiss cheese. Pricey as it is, the Boreas is considerably less expensive than a neurologist. Still, even a helmet as well made as the Boreas won't protect you if it does not fit properly. Make sure to have your helmet fitted before you leave the store where you buy or rent it. Many helmets like this one or Bell Sports's more moderately priced Image Pro, $65, have excellent but complicated retention straps that are best adjusted at a bike shop. For a Smoother Ride Not all road shock comes when you fall off your bicycle. An average stretch of asphalt or macadam sends plenty of unpleasant jolts through your arms to your shoulders and up your spine. Padded gel gloves help somewhat, and bikes with front or rear shocks help a lot, but most road bikes don't come with these. Softride, which makes bikes without seat posts to reduce spinal shock, now makes an impact-absorbing stem (the part that connects the handlebars to the frame). The Soft ride Stem ($100 to $330), (800) 557-6387, which has a big spring inside of it, replaces your pre-existing stem -- an easy operation that can be done by a bike mechanic. Once it's in place, the handlebar remains level while the stem travels, taking in the bumps and jostles of the road. In Case of a Flat On that trip through Vermont, one of my friends got a flat, and no one had a pump that would fit his tire valves. (His valves were Presta, ours were Schrader.) We should have been carrying a minipump like Blackburn's Air Stik ($25), (800) 456-2355, which fits both valve types and inflates on the push and pull strokes. We also should have been riding on Kevlar tires. The Bike Nashbar catalog compares specs on an extensive inventory of tires, (800) 627-4227. Kevlar, which is extremely lightweight, is remarkably tough; it's what bulletproof vests are made of. It may be overkill, but it also may keep you from standing on the side of the road in a storm as we did, with a friend who has lost his ride.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 132-> COMPANY NEWS; PANOLAM TO ACQUIRE PIONEER PLASTICS FROM RUGBY GROUP
Panolam Industries, a building-materials maker, agreed yesterday to buy the Pioneer Plastics Corporation from Rugby Group P.L.C., a building-products producer in Britain, for as much as $175 million. The buyer, which is owned by Genstar Capital L.L.C., a private investment firm based in the United States, will pay $160 million in cash and as much as $15 million more depending on the profitability of Pioneer and Panolam in the years 1999 through 2003, Rugby said. The company is Britain's fourth-biggest maker of materials used for building interiors. Panolam is the leading producer in the United States and Canada of low-pressure laminates, which are sheets of building material used for counter tops, kitchen cabinets and doors.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 134-> COLLEGES: WOMEN'S ROUNDUP; Lady Vols Trounce 8th-Ranked Bruins
TENNESSEE 100, U.C.L.A. 77 Chamique Holdsclaw had 29 points and 12 rebounds to lead No. 2 Tennessee to a 100-77 victory over No. 8 U.C.L.A. last night in Knoxville, Tenn. The Lady Vols (9-1), who shot 62 percent from the field in the first half and led by 25 points after 20 minutes, also got 16 points from Tamika Catchings and 15 points from Semeka Randall. U.C.L.A. (7-3) was led by Janae Hubbard with 17 points, and Maylana Martin added 16 and 8 rebounds. PURDUE 84, FLORIDA 76 Stephanie White-McCarty set a school record by making 7 of 8 3-point shots while scoring a career-high 33 points as No. 3 Purdue beat No. 20 Florida in Gainesville, Fla. White-McCarty was 11 for 17 over all as the Boilermakers (8-1) ended the Gators' 21-game home winning streak. Ukari Figgs added 21 points, including 11 of 12 from the free-throw line, giving Purdue's backcourt 54 points. NOTRE DAME 75 MICHIGAN STATE 64 Ruth Riley had 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Danielle Green added 16 points and 10 rebounds as No. 7 Notre Dame (9-1) beat Michigan State (6-4) in East Lansing, Mich. The Irish used a 15-0 run in the first half to open a 30-11 lead. The Lady Spartans broke the 11-minute 32-second scoreless streak, starting a 13-2 run that cut the halftime lead to 32-24. The Irish quickly extended the lead to 15 points early in the second half. The Spartans closed to 67-60 when Christie Pung hit a 3-pointer with 2:15 left. But a layup by Niele Ivey and a pair of free throws by Sheila McMillen insured Notre Dame its second straight victory. CALIFORNIA 80 COLORADO STATE 75 Sherrise Smith made two free throws with 12 seconds remaining as California (5-2) upset No. 9 Colorado State (12-1) in the championship of the Oakland Tribune Classic. Jennie Leander's short jumper gave the Bears a 74-73 lead with 1:11 left, and Lauren Ashbaugh, who led California with a career-high 18 points, grabbed a defensive rebound with 38 seconds left.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 135-> Andre de Wavrin, 87, 'Col. Passy' of Resistance Fame, Dies
Andre de Wavrin, the ''Colonel Passy'' who forged a Resistance intelligence network for de Gaulle during World War II, died at his home in Paris on Sunday, friends said. He was 87. Born in Paris in 1911 and a graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique, the leading French engineering school, Mr. de Wavrin was a 29-year-old captain teaching fortifications at the French military academy of St.-Cyr when war broke out. He first saw action in a British-French expedition to retake the northern Norwegian port of Narvik from the Germans in 1940. The expedition was recalled after France's defenses against the Germans collapsed, and Mr. de Wavrin ended up stranded with the other French officers near Manchester, England. Though his wife and family were still in France, Mr. de Wavrin decided to stay in Britain and, on July 1, 1940, found the headquarters that de Gaulle had just set up in London and volunteered for whatever duty the general might see fit to give him. He emerged from a brief meeting with the job of organizing the Free French operational and intelligence organizations. ''Nothing had prepared Passy for this unprecedented mission,'' de Gaulle wrote in his memoirs, ''but I preferred it that way.'' Mr. de Wavrin and three lieutenants picked their Resistance pseudonyms from a map of the Paris Metro. He chose Passy, a station near his home in the 16th Arrondissement, and decided to concentrate on the intelligence part of the assignment de Gaulle had given him. Working out of a three-room suite at the Resistance's new London headquarters at 4 Carlton Gardens, Mr. de Wavrin and his men scoured military camps and hospitals in southern England to recruit volunteers for a service that had to be built from scratch. Slowly, with skeptical help from the British and despite fierce rivalries within de Gaulle's organization, Mr. de Wavrin's group began sending agents across the English Channel in boats. Tall, with thinning blond hair and piercing blue eyes whose constant scanning unnerved many who dealt with him, Mr. de Wavrin soon built up a roster of enemies almost as long as those of his agents. ''His enemies accused him of operating a small-scale Gestapo office in London, complete with dungeons for the uncooperative,'' the American historian Gordon Wright later wrote, and Mr. de Wavrin was accused (falsely, he insisted) of having been associated with an extreme-right subversive organization, the Cagoule, before the war. One of his own agents, Gilbert Renault, known by the code name Remy, recalled that Colonel Passy had initially received him ''with all the warmth accorded an unwelcome traveling salesman,'' as an American historian, Douglas Porch, put it. There were setbacks, notably the failure of a mission with de Gaulle to Dakar, Senegal, in 1940 to try to persuade the French garrison there to rally to the Resistance. There were also fiascos over Mr. de Wavrin's attempts to keep enemy agents from penetrating his group. And its relationship with the British was strained by rivalry and suspicion. ''We had practically no means, while the English had everything,'' Mr. de Wavrin wrote, and that included the radios on which his organization depended for contact with agents in occupied France. To prevent the British from eavesdropping, Mr. de Wavrin established a separate French code. Annoyed, the British started delivering the messages to him only at midnight. He retaliated by summoning British secret service officials to his headquarters to receive inconsequential messages at odd hours of the night. ''Miraculously the telegrams began to arrive at more normal hours,'' he related later. But in 1942 and 1943 his Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action attracted people in France like Jean Moulin, who were disaffected with the Vichy occupation regime. Mr. Moulin, later a martyred hero, was part of a group that worked to unify all the various strands of the Resistance, under de Gaulle's leadership, and Mr. de Wavrin began planning for a new political organization in France. By D-Day, June 6, 1944, Mr. de Wavrin's network had mounted extensive sabotage operations and provided Eisenhower, the Allied commander, with so much information that he said the Resistance was worth six allied divisions. Mr. de Wavrin himself parachuted into Brittany in August 1944 and helped take charge of a force of 2,500 Resistance soldiers operating with advancing American units. The force captured 2,000 prisoners. In 1945 Mr. de Wavrin became director general of the precursor of the present-day French foreign intelligence service, the Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure. But three months after he resigned in February 1946, he was arrested and charged with setting up secret bank accounts in Britain and Paris with diverted intelligence money. He was imprisoned for three months in an affair judged later to have had mostly to do with Communist desires to discredit de Gaulle. Decorated with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1981, Mr. de Wavrin was later a banker with the private Banque Worms and a director of several French companies.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 136-> Wanted: Poet Laureate. Anyone Willing?; Some Britons Are, but Many Want to Transform a 'Pointless' Post
The job pays only about $165 a year, plus a case of Spanish sherry. It is meant to be a great honor, but is often considered faintly embarrassing. In the last 15 years it has required an unironic belief in the grave national importance of events like the wedding of the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson, also known as Fergie. Why on earth would anyone want to be Britain's poet laureate? ''That would be my question as well,'' said Christopher Reid, the poetry editor at Faber & Faber, which publishes some of Britain's best-known poetry. ''It seems to me a pretty pointless kind of job.'' With the death in October of Ted Hughes, the poet laureate since 1984, the position and the job description are now wide open. While some of Britain's higher-profile poets have removed their names from consideration with all the passion of teen-agers who think the student council is for nerdy teacher's pets, others are gently letting it be known that if appointed, they would serve. Perhaps the most frequently mentioned candidate is Andrew Motion, a poet, critic and biographer who is the professor of creative writing at the University of East Anglia. In the last 18 months he has raised his own profile and helped bring poetry to the public's attention by publishing poems in national newspapers marking the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Mr. Hughes, a longtime friend. Other poets in the running are Wendy Cope, whose work tends to poke fun at pretension, particularly that of other poets; Benjamin Zephaniah, who attacks social injustice in often playful tones that draw heavily on West Indian speech and culture, and U. A. Fanthorpe, who seemed to all but apply for the post when she was moved to publish ''A Brief Resume at 50,'' an ode to Prince Charles on his birthday, in The Guardian. For reasons of its own, The Guardian has taken up Ms. Fanthorpe's candidacy, encouraging her to submit poems for every occasion. (Last Monday it published her poem about road rage.) ''She's liked by people who don't read any poetry, and she's accessible,'' said the newspaper's deputy arts editor, Fiachra Gibbons, who went on, rather confusingly, to say that the ''job is about producing embarrassingly bad poetry.'' Spurred by Ms. Fanthorpe's new high profile, William Hill, Britain's biggest betting agency, has raised her chances of being made laureate to 16 to 1, from 50 to 1. The agency's favorite candidate is Mr. Motion, with odds of 6 to 4, followed closely by Ms. Cope (4 to 1) and James Fenton (5 to 1), the professor of poetry at Oxford University, who appeared to rule himself out when he told The Observer of London that ''I can think of people who would want to take the job, other than myself.'' Similarly, Craig Raine, another Oxford poet (25-1), exclaimed, ''Oh, God, no,'' before hanging up the telephone. Even E. J. Thribb, who is one of Britain's best-known poets despite being a fictional teen-ager who specializes in terrible civic verse for the satiric magazine Private Eye, is in the running, though at odds of 1,000 to 1. What exactly would the new laureate do, at a time when old views of Britain and the monarchy that serves as its figurehead are rapidly changing? Some people in the poetry world say the time has come to give the post an overhaul, perhaps creating an American-style laureate. In the United States, the laureate serves for one year at a time, gets an office with a stunning view of the Capitol and earns a respectable salary of $35,000. (Mr. Hughes's job as poet laureate earned him half as much a year as Britain's first official laureate, John Dryden -- and $:200 went a lot further in the 17th century.) Maybe Britain's laureate should serve for a fixed term instead of until death, critics say. And maybe he or she should be explicitly freed from the job's chief unstated burden: churning out quick poetry that, harking back to the days when poets depended on the patronage of the monarch, celebrates events like royal birthdays and royal weddings. Although the job has been filled over the years by some of Britain's poetic heavyweights, including Ben Jonson, who held the post unofficially, as well as Dryden, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cecil Day-Lewis and John Betjeman, it has rarely inspired their best work. John Masefield, who beat Rudyard Kipling for the job in 1930, suffered under the impression that he had to compose an ode to mark the monarch's return to Britain after each foreign trip. He also had such low regard for his talent that when he submitted his poems to The Times of London, the laureate's de facto house organ, he always enclosed a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Perhaps the most notorious example of laureate poetry came during an illness of the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII. The laureate, Alfred Austin, who took the job in 1896, is said, perhaps apocryphally, to have written: Across the wires the electric message came ''He is no better, he is much the same.'' Mr. Hughes became laureate after another poet, Philip Larkin, turned the job down. Although he was considered a great poet whose reputation was immortalized by his last work, ''Birthday Letters'' and ''Tales From Ovid,'' Mr. Hughes generally confounded his supporters with his royal poems. Lack of Admiration For Many Poems When Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, married Ms. Ferguson, Mr. Hughes wrote, among other things, ''A helicopter snatched you up./ The pilot, it was me.'' (The marriage ended in divorce.) On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, he said her corgis were the same color as the Lion of England. And when the Queen Mother turned 95, he compared her to an old oak tree whose ''crown of oak leaves amplifies/A global marketplace.'' Such poems were not widely admired. ''At the age of 66 I have a cast-iron digestion and have weathered some of the worst storms at sea,'' a reader wrote to The Daily Telegraph, having just completed Mr. Hughes's nuptial poem for Andrew and Ms. Ferguson. ''However, reading the poet laureate's so-called royal wedding song over breakfast this morning, I felt very sick indeed.'' The writer and critic Blake Morrison, who generally admired Mr. Hughes, said: ''It did him no good. I think his reputation went backward as a result of being laureate. People ridiculed him. Even his admirers found his laureate poems impenetrable or disappointing, and then, thank God, he produced some wonderful work in the last three years.'' Mr. Morrison and others argue that many respectable poets would consider the post a burden and would turn it down because of its ties to the monarchy. ''To me the trivial side is the royal side, and I'd like to see the laureate detached from the monarchy,'' he said in an interview. ''If people want to produce odes to the Queen Mother, fine. But the expectation that that's what the job is is a mistake. Of course, some people hate the idea of changing the rather eccentric system that we have because they think, at least it's English, like fox hunting.'' Perhaps, said the poet Tom Paulin (33 to 1), the post should be redefined ''as a way of embodying a kind of multicultural national spirit'' that would reflect, rather than ignore, contemporary Britain. ''One imagines a Virgilian poet in a post-modern era,'' he said. Would he consider taking the job? ''Oh, absolutely not, no,'' he said. ''I wouldn't, not at all, no.'' One positive side effect of the speculation surrounding the next laureate is that it has brought poetry into the public eye. This is part of a general trend, said Chris Meade, director of the Poetry Society in Britain, who pointed out that in recent years there has been a boom in poets in residence attached to institutions like the London Zoo, the department-store chain Marks & Spencer and the law firm Mishcon de Reya, home of Anthony Julius, the high-profile lawyer who handled the Princess of Wales's divorce. But, Mr. Meade said, regular people have a hard time making the leap from appreciating ''poetryness,'' or the idea of poetry, to being able to name actual contemporary poets. ''You get an interest in single poems, such as those people come across on the Underground, but then there's a gap. The next step is slim volumes by lots of people you've never heard of and slender magazines full of angry critics who love one thing and hate another,'' he said. ''The poet laureate could help to consolidate poetry's position and bridge the gap between the initial interest and a deeper understanding.'' Gathering Names Of Candidates Michael Holroyd, the biographer and chairman of the Royal Society of Literature, said the job should evolve when the new laureate takes office. ''Poets disagree with practically everything about the job, except that they feel they should get more money,'' he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Meade, Mr. Holroyd and representatives of various organizations are compiling lists of names to submit to the Prime Minister's office, which will select a new laureate, with the Queen's approval, next year. They say they are unmoved by the flurry of poems by would-be laureates, which have appeared in national newspapers in recent years, and by the efforts of amateur poets to put their names forward. ''We've had three general members of the public who have written a few poems, and they're very keen to do the job,'' Mr. Meade said. ''But we won't be mentioning them in our letter of recommendation. They were newcomers to poetry, and you know, they just weren't very good.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 138-> Caution Urged When Seeking Whiter Teeth
A variety of new procedures and products are becoming available for whitening teeth, but some authorities question the effectiveness and safety of some of the items. Manufacturers insist that the products are both safe and effective. Whitening solutions with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide -- 30 percent to 35 percent -- have been available in dentists' offices for years for teeth stained by food, coffee, tea, tobacco or other substances. Initially, the solutions required meticulous preparation and this, coupled with their unpredictability, limited their popularity. By the early 1990's new products were introduced that were easier to apply, and the process began to be used more often. In 1991, the Food and Drug Administration classified the whiteners as drugs, affecting bodily structures or tissues and requiring the agency's approval. The manufacturers then argued that the products were cosmetics, and the agency allowed them on the market but pending another review. The F.D.A. says questions are still being raised, including recent reports of increased levels of peroxide added to home products. The matter remains under investigation. The generally accepted method of whitening is done in the dentist's office with prepared bleach and gel solutions, usually one to three times a year after a normal teeth cleaning. The dentist places a rubber dam or a gel on the gums to protect them, then swabs the teeth, keeping the bleaching agent in place for 10 to 20 minutes. The number of treatments depends on the severity of the staining. Another office procedure, approved two years ago but not yet subjected to long-term study, adds laser light to the bleaching to speed the process and lessen exposure. Dr. Clifford W. Whall Jr., director of product evaluation at the American Dental Association, said the in-office bleaches have a long record of safety, though it is too soon for long-term conclusions on laser or at-home procedures. Dr. Whall and others say that, as with many medical procedures that are beneficial if correctly followed and harmful if not, teeth whitening can kill gum tissue or damage the teeth if done improperly. And animal studies suggest that high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can cause irreversible cell damage and may enhance carcinogens. Home-bleaching devices, prescribed by a dentist or purchased over the counter, use lower levels of peroxide, but must be applied more often, generally several hours a night for up to six weeks. The bleaching agent -- acceptable mixtures contain 10 percent carbamide peroxide, the equivalent of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide -- is poured into small, thin trays that are molded tightly around the teeth. Dr. H. Jinder Khurana, a periodontist and an official of the New York Dental Association, said, ''People can be tempted to overuse them and this can eventually cause damage to both the exterior enamel and the inner nerve or the mouth itself.'' An ''all-in-one'' solution that combines whitener and toothpaste contains still less peroxide, but is recommended for use twice a day, presumably for life. The effect of lifetime exposure to low-level hydrogen peroxide is unknown, the experts say.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 139-> Sports of The Times; A Good Man Who Had a Very Bad Moment
A FRIEND of mine died two months ago while I was in the middle of the World Cup, and then came vacation. Now, before I get going on the next season, I need to write about a good man named Al Campanis. The Chief is a stick figure now, a stereotype, useful to anybody with a knee-jerk desire to flail a symbol of the white American sports establishment. He put himself in this vulnerable position on the night of April 5, 1987, when he bumbled and mumbled on national television about why there were not more African-American baseball managers and executives. No sooner had he uttered the world ''necessities'' than his career as general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers was over, with the formality of a resignation two days later. I have heard Don Newcombe use the word ''tragedy'' to describe what happened to Al Campanis. Newk was one of the first blacks in the major leagues, and he has served the Dodgers long and well in community liaison and addiction treatment, and he does not mince words. He knows Al Campanis was not from central casting of elderly white power brokers who consciously barred the door to black (and Hispanic) candidates. How many times, in private chats, did I hear Al rave about his Montreal Royals teammate Jackie Robinson as one of the greatest baseball people he had known, or lament the early paralysis of Roy Campanella and the early death of Jim Gilliam that kept them from managing for the Dodgers or some other team? Of course they would have made great managers, Al said. They were Dodgers. The Campanis ''tragedy'' concerns all of us - fans, journalists and athletes - because it refers to the way we attach labels to people and events. I am not talking about the current sordid business in which the world is re-evaluating an American Preisdent for his lifetime pattern of evasion. I am talking about the American need for new scapegoats, new villians, every day. I am talking about one foolish moment, one addled statement on live television, and how your snippet of film clip, your press clippings, the guffaws from the talk shows, will follow you to the end of your days. Al Campanis, born on a Greek island in the middle of World War I, never caught up with the electronic sound-bite age. He was a perfect example of why most of us should be cautious about appearing on live radio or television. In normal dugout or press-room conversation, Al tended to meander down obscure conversational paths, until one of the reporters would raise an eyebrow and murmur, ''Ummm, Chief,'' and steer him back onto the main highway. Nobody I know ever heard him utter a solitary phrase that could have been vaguely construed as racist. When I got to know him in the early 80's, he would come to Shea Stadium and fill the general manager's box next to the visiting dugout with scouts and officials and old high school coaches, many of them of color, many of them from the Dominican republic, where the Dodgers did business. With his dark suits and courtly manners, he was quite at home with these Caribbean gentlemen. In my opinion, Al Campanis was incapable of prejudice because he had faced marginalism in his own life. He was born on Kos, in the Greek chain called the Dodecanese, across the straits from Turkey. His mother had fallen in love with a dashing Italian bersagliero, a marksman soldier, and she pursued him by ship to his home city of Modena, convincing his family that she wanted nothing more than a legal name for her son. Struck by her bearing, they signed the papers that named the boy Allesandro Campani. Later, an American immigration official added as ''s'' to the boy's last name. Al Campanis attended George Washington High, and then he acquired a New York University degree that was always apparent. His humanity and his education did not protect him on the night of April 6, 1987. The officials of ''Nightline'' were looking for people to comment on the 40th aniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut, and they caught up to Robinson's loyal teammate at a ball park and stuck a microphone on his lapel and a tiny speaker in his ear, and connected him to the disembodied voice of Ted Koppel, a few thousands miles away. Koppel asked: Was baseball prejudiced? ''No, I didn't believe it's prejudice,'' Campanis said. ''I truly believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, let's say, a field manager or perhaps a general manager.'' Koppel, who didnot know Campanis, tried to help out his bumbling guest, but lacking eye contact or body language or a brief huddle in a studio, all Koppel could do was use words and inflections, giving him an opportunity to ''dig yourself out.'' The Chief rambled on about blacks being good athletes but bad swimmers and how there are few black quarterbacks in football. In any slower-paced interview with a print journalist, Campanis would have veered toward Robinson and Campanella and Gilliam, and the inevitability of more minority officials. It is true, the Dodgers had not done enoughto keep their best people - John Roseboro always comes to mind - but Al had often predicted that things would get better. This time, after a few silly minutes on national television, he was a dead man, professionally. He lived for a decade more, a family man who loved his mother, Mamma Tulla, like no man I have ever met, who mourned his late wife, Bess, who loved his sons, George and Jimmy (whom he once traded to Kansas City). On the day he resigned from the Dodgers, Al called his grandson to see if he had got any hits that day for U.S.C. None of this proves that Al Campanis did not have someblind spot about the aptitude of blacks and Hispanics to teach and coach and manage and scout. I only know that he was far more fair and educated than he showed in his few dopey momentson television. I hope everybody finds a new stick figure soon.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 140-> A Predator Returned to the Wild Discovers It Is Now Prey
Last spring, Bobby Fite peered down the sight of his .22 magnum rifle at what he thought was a coyote stalking two newborn calves near his house here. ''I threw that scope on her, then I saw that box on her, and I thought, man, that's one of them wolves,'' Mr. Fite, a rancher, said, recalling how he lowered his rifle after he realized that the predator in his pasture was a Mexican gray wolf, or lobo. Newly reintroduced after ranchers exterminated them half a century ago from the high timberlands of eastern Arizona, today's lobos wear radio collars that allow them to be tracked by biologists. But the wolves have had a rocky return to Arizona's forests this year. Of the first batch of 11 released in March, 5 were shot, 2 are missing and presumed dead, and the rest had to be recaptured for their safety while biologists reworked the program. Last week, scientists gave it another go, releasing two pair into the wilderness. This time, the hindquarters of each wolf were spray-painted orange. The radio collars were also painted, orange for males, pink for females. The paint should not interfere with the wolves' mating habits, because the animals are color-blind. But some environmentalists grumble that, even though the intent is to protect the wolves, marking them this way is the equivalent of painting large, fluorescent targets on their backsides. The paint is to help hunters distinguish Mexican wolves, one of the smallest wolf subspecies in North America, from coyotes, the garden-variety predators of the West. In much of the rural West, coyotes can be legally shot year round, no questions asked, no permits needed. ''Coyotes are varmints,'' said Sam Luce, another rancher near here. ''They are in our chicken houses, killing our chickens, killing our barn cats. A lot of the sportsmen consider them a target. That puts the wolf in a bad situation, because he looks just like a coyote.'' After the rash of wolf shootings in the fall, wildlife officials angrily called the killings ''sabotage.'' But now they say it appears that errors by hunters may account for most of the shootings. Aware that many local ranchers were hostile to the release of the wolves, biologists worked early this year to monitor the animals and remove them from areas with sheep and cows. They also educated ranchers about the penalty for intentionally killing a Mexican wolf, an endangered animal, on public land: a fine of up to $100,000 and a jail term of up to one year. The efforts appeared at first to be successful. Until the hunting season began in August, only one wolf was shot and killed -- by a camper. ''If the ranchers wanted to shoot wolves, they would have shot them in April, May and June, when the wolves were in town, in calving pastures, among sheep, among horses,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, a wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, who has directed the introduction program. ''The local people had plenty of opportunities to shoot these wolves. I really don't think it was the ranchers.'' But things took a turn for the worse with the annual fall invasion by hunters of the Apache National Forest, which surrounds this tiny village. Before the season began, wildlife officials had mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000 hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions in the wolf area. But from August through November, four wolves were shot dead over an area the size of Connecticut. According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which is leading the investigation into the killings, at least three guns were used. Rewards totaling $45,000 have been posted for information leading to an arrest and conviction in a wolf killing case. ''My personal feeling is it is just random,'' Ms. Boyd-Heger said. ''I don't think there is a concerted sabotage attempt. I don't think there is a conspiracy.'' Undaunted by losing half of the wolves in the first year, biologists plan to release in the National Forest here next March two more packs, totaling nine wolves. The goal is to have a population of 100 Mexican wolves roaming the National Forest by the year 2005. Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of the Interior and a former Governor of Arizona, has stressed his support for the program in two visits this year to this remote mountain town, a five-hour drive from Phoenix. Many people here, and in the rest of Arizona, support the return of the wolves. A poll in October of 720 Arizona residents by the Behavior Research Center, a Phoenix company, found that 61 percent of respondents said they had become more supportive in recent years of efforts to protect endangered wildlife. But in this economically depressed corner of the state, many people see the wolves as another blow imposed by outsiders to a traditional rural economy already hammered by dramatic reductions in timber harvests from public lands and in the number of cows that ranchers can have graze on public lands. ''We've got plenty of predators around here already -- mountain lions, coyotes, lots of bears,'' said Dr. Luce, a retired doctor whose cattle grazes on his own land along the Blue River. He said that every fall when his neighbors rounded up their cattle from grazing on National Forest lands, they regularly discovered that they had lost about 10 percent of their calves to predators. ''This competition just throws these wolves into the cattle,'' said Dr. Luce, who added that he occasionally saw wolves in his pastures this summer and that, in May, a wolf killed his 8-year-old trained cow dog, which he valued at $5,000. ''A little old calf that can barely get into a trot is a lot easier to catch than a deer or elk that can run full blast,'' he said. Tim Anderson, a big-game hunting guide, said over lunch at the Bear Wallow Cafe here that he had no problems with a few wolves in the woods. ''But if they get 100 up here, I don't know what will happen,'' Mr. Anderson said, as his prized blue tick hunting hounds barked outside. Worried by articles in hunting magazines about wolves killing hunting dogs in Minnesota, he said: ''I have hounds that I have turned down $4,000 for. I guess I'll just keep my fingers crossed.'' The wolf release program was opposed by the ranching associations of New Mexico and Arizona, the Governors of both states and votes of county commissioners in 11 counties. In the past, ranchers were the angriest of the opponents, and some environmentalists charge that they are the ones are behind the killings. ''The ranchers came out publicly saying, 'We will kill the wolves,' '' said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group in Tucson. ''After the killings, ranchers were the only group of people who came out and applauded. Now ranchers are the only group who are suing to stop the program.'' Reflecting the polarization caused by the wolf release, on Dec. 6 someone fired a shotgun into the offices of a Santa Fe animal rights group. The group had received an anonymous letter threatening ''to kill any wolf reintroduced.'' Four days later, someone spray-painted in large letters, ''Wolves'' and ''N.M. Needs Wolves'' on the building that houses the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association. ''It is part of a radical agenda to move us off the land,'' said Caren Cowan, the association's executive secretary. Noting that her ranching group has filed a legal challenge to the wolf program, Ms. Cowan added: ''Our members are law-abiding citizens. We don't condone anyone breaking the law.'' On Wednesday, the Cattle Growers' Association sent out a press release urging hunters to boycott a Fish and Wildlife Service questionnaire about the wolf killings. Slipping into the kind of harsh language that has often surrounded the wolf program, the association called the query ''Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control Federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised reintroduction program.'' [Faced with sharp criticism by three of New Mexico's Congressmen, the service retracted the questionnaire on Friday.]

Aug. 23, 1998-> 141-> REVIVING NEW OPERAS; What Audiences Want
To the Editor: I was most unhappy to find myself misrepresented in K. Robert Schwarz's article ''Bag Full of Operas: Anyone Want One?'' [July 12] about the lack of immediate revivals of new operas, John Adams's ''Nixon in China'' in particular. Mr. Schwarz and I had a lengthy and somewhat complex discussion about what factors affect revivability in general and what has specifically stood in the way of our reviving operas that were given their premieres in Houston over the last 25 years. First of all, I never told Mr. Schwarz that I didn't find a compelling reason to revive any of those operas. Rather, I clearly emphasized to him that we have planned at least two revivals of works recently given their premieres -- Mark Adamo's ''Little Women'' and Daniel Catan's ''Florencia en el Amazonas,'' both of which enjoyed such success that they have been summoned back ''by popular demand.'' Audience demand is the same factor that contributed to immediate revivals of works by Verdi, Puccini, Massenet and Bizet more than a century ago, when opera was more popular entertainment and, not coincidentally, when many of the operas we now consider to be classics were created. Our early premieres in Houston during the 1970's and 80's were admittedly calculated to gain notice and prestige and, as Mr. Schwarz rightly pointed out, they have gone onto the shelf indefinitely. Increasingly, we have sought out composers who could make a compelling first impression with the audience, and have achieved some success (my criteria) with Messrs. Adamo and Catan. Lacking this kind of chemistry, a succes d'estime like ''Nixon in China'' will be dutifully revived when there is an anniversary to celebrate or when a new generation emerges to confront it afresh. Verdi reportedly said that his greatest failure as a composer was to suffer empty seats in the theater. He thus found out how to romance his public through music, so that they would return time and again to hear a work. And because of this, impresarios fought to win his next piece. (Even then, it took him 16 tries before ''Rigoletto'' gave him his first acknowledged masterpiece and repertory staple.) How magnificent it would be if hundreds of new operas would be launched every year, if 10 of these would be immediately revivable, and if one composer would be a Verdi!

Dec. 21, 1998-> 143-> Zambia Announces Deal to Sell Copper Mines
After two years of on-and-off negotiations, a deal to sell state-owned copper mines in Zambia has finally been reached, the Finance Minister has announced. The Anglo American Corporation of South Africa will take over the important Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said on Friday. Copper is Zambia's most important industry and earns 56 percent of its export earnings. At independence in 1964, copper made the country, then Northern Rhodesia, one of Africa's richest nations. But decades of falling copper prices and Government failure to invest in technology turned the mines into a burden on the state. Recently, they were estimated to be losing $1 million a day. The state-owned copper company, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, is the centerpiece of the aggressive privatization program started by President Frederick T. Chiluba after his election in 1991, when the state owned 80 percent of the economy. It was put up for sale two years ago, but there have been many disputes along the way. Instead of bidding against one another, the buyers -- including Phelps Dodge of the United States, Noranda of Canada, the Commonwealth Development Corporation of Britain and Anglovaal of South Africa -- formed a consortium to make a unified bid for several mines and their associated smelters and power companies. Talks ended in May with the Government seeking $500 million and the consortium offering $131 million. The Government accused the companies of trying to grab Zambia's greatest asset at a fire-sale price. The consortium countered that the mines, smelters and equipment were so old that they would need billions of dollars in new investment. Falling copper prices made other companies back out of deals for lesser mines. Political uncertainty made matters worse; the copper belt is on the border with Congo, which in the middle of a civil war, and Mr. Chiluba's Government has become increasingly repressive. As foreign donors told Zambia it would get no more aid until the mines were sold, Anglo American, which already owned 27 percent of the state copper company, stepped in. The Associated Press said the deal includes an agreement to keep paying for the high-quality schools, hospitals and water systems that mining communities enjoy. The copper belt region, including some of the country's biggest cities, depends on them. The state will retain 20 percent of the new company. Anglo has agreed to pay $10 million in royalties and dividends on profits and eventually to invest $1.1 billion in upgrading the mines. It was not clear how many miners would be laid off. If copper prices ever rise, the deal could be a rich one. The Konkola mine is estimated to have deep ore bodies that could last 100 years and are three times as concentrated as those of American mines -- but it will cost more than $600 million to get to them.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 144-> Producing Videos to Help Parents Cope
ACCUSED killers, 7 and 8. School shootings by children. All too often such horrific events are making headlines. Now, in an attempt to help parents converse with their children, an award-winning publisher of educational videos, Sunburst Communications in Pleasantville, has begun to produce videos for the home market dealing with many of the troubling issues facing parents. ''In 26 years of producing educational videos for the school market, we've earned a reputation for helping teachers present hard topics, like violence, sex and drugs, in the classroom,'' Warren Schloat, president and chief operating officer of Sunburst, said. ''Actually, it was the suggestions from teachers and guidance counselors that encouraged us to go into the consumer market. They said, from their observations, a lot of parents needed help in communicating with their children and could learn something from videos that dealt with real-life family conflicts.'' Consumer market research for the videos started in 1995. ''Reactions of 83 percent of our customers, guidance counselors, principals and school officials -- some 100,000 were queried -- was so positive that we were encouraged to introduce a new product line,'' Mr. Schloat said. ''And with Susan Simmons as executive producer and the creative force behind the project, we began production of the first Parent and Child video for the K through 12 home market in January of this year. ''To date, we have completed three titles, 'Good Discipline, Good Kids,' 'Keeping Peace at Home' and 'Help Your Child Succeed at School,' Ms. Simmons said. ''They feature Adele Farber and Elaine Mazlish, two well-known experts on communication and authors.'' The programs feature families embroiled in real-life situations exhibiting the frustrations, conflicts and communications problems that typically result, said Ms. Simmons, a former third-grade teacher and publishing executive at Simon & Schuster, who as executive producer is responsible for the development of Parent and Child videos. ''In 'Keeping Peace at Home,' for example, classic conflict scenarios are played out,'' she said when asked about the content of the videos. ''It shows sibling fights and situations with disrespectful kids and then offers parents concrete, practical strategies to help handle the conflicts constructively -- strategies that ease tensions and help parents create a peaceful home.'' Each of Sunburst's three videos, Ms. Simmons said, won first-place awards at the industry's 31st Annual Film and Video Competition on June 4 in Chicago, and ''Help Your Child Succeed in School'' was also named the 1998 Grand Award winner at the Questar Awards on June 16 in Manhattan. ''It was in competition with hundreds of other entries from 16 countries,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''It's always very exciting to have your peers salute your professional efforts, and it was especially gratifying to have our first videos so well received.'' Recently, a casting call for children 4 through 12 at Deerfield Studios in Hawthorne was held for actors in Sunburst's first companion Parent and Child video set. ''It's a totally new concept for us, making two videos simultaneously, one for parents and one for children,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''The one we're doing tackles the subject of responsibility. The parent version is titled 'Raising Responsible Children,' and the child version is called 'I Can Do It: Taking Responsibility.' '' Other videos in the works, she said, ''are being made specifically for single and stepparents and parents of children with learning disabilities.'' The suggested retail price of the single 40-minute videos is $19.95. Prices have not been set for the 90-minute companion sets, said Dan R. Sladkus, president of Deerfield Productions, who filmed the video. Mr. Sladkus, who was hired by Sunburst as co-producer with Ms. Simmons, is also responsible for marketing the new products. ''We're using TV and radio spots regionally at first and then nationally for the launch,'' he said. ''As for distribution, we're in discussion with Blockbuster and Avon's catalogue division.'' Volume sales, he said, are critical. ''We'll be happy with unit sales of 30,000 to 50,000, which will indicate that we're capable of breaking into the consumer market successfully,'' he said. Sunburst expects to generate sales upward of $20 million this year, Mr. Schloat said. The company, which operates two divisions, Sunburst Software and Sunburst Video, now employs 150 people, a far cry from its beginnings 26 years ago, when Mr. Schloat, with two employees, started the business in the basement of his home in Pound Ridge. Tracing his career, Mr. Schloat, 58, said: ''I started out working in the family business, known as Warren Schloat Productions, which was an educational filmstrip company owned by my father. When the company was acquired by Prentice Hall in 1967, I became vice president of marketing and operations. But five years later, my entrepreneurial streak got to me. I was 32 and determined to go out on my own.'' After raising capital, amounting to $210,000 -- most of it borrowed from friends and family -- Mr. Schloat formed Sunburst Communications and started writing and producing filmstrips and selling them by direct mail to the educational market. ''We mailed 200,000 catalogues to classroom teachers,'' he said. ''The scripts were all important. They had to be very high caliber. Classroom teachers began to use the strips as a teaching device and gradually but slowly our business grew. Each year we did a little more business.'' Educational videos, Mr. Schloat said, evolved from World War II training films. ''By supplying materials that help the classroom teacher teach tough topics and at the same time engage students in creative learning and problem solving, we were able to carve out a niche for ourselves in the educational market,'' he said. Currently, the company is ranked as the fourth-largest publisher of videos for the kindergarten-through-12th-grade market and the ninth-largest software publisher in the same market in the United States. It recently acquired Tenth Planet Explorations, an educational CD-ROM publishing company in Half Moon Bay, Calif. With 1997 gross sales topping $20 million, in the last three years Sunburst has sold programs to about 73 percent of the school districts in its target market. ''We're committed to excellence, and our goal is to be known as the company both parents and teachers turn to when they are looking for quality material,'' Mr. Schloat said.

She mentions a Brooklyn version -- where can I find it? Sicilian focaccerias (of which there are at least three in the Cobble Hill-Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn) make a similar concoction: Flat cakes of chickpea paste called panelle are deep-fried and served plain or on a roll. JOSEPH D. SAPIENZA Closter, N.J. Ms. De Silva responds: I had socca at a street fair in Brooklyn about 20 years ago and, alas, never found it there again. Panelle, which are utterly delicious, are not quite the same.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 146-> 2 Rivals to Split Sun Media Assets
The owners of The Toronto Star, Canada's largest-circulation daily, agreed today with Quebecor Inc. to divide the newspaper assets of the Sun Media Corporation, which both had been seeking to acquire. Under the deal, Torstar Inc. would end its hostile takeover bid for Sun Media's tabloids, including The Toronto Sun, but would buy the group's four broadsheets in southern Ontario for $350 million (Canadian), or $225 million (United States), after Quebecor completed its $983 million (Canadian) takeover of Sun Media. With the addition of these papers -- The Hamilton Spectator, The Kitchener-Waterloo Record, The Cambridge Reporter and The Guelph Mercury -- Torstar would control about 14 percent of Canada's newspaper circulation. Two weeks ago, the Montreal-based Quebecor disclosed a friendly bid of $634 million to acquire all of Sun Media, topping The Star's earlier offer. Torstar's hostile bid of $891 million (Canadian) for Sun Media will lapse on Wednesday, as scheduled. Quebecor is Canada's largest commercial printer and also publishes daily papers in Montreal; Quebec City; Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Sherbrooke, Quebec.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 147-> SOAPBOX; Medical Leave
I HUGGED my doctor today. I would have kissed him, had he not just diagnosed my bronchitis. He's retiring. We've had more than 30 years together, and I wanted to say goodbye. My mother first brought me to this office when we moved from a neighboring state. It was almost time for me to graduate from pediatrician to grown-up doctor, so she enrolled me with Dr. Richard Daniels. No managed-care company is saying I can't see him because he's not on its list of approved physicians. My doctor is simply exercising his right to retire. He was a big part of my life, and it's hard to let him go. I've been to the partners he brought into his practice, and they're fine. But they're not my doctor. My doctor knows me; my doctor and I have a history. I don't know what I'm going to do without him. No malady was ever too minor to Dr. Daniels. Sometimes I went with a list of complaints, and he listened to them all. During one bad cold, I made an emergency appointment when I discovered white spots on the back of my tongue. After peering in my mouth, he reassured me my taste buds were doing fine. He was there for the big stuff, too. He sent me to specialists when I needed them, bypassed them and treated me himself when I didn't, and showered me with samples so I wouldn't have to buy prescriptions. Once, when I was in the hospital, under a specialist's care, he showed up at my bedside on his early morning rounds. Did he know how comforting it would be to me to see a familiar face? ''Are you still smoking?'' he asked me one year. I hung my head. ''I stopped cold turkey,'' he said, ''and so can you.'' His strength was something to aspire to. He diagnosed my early emphysema when I was in my 30's, which was the warning I needed. I stopped cold turkey, too. I owe him big for that one. If he scheduled appointments in 15-minute increments, I never knew it. And at each visit he inquired about my brother Bob, who had also been his patient before losing his way with alcohol. He nursed my father through cancer. The night before my father died, I asked Dr. Daniels if the end was near. ''No, he said, ''it's a slow-growing form of cancer.'' It was hard to face that he was not infallible, that even a hopeful prognosis sometimes takes a detour and it's no one's fault. It reminded me that besides being a good doctor, he was human. My mother died in a nursing home, attended by a different doctor in her final years. When I found myself in Dr. Daniels's office shortly after her death, his first words were: ''Sorry to hear about your mother.'' I didn't know he knew. His thoughtfulness made my heart hurt. Some years, it seemed I lived in his office. Bronchitis kept a lot of my colds company, and I'm surprised he didn't install a revolving door for me. I must have had a healthy stretch, for at one appointment I was shocked to note his hair had turned white. I introduced him to my new husband at one of my appointments, and a year later, I brought my new baby in, too. Every time I saw him after that, Dr. Daniels asked about both of them, as well as my brother. It's not as if I didn't see his retirement coming. He cut back his hours a couple of years ago, and the nurses have been hinting that ''the day'' would soon come. I was lucky to catch him rather than one of his partners on this particular day. At the end of my visit, when I asked if I could hug him, he put his arms around me. ''It's been a lot of years,'' he agreed. In that instant, I forgave him the two pharmaceutical representatives he let in before me. I made it to my car before tears spilled over and ran down my cheeks. Who knew that losing your doctor would feel like losing a favorite uncle? Who knew I would care this much? Happy retirement, Dr. Daniels, and be well.

Cammermeyer won a 1994 job discrimination suit against the Army after being dismissed for acknowledging her homosexuality. She's running for Congress in Washington state. Q: The Republican incumbent, Congressman Jack Metcalf, recently sent out a fund-raising letter that stressed ''values like honoring the traditional family structure.'' Do you resent those insinuations? A: I expected more class from somebody who's been in politics 40 years. Q: Some of your critics say you're running two different campaigns. One in your district where your literature only mentions your discrimination suit in vague terms, and another where you're more open about your life, raising money with help from celebrities like Barbra Streisand. Are you trying to play it both ways? A: The fact that my personal life happens to be public knowledge is how it is, but I'm not running because of that.. . .Play this one out: a retired Army nurse, Vietnam vet, Ph.D., grandmom and mother of four sons is running for Congress. Is there anything else that's necessary to describe a candidacy?

Dec. 22, 1998-> 149-> Banana Wars
The United States and the European Union are headed toward an avoidable collision over bananas. Yesterday, in retaliation for European restrictions on banana imports, the United States announced a list of European imports that will be subject to 100 percent tariffs -- ranging from cashmere sweaters to plastic purses. The Europeans are flouting a ruling by the World Trade Organization that their banana restrictions, which discriminate in favor of European companies in importing the fruit, are illegal. Such defiance is discouraging when protectionist pressures are growing in many countries. The principal beneficiary of an American victory would be Chiquita Brands, whose chairman, Carl Lindner, has been a generous contributor to both Democrats and Republicans. That has allowed Europeans to claim, inaccurately, that this is about politics, and that they are simply favoring poor Latin American banana exporters. In fact, central American countries, also poor, are joint plaintiffs with the United States in this dispute. Rather than negotiate a settlement after the W.T.O. decision, the Europeans announced new banana rules. But those rules made no significant changes, and appear to be an effort to delay compliance. Europe resisted efforts to get a rapid W.T.O. opinion on those rules. Compromise is needed. If Europe shows a willingness to abide by the W.T.O. ruling, the United States should be open to delays in Europe's coming into full compliance. But it is essential for Europe to accede to the W.T.O. ruling even if it does not like it. To do otherwise would invite international anarchy on trade rules when protectionism is a greater threat than at any time in the past decade.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 150-> SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1998: RELIGION; Wired Into the Monks
Until a couple of years ago, the cloistered Monastery of Christ in the Desert, in New Mexico, had no electricity. Now the rural outpost is the center of the Catholic Church's most ambitious Web plans. Brother Mary Aquinas Woodworth, a computer programmer turned Benedictine monk (pictured), is in the process of developing a worldwide virtual community for Catholics -- sort of a stained-glass America Online -- featuring E-mail, news and chat. Already under way: a project to put Christ in the Desert's monastic liturgy on line. When it's finished in January 1999, people anywhere, anytime will be able to see, hear and pray with the monks, who will be in chapel using IBM-provided flat-panel displays instead of choir books. Brother Aquinas has found that bringing gee-whiz technology to the church hasn't always been easy. He spent a few months working at the Vatican, but says he was stymied by the ''political hothouse'' atmosphere of the place. Like many a Web enthusiast before him, the monk thinks the Internet could be revolutionary. Instead of belonging to a local parish, Catholics may find that their ''congregation'' is a worldwide on-line prayer community. ''This will force a new understanding of community,'' he says. ''It will shake the organization of the church profoundly.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 151-> An Exiled Chinese Activist Speaks Out
A Chinese dissident who arrived in New York on Sunday accused the Government in Beijing yesterday of ''trampling on human rights'' and said he had been beaten while in captivity. After serving more than two and a half years in a labor camp, the activist, Liu Nianchun, managed to give a faint smile and convey his appreciation to the United States Government for his new-found freedom. With his wife and 10-year-old daughter by his side during an hourlong news conference at the Manhattan office of Human Rights Watch, Mr. Liu described the human rights situation in his home country. ''My release into exile for medical treatment cannot be seen as an improvement of China's human rights situation,'' he said. ''The very fact I am here, forced to leave China in order to receive medical treatment, is a serious violation of human rights in itself.'' Recent events like the broadcasting of President Clinton's human rights debate with President Jiang Zemin on Chinese television were significant steps, Mr. Liu said, but do not reflect the true situation. ''These events have masked and diminished perception of the actual situation on gross human rights abuse,'' he said, ''leading some democratic countries to claim that China has already shown marked change in the realm of human rights.'' Mr. Liu recalled beatings by prison guards for offenses as minor as not saluting when entering the bathroom or dining hall. ''I refused to do that,'' he said. ''It was an insult to my personal dignity. ''I was in a 're-education through labor' camp in China. I was extremely sick, and it was very difficult to get a medical examination, and even more difficult to obtain treatment. My living conditions were deplorable.'' Mr. Liu said his 80-year-old mother had gone on a hunger strike to protest his incarceration. And his wife, Chu Hailan, who arrived with him in the United States on Sunday, was beaten by the police when protesting on his behalf, he added. ''We must urge the Chinese Government to match deeds and words and desist in openly trampling on human rights,'' Mr. Liu said. Speaking through a translator throughout the news conference, he said he hoped to return to China someday but for now would work in exile for a democratic China. He said he suffered from high blood pressure and planned to undergo medical tests to determine the extent of his other illnesses.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 152-> POP/JAZZ; Crossing Back Over From Profane to Sacred
ON her solo debut album, ''The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' the rapper, singer and visionary artist Lauryn Hill imagines herself as part of a very old story. It transcends her own 23-year-old life, as stimulating as that may be with the success of her hip-hop group, the Fugees, her highly promising career as a musician and producer and her personal happiness mothering a baby boy. And it eclipses the back catalogue of rhythm-and-blues, although Ms. Hill has established herself as a tradition bearer by respectfully reworking the classic ''Killing Me Softly'' for the Fugees' biggest hit, writing a song for the regal Aretha Franklin, inviting the funk-rock guitarist Carlos Santana to appear on the solo album and recording part of that album at Tuff Gong Studios, founded by the reggae icon Bob Marley. The saga that inspires Ms. Hill even surpasses the details of black American life that fill her work, right down to her album's title, which echoes that of ''The Miseducation of the Negro,'' a book that she probably read in an Afro-American studies class at Columbia University. Her gaze reaches farther, to what she considers the Greatest Story Ever Told: that of a black spiritual legacy grounded in Christianity but constantly adapting to the world outside the church, the buried lifeline of the African diaspora's social movements and its arts, foremost among them the music that ''Miseducation'' (Ruffhouse/Columbia) renews. ''Now some might mistake this for a simple song, and some don't know what they have till it's gone,'' Ms. Hill warns on ''Lost Ones,'' the first track on ''Miseducation'' and one of several rebuking her peers who ignore the hallowed sources of the music they mine. ''You can't hold God's people back that long,'' she intones with a lilt redolent of Rastafarian reggae, the Jamaican version of the story she embraces. Ms. Hill assumes a prophet's voice because she genuinely believes that today's youth lose themselves when they forget that their material gains, their sexual prowess and their emotional well-being are all God-given gifts. Nonbelievers may find her preaching self-righteous. Her religious fervor is not what makes ''Miseducation'' exceptional; it is the way that her faith, based more in experience and feeling than in doctrine, leads her to connect the sacred to the secular in music that touches the essence of soul. ''Miseducation'' is Ms. Hill's attempt to reanoint hip-hop-flavored soul. The great artists to whom she is often compared crossed the same boundary between the holy and the profane, in the opposite direction. Aretha Franklin was a minister's daughter who transformed the hosannas of gospel music into a language exalting human love. Al Green, himself a man of the cloth, delved deep into the nexus of sensuality and mysticism and recast sex as a sacrament. James Brown learned from his gospel roots how to perfect the hypnotic call-and-response of funk. Marvin Gaye, soul's great agnostic, imbued social protest and seduction with fragile grace. These are only a few of many famous examples; in fact, the whole trajectory of rhythm-and-blues can be described as a journey, with plenty of baggage, from church to nightclub. What made the music so rich was not the simple union of religious content into pop but the human enigmas it illuminated. African-Americans, historically forced to adjust their own spiritual practices to fit within their oppressors' religion, created a consecrated language far more flexible than traditional Christianity had ever been. Soul music showed how that language, and the music that expressed it, could elevate people's understanding of carnal pleasures, personal relationships and social concerns. In bringing religion down to earth, it sanctified the commonplace. Lauryn Hill enters into this context and find universal lessons in contemporary scenarios. Although many of the songs on ''Miseducation'' tackle the troubles of earthly love, nearly all of them make reference to the Bible or its God. The link she forges with this God replays the African diaspora's process of spiritual syncretism, or adapting a belief system to new circumstances, on a personal level. Using this approach, Ms. Hill gains a modern woman's self-respect, not a Southern Baptist lesson of submission that some consider sexist. As Ms. Franklin first did in the 1960's, Ms. Hill uses spiritual rhetoric to create a highly introspective and ethical view of romance. ''Father, you saved me and showed me that life was much more than being some foolish man's wife,'' she and her soul sister Mary J. Blige sing in their duet, ''I Used to Love Him,'' thanking a God within for the strength to leave a destructive man. In the album's title track, Ms. Hill declares that religion helped her resist peer pressure and turn inward. ''I made up my mind to find my own destiny,'' she croons over lush orchestration that recalls Stevie Wonder. This is not the kind of Christian pop pablum that puts its message first. In gospel, where Ms. Hill begins, the music is the message, the purest expression of the spiritual self. Ms. Hill honors this fundamental tenet by challenging herself and her listeners, crossing musical borders in pursuit of gospel's wandering lineage. She finds it in doo-wop, soul and rock, but she concentrates on the conduit that brought it from the 1960's to the 1990's: reggae, from Bob Marley to hip-hop. Ms. Hill makes reggae her main power source. She reworks a Marley song, ''Concrete Jungle,'' to include a rap by the Jamaican artist Shelley Thunder, and her own declamatory rapping technique often incorporates Jamaican slang and inflection, recalling how hip-hop evolved from those influences. The album's stunning vocal arrangements are greatly inspired by the harmonies of Marley's former back-up singers, the I Threes. The connection to Jamaica is a personal one; Ms. Hill's lover and the father of her child, Rohan Marley, is one of Bob and Rita Marley's sons. But it also updates the story of soul by grounding ''Miseducation'' in a more recent moment when the sacred met the secular. Reggae began as a hybrid form, marrying soul melodies to Caribbean rhythms; in Marley's hands, it expanded to include elements of rock and Dylanesque folk. In the 1970's, when Ms. Hill was growing up, reggae, influenced by Rastafarianism, was the most vital musical expression of the African diaspora's spiritual life. Rastafarianism is a paradoxical faith, orthodox in its tenets but anarchistic in its practices, embracing no leaders but many prophets. Pioneering rappers like KRS-One employed the reggae inspired by Rastafarianism as a bridge between old-style preaching and newfangled rhyming. ''Miseducation'' is not a reggae album, but it adopts reggae's open, synthesizing approach in songs that vary in tone from ''Nothing Even Matters,'' a slow but rhythmically dazzling duet with D'Angelo, to ''Superstar,'' a rap that borrows its first line and percolating keyboards from the Doors. One of Ms. Hill's more audacious bits of preaching takes place in ''Superstar,'' when she compares today's rap stars to Christ, reminding them that fickle crowds tend to crucify their heroes. But Ms. Hill makes her most daring, and beautiful, leap in ''To Zion,'' which celebrates the arrival of her son. Naming the baby after the homeland longed for by the Bible's chosen people and later by the Rastafarians who re-envisioned that home as Africa was brash enough. But Ms. Hill actually imagines herself in the place of the Virgin Mary, receiving an angelic annunciation that ''unto me a man child would be born.'' Ms. Hill is not our Lady of the Turntables. But her locating herself in one of the great Christian narratives lends gravity and grace to her expression of new motherhood's elation and fears. As the chorus builds, with a gospel choir singing ''Beautiful, beautiful Zion'' and Ms. Hill shouting herself hoarse in the foreground, the song becomes the high point of a miraculous album, a hymn to all the holiness the mortal heart can generate.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 153-> The Rainbows Are Coming!
I was taken aback by the account of the Rainbow Family's recent stay in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona (Sunday: ''The Rainbows Are Coming!'' Aug. 2). A few years ago, the group came to Vermont and stayed nearby in the Green Mountain National Forest. Out of curiosity, my daughter and I hiked up to see what was happening, and we were pleasantly surprised to find a well-organized gathering of thousands of people. Some were using drugs, it is true, and some nudity prevailed, but there were also positive aspects, like hospitality to all, wonderful music and signs warning against abusing the land or polluting the river. A hike a couple of weeks after the Rainbows left showed no remains of their presence except some areas seeded by members who stayed to make sure the land was in good condition. I find it strange that such a drastic turn of events could occur within such a short period of time. Marlene Wurn Harrison Salisbury, Vt.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 154-> A Blue Oasis, Seen From Space
Earth was not supposed to be a tourist attraction on the way to the Moon. But as T. S. Eliot suggested, the real meaning of exploration is to get back to the starting point ''and know the place for the first time.'' So it was on the day before Christmas in 1968 that three astronauts, Frank Borman, William Anders and James Lovell, cruising 69 miles over the slate-rubbled surface of the back side of the Moon, having ventured farther from home than any humans in history, looked up and saw their home world, again, for the first time, as a planet, a blue oasis in the void, rising over the dead gray moonscape. Arguably no artifact of the space age has had the emotional impact of the ''Earthrise'' photograph, which has decorated countless dormitory rooms and grass-roots environmental offices and has been made into a stamp -- despite long-standing uncertainty over who exactly took the famous photograph. Both Major Anders and Colonel Borman, the spacecraft commander, recalled taking the picture. In his autobiography, Commander Borman said he had snatched the camera from Major Anders, who had been photographing lunar features. Two recent historical accounts, ''A Man on the Moon,'' by Andrew Chaikin, and ''Genesis: the Story of Apollo 8,'' by Robert Zimmerman, tend to bear out Colonel Anders's account. Shortly after the photograph was taken, Commander Borman, who thought the only thing more important than getting to the Moon was getting safely back, ordered his excited and tired crew to bed. Back on Earth, Americans were coming to the end of a traumatic year that included the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., continuing turmoil over the war in Vietnam, a Presidential campaign fraught with violence and the humiliating seizure of a Navy tanker, the U.S.S. Pueblo, and its 84 crewmen, by North Korea. Apollo 8's Christmas mission to orbit the Moon in preparation for a planned landing the following summer was a bright surprise. Time magazine named the three astronauts Men of the Year. Charged with conducting a live television broadcast from Moon orbit on Christmas Eve, Colonel Borman rose to the moment and reached for the best material. As Apollo 8 drifted into the shadow of lunar blackness and Earth disappeared over the horizon, the crew started to read from the Bible, ''In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth . . .'' Major Anders later remembered thinking that this moment was a new beginning for humanity. Apollo 8 circled the Moon 10 times before looping back to splash down in the Pacific Ocean on a grateful Earth. Neil Armstrong's small step, golf balls on the Moon, the desertion of lunar exploration, shuttle explosions, myopic space telescopes, and lumbering space stations were still in the future. But 30 years ago this week, there was poetry in the cosmos. DENNIS OVERBYE

Dec. 22, 1998-> 156-> As Octuplets Remain in Peril, Ethics Questions Are Raised
The two sons and six daughters born to a Houston area woman remained in critical condition at Texas Children's Hospital tonight, sedated and incubated -- all eight of them together weighing just a breath over 10 pounds. The infants born to Nkem Chukwu, who are the only known living octuplets in the world, maintained a fragile hold on life. The next week will be critical as it becomes clear whether the babies' lungs, hearts, brains and internal organs are developed enough to keep them alive. Even after that, doctors said, dangers remain from infections or metabolic problems. The infants, still unnamed, were being referred to as babies A through H. The largest of them was 26 ounces, the smallest 10.3 ounces and 9.75 inches long, small enough to fit in a woman's hand. ''As small as a Beanie Baby,'' said Laura Floyd, a hospital spokeswoman. Even as the news leaked out on Sunday, drawing reporters and television crews to the hospital, the births were raising deep concern among reproductive specialists around the country. ''This should not be a cause for celebration,'' said Dr. Mark Perloe, director of reproductive endocrinology at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Center. ''The cost of caring for these babies and the pregnancy will run into the millions of dollars. The risk of death still exists. And there is a significant risk that they will have lifelong health problems. I think this is a wake-up call for the medical profession.'' Increases in the use of the same kinds of fertility drugs that had been given to Ms. Chukwu have caused a surge of multiple births in the last decade, specialists said. Many aging and childless couples are demanding aggressive fertility therapies more likely to produce multiple births. ''If you look at the statistics, you see that there is a growing increase in the number of multiple gestations,'' said Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, based in Birmingham, Ala. ''Some of it is due to in-vitro fertilization, some is due to an expanded use of the medications but some of it is just because we are seeing the results of the baby boomers who delayed in having their children.'' ''I wish this couple well and I hope the babies do well, but this scares me,'' said Dr. Alan Copperman, director of reproductive endocrinology at Mt. Sinai-N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System in New York. ''It seems there is almost an acceptance these days of quads or quints or even more, and the outrage gets less and less as we hear about more and more of these cases. The fact is that the vast majority of these cases end in disaster, sometimes for the mom, most often for the babies.'' Dr. Mark Evans, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Wayne State University in Detroit, noted that there had never been a successful octuplet pregnancy. ''Although these babies were born alive,'' Dr. Evans said, ''the odds are, unfortunately, that there will not be happy outcomes for at least several of them.'' Hospital officials would not speculate on the infants' chances, but other neonatal specialists said that all but the smallest of the infants should, statistically, have about an 85 percent chance of pulling through. The little one has a harder road. All of the babies were under sedation and receiving regular intravenous supplies of sugar and water, and seven of them remained attached to ventilators to aid their underdeveloped lungs. Nkem Chukwu (pronounced nih-KEHM chuhk-WOO) was admitted to St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in October as she and doctors struggled to forestall the birth of the fetuses until they were old enough to survive. She gave birth to her first daughter on Dec. 8, 15 weeks premature, but doctors were able to delay the other births until Sunday morning. It was not until after the first birth that a sonogram revealed there were seven more living fetuses. In 1971, nine infants were born to a mother in Sydney, Australia, but all of them died. There have been three other octuplet births in the past 13 years -- in Spain, Britain and Turkey -- but in each case at least some of the infants soon died. Every time a case comes along like that of Ms. Chukwu or the McCaughey septuplets, some desperate couples become more willing to take greater risks, Dr. Copperman said, adding, ''It's almost like an arms race.'' Ms. Chukwu, 27, was born in Nigeria but is an American citizen living in the Houston area. The hospital declined to release any personal information about the couple, at their request, though The Houston Chronicle identified her husband, Iyke (pronounced ee-KAY), as a respiratory therapist. The couple had been trying to conceive for several years and Ms. Chukwu had lost triplets earlier this year, doctors said, so she entered her most recent pregnancy with a solemn determination. At a news conference at the hospital on Sunday, Dr. Patti Savrick described the new mother as unusually tall and ''very serene, a very spiritual woman.'' Ms. Chukwu had surgery today to stop internal bleeding described as a ''generalized ooze,'' by Dr. Brian Kirshon, a specialist in high-risk births who delivered the Chukwu children. Hospital officials said tonight that Ms. Chukwu was stable and improving and would probably would be well enough to go home in about a week. But the infants, if they survived, would probably remain in the hospitals for many weeks. The fertility drugs Ms. Chukwu was receiving, hospitals officials said, included one to stimulate ovulation and H.C.G., or human chorionic gonadatropin, which is normally produced by a healthy placenta to maintain pregnancy. Ms. Chukwu was placed on a liquid diet and was confined to her hospital bed for six weeks, the last two following her initial delivery with her pelvis raised above her head, to remove pressure on her cervix. She was given a trio of drugs -- magnesium sulfate, terbutaline and indomethicin -- to delay the birth of the remaining fetuses, hospital officials said. The remaining seven children were born during a 45-minute Caesarean section at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital early Sunday and ferried to the adjacent Texas Children's Hospital by a team of more than two dozen doctors. The family immediately asserted its privacy, refusing to give interviews, to appoint a family spokesman or to allow photos of the tiny infants, forcing journalists to set up camp outside the hospital which, by today, was giving no more press briefings and simply releasing updates every six hours on its Internet site. Dr. Kirshon and other members of the medical team involved in the Chukwu births told reporters on Sunday that bearing octuplets was not a desired result of fertility treatments. ''The human being was meant to have one baby,'' Dr. Kirshon said. It had happened, in this case, both because the fertility drugs which had made Ms. Chukwu's pregnancy possible had also led to the fertilization of so many eggs and because the family, when given the option early in her pregnancy to stop the growth of some of the fertilized embryos, a procedure called selective or multi-fetal reduction, had declined to allow it. Some patients and doctors consider the procedure unethical, a form of early abortion, but proponents argue that it gives the remaining embryos a better chance for survival. ''With every single patient that undergoes treatment with these fertility drugs I discuss the dangers and I discuss multi-fetal reduction,'' Dr. Copperman said. ''If they say yes, they will allow reduction, it perhaps allows you a little more leeway to give fertility drugs. Others say they can't emotionally or religiously or ethically tolerate the procedure, so you have to be more careful.'' Such issues only come into play in procedures involving these fertility drugs, doctors say. In those cases where in-vitro fertilization is used, under 10 percent of all cases, the number of eggs implanted into the mother can be controlled. ''With in-vitro, you have a tremendous amount of control, but with these fertility drugs, when you don't use in-vitro, you can cause the woman to make a lot of eggs and you don't have quite as much control,'' Dr. Copperman said. It becomes, in some extreme cases, a bit of a guessing game, and not all doctors administering the fertility drugs have as much training as they might need, said Dr. Perloe. ''There are no restrictions on who can use these drugs,'' Dr. Copperman said. ''A gynecologist with four weeks training during his residency has just as much access as someone who has done a fellowship and trained two to three years.'' Another problem, Dr. Younger said, is that prospective parents sometimes must pay for their own fertility procedures when medical insurers decline to cover them. ''And since they're paying for it, and it is very costly,'' Dr. Younger said, ''they often demand the most aggressive form of therapy and they get into a situation of unnecessary risk taking.'' At the same time, Dr. Younger said, the Federal Government has steadfastly refused to allocate money for reproductive research, largely because ''the issue inevitably always becomes entwined with the abortion debate.'' Conservatives in Congress have expressed concerns over research involving the use of human embryos, Dr. Younger said, choking off financing both for that kind of research and for other fertility research, even if it does not involve embryos. The end result, he said, is that during the same years when the use of such fertility drugs was going up and the demand was increasing from aging, childless couples, little research was being done in the United States on the proper use of the drugs. ''If we'd been doing the research, we might have looked to develop some protocols on how to best use these drugs, protocols that would have lessened the likelihood of something like this happening,'' Dr. Younger said. ''The dearth of research has left a great void in this country.'' On the brighter side, doctors in the field have become much more scrupulous about warning patients of the dangers involved, he said. The problem is that the patients, desperate to get pregnant, don't always listen. ''Patients develop what we call selective hearing,'' Dr. Younger said. ''They just filter the warnings down to a lower level and concentrate on the part about getting pregnant.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 157-> 10 Years After Lockerbie, Still No Trial
On the 10th anniversary of the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland, the United States told Libya today that it will face more sanctions if two Libyan suspects are not turned over for trial by a Scottish judge in the Netherlands by February. ''Ten years is much too long to wait for justice,'' said Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the Security Council, which discussed the issue today. In Libya, however, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi only widened the breach today, apparently rejecting the compromise plan for a trial in the Netherlands by saying that he wanted an international tribunal to hear the case. Earlier this month, Libya's National Assembly seemed to endorse the plan for a Scottish trial after a personal appeal to Colonel Qaddafi from Secretary General Kofi Annan. ''An international court is the solution,'' Colonel Qaddafi told a Dutch television interviewer in a program taped last week and broadcast in the Netherlands today, ''with judges from America, Libya, England and other countries.'' Today, however, at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery marking the bombing, President Clinton said the plan to hold the trial in the Netherlands was a ''take it or leave it'' deal. ''We will not negotiate its terms,'' he added. For years Libya refused to allow American or British courts to try the suspects in the bombing, which killed 270 people, including 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, the Scottish town where the plane came down. In August Britain and the United States offered the compromise of a trial in a third country, and the Netherlands agreed to allow a Scottish court to be set up for that purpose in Utrecht. But Libya, under United Nations sanctions since 1992, continued to stall, raising questions about the treatment of the suspects and where they would be imprisoned if convicted. British officials and the Secretary General's legal counsel, Under Secretary General Hans Corell, replied exhaustively to the Libyans. Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative at the United Nations, said today that all the questions raised by Libya had been answered. Arab diplomats say Libya is concerned that the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, could be pressed by Western intelligence agencies or trial prosecutors to talk about more than Lockerbie. Mr. Annan said again today that he remains optimistic that Libya will eventually comply with the request to send the suspects to the Netherlands. But the signs from Libya seem to be pointing in another direction. In February the Security Council will review the sanctions, which would be suspended immediately if the suspects were handed over. By February, Mr. Burleigh said today, ''the Libyan Government will have had six months to accept the offer it long said it would accept.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 161-> POSTINGS: 16-Story, $80 Million Building on East 14th Street; From a Disco Palace To an N.Y.U. Dormitory
Demolition of the old Palladium dance club forged ahead last week to make way for another New York University dormitory on 14th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, which students are already calling Palladium Hall. ''I don't see why not,'' said L. Jay Oliva, president of the university. ''Folks are trying to preserve a sense of place.'' The 16-story, $80-million, block-through iron-spot brick building will begin to rise on the site in February. Just west of it, 637 N.Y.U. students will begin the new semester in the alabaster-colored 20-story University Hall where Luchow's restaurant once stood. The two sites are now separated by a P. C. Richard & Son appliance store on 14th Street and Genesis Apartments, for the formerly homeless and low-income families, on 13th Street. ''There is a corridor of students across Union Square,'' said Dr. Oliva. ''Academic life is focused on Washington Square and residential life is focused on 14th Street and Union Square. We run a large bus system.'' About 9,000 students are now living in N.Y.U.'s sprawled-out dormitory rooms. The figure will remain the same when the new dormitory, accommodating 973 students, opens in September 2001, because the school will give up some space that it now leases. The new building's red-granite base is to give a sense of the commercial streetscape, and the upper three floors will be set back. Students will be able to fix meals in kitchen areas of apartment-like suites. A dining hall will seat up to 350 students at a time. The dormitory will have a 65,000-square-foot athletic and recreation facility, including a pool designed for swimming meets; a basketball court and exercise spaces with dance, aerobics and weight rooms in two basement floors. There will also be 43,000 square feet of retail space on the first two floors. The architect is Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, of Hamden, Conn. The Palladium building, with its dilapidated marquee and graffiti-covered bricks, is to be completely demolished by the end of next month. The disco was built in 1985 within the shell of a 1926 vaudeville and movie palace called the Academy of Music.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 163-> WINTER SPORTS: WORLD CUP ROUNDUP; Swiss Skier Wins; American Is Second
WOMEN'S SLALOM Karin Roten gave Switzerland's women their first World Cup victory of the season, in a slalom yesterday in Veysonnaz, Switzerland, as the American Kristina Koznick finished second. Leading after the first run, Roten had a brilliant second run for a combined winning time of 1 minute, 28.81 seconds. Swiss women had not won a race since 1997 when Heidi Zurbriggen captured a downhill at Cortina, Italy. Roten's only other victory came two years ago, when she won a slalom at Lillehammer, Norway. In between, Roten had three medal finishes. Her last was a third place in a giant slalom at Vail, Colo., a year ago. It was a relief, Roten said. Two years is a long time. It was important for Switzerland, which needed a win.'' Roten beat Koznick by a half-second. Koznick's second place was the Americans' first medal finish of the season, too. Finishing 15th and 27th in the season's earlier slaloms, Koznick finally displayed the form which led her to four medals -- including a victory at Are, Sweden -- and second place in the World Cup slalom standings last season. I needed this result to prove I could still ski well, said Koznick, whose goal this year is to win the World Cup slalom. After doing so well last year, I put a lot of pressure on myself at the start of this season.'' The winner of the previous slalom, at Mammoth Mountain, Calif., 17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden, finished third. BIATHLON Germans Dominate In Pursuit Races Germany's powerful biathlon team capped an extraordinary week by capturing both World Cup pursuit races yesterday in Osrblie, Slovakia. Uschi Disl captured her third World Cup victory in a week and led a German sweep in the 10-kilometer women's pursuit. Sven Fischer overcame two shooting errors to win the men's 12.5-kilometer event and hold on to first place in World Cup standing. Germans won seven of eight events during the week. Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm, who won Saturday's 7.5K sprint, was second in the pursuit, and Katrin Apel was third. Disl clocked a time of 31:26.50 to gain her 17th World Cup victory and grab a share of the season lead. Fischer posted a time of 33:11.1, beating Raphael Poiree of France by 43.7 seconds and Pavel Rostovtsev of Russia by 44.5. MEN'S GIANT SLALOM First Cup Victory For Swiss Champion Michael Von Gruenigen, the world champion from Switzerland, claimed his first World Cup victory of the season yesterday when he skied a faultless second run to win a men's giant slalom in Alta Badia, Italy. Gruenigen, the Olympic bronze medalist, was second after the first leg but was more than half a second faster than the field in his final run to finish with a combined time of 2 minutes 41.01 seconds for his 15th career World Cup triumph. To win once on this great course is wonderful, but to win here twice is really a dream, said the 29-year-old Swiss, who won in Alta Badia two years ago. Italy's Patrik Holzer, the first-leg leader, skied a brave second run immediately after Von Gruenigen but had none of his rival's composure and settled for second place in 2:41.77. The World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer was third in 2:42.26. (Reuters) LUGE Germany's Hackl Takes Overall Lead Germany's Georg Hackl, the three-time Olympic champion, won his second World Cup singles race of the season yesterday, with Adam Heidt of the United States a surprising third in Winterberg, Germany. The victory over Markus Prock of Austria, his perennial rival, gave Hackl the lead in the overall standing. Hackl battled through a snowy first run in 55.439 seconds to take a 0.18 of a second advantage over Prock. The 32-year-old German rode that margin with a second heat time of 55.047 for a winning aggregate of 1:50.486. The victory gave Hackl 309 points after four of seven events. Prock, without a victory to date, was second in 1:50.578 and is second in the standing with 290. Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, 11th in the event, fell from first to third with 289. I like this track and I was lucky with the conditions, Hackl said after his 20th career World Cup victory. SKI JUMPING Finn Clinches 3d Event of Season Janne Ahonen, the world champion from Finland, clinched his third ski jumping World Cup victory of the season, beating Japan's Noriaki Kasai by 6.6 points at the K120 hill yesterday in Harrachov, Czech Republic. Ahonen won the first round with 126 meters and 128.3 points, which gave him a comfortable lead for the second heat in which he finished 12th at 126.5 meters. After eight events, Ahonen leads the World Cup. He also won Saturday's competition. Kasai, second in the first round with a jump of 122.5 meters, finished 11th in the second at 125 meters. Andreas Widhoelzl of Austria finished third over all, with jumps of 116.5 and 129 meters. Tommy Ingebritsen of Norway had a record jump of 135.5 meters in the second round, but combined with 110.5 in the first heat, it was good only for sixth over all.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 164-> Q & A
Layover in Frankfurt Q. We are six adults bound for Cape Town in October and have a layover in Frankfurt from 10:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. Any recommendations on sightseeing, shopping and dining? -- Lois Mendelson, Livingston, N.J. A. With seven and a half hours of air travel behind you and 13-plus hours to Cape Town ahead, you and your friends may well want to leave some time just to catch your breaths. Making an airport hotel a base will allow you to rest and to be near your airline terminal when departure time draws near. Here are two hotels that have ''day rooms,'' where one can stay from morning until 6 P.M. The rates are for double occupancy. At the Sheraton Frankfurt Hotel, (49-69) 69770, fax (49-69) 60549, the rate is $126, based on 1.78 marks to the dollar. It is connected to the terminal by a pedestrian bridge. At the Steigenberger Airport Hotel, (49-69) 69750, fax (49-69) 69752505, it's $115. When there's a trade fair such as the huge Frankfurt Book Fair, from Oct. 7 to 12, the rate does not change but availability can be very tight. The hotels are 20 minutes from downtown by taxi ($17 to $28) and 10 minutes by the S-8 Bahn ($3.20). The downtown area is compact enough to get around easily on foot. Starting at the Hauptwache, a historic guardhouse, will put you in the heart of the city (nearest S-Bahn stop: Hauptwache). From there you can head for the Zeil, where the shopping options include the Zeil galerie, an exclusive mall, and the Fressgasse (part of which is officially known as the Grosse Bocken heimer Strasse), where cafes and bistros abound. An easy way to catch the highlights is to take a two-and-a-half-hour bus tour that includes a walk through the old part of the city and a visit to the Historical Museum and the Goethe-Haus, where the writer was born 249 years ago this week. The tour departs from the Tourist Information Office Romer, at 27 Romerberg, at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. from April to October; (49-69) 21 23 88 00. During the rest of the year, there is a single tour, at 2. Cost: $25. Among the buildings around the square known as the Romerberg, where the city tour originates, is the Romer, a house with three stepped Gothic gables that the city acquired in the 15th century; it has become became the city hall and a symbol of the city itself. Also bordering the square is the cathedral where coronation ceremonies for Holy Roman emperors were held. If you return to the Hauptwache, you are a few minutes' walk from the Restaurant Francais, in the Hotel Frankfurter Hof, 1 Kaiserplatz, (49-69) 2 15 02. The cuisine is European; a three-course dinner for one, not including wine, is $20 to $42. Should time, interest and energy permit, you can cross to the south bank of the Main where along the Schaumainkai you will find half a dozen museums, including the recently renovated Stadel Art Institute, whose holdings include works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Durer and Goya. The entry fee is normally $2.80, but it will be $5 in October because of an exhibition about ''Interior Lives'' in painting from the 14th to the 20th century. Closed Mondays. A bit farther west, at 71 Schaumainkai, is the Liebighaus, a sculpture museum. Its outdoor cafe, amid beautiful trees, is most romantic. A cup of coffee and a pastry is $3.65. All Aboard for the Rockies Q. WNET recently televised a program titled ''The Rockies by Rail.'' Can you provide details about how to take this journey? -- Howard S. Ravis, Ossining, N.Y. A. The trip shown on your local Public Broadcasting Service station was aboard the American Orient Express. A restored luxury train with cars built between 1948 and 1958, it is operating on eight routes this year, including the trip you saw -- between Denver and Portland. The highlights of the six-day journey, known as ''The Rockies and Yellowstone,'' include traveling for 238 miles along the Colorado River, by turns turbulent and placid, and passing through a series of dramatic canyons, among them Glenwood. It is Glenwood that is said to have inspired the building in the 1940's of rail cars with spacious windows affording a view not only of grand vistas and towering rock walls on either side but also of the sky above. After a stop in Salt Lake City, the train goes to Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island State Park. Then come two major highlights -- Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks -- after which the train follows the Columbia River on the way to Portland. Trips through the Rockies resume in 1999, when the schedule calls for departures from Denver to Portland on June 11 and Oct. 8, and from Portland to Denver on May 17 and Sept. 11. The prices are from $2,875 to $4,585 a person, double occupancy, and include all meals, one night at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Yellowstone and excursions. Information: American Orient Express Railway Company, 2025 First Avenue, Seattle, Wash. 98121; (888) 759-3944 or (206) 441-2725, fax (206) 727-7309. Atlanta to Savannah Q. We will be traveling to Atlanta, and while in the South we want to visit Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. Is there a bus tour that leaves from and returns to Atlanta? -- S. Kaye, Forest Hills, Queens A. The limited interest in such an excursion doesn't justify running it regularly, representatives of the two major bus-tour operators in Atlanta say. If you're really determined to see Savannah while in Atlanta, you can take an intercity bus. The ride on the first three buses of the day -- departing at 7, 7:30 and 8 A.M. -- can take from 5 hours 40 minutes to 6 hours 40 minutes. All three arrive at 1:40 P.M. The 7 and 8 A.M. runs are operated by Southeastern Stages, which charges $71.16 for a round trip, and the 7:30 and three other buses to Savannah are operated by Greyhound Lines, which charges $77.04 round trip. Information: Greyhound, (404) 584-1728; Southeastern Stages, (404) 874-2741. In Savannah, there are about two dozen tour companies, and they offer tours by van, by boat and on foot. So if the trip seems worth the effort, you can get details from the Savannah Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, 222 West Oglethorpe Avenue, Savannah, Ga. 31402-1628; (800) 444-2427 or (912) 944-0456. Another option is staying put and getting to know Atlanta better. A choice of daily four-hour excursions is offered by American Coach Lines, (770) 449-1806, for $35 to $40, and American Sightseeing Atlanta, (800) 572-3050 or (404) 233-9140, for $35 or $36.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 165-> 3 Balloonists Press Flight, Then China Lifts Its Ban
Fearing that China might force their balloon to land in the Himalaya Mountains, three balloonists received word early today that the Beijing Government had reconsidered its ban and would allow them to continue their round-the-world journey. Shortly after the balloon reached the Himalayas yesterday, China unexpectedly canceled the overflight permission it had granted to Richard Branson and his crew. By then the balloon was already over the mountains on a course from Nepal into China, unable to return or land. Frantic diplomatic efforts by Mr. Branson's ground team in London ensued, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain appealed for Chinese overflight permission. News agencies reported from Beijing that the Government reluctantly agreed to let the balloon proceed over China, provided that the crew made every effort to stay south of the 26th parallel, below China's most heavily traveled air corridors. It appeared that the ICO Global Challenge, which has already covered one third of the distance around the world, still had a chance of success. Yesterday, during the fourth day of their flight, the three-member crew -- Mr. Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett -- encountered the first serious check to their rapid progress. Soon after they had committed their 160-foot-high balloon to a course taking it over the Himalayas from India, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent word that the overflight permission it had granted the balloonists on Nov. 26 had been withdrawn. In a satellite telephone interview yesterday while the balloon was over Nepal at an altitude of 29,000 feet, Mr. Fossett said: ''We're in a real jam. We're already over the Himalayas and there's no place to land. We have to keep going into China, and once over Chinese territory they could order us to land, or might even shoot us down.'' ''We can't turn back, we can't land and we can't avoid China,'' Mr. Fossett said. As Mr. Fossett spoke, the balloon was a scant 15 miles from the Chinese border. Two hours later, in the darkness of night, the balloon crossed into China in a region dominated by the highest mountains in the world. Mr. Branson (who is the billionaire chairman of the Virgin Group) and Mr. Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd., are British subjects. Mr. Fossett, a wealthy commodities broker and a champion long-distance balloonist, is American. Since the ICO Global Challenge rose from its launching site at Marrakesh, Morocco, on Friday, jet-stream winds have whisked it nearly a third of the way around the world. But the flight has been anything but relaxing. On Saturday the balloonists were forced to fly through a dangerous corridor between a line of powerful thunderstorms in southern Turkey and the border of hostile Iraq. The balloon also had to carefully thread its way around the borders of Iran and Russia, which had denied it overflight permission. Although a balloon cannot steer, it can rise or descend, seeking out winds blowing in the desired direction. For this, a team of ground-based meteorologists in London constantly analyzing weather data provides the ICO Global Challenge with essential guidance. No balloonists have ever come close to circling the earth nonstop, but more teams are expected to try in the coming months than ever before. Seven teams besides the ICO Global Challenge have announced plans to try their luck. Two of them -- the Breitling Orbiter 3 from Switzerland and the Cable & Wireless Balloon from Britain -- are already at their launching pads in the Swiss Alps and Spain awaiting favorable weather to start. Two others hope to be ready before the season's weather opportunity ends in mid-February. Three other balloon teams are planning attempts around the world from the southern hemisphere next July.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 166-> BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; Average Salary Rises By 4.7 Percent in 1998
The increase in major league baseball salaries slowed to 4.7 percent in 1998, and the Baltimore Orioles displaced the Yankees from the top spot for the first time since 1993. The average salary this year was $1,398,831, according to final figures released yesterday by the players association, up from $1,336,609 last year. That increase is considerably less than the 19.3 percent jump in 1997. The commissioner's office, which uses a slightly different method to assess salaries, came up with a final average of $1,380,099. Baltimore, which stumbled to a 79-83 record and a fourth-place finish in the American League East, set a record for team average per player at $2,761,464, breaking the mark of $2,303,437 set by the 1997 Yankees. The Yankees, who won the World Series for the second time in three seasons this year, had the second-highest average at $2,229,945, followed by Texas ($2,108,505), Atlanta ($2,007,665), the Mets ($1,959,971) and the National League champion, San Diego ($1,895,756). All eight post-season teams were among the top 14. Texas soared to 3d in the salary standing from 13th in 1997, while the Mets jumped to 5th from 15th. The Chicago Cubs, who won the N.L. wild-card berth, increased from 19th to 11th and Houston, which won the N.L. Central, went from 22d to 14th. Florida, which won the World Series title in 1997, dropped from 5th at $1,793,766 to 28th among the 30 teams at $462,381 following a payroll purge. Montreal had the lowest average salary at $306,162. Pittsburgh, last in 1997, was next to last this year at $459,552. First base was again the most lucrative position, averaging $3,720,005. Designated hitters averaged $3,312,611, followed by outfielders ($2,861,263), third basemen ($2,770,642), second basemen ($2,480,481), starting pitchers ($2,182,700), catchers ($2,115,584), shortstops ($1,565,123) and relief pitchers ($851,053). 39 Players Become Free Agents Outfielders John Mabry, James Mouton and Darren Bragg were among the 39 players who became free agents yesterday when their teams failed to offer them 1999 contracts. All players on 40-man rosters must be offered contracts by the Dec. 20 deadline or they immediately go free. Teams may then re-sign the players as free agents for any amount. The Yankees did not offer a contract to outfielder Darryl Strawberry for a different reason. He is recovering from colon cancer surgery and may not be ready by opening day. The Yankees intend to re-sign Strawberry to a minor league contract -- that way, if he starts the season on the disabled list, his salary is not subject to the luxury tax. As the focus began to shift from free agents to salary arbitration, the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a $17 million, three-year contract with Joey Hamilton, obtained from the San Diego Padres last week. Hamilton, who made $3.25 million last season, gets $4.25 million next year, $5.25 million in 2000 and $7.5 million in 2001. The 28-year-old right-hander was 13-13 last season with a 4.40 earned run average. Detroit Ball Park Gets Bank's Name The Detroit Tigers announced yesterday that the club's new downtown stadium -- scheduled to open in time for the 2000 season -- will be named for Comerica, the Detroit-based banking company, as part of a 30-year deal. Comerica's cost: $66 million total. The ball park will cost $285 million and will seat 40,000, the club president John McHale Jr. said.

To Sunday Styles: The short article ''Bottled Tans Good Enough to Fool a Dermatologist'' (Aug. 16) contained some very good information. It was misleading, however, as regards its reference to malignant melanoma. The article implied that use of self-tanning products by women ''may be one factor'' why women have a lower rate of this disease than men. There is no data to support this hypothesis. In fact, most researchers believe that genetics, not exposure to sunlight, plays the major role in this deadly malady. KEN KLEIN Fairfield, N.J.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 168-> PULSE; Martini Liftoff
Did Adam Tihany's martini arrive too late? When he designed a space-age cocktail glass for a Bombay Gin advertisement in 1992, the martini craze was just taking off. ''That glass was my homage to James Bond,'' Mr. Tihany said. ''It was kind of like a little rocket launcher.'' When the ad appeared, people wanted to know where they could buy the handmade Venetian glass, with a sphere for a stem, set down in a silver stand. Nowhere, unfortunately. There were only two, props commissioned by Bombay, which held the rights. The rights have since reverted to Mr. Tihany, who has made 200 limited-edition glasses with Christofle. But now that martinis have reached a saturation point, will anyone spend $550 a pop for the glasses? In two weeks at Pavillon Christofle (800-799-6886), 50 have been sold. The thirst for martinis hasn't gone completely dry. KIMBERLY STEVENS

Dec. 22, 1998-> 169-> Apparel Retailer Drops 2000 Bug Claim
In a setback for computer users looking for deep pockets to help pay the cost of Year 2000 problems, J. Baker, an apparel retailer, has dropped its claim that Andersen Consulting, the designer of a computer system Baker installed in 1991, is liable for the system's Year 2000 defects. Baker had been threatening to sue the New York-based Andersen when the consulting company instead rushed to a Massachusetts state court in August asking for a ruling that there was no basis for such a suit. The contract said nothing about the Year 2000. Baker said yesterday that as a result of a mediator's report backing Andersen it had agreed that Andersen owed it nothing for the Year 2000 repair costs. Andersen is dropping its request for a state court ruling. Baker, based in Canton, Mass., operates several retail clothing chains, including Casual Male Big and Tall.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 170-> PULSE; Yankee Magnetism
When the Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu joined the Yankees last season, he spoke little English but quickly became known for his magnetism. That is, for taping tiny magnets on his arms before games, a practice common in Japan, where ball teams also enlist Shinto priests and burn incense in hopes of improving their performance. This season, Darryl Strawberry, Paul O'Neill, Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius are following Mr. Irabu's lead and wearing U-shaped magnetic bracelets, which are touted by their Japanese manufacturer, Tsujimoto, to increase circulation, ease pain, help balance and promote energy. ''From what I've heard about it, it's going to make me healthy and I'm going to live to be 150,'' Mr. O'Neill said. But Dr. Carlos Vallbona, a medical authority on magnet therapy, said that any benefit the Yankees receive from the bracelets is mind over magnets. ''For the magnetic field to work, magnets have to be applied directly to the area of distress,'' he said, adding, however, that the jewelry did work nicely with the team's 1996 World Series rings. Though the Yankees are on pace to win 120 games this season, Mr. Strawberry leads the team in home runs and the rest of the bangled players made the All-Star team, magnetic bracelets, which can be bought for $50 to $150, may not become as common among major leaguers as batting gloves and creatine drinks. Another Yankee, Chuck Knoblauch, recently tried the bracelet, but during a batting slump decided to stick with just a sweatband. JOE BRESCIA

Dec. 22, 1998-> 171-> A Play Aimed at Arrogance
To the Editor: Dr. Abigail Zuger's essay expresses a deep sense of sadness about the portrayal of physicians in the play ''Wit'' as variously remote, pompous, slick and rude. As a medical ethicist who has contributed to the critical examination of contemporary medical practice, I can appreciate that the play cuts close to the bone. However, having seen the play twice, I would like to suggest its strongest indictment is not of physicians but of all forms of inhumanity and arrogance that potentially accompany technical expertise. Aristotle astutely observed that a technician can perform brilliantly in ignorance of the human consequences of mastery. The play is brilliant because it dramatizes the moral challenge of professional expertise -- whether of a scholar-teacher or physician-researcher: The professional must bring expertise to earth without crushing those whom it is intended to benefit. This is the paradox of ''Wit.'' VIRGINIA A. SHARPE, PH.D. Garrison, N.Y.

The Levitz Furniture Corporation, struggling to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, said yesterday that it would close 27 of its 90 stores and eliminate 1,000 jobs, or about 25 percent of its work force. Levitz said it would also shrink its warehouse system down to 17, from 65 sites, and continue efforts to freshen up its dowdier stores. It will also open at least 15 stores, including at least three or more in the 1999 first half. Levitz, based in Boca Raton, Fla., has been operating under Chapter 11 of United States bankruptcy law since September 1997. The restructuring marks the first major move by Levitz's new chairman and chief executive officer, Edward L. Grund.

Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball -- one of the most sought-after in baseball history -- will be auctioned off. McGwire's record-setting ball and Hank Aaron's 755th home run ball were added to five other baseballs from the past season's home run derby, all to be sold by Guernsey's Auction House in Manhattan on Jan. 12. Aaron's 755th ball was caught 22 years ago at Milwaukee's County Stadium, by then Brewers groundskeeper Richard Arndt. Until now, Arndt has turned down many offers to sell the ball signed by Aaron, whose final home run set the career record in 1976. The Guernsey's catalog for the sale features color photos of each ball and historical anecdotes from the most famous home runs in history. McGwire's 70 home runs broke Roger Maris' 37-year-old single-season record of 61.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 174-> SOCCER; It's the Same Old Refrain as Yet Another Late Goal Trips Up the MetroStars
Another late goal, another loss for the MetroStars. Tonight it was a goal in the 79th minute by D.C. United's Marco Etcheverry that sent the MetroStars to defeat, 2-1, before 16,729 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. The MetroStars (14-12, 38 points) have yielded more than half the 48 goals scored against them in the last 30 minutes of their games. For United (21-5, 51 points), the victory was their eighth in a row in Major League Soccer as the club nears its third straight Eastern Conference title and a possible third M.L.S. championship. ''We just became too individualistic in the second half,'' MetroStars Coach Alfonso Mondelo said. ''I don't know what it is. Maybe fitness is a problem, even at this point in the season. It's just been happening too much.'' The match was the first M.L.S. game in 15 days for D.C. United, which had played three international matches in the Concacaf Champions Cup, winning the title last week over Toluca of Mexico. United has not lost a game at home since June 25. The winning play started deep in the MetroStars' offensive zone when United quickly restarted play after a foul by the MetroStars. United defender Jeff Agoos hit a long, low pass to the streaking Etcheverry, who carried the ball for about 20 yards before unleashing a left-footed blast from 30 yards out that beat Tony Meola to the far post. It was the ninth goal of the season for Etcheverry, United's playmaking Bolivian midfielder, and merely capped an all-out offensive assault in the second half by United that saw Roy Lassiter miss several good scoring chances. The MetroStars took a 1-0 lead in the game's 41st minute on a goal that went completely against the flow of play. On the scoring play, the team's Chilean international, Marcelo Vega, did some neat work in the right corner, cutting the ball around Agoos once, twice, three times before hitting a cross. United goalkeeper Scott Garlick lunged to get a toe on the ball, but pushed it directly into the path of the MetroStars' Diego Sonora, who tapped it in from 5 yards out. It was only the MetroStars' third shot on goal of the half and only Sonora's third goal of the season. He got the MetroStars' lone goal in their 5-1 loss at San Jose last weekend. D.C. United had dominated until that point, controlling the midfield and putting pressure on the MetroStars' defense. United's nippy little right wing, the American Ben Olsen, gave MetroStars defender Mike Petke all he could handle on the right flank. In the 30th minute, Olsen took a nice lead pass from United's Etcheverry, went around Petke and struck a pass that Lassiter, the league's second-leading scorer with 16 goals, hit first-time but directly into the arms of Meola. United broke through with the tying goal in the 59th minute, thanks to a mixup in the MetroStars' defense. Arley Palacios and Kerry Zavagnin could not get their signals straight on an attempted clearing pass. Sensing the indecision, United's Jaime Moreno swooped in and deflected Zavagnin's desperation clearance past Meola. CORNER KICKS The MetroStars played without their leading scorer, EDUARDO HURTADO, who had to sit out the game after accumulating too many yellow caution cards. Hurtado leads the MetroStars with 10 goals and is the league leader with 15 assists. Defender MIKE DUHANEY was also suspended from the game. . . . The MetroStars have scored only 11 of their 50 goals away from Giants Stadium.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 175-> PULSE; Sneakers As Art
In the window of DDC Lab, a recently opened boutique at 180 Orchard Street, sneakers hang like museum pieces. Understandable, since the treads on display are limited editions that can cost as much as a work of art. Safe behind locked glass are Reebok Insta-Pump collectibles: the $180 Bjorks (named after the Icelandic techno star); the $300 Jackie Chans, which have the Kung Fu master's signature on the tongue and heel, and last but not least, the Hong Kong Furies, for $2,500. These inflatable sneakers command an exorbitant price because only 1,997 pairs were made, commemorating Hong Kong's reversion to China last year, said Steve Gardner, a spokesman for Reebok, which has a factory in China. Made in yellow, black and red -- the colors of China's flag -- the high-tech souvenirs come with Chinese characters that read ''Hong Kong '97,'' a gold-plated serial number and a hand-held pump. Who's buying? A stylist, Sharon Stone, for one. But she didn't buy hers for their historical value. ''If they cost this much, you can be sure that not everyone walking down Broadway will have on the same pair,'' she said. JULIA CHAPLIN

Aug. 23, 1998-> 177-> Reduce Surplus In Fishing Fleet, Wildlife Group Recommends
The number of fishing boats chasing a diminishing fish population worldwide is far greater than originally estimated, and the fleet should be slashed by two-thirds, according to a report this week by the World Wildlife Fund. The report suggests that fishing boats worldwide can catch 155 percent more fish than can be replaced through normal reproduction. That is a big increase from the latest United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization study, which estimates overcapacity at only 30 percent. Too many boats and too few fish could eventually devastate the industry, the World Wildlife Fund study said. ''The prospect of a crash is possible unless there is a drastic attempt to reduce the worldwide fleet,'' said Gareth Porter, the study's author. ''Without really radical surgery, the situation gets worse and worse.'' Every fishing region faces over capacity, including the United States, the European Economic Union and China, Mr. Porter said this week. Mr. Porter's report comes before an October United Nations meeting of fishing nations, in Rome, where environmentalists hope to propose solutions to overfishing. ''We're seeing an increasing recognition that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with,'' said Scott Burns, director of marine conservation for the World Wildlife Fund. ''As it is now, fishermen have to fish harder and spend more money catching less fish.'' One solution may be to issue each fishing company tradable rights to a percentage of the catch. The rights could be leased or sold. ''If no one has the right to harvest any portion of a stock,'' Mr. Porter said, ''every fisherman must strive to capture as much of the catch as possible because it is assumed that any fish in the water will be taken by someone else.'' Mr. Porter added that the setup has worked well in New Zealand, Australia and Iceland. One problem with the proposal is deciding how to fairly and evenly divide the fishing rights. Mr. Porter also called for an end to government subsidies to the fishing industry, which he estimates at $11 billion to $21 billion annually worldwide. Subsidies can range from boat building grants to a minimum price for fish. They make fishing more attractive to newcomers and prop up ailing companies suffering from a lack of fish, Mr. Porter said. Other solutions governments may consider are buying and scrapping fishing boats and training workers for new jobs. Overfishing has long been recognized as a problem, with species like haddock and cod fished until they have almost disappeared. Now, as fish supplies shrink and demand rises, fishermen can maintain their incomes despite catching fewer fish. But overfishing can lead to permanent changes in the ecosystem, Mr. Porter said. ''The high-value fish disappear, and they're replaced by lower-value fish,'' Mr. Porter said. ''What they call 'trash' fish have become a much larger portion of the total catch.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 178-> Questions Regarding White Plains Schools
Upon reading [In Brief, Aug. 9] that the United States Departments of Education and Justice have issued a report citing the White Plains after-school program as a national model, I have some questions to ask. How can the people in Washington evaluate or give credit to a program that I understand will not officially go into effect until next month? Are they aware when giving grants and funds to White Plains that we are not an inner city but a diverse small city that already spends almost $100 million for a school population of 6,000, more or less? And the results to date are that two-thirds of our high school students partake of drugs or alcohol, and The New York Times and Newsweek have ranked our middle schools and high school among the worst in Westchester County? And with this ranking, the Department of Education in Washington proclaims our schools ''Schools of Excellence.'' Who will benefit from this program? Not the minorities and disadvantaged who are segregated to their own Slater Center, have to pay for the after-school activities funded by the P.T.A. in the lower schools and are given an arcade in their neighborhood, as an adequate leisure time activity. How will this new program be paid for? Will it be Federal taxes or state taxes or local taxes? Will it be a never-ending drain on the taxpayer as, for example, the ''Humanities Magnet School'' at Highlands that destroyed that much needed community resource ''The Technology Center?'' Or will it be similar to the oxymoronic ''Controlled Parents' Choice'' program that requires a $4 million budget for busing and was instituted to pacify parents and real estate agents when they noticed a few extra minority or disadvantaged children in their neighborhood primary schools?

Aug. 23, 1998-> 179-> Problems at Graham-Field Cloud Future
BY almost any measure, this has been a stomach-wrenching year for Graham-Field Health Products, the hugely diverse medical supply company. Since 1990, Graham-Field has tried to turn itself into a low-cost, one-stop shopping source for hospitals, physicians, home health-care dealers, and nursing homes by offering an immense arsenal of products, everything from cold packs and medical gloves to stethoscopes and wheelchairs. Last year the company went on a heady acquisition spree, swallowing six medical supply and distribution companies. But all those acquisitions also helped saddle Graham-Field, which got its start as a regional distributor, with $120 million in overhead costs, more than quadruple the amount two years ago. This year, those costs have hit home. After repeatedly assuring shareholders that it was on track with profits, Graham-Field in March reported an unexpectedly large net loss of $22.9 million for 1997, as well as a pretax loss of $43.9 million for that year's fourth quarter. That, however, turned out to be just the beginning of the company's bad news. Soon after the company announced its financial results, Graham-Field discovered that it was the subject of at least six class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of shareholders who claimed they had been misled about the company's business prospects. Then the company discovered it was part of an investigation by the United States Customs Bureau and the Food and Drug Administration into the possible unauthorized diversion of medical products shipped overseas back to the United States. Lately, Graham-Field's management has come under scrutiny as well. Its president, Andrew A. Giordano, a former Navy supply and logistics experts, left abruptly in June. At the end of July, the company announced that its longtime chairman and chief executive, Irwin Selinger, would also be leaving. The new chairman and chief executive is Rodney F. Price, a former consultant to Brierley Investments, which is Graham-Field's largest shareholder. But Mr. Price's arrival has not lifted the company's stock, which has sunk about 74 percent since its March high of $19.625 a share. And the company's most recent financial results, which were reported on Aug. 13, have done nothing to quell the worries. They showed that Graham-Field, before income taxes, lost $2.8 million during the quarter ending in June, compared to a before-tax profit of $4.4 million for the same period last year. Mr. Price did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Meanwhile, analysts said that Graham-Field's troubles are so deep that it may soon be put on the block. The medical supply industry -- because of pressures like the growth of managed care -- is consolidating rapidly in an effort to cut costs. Analysts also said that Brierley, which owns about 24 percent of Graham-Field's voting stock, may want out. ''Brierley is having serious difficulties because of the Asian problems,'' said Robin R. Young, an analyst at Stephens Inc. of Little Rock, Ark., said. ''I think it's going to try to get out of their North American investments.'' If Brierley does, then it will leave behind a company that, by some accounts, has not only seen its costs spiral out of control, but also lags the industry in many respects. ''Innovation isn't key to Graham-Field's business,'' which is based largely on standard low-cost products like stethescopes and bandages, said Alison Cherney, a home-care industry consultant in Brentwoood, Tenn. ''And Graham-Field is really only mid-range when it comes to customer service.'' As for market awareness among its customers, she does not think the company's name ranks that high, either. But even with its premium-price products, Graham-Field may be having a tough time keeping up. Take the company's Everest & Jennings wheelchair business. ''Everest & Jennings is the slowest company to change in this business,'' said Bill Anderson, the owner of Wheelchair Workshop, a retailer in Long Island City. Mr. Anderson likes Graham-Field's wheelchairs for their durability. But he thinks that companies like Pride Health Care offer chairs that are more versatile and better values. Paradoxically, Graham-Field's efforts to clean up its balance sheet may be causing it to lose customers. Take Mitchell Spaiser, who owns White Plains Surgical Supply, a medical supply store. Mr. Spaiser said Graham-Field used to be fairly lenient, giving him three or four months to pay his bills. But during the past year, he said, the company has been demanding that he pay in 30 days or less, something he finds increasingly difficult to do because of spending limits on medical supplies that have been imposed by managed-care companies. ''Money isn't flowing like it used to in this business,'' he said. One of Graham-Field's problems may be its dual identity. ''It's both a manufacturer and a distributor, which means that it's a distributor to some of the people for whom it also a manufacturer,'' said Tom Kuczenski, a health-care consultant to Find SVP Inc., a Manhattan market research firm. Ms. Cherney, however, thinks that Graham-Field's problems are, in some ways, typical of the health-care industry. ''Typically, health-care companies are good acquirers, but not necessarily good integrators,'' she said. Lately, Graham-Field has had a few bright spots. Its recent acquisition of Fuqua Enterprises not only upped the company's arsenal of products to about 45,000, but also made it one of the larger players in the rapidly growing home health-care field. Home health-care products still account for only a small percentage of Graham-Field's products. Ms. Cherney, however, estimates that such sales in the industry are growing 10 to 15 percent a year, while sales of medical products to hospitals are flat. With its acquisitions, Graham-Field is trying to become a major player in the home health-care industry. Meanwhile, its presence within the industry is being helped significantly by its innovative GF Express business, which it launched in 1996. The service, which operates from six locations in the United States and Puerto Rico, offers same-day or next-day service of a limited number of medical supplies to home health-care dealers. That's a quicker turn-around than the normal three or four days. According to Mr. Young, while Graham-Field is growing its core revenues about 4 to 5 percent a year, GF Express is growing about 20 percent. He expects the service to pull in revenues of $88 million this year -- a canyon-sized jump from the $14 million it brought home in 1996. Analysts see another hopeful sign. Graham-Field earlier this year named Paul Bellamy its chief financial officer andthen, in July, as interim president and chief operating officer. Before he came to Graham-Field, Mr. Bellamy, a tough-talking New Zealander, gained a reputation for successfully finding merger partners for companies. ''Bellamy is in charge now -- this is his shtick,'' Mr. Young said. Still, why would anyone want a company that has been hobbled by as many problems as Graham-Field? Mr. Young does not think the idea is so far-fetched. In an industry that is consolidating as rapidly as the medical supplies business is, he thinks that Graham-Field's stock, even in its presently damaged state, might be worth $9 or $11 a share. ''There are probably more buyers in this industry now than there are sellers,'' he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Young suspects that Graham-Field's overhead expenses have become so inflated that another medical supplier might be able to pare them by $50 million. ''Those are the kinds of efficiencies that are available here,'' he said.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 181-> Abroad at Home; And Cauldron Bubble
Should Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg and Kenneth Starr decide who is to be President of the United States? When you analyze the principal argument made for the impeachment of President Clinton, you are brought inevitably to that question. Perjury was the House Republican mantra, the argument pressed by the hard right to bring moderates to heel. In the debate, one Republican after another said he or she had to vote to impeach Bill Clinton because he lied under oath. But that proposition overlooks what the trio did. The President tried to keep his sexual improprieties secret. That was neither surprising nor ignoble. Henry Hyde and Robert Livingston did the same, and so men have done since the Creation. But Monica Lewinsky told Mrs. Tripp, a former White House employee who had been trying for years to harm President Clinton. At the urging of Ms. Goldberg, a right-wing literary agent, Mrs. Tripp taped her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. She told Paula Jones's lawyers and Mr. Starr about the tapes. The resulting trap was sprung on the President at his deposition in the Jones case. That was the fount of his troubles. So it is vital to understand how his testimony has effectively been judged. Mr. Clinton denied, famously, having had ''sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. The definition of that was so obscure that no jury was likely to convict him of perjury in his denial. And the House of Representatives evidently took the same view. It rejected the article of impeachment charging him with perjury in the deposition. Mr. Starr had another string for his bow. He called the President before a grand jury, where he was asked about his statements in the Jones deposition. Then Mr. Starr charged that Mr. Clinton's answers were false. Again, I doubt that a jury would have convicted Mr. Clinton of perjury. Millions of Americans saw the videotape of his grand jury appearance and most sympathized with him -- indeed, were outraged at what he had been put through. But House Republicans said that the President's answers to the Starr prosecutors were perjurious. That is, answers that the House found were not perjurious at the original proceeding became high crimes when the same answers were given again. No other American would have had to undergo that second turn of the screw. Targets of prosecutors customarily invoke the Fifth Amendment; Justice Department rules discourage calling them before grand juries. But Mr. Starr, determined to get something on him after four years of fruitless investigation, guessed correctly that for political reasons the President would not refuse to testify. In truth, many House Republicans who cited perjury as their ground for impeachment had deeper reasons. They do not like this President. An unmistakable venom ran through the whole process. An astute foreign eye saw it clearly. Philip Stevens of The Financial Times wrote: ''This was not about the sacred Constitution of the United States. It wasn't even honest politics. The impeachment of Bill Clinton was personal. It was an act of vengeance.'' Conservatives have hated Bill Clinton since the day he took office. Some conservative commentators, broadcast and print, seem obsessed by the man. Robert Livingston, before he gave up the Speaker's job, showed his distorting animus when he said: ''Richard Nixon's crime was covering up a crime he did not commit. Clinton is covering up a crime he did commit.'' There are reasons for politicians, Democratic and Republican, to distrust Bill Clinton. He has not played straight with many of them. And the public has reason to have been offended at his false assurance that he had not had sexual relations with that woman. But those are not grounds for impeachment, or resignation, unless we are going to make the impeachment process a vote of no confidence and move toward a parliamentary system of government. In the end, I do not believe that the Senate or the public will want to reward hatred. I do not believe they will want our political fate to be decided by Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg and Kenneth Starr.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 182-> TELEVISION; Britain's Diana-Mania, Anniversary Edition
WITH Britain bracing itself for a barrage of Princess-Diana-related television programming in the next few weeks, it is not surprising that ''The Princess's People,'' one of the shows on offer, has generated a bit of unflattering advance publicity. Maybe because it shows, among other things, Londoners swearing at the television set during the broadcast of the Princess of Wales's funeral last year. Or, to quote The Sunday Mirror, a tabloid newspaper that prides itself on its always tasteful (if somewhat relentless) coverage of Diana in the post-Diana era: ''This filth on TV insults the memory of Diana. So why are the BBC screening it?'' Iconoclastic as ''The Princess's People'' may be (it makes the apparently subversive point that some people in Britain were not particularly upset about Diana's death), it is one of a vast sea of specials planned as the first anniversary of her death approaches and Diana-mania heats up in a way never seen before -- or, at least, not seen since her actual death last Aug. 31. Though Diana rarely seems far from people's minds, and though she has been a ghoulishly constant presence in the newspapers and on television, Britain's five noncable television stations are taking this opportunity to beat back to life every possible angle on every conceivable aspect of her life and death. The shows range from the frankly spiritual (the BBC is broadcasting a special edition of ''Songs of Praise,'' a religious program that appears ever Sunday) to the faintly ridiculous (Channel 5, the nation's youngest and scrappiest noncable station, is presenting a Diana quiz show). In between are a vast army of documentaries, docudramas and other specials focusing on particular aspects of the Diana story. These, of course, will join the vast industy of Diana books, Diana editions of magazines and Diana sections of newspapers that make up Britain's Diana media juggernaut. ''We have two sets of programs running during the anniversary period,'' said John Diamond, a columnist for The Times of London and a television critic. ''The first commemorating the anniversary of the death of a much-loved princess and the second asking why in the world we're broadcasting the first.'' If a prize were awarded for sheer volume of Diana programming, Channel 5 would win. Still struggling to find its audience and to establish itself as a real competitive presence, Channel 5 devoted an entire evening to Diana-related shows last Sunday, using a creative mix of genres in order, according to a publicity release, ''to reflect her true popularity and examine the influence she had on her public.'' ''We wanted to be ahead of everybody,'' said Greg Day, a publicity executive at Channel 5. ''The problem is that since we're still a small, growing station, we knew that if we tried to get our programming out during the weekend that she died, we'd be dwarfed and dominated by the other stations. We wanted to get in there first, for commercial reasons.'' Channel 5 has given a great deal of thought to its programming mix, Mr. Day said, based on its research into the responses to Diana's death. ''Our programming stretches across different genres,'' he said. ''The idea is to show her impact on every single area of TV. There is something about Diana that pervades every single genre.'' Hence, Channel 5's quiz show ''100 Percent Diana,'' the idea of which has left some people ''shocked and disgusted,'' he said, but which grew out of the network's interviews with children and teen-agers. ''The kids said it would be a bit like a history lesson; she's dead, but it would be interesting to know how much we actually know about her,'' Mr. Day explained. ''100 Percent Diana'' is to feature 3 contestants and 100 Diana-trivia questions, along the lines of ''When she was 11, she had a pet guinea pig. What was its name?'' (Answer: Peanuts.) Other questions will focus on Diana's clothes, Diana's public utterances and Diana's private life. The winner gets $160, to be donated to charity. The network will also show ''I Dream of Diana,'' a one-hour documentary in which, according to the network's press release, ''a group of people talk about the dreams they've had of Diana since her death, and how those dreams affect their lives.'' Another show, ''After Diana,'' is a documentary look at the royal family's woeful post-Diana image problems and how it has sought the help of the British Government in boosting its appeal. And ''The Diana Years'' is a three-hour documentary, to be shown three Sundays in a row, that seeks to give an MTV-style ''rock-and-roll view of Diana's life from Shy Di to the world's No. 1 icon,'' Mr. Smith said. Using a quick-cutting camera style and a racy soundtrack, ''The Diana Years'' uses interviews with Bob Geldof, Jeffrey Archer and others to position Diana ''at the center of everything else that was happening at the time, and what her impact was on theater, music, film and the media generally,'' Mr. Smith said. Finally, the network plans to broadcast ''The People's Princess,'' a two-hour dramatization of the wrenching final week of Diana's life, with actors playing her, Dodi al-Fayed, who died with her in the Paris car crash, and a raft of peripheral figures. The show initially appeared on cable television last year. ''It's designed to appeal to an audience who sees it as a way to honor the memory of her,'' Mr. Day said. ''It's a very sympathetic view of her last week. It's extremely mainstream and very soft-focus.'' ''It's Hello magazine on television,'' he added, referring to Britain's popular weekly celebrity magazine. Channel 5 seems to be the only network to broadcast (or at least to admit to broadcasting) a fictionalized account of Diana's death. Most of the other stations are sticking strictly to fact-based programming, competing to find angles that set them apart from the pack. There's the tentatively titled ''Unseen Diana'' on ITV, which uses, according to the network, ''never-before-seen video footage of the People's Princess,'' compiled from members of the public who met her and provided ITV with home videos of her showing up at their houses, schools and hospital beds. There's another documentary, currently called ''Diana's Children,'' also on ITV, which ''looks at the children whose lives were touched by the Princess'' -- children she took care of before her marriage, children she met during her charity work and others -- and explores the ''profound effect her tragic death had on them.'' ''Diana's life has been quite well trawled,'' said Steve Anderson, controller for news and current affairs of ITV. ''But we're heading into a period which will be quite poignant and quite sad, and as a way to mark her life a year after her death, the two shows we're airing focus on her relationships with people.'' ITV's experience several months ago, when it broadcast a much-criticized documentary investigation into the car crash that killed Diana, proved how insatiable the public appetite was, Mr. Anderson said. The program drew an audience of almost 15 million people, about 53 percent of the audience share. ''If the program is right and it feels right and you pitch it right and it doesn't seem too exploitative -- '' he said. Meanwhile, Channel 4 is broadcasting a documentary about Diana's role in the international campaign to ban land mines, one of her favorite causes. And ''Diana: The Mourning After,'' written and narrated by the journalist Christopher Hitchens, also on Channel 4, is an effort to find some method in the madness surrounding the media coverage of and reaction to Diana's death. ''The film looks in a fairly studied way at Diana and the impact of her death and the way the media reported it,'' said Paul Smith, a press officer at Channel 4, which is broadcasting the program. ''He's taking a step back from what was being reported at the time, which represented such a monolithic view of Britain.'' Mr. Smith added that he didn't believe that the British public was likely to suffer from Diana overload. ''Everyone's doing their bit to mark the anniversary, and this is what we're doing,'' he said. ''We're not directly competing with the other programs. People who want to watch them will, and people who don't won't.'' Of all the shows, ''The Princess's People'' has come in for the most advance publicity and the most advance criticism. The 75-minute film, which gauges the reactions of ordinary people around Britain on the day of Diana's funeral last year, is to be shown on Sept. 6, the anniversary of the funeral, on BBC2. The film, said Colin Luke, its director, is most definitely not about Diana herself. ''Personally, I'm not interested in saying anything about Diana,'' he said. ''I'm bored stiff with seeing stuff about her on film, and the last thing I would want is to make a film about Diana. I'm interested in ordinary people, not stars and icons.'' To that end, the film is the result of film shot at various spots in London and around Britain during Diana's funeral. These include a hairdresser's salon, a pub, the scene of a countryside wedding and a newspaper store, as well as the streets of London, filled with the sad, the indifferent and the curious. As several newspapers that have seen advance copies of the program have pointed out, some of the people caught on camera have been less then reverential about Diana and her funeral. One person, for instance, mocks the so-called floral tributes left for her, and another wanders through the crowds in search of celebrities. ''It gives the lie to the notion that British people were united in their grief,'' Mr. Luke said. ''But we tried to paint a fair portrait. A lot of people were affected, and cried, and put flowers out, but some people didn't.'' ''PEOPLE should draw their own conclusions,'' he added. ''One conclusion is that human beings are wonderfully rich and complex and varied, and all of us behave differently and have different emotions. That is contrary to what our media and the world media was saying about us, that we had all been overcome by some collective emotion.'' Is this the beginning of the end? When this is all over, will Britain be able to get on with its life? ''Right now, the interest in Diana and the payback for television companies is too great,'' said Mr. Day of Channel 5. ''But perhaps we'll see a lessening of interest as time goes on. I certainly hope so.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 184-> Q&A/Thea R. DuBow; An Appeal to End Domestic Violence
ONE night back in December 1982, Thea R. DuBow, then a Yonkers resident, awoke to find her husband of almost 10 years near death from a gunshot wound to his head and the gun lying nearby. Eighteen months later, after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the case, for a crime she says she still has no recollection of having committed, she entered Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, where she served three and a half years. Ms. DuBow, who has a master's degree in early childhood education and is now a resident of Eastchester, tells a story of years as a battered wife. On the fateful evening, she and her husband got into a fight, he made her swallow some drugs that to this day she says she cannot identify, at some point she passed out and awoke to find her husband suffering what were to be fatal wounds. Today, Ms. DuBow, in her mid 40's, is the assistant executive director of My Sister's Place, an agency that runs one shelter for battered women and their children in Westchester and will soon open a second. October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and as part of that the Jewish Women International's Rita Salberg Chapter of Northern Westchester will sponsor a forum on the topic at the Chappaqua Library. Ms. DuBow, Carla Horton, executive director of the Northern Westchester Shelter for Women, and representatives of the Westchester District Attorney's office will be among the speakers for the free event. Further information may be obtained by calling Jayne Kaplowitz at 232-6068. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. DuBow: Q. How did you come to be a battered wife and a killer? A. I met my potential husband at a mutual friend's house in about February of 1973 and we got married May 27. My marrying him wasn't even my own choice. I say that because I wanted to live with him, but being this was the beginning of the 70's my parents didn't want me living with him. So I married him. I was 21. Q. Did the abuse begin immediately? A. Before he physically abused me he -- I realize this now -- he laid some groundwork. He was able to isolate me from my family and from my friends. There were many control issues going on. And then I stopped driving. What happened is when we got married we both had a car, but one of the cars ceased to work. When my license was up, I just didn't renew it because by that point he was driving me around everywhere. And in Westchester, as you know, you need a car. After I stopped driving, I could only go where he would drive me. So my world got smaller and smaller as time went on. I was a substitute teacher at the time, and he would take me to work, meet for lunch and pick me up. Isn't he attentive? Isn't he considerate? But how controlling. What better way to monitor my every move and not let me do anything without his knowledge? Q. Did you argue in those early days about these issues? A. No. I was naive. I was 21. I wasn't worldly, and I was trusting. And the first time he slapped me he alleged that I was having a sexual liaison. He alleged I was having a sexual liaison with one of my friends -- a female friend, yet. Q. And you were not? A. I was not, and I was angry and said, I don't have to take this, I'm leaving -- you know that whole spiel. And he slapped me across the face hard. He was 180 pounds and 6 foot 2. It was hard. I'm a small person. I threatened to leave him, but he was so sorry, so apologetic and the thought, he told me, of me being with someone else made him lose control. And I fell for it. I thought -- the way I think women are raised in our society -- that anybody is allowed to make a mistake and should be forgiven. This was, he said, a mistake, and he lost control out of love for me. Love in quotes, I guess. So I let it go. I didn't even in my nine and a half years of marriage ever string all of these things together and put a name to what was going on, to see the ongoing pattern. In fact, I didn't name my own experience until after I was in prison for his death. Q. When he struck you, what was it? A slap, a punch, more? A. All of those things. Hitting, punching, slapping, kicking. Q. We hear of battered wife syndrome where the wife thinks it is all her fault. Did you feel it was your fault? A. Yes. He always had a reason why he did it. It wasn't because of anything that he did, it was because I had a big mouth, I was sarcastic, I was manipulative. Q. Did you ever go to the authorities? A. Yes. I called the Yonkers police once after he threw me out of our apartment. He wouldn't let me back in. I went to a neighbor's house and called the police and the police arrived and had one question: whose name was on the lease? When I told them my husband, they said they were very sorry about my situation but there was nothing they could do to help. So I never called the police again. Eventually, he opened the door. And I moved back in. Q. Did you share your experiences with family at this point? A. No. I think maybe they suspected, but nobody talked about it. When he broke my arm I lied to the emergency room staff, I lied to my parents. I said I slipped on some water. Then, of course, he was so sorry. Then there was another time where I had taken some prescribed barbiturates. I woke up with a hangover, and he bound and gagged me and told me he was going to have me committed. He called a psychiatrist from a local agency who he talked into committing me. Then he convinced the psychiatrist not to commit me, and the doctor prescribed heavy dozes of Thorazine. So now I was taking barbiturates and Thorazine, so I was kind of out it. I saw the psychiatrist for about six months. Q. Did you tell him what was going on? A. No. He frightened me. Here was a man who had been willing to commit me. I wasn't going to share anything with him. Then my older sister, Jane, called him and told him that I was over medicating. Then I thought I was in big trouble if my sister is giving the psychiatrist advice on how to medicate me. So I stopped seeing him. There was another time when my husband beat me up that I did call Jane -- but I made her swear not to tell anybody. He had beaten me up, and I had bruises. We wanted a doctor to put in a medical report that my husband had beaten me up. So I made up a story that I was going to a diner with her, but we really went to the hospital. But the doctor wouldn't say that my husband did this. Yes, he said, I had bruises, but he hadn't witnessed who had done it. So I realized the hospital wasn't an ally. Q. Then what happened? A. Finally, one night in December of 1982 my husband and I had a large argument -- the usual, I had a big mouth, I was insulting -- he took a handful of pills and he told me either I take the pills in his hands or he was going to hit me. So I took the pills. These are things that to this day I don't know what they were. I swallowed them. The next thing he was dead. Q. You have no recollection? A. None at all. Q. Are you positive you did it? A. I take responsibility for it. I feel I must have. There wasn't anyone else there when I woke up, and he was dead of gunshot wounds to the head. Q. Whose gun? A. He happened to have a gun, but he didn't own it. What happened was he had given a friend of his money, and the friend gave him the gun as collateral. So after I saw him there, I called the police and they came and rushed him to the hospital and he died two hours later without gaining consciousness. It wasn't until the following March that I was arrested for his death. Q. Did you plead guilty? A. I pleaded guilty to manslaughter first degree the following June of '84. The reason I decided to take a plea -- although my attorney thought we had a very good case -- was that if I lost the trial I would face a prison term of a minimum 15 to 25 years to life. Eventually, I was offered a sentence of 4 to 12 years if I pleaded. I thought about it, and I spoke to people who told me if you go to trial they punish you for losing, for making you take them to trial. Eventually, 6 months was taken off the sentence. Q. Do you think public policy and attitudes have changed about domestic violence since 1982? A. I think things are changing, but they are changing very, very slowly. The laws are changing, but I don't think they've been enforced up to this point. I think the real change that I see is that many more women are coming forth, saying they are battered. Q. Are there signs a woman should be aware of, before there may be any physical violence? A. Yes. An over-bearingness. A desire to have you all to himself. Asking you to leave things like hobbies and friends. Making him the center and most important thing in your life so that you disregard all your other interests. Q. What do you tell the people you encounter at My Sister's Place? A. I tell them no one has the right to hit you, to manipulate, control or insult you no matter what you've done. I'm not going to say that all battered women are little angels. But there is no reason ever to be hit. If your partner doesn't like you they can leave. That's the message I try to get through to women. To society my message is a little different. I say to men that they have to hold their brethren accountable for abusiveness. Men have to make battering socially unacceptable. One woman can't stop one man, and women as a class can't stop men as a group. Men need to step in.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 185-> Yes, in Our Back Yards
To the Editor: Re ''Council Votes to Override Giuliani's Veto of Shelter Bill'' (news article, Dec. 18): Living near homeless shelters does not have to be a punishment, as one might assume from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's threats to open new ones in the districts of New York City Council members if they enacted a law to regulate them. Now that the Council has called the Mayor's bluff and has overridden his veto of the bill, the Council should use its authority to show that with sufficient oversight and community input, new shelters do not have to be eyesores or lightning rods. Erecting safe, usable space with adequate social services need not double as fodder for the ''Nimby'' rats. Upscale and middle-class neighborhoods in Philadelphia support several shelters, which, when managed well, as these are, do what they are supposed to do -- provide a temporary home, psychological support and self-sufficiency training for homeless individuals and families. To threaten New York City Council members with the creation of such dwellings is absurd. The tired and poor must live somewhere. Why not in your district -- and yours and yours?

Aug. 23, 1998-> 186-> SOAPBOX; A Rough Ride for Hispanic Pride
FEELING a hankering for mama's home cooking, I went to the bodega for some artery-clogging food. You know, fried pork rinds, blood sausage, and plantains for a garlic- and grease-laden mofongo. But my appetite for nostalgia ambushed me in, of all places, an Hispanic deli in Montauk. It started when I spotted the flier announcing that Suffolk County is striking up a brass-band centennial celebration for Camp Wikoff. That's where Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders spent a month near Montauk's Deep Hallow Ranch to recover from malaria, dysentery and yellow fever after their campaign in Cuba. I had already missed the Teddy impersonator, but could still catch the Rough Rider Dinner Theater. Then I read the part in the flier about the historic re-enactments. Hold it, I thought. We're talking the Spanish-American War here. They're re-creating the war that made my mother's native Puerto Rico a United States colony. So as I walked into the bodega and the smell of the empanadas hit me, I thought, hey, I should be vilifying this centennial, not celebrating it. I nearly squashed a mango while fantasizing about mobilizing the others in the bodega to stage counter-re-enactments. Then I started listening not to my heart, but to my head. Having researched my family's past, I knew that my emotional response to Puerto Rican history was built on a desire for self-affirmation instead of historic fact. For example, to prop up my ethnic pride, I needed to paint Puerto Ricans as resisting the Yankee invasion mightily. Wrong. In fact, a lot of Puerto Ricans actually welcomed the volunteer regiments from Wisconsin and Illinois, shouting, ''Vivan los americanos!'' How could this be? my nationalist self had asked. Were my forefathers cowards, collaborationists, imperialist lackeys? ''Los espanoles.'' The anger that cut the dance in the eyes of my 98-year-old great-aunt Mercedes gave me a clue. ''The Spanish tied men to horse tails to drag them through the plaza.'' Our town square? Where I sat as a kid, under the shade of clipped ficus trees to eat my tamarind ice cones? Could Mother Spain have done this to us? Yes, and worse. In 1887, the dreaded Spanish Civil Guard not only drew men across the cobblestone plaza of my ancestral hometown, Juana Diaz, they jammed slivers under fingernails and twisted thumbscrews. They tortured the townspeople to quash a boycott by native-born Puerto Ricans protesting the favoritism shown by the authorities to Iberian-born merchants. I felt shame for accusing my ancestors of cowardice, and stupid for letting my need for an Hispanic identity blur my interpretation of history so much that I forgot that Puerto Rico had, of course, been struggling against Spain for its autonomy. I began to understand why, when the Yankees landed on Puerto Rico 11 years later, Juana Diaz, like other towns, surrendered willingly to the Americans. Only Juana Diaz had the distinction of mistakenly surrendering itself to a man with a pen, not a sword. Stephen Crane, the irrepressible author of ''The Red Badge of Courage,'' who was covering the Puerto Rican campaign for William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, took the town as a journalistic joke. At first, I snickered along with Crane. But my giggles turned into resentful gasps. Crane was mocking my people. He divided good citizens from bad according to their dress, and his whims. Didn't Crane understand that the group toasting him in the Plaza wasn't a passive horde? It was made up of individuals who read newspapers, discussed politics at the barbershop and had their own motives -- some as cynical as his -- for greeting him. That was when I realized the depth of my error. I had been as guilty as Crane of reducing complex people to cardboard. Crane did it to strangers to bolster a good story. I did it to my family to bolster my identity. And so, as I paid for my pork rinds and plantains, I felt humbled by the reminder that history isn't a self-help crutch. With that lesson in mind, I decided it's O.K. to enjoy the Rough Rider Dinner Theater. I'll just tap a salsa beat when the banjo starts plucking.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 187-> PRO FOOTBALL; Giants, Minus Sehorn, Begin to Regroup
After a day off, the Giants returned today for their first practice since breaking training camp on Wednesday, their first since a 27-23 preseason loss to the Jets on Thursday, and their first without Jason Sehorn, their injured cornerback. With Sehorn out for the season after tearing his right knee while returning the opening kickoff against the Jets, Conrad Hamilton, a three-year veteran, became the starting right cornerback. Hamilton has started in only one regular-season game, and that was as a nickel back. Shaun Williams, the safety from U.C.L.A. drafted in the first round last April, will try to learn the cornerback position. But today, Williams was not even on the grass practice field next to Giants Stadium. Coach Jim Fassel said that before the Jets game, he had given Williams permission to go home after the game to handle a personal situation. Williams was expected back Sunday night. When the Giants play the Baltimore Ravens here Friday night in their final preseason game, Williams will be the nickel back. Williams, a free safety in college, already has a heavy load: free safety, strong safety, nickel back, dime back, special teams and now cornerback. Fassel was concerned how his team would take the devastating loss of Sehorn. The coach's message was simple. ''I told the team you always face adversity,'' he said, ''and at times you have to push through adversity. You don't look behind you to see what's left. You have to look forward. You don't worry about what you don't have.'' Practice, even without pads, turned out to be business as usual, to Fassel's relief. ''I thought practice was good,'' he said. ''They paid attention at meetings. I didn't expect the guys to have the same zip today as if we won the game and Jason was healthy, but in the training room, Jason said: 'Don't worry about me, Jim. I'm going to be all right.' '' Corey Widmer, the middle linebacker, said: ''Every team goes through this. It doesn't mean we can't have a good season. We're going to have to learn to deal with it and go forward. You have to be able to look through adversity. Don't let one bump in the road do in your year. There're going to be more bumps.'' Hamilton knows that. He is 23-years-old, 5 feet 10 inches and 195 pounds, soft-spoken, confident and realistic. After the Jets game (''I thought he played well,'' Fassel said), Hamilton faced his new responsibilities without blinking. ''Yeah, I'm the starter,'' he said. ''My team needs me now. I think I have the skills to start at corner. I usually play left corner, and this is right corner, but there's not really much difference. You turn your head ha different way, and it's a little different the way you read and backpedal. But it's not a big deal. Covering somebody is covering somebody.'' After today's practice, Hamilton said he understood his new situation. ''Don't compare me to Jason,'' he said. ''Jason is one of the five top cornerbacks in the league. Our styles are totally different. He's polished. Give me a chance to get a little experience, and see where I am in a couple of years. I've just got to prove it on the field. Every backup thinks he's ready for prime time. I'm going to get every opportunity to do well.'' When a starter goes down, other teams tend to pick on his replacement. Hamilton expects that. ''I can hear them say: 'They've got a new guy. Challenge him.' '' he said. ''Why not? This is football. Guys get hurt. I'm one of the backups, a quality backup. It's a challenge to me, and I love it.'' EXTRA POINTS The Giants cut 16 players. They included OMAR DOUGLAS and EDDIE GOINS, both veteran wide receivers. C. W. ESTES, a defensive end, West Point graduate and an Army artillery officer, was placed on the reserve/military list. The others were first-year players and rookies: quarterback BEN ANDERSON, offensive tackle DARRYL GILLIAM, offensive guard MARC LAMB, centers COREY BAILEY and BEN FRICKE, defensive ends HUNTER ADAMS, JIMMIE BELL and CHRIS SNYDER, defensive tackle BRAD KEENEY, linebacker MARCEL WILLIS, cornerback RAPHAOL BALL, safety RASHEE JOHNSON and punter WILL BRICE. The roster is down to 64 players. All National Football League teams must reduce to 60 by 4 P.M. Tuesday. Two of the Giants' four remaining cuts will be easy because cornerback JASON SEHORN and outside linebacker COREY MILLER, who has a herniated disk in his neck, are headed for injured reserve.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 188-> A.M.A. Is Seeking to Stop Aetna Deal With Prudential
In its first action ever opposing a proposed health care merger, the American Medical Association is fighting Aetna Inc.'s $1 billion purchase of the health care business of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Calling the deal anticompetitive and a threat to consumers' ability to choose a health care plan, the association is asking the Justice Department to challenge it. ''The market power that would be created or exacerbated by this merger would limit the choices of patients and employers, reduce competition and further erode the ability of physicians to make medical decisions based on science and the medical needs of their patients, not share price,'' Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., the association's executive vice president, said in a letter sent on Friday to the Justice Department's antitrust division. The letter was first reported today in The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Anderson said the merger would ''create a dominant entity'' and would allow the new company to ''drive medical decisions based on financial and stockholder expectations.'' The deal, if approved, will put 9.7 million members under the Aetna umbrella, making it the nation's largest health maintenance organization. The medical association, which has had a thorny relationship with Aetna, called the letter its latest effort in a continuing campaign ''aimed at correcting and exposing managed care abuses.'' ''For the past year the A.M.A. has attempted to convince Aetna to ease harmful practices that are not in the best interests of patient care and to adopt practices that will restore trust on the part of patients and physicians,'' the association said today in a statement. An Aetna spokeswoman said that the company was disappointed at the association's opposition and that Aetna officials ''vigorously disagree'' with its contention that Aetna has engaged in managed-care abuses. ''We really don't think that the facts bear out the picture as the A.M.A. paints it,'' Joyce Oberdorf, the spokeswoman, said. The Justice Department did not immediately return calls seeking comment today.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 189-> Baghdad Frozen in Time By Years of Sanctions
At one newsstand in downtown Baghdad, a magazine on display reports that the Prince of Wales has been seen with Lady Diana Spencer and speculates that a romance might be blossoming. At another the prize offering is a maintenance manual for the 1988 Oldsmobile. Iraq is a nation frozen in time, and the recent wave of American and British bombing seems to have done nothing that would hasten a thaw. The oddest thing about the bombing campaign, at least as viewed from Baghdad, is how little it changed anything. Today life continued as if the explosions that were heard last week were nothing more than a fireworks show. Certainly there was an air of theater about the streaking antiaircraft fire that lit up the sky during the bombing raids. Most, if not all of it, came from low-caliber weapons that had no more chance of shooting down a jet fighter than a popgun would have. Its only purpose was to give Iraqis a sense that they were in some way masters of their destiny and not simply mute subjects. That sense was probably inaccurate. Iraq may still be able to defy the West, but people here cannot affect the course of President Saddam Hussein's Government. Out of necessity, if for no other reason, Iraqis seem to have accepted their fate. As they adjusted today to a new period of peace, they continued to live in a world that for nearly a decade has not progressed a bit and in fact has slowly deteriorated. Nowhere is this more visible than along the banks of the Tigris, which runs through the heart of Baghdad. For generations its landscaped banks were one of the most romantic places to stroll in the entire Middle East, lined with seafood restaurants that were packed until late at night. Now the once-magnificent parks are overgrown with weeds, and the ruins of the restaurants are home only to vermin. This afternoon, groups of unemployed men sat in chairs along the opposite sidewalk, gazing toward the river and perhaps recalling the city's lost glory. Baghdad's central bazaar resembles Cairo's or Istanbul's played in slow motion. There is a fair amount to buy, but nothing like what is available even in comparably tiny cities like Amman, Jordan, or Manama, Bahrain. The bursting commercial energy that throbs through the rest of the Middle East is absent here, as if someone had sprinkled the population with sleeping powder. Eight years after the United Nations imposed punishing economic sanctions on Iraq, people here have devised two distinct strategies for dealing with the country's steady decline. Ordinary people have simply reduced their expectations. They live on what can be produced inside the country and on rations distributed by the United Nations. The elite have found ways to maintain the good life. There are villas along leafy avenues and new Toyota sedans, which under the right circumstances might someday be traded for the latest BMW or Mercedes models. In places like the Samsung dealership downtown, televisions, computers and microwave ovens are available at bargain prices, courtesy of sanctions-busting smugglers working from Persian Gulf countries. From the Samsung showroom and the stores nearby that sell expensive items like imported marble floor tiles, the idea of rebelling against President Hussein, as the United States has been urging, seems far-fetched. He not only summarily executes everyone he suspects of plotting against him, but he also offers privileges to his elite that make loyalty pay off. In the eyes of many Iraqis, the image of the United States is reflected not by dazzling consumer goods or terrifying weapons, but rather by the decaying United States Embassy, which sits forlornly on a Baghdad street corner, guarded by three friendly young soldiers. Inside the embassy, yellowing photos of San Diego, Houston and other cities line the main stairwell. A shelf in one office holds a set of American Heritage magazines, the latest dated June 1990, just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting evacuation of American diplomats. A Polish diplomat now sits in the office that was used by the last United States Ambassador, April Glaspie. He represents American interests in Iraq, presumably no more ambiguously than Ms. Glaspie, who gave Mr. Hussein fateful signals that he apparently interpreted as a go-ahead for his invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Along streets near the embassy, shopping malls lie quiet, shut long ago when sanctions began to bite. Storefronts that once housed travel agencies are still plastered with KLM and Air France decals, but with the airlines unable to fly here, no one has opened their doors for years. At Al Rashid Hotel, one of the few hotels still functioning, pictures of Santa Claus and cherubs hang from the walls. Today an ersatz Christmas tree, fully decorated, was placed in the lobby. Everyone entering the hotel must walk across a large floor panel bearing a diabolical likeness of George Bush and the motto ''Bush Is Criminal.'' Employees said there was no plan to update it by adding President Clinton's image.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 190-> POLITICAL BRIEFING; Fordice Changes Tune On Right to Privacy
A couple of years back, Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi was seriously injured in a car wreck while traveling from Memphis to Jackson, Miss. He recovered, but questions about the crash and circumstances leading to it plagued him and were kept alive in the press and on talk shows, long after he returned to work. Area papers reported that at the time of the crash, the Governor, a Republican, was not accompanied by his usual state police escort. The reports said that a few hours before the crash, he was seen holding hands and sipping wine in a Memphis-area restaurant with a woman who was not his wife. Mrs. Fordice, the reports noted, was in France that day, representing the Governor and the state on a cultural mission. Asked if the reports were correct, Mr. Fordice said in several statements and interviews that there was nothing to say because he could remember nothing about the accident. Anyway, he insisted, his private life should not be subject to scrutiny by reporters or anybody else. On Tuesday, commenting on President Clinton's speech the night before about the Lewinsky investigation, the Governor said at a gathering of Mississippi Republicans in Jackson that one of the burdens of public office was intense scrutiny about public and private matters. ''When folks enter public office,'' he said, ''they're due all the scrutiny they get.'' In the case of the President, he went on, that scrutiny had made clear that Mr. Clinton was no longer fit to hold office. Then he added: ''The best thing for the country, I think without question, is his resignation. We now know he's a liar. Other horrors much worse are to follow and impeachment will surely follow and the United States doesn't need that.''

To the Editor: Re ''Financial Planners Fume at the Taking of a Title'' (Investing It, Aug. 2): As a retired librarian, I understand why certified financial planners are dismayed to learn that some New York City welfare workers are now being called ''financial planners,'' too. Anyone who does any sort of work with any book collection has for years been called a ''librarian,'' even though librarians should have a graduate degree in library science. Professionals in all fields should work together to restrict their titles to those who have appropriate qualifications and do the appropriate work. EDITH FRANKEL Hannawa Falls, N.Y., Aug. 8

Dec. 22, 1998-> 192-> A Star Floral Designer's Flights of Fancy
HERE are some important pronouncements from Robert Isabell, the Manhattan florist who did Caroline Kennedy's wedding, Jacqueline Onassis' funeral, last year's Versace tribute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, this year, the White House. White lights on Christmas trees have become so tiresome that he has switched to the mixed colors considered so hideously downmarket in the 1980's. Poinsettias are overdone, but they last. Carnations can actually be chic, like the burgundy ones he used at the opening of the New York Public Library's Reading Room. (''Oscar de la Renta called and asked, 'What were those beautiful flowers?' '') Sunflowers are an unfortunate trend, but marigolds, like those he used for the opening of the Jackson Pollock exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, are marvelous. Magnolia leaves on Christmas mantels have become very big in the North. But never, ever use a vanilla-scented candle at dinner, unless you're in Bali. ''In New York City,'' he said, ''it's just all wrong.'' So went a conversation last week with Mr. Isabell, which started on his daily morning prowl through the 28th Street flower district, continued in his black Cadillac en route to his 13th Street office (where his staff was making snowmen out of, yes, carnations, for a ''winter wonderland'' party), and ended up at his West Village town house, a modernist villa with an interior atrium of cascading walls of philodendron, where he apologized for not making his bed in an otherwise profoundly neat home. Then he talked about his Christmas decorations for the White House. ''It was a great honor,'' he said, ''maybe even more this year than other years. I hope we brought some happiness to the Clintons.'' Mr. Isabell worked with Nancy Clarke, the chief White House florist, who has been there since the Carter Administration. He made 18 gold-leafed conical trees for the East Room, a lot of crystallized fruit for the State Dining Room and an enormous outdoor wreath of noble fir and blue lights for the South Portico. This he considers his masterpiece. He and his staff hand-dipped 1,500 bulbs into a blue gel used for theater lighting to get just the right hue -- ''Presidential blue,'' as he calls it. ''Royal blue is not the color of the Presidency,'' he said. ''That's too dark. It has no life. And Navy blue is very blackish. This is a very intense, memorable blue. You'll always remember seeing a wreath of blue lights.'' Mr. Isabell has been the premier florist and party producer for New York society and people with enormous amounts of money for more than a decade, but this is his first foray into the White House. ''We knew about him, of course,'' said Capricia Penavic Marshall, the White House social secretary. ''And Mrs. Clinton had seen his work before, and noted it.'' In June, Mr. Isabell was invited to a White House dinner, and by September, Mrs. Clinton had her office give him a call. ''She gave me the directions, specifically,'' Ms. Marshall said. ''She said, 'I would like to bring in Robert Isabell to work with Nancy Clarke.'' Mr. Isabell made several trips south, and got along famously with the First Lady, Ms. Marshall said. ''They had a wonderful time,'' she added. ''They walked from room to room, deciding where they were going to place things.'' MR. ISABELL, who says he is in his ''late 30's,'' said he came to Manhattan from Duluth, Minn., 20 years ago, which means he arrived in his late teens. This is entirely possible, since he didn't go to college. (Although in 1995, Vanity Fair said he was 41.) In any case, Mr. Isabell is murky and sensitive about his past. His mother was a homemaker; Vanity Fair described his father as a power-plant operator. ''I don't want to talk about my father,'' Mr. Isabell said last week. ''I just don't want to even get into it.'' Mr. Isabell, who is tall, dark and handsome, with a soft Minnesota accent, did say he worked in a Duluth greenhouse from a very young age, then for the society florist Renny when he first arrived in New York. Soon he had started his own business -- and was planning events for Studio 54. In August 1989 he created the 50th-birthday party for Saul Steinberg at which two children dressed as cherubs wheeled out a five-tier cake covered in gold and silver leaf. But his biggest party to date was the three-day celebration in 1995 of the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller, the second daughter of a billionaire, and Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece. For the pre-ceremony ball, Mr. Isabell created a Greek temple at an estate outside London. ''The party went on until six in the morning,'' he said. ''I was there until 4, because I had to go start the lunch. I've never seen so many young girls wearing couture.'' Nonetheless, friends describe Mr. Isabell as shy, a little mysterious, and private. ''You run into him at these places, and there's Robert in the corner, in a little denim jacket, watching everything,'' said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright. And yet, Mr. Isabell does 300 to 400 events a year, from the 50-foot moss-covered Eiffel Tower he once built for Bendel's to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's lily-of-the-valley wedding bouquet. Why flowers? ''I don't even know,'' he said. ''It always brings joy to people. People use them at the important moments of their lives.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 193-> Praise for the Star of an Unsung Musical
LINDA EDER was tired. She looked radiant, not at all like the wistful prostitute she plays in the Broadway musical ''Jekyll & Hyde.'' Still, the toll of eight performances a week on top of the excitement of a new marriage and the move to a new house here was unmistakable. It showed in the way Ms. Eder talked about her horses and the urge to browse for antiques on a lazy summer afternoon. ''Sometimes,'' she said, ''when I lie down on the bed in Act II, I wish they would just let me go to sleep.'' Instead, her character, the prostitute Lucy, gets stabbed to death as the audience gasps. Ms. Eder, who recently married Frank Wildhorn, the composer of ''Jekyll & Hyde,'' has being playing Lucy since the show opened on Broadway 16 months ago. The show and its stars, Ms. Eder, Robert Cuccioli and Christiane Noll, have generated an enormous following, which began even before ''Jekyll & Hyde'' toured the country on its long pre-Broadway run. An album of songs from the show, with music by Mr. Wildhorn and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse -- who also wrote the book for ''Jekyll & Hyde'' -- has been so successful that audiences have arrived knowing every word. A cadre of fans known as Jekkies maintains its own Web site, and a crowd waits at the stage door after every performance. One woman is said to have seen the show 150 times. Ms. Eder has no complaints about Jekkies or the adulation generated by Mr. Cuccioli's double-threat performance as both the idealistic Dr. Jekyll and his murderous alter-ego Edward Hyde. ''Fan letters keep me going,'' she said, as she and Mr. Wildhorn sat on a flowered linen sofa in their comfortable parlor. ''Most of the time it's the audience that helps. We have never not had a standing ovation.'' While ''Jekyll & Hyde'' is Mr. Wildhorn's first Broadway venture -- it was soon followed by ''The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' playing just a few doors away -- and also marks Ms. Eder's debut as an actress, the couple, who are both in their late 30's, have been successful entertainers for many years. Mr. Wildhorn first became famous as a composer of popular songs like ''Where Do Broken Hearts Go?'' which was recorded by Whitney Houston and reached the top of the charts. Ms. Eder was a singer and recording artist who first found her niche on ''Star Search,'' the television program that not only won her $100,000 but also brought her together with Mr. Wildhorn. A friend of his heard the show and suggested that he listen to her sing. Mr. Wildhorn invited Ms. Eder to audition for ''Jekyll & Hyde,'' a show he had been working on since college, and the two began living together soon afterward. That was 10 years ago, but an air of freshness still hovers over the relationship. Like the newlyweds they are, they frequently embrace, and he, the less reserved of the two, tends to gush about her. The couple also projected a vulnerability and slight defensiveness as they sat in the casual privacy of their parlor, with none of the superstructure that has made ''Jekyll & Hyde'' a $l00 million business. The show is a runaway hit, with Broadway tickets on sale through next June, best-selling albums and upcoming worldwide productions, but some critics have been scathing. Ben Brantley of The New York Times seemed almost to be holding his nose, calling Mr. Cuccioli ''nearly unbearable'' as Jekyll, likening Ms. Eder's character to a model for Victoria's Secret and dismissing the whole venture as a ''plastic monster assembly kit of a musical.'' Mr. Wildhorn, whose idols are George Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein, maintains that the critics just don't get it. ''They have an agenda,'' he said, ''and we're not that.'' Ms. Eder, a tall woman with wide-set, almond-shaped eyes, allows herself a simple, natural beauty off stage. Her streaked brown hair falls straight to her shoulders or is pulled back in a braid -- contrasting with Lucy's mop of long black curls -- and she seems to prefer going barefoot to the knee-high black boots (with tights and black teddy) she wears in ''Jekyll & Hyde.'' Before ambling across a field to the barn her father is building on the property, Ms. Eder, a Minnesota native who recently sold her own farm there, spoke quietly of her love for music, her belief in innate musicianship and her sense that happiness lies elsewhere than the stage. In show business, she said, ''You are the product, and you're constantly doubting yourself. Show business isn't going to make me happy.'' Mr. Wildhorn, who bubbles with an almost collegiate enthusiasm, does not contradict such remarks, despite the fact that he has built several upcoming productions around Ms. Eder: the musical ''Havana,'' planned for late 1999, and ''Svengali,'' a musical that allows Ms. Eder to sing opera. She will have a smaller role in ''The Civil War,'' Mr. Wildhorn's next musical production, which is scheduled to open in New York in March. Inextricably involved in his work as she is, Mr. Wildhorn says he values his wife's naturalness and down-to-earth quality, her readiness to drive in fence posts just hours before going on stage, for example. ''The industry wants to make her a star, but she won't give up her life,'' he said, smiling, when Ms. Eder left the room momentarily. ''I love her for that, but it also makes me crazy.'' Ms. Eder's last performance in ''Jekyll'' will take place next Sunday. Then she will fly to Houston to rehearse for ''The Civil War,'' a respite she views as a vacation. Next comes a solo album, with songs mostly by her husband, some concerts and other projects. Mr. Wildhorn can barely contain all his ideas and plans, and Ms. Eder is at the heart of them.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 194-> SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1998: FUTURISM; Japan's Many Possibilities
Japan's financial woes are keeping global economists up at night, having bad dreams. Tadashi Nakamae, president of Nakamae International Economic Research, a Tokyo-based financial advisory firm, is dreaming in grander fashion. Nakamae and the Global Business Network -- a think tank in Emeryville, Calif., that specializes in corporate ''scenario planning'' -- recently teamed up and interviewed more than 100 experts on Japan about their ''visions, worries and expectations'' for the next 20 years. The goal? To find answers to Japan's troubles using informed speculation. The team cranked out three possible futures for the place, delivered as if written by ''a historian writing in 2020.'' Here's a look. Scenario: ''Crash and Rebirth'' This optimistic outcome is called ''Japan 2020 -- The Rebirth of a Nation, BBC Television Special.'' Here, Nakamae and fellow scripters imagine a prime-time broadcast looking back on the turnaround that occurred after Japan's financial markets tanked on a June day in 1999. At that fateful, terrible moment, Japanese banks shut down for a week, inciting violence and suicides. After the initial crisis, radical economic reforms took root, all industries were deregulated and Japan's auto makers sparked a new environmentalist craze. From their utopian vantage point, the BBC hosts look back on the late 90's as a wacky, primitive time. ''I'll tell you, Christine,'' says one, ''the first thing that came to mind was astonishment at the styles that . . .you and I wore back in the 1990's. And the haircuts. That was really a different century!'' Scenario: ''Hercules Departs'' This one is set near ''Otsu, Biwa-Ko, Shiga Prefecture, July 2010, the Night Before the General Elections.'' Things are a little iffy for Japan in this storyline, which points a finger at the United States for its rapid troop withdrawals from the country in 2003. The story begins with Yoshikazu Takeda, an 80-something ex-Foreign Minister, sitting for an interview with a tweedy, balding American magazine journalist named Thompson. Sipping sake, Takeda gloomily recalls the American election in 2000, which brought Quentin Jackson (a Republican war hero) to the White House. The troop withdrawals sparked a rancorous, decade-long debate about Japan's defense. To rearm or not to rearm -- that's the question, and Takeda must vote in a pivotal national election the next day. And? That's it -- The End. Takeda leaves us hanging. Scenario: ''The Long Hollowing'' Set at a dinner party in Tiburon, Calif., in March 2020, this scenario is gloom-and-doomy. In ''a denial of reality'' about its money woes, Japan is on a fast track to has-beendom. In this script, Jason Croyer -- ''host of the Web's most popular interview show'' -- chats up a Japanese expatriate entrepreneur named Michiko Sanjo at her California home for some historical insight. Sanjo explains how she became a ''diminutive billionaire'' after bolting Japan in 2002 when a bank bailout left the economy reeling. Safely abroad, Michiko cleared her ''first $100 million'' by 2005, but back home things got bleak. Japan endured a post-millennial ''brain drain'' of talent to other countries and was sidelined in global politics. ''Japan is a broken country,'' Michiko confides to Jason as the room is wrapped in eerie silence. ''It has become irrelevant,'' she laments.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 195-> Body Is Identified as Missing Brooklyn Doctor
The search for a popular Brooklyn doctor ended yesterday and a murder inquiry began after the doctor's relatives identified his body, which was found bound and beaten last week in a vacant lot, the police said. Dr. Peter Williams, 42, an immigrant from Trinidad who practiced medicine in East Flatbush, was reported missing on Dec. 11 after he made a house call and dropped off his 7-year-old son at a friend's house, the police said. Five days later, a body was found in a vacant lot at Shepherd and Flatlands Avenues, the police said. Detectives from the 75th Precinct first linked the body to Dr. Williams on Sunday when they found his black 1996 Lexus sport utility vehicle abandoned on Ralph Avenue between Avenues J and K, said Officer Theresa Farello, a police spokeswoman. The doctor's relatives went to the Kings County morgue and identified the body as that of Dr. Williams, the police said. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, Ellen Borakove, said he had been smothered and had head injuries from being beaten. His older brother, Trevor Williams, said Dr. Williams had been beaten so severely that the skin was stripped from his cheeks. Dr. Williams, a general practitioner, was popular among his neighbors and patients, and soon after he disappeared, his family began a search, contacting the police and placing fliers around his neighborhood.. ''He was a very responsible person,'' Trevor Williams said outside the family's home on Linden Boulevard. He said his brother ''may have trusted people too much.'' ''He's riding a fancy car that could attract people,'' he said. ''And he would go to any neighborhood any time to see somebody. He just had this fearlessness.'' Mr. Williams said that his brother's patients had been coming by the house to pay their respects all day yesterday. ''Some of the places I took fliers to, people recognized him instantly,'' he said. ''I was in one place near New Lots where there were dirt roads and places where they strip cars -- I figured that would be a place they might dump somebody -- and I gave a flier to one guy, and he said, 'Oh, he came to my house.' I showed a flier to another lady in the same neighborhood, and she said, 'Oh, there's Doctor Pete,' and she started crying.'' Dr. Williams's wife, Judy Williams, who recently separated from her husband, did not speak to reporters yesterday. The couple had two children: the boy and a daughter, 4.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 196-> SIGNOFF; Guardian Angel of Film Indies
ALTHOUGH John Pierson has helped usher a number of seminal independent films to the screen in the last decade, including ''She's Gotta Have It,'' ''Roger and Me,'' and ''Slackers,'' don't bother searching for his name in the credits of any of these movies. Throughout the late 1980's and early 90's, as the American independent film scene burgeoned and then exploded, Mr. Pierson hovered like a guardian angel, unnoticed by moviegoers but an indispensable ally to aspiring filmmakers like Spike Lee and Michael Moore. Because Mr. Pierson had accumulated film business contacts while serving as a programmer at influential art theaters in New York City, ''young directors started coming to me about a decade ago and asking if I could help get their films sold,'' he said. He responded by contributing financial support and taking the films to distributors and studios to try to generate interest. In so doing, he played an important role in the evolution of American independent film, yet remained behind the scenes, removed from the creation of the films he so admired. That changed two years ago when Mr. Pierson started his own television program, ''Split Screen,'' which begins its third season tomorrow night at 8 on the Independent Film Channel (it will also be shown on Friday night at 7:30 on Bravo). A half-hour magazine-style show billed as ''a wild ride through the world of independent film,'' it features the lanky, slightly awkward Mr. Pierson as a host who drives across the country in search of interesting filmmakers. ''Independent film is alive and well everywhere you look these days,'' said Mr. Pierson, 44, during a recent interview. In each episode, Mr. Pierson introduces a series of on-location reports -- actually mini-films running about 7 to 10 minutes -- that have some connection to the subject of film. The segments are usually shot by young, obscure local filmmakers selected by Mr. Pierson. ''If I see or hear something interesting about a young filmmaker, I try to use that person in the show,'' he said, noting that about 50 filmmakers contributed to the current season's episodes. Mr. Pierson gives each segment director a story assignment, a lean budget (usually about $3,000) and, if needed, a movie camera on loan. WITH its shoestring planning and production, off-the-wall subjects and inventive camera work, the show looks like nothing else on television. In Monday night's season premiere, one segment follows the film stars Matt Damon and Edward Norton as they travel to Las Vegas to play in a high-stakes card game against top professional poker players (the actors end up being much less interesting than the oddball characters they play against). Next, Pierson introduces a profile of an amateur stuntman who dreams of breaking into car-chase films one day and prepares for that possibility by driving maniacally in an old junkyard. The episode closes with a report about a drive-in movie theater beside a cow pasture; the filmmakers, having decided that the fenced-off cows were being unfairly excluded from the movies, arranged a screening of ''Red River'' attended only by a bovine audience. Not all the segments are so light. Last season, ''Split Screen'' featured a report on censorship in Oklahoma City, and a recent segment showed a short film from 1970 in which the subject demonstrates his determination to avoid serving in the Vietnam War by shooting himself in the foot on camera. This kind of raw unpredictability has helped the series develop a small cult following. Caroline Kaplan, vice president for productions at the Independent Film Channel, said the channel's Web site invariably drew a crowd after each episode. Because of the reaction, Ms. Kaplan said, the fledgling channel has decided to make ''Split Screen'' ''our signature show and our main focus.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Pierson, once anonymous, is becoming more recognizable. On Tuesday, the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center will pay tribute to him by showing past episodes of ''Split Screen.'' And fans have been hailing him on the street, including one admirer whose advice, Mr. Pierson reported, was to ''keep it scruffy.'' Mr. Pierson and his cadre of guerrilla filmmakers intend to do just that.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 197-> 33 Arrested at Winter Solstice Observance
They waved sparkling wands. They chanted healing messages to the universe. They lit a small fire and burned offerings in the name of renewal. And then the police came. Thirty-three celebrants of the winter solstice were rounded up last night on a Staten Island beach and charged with trespassing because the beach was closed for the evening, the police said. The suspects, participants in a ceremony on South Beach organized by Donna Henes, an artist, author and self-described urban shaman from Brooklyn, had come from as far away as Florida and ranged in age from 21 to 74, the police said. Ms. Henes, 53, said she had held at least 15 solstice ceremonies on South Beach and never run into a problem before. ''In the past,'' she said, ''sometimes the Fire Department has come because someone has seen the fire, and we say, look, this is our religion, and they have been very respectful and let us finish the ceremony.'' The celebrants arrived on the beach just before the solstice at 8:56 P.M., marking the beginning of winter. Those arrested were each given a desk appearance ticket and released. Ms. Henes said some were issued tickets with $50 fines.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 198-> Woman Put Off Calling 911 While Trying to Douse Fire
A 67-year-old Brooklyn woman who dropped a cigarette onto her couch and started a fire that claimed the lives of three firefighters delayed calling the Fire Department for as long as 20 minutes while she tried to douse the blaze with teapots full of water, investigators said yesterday. The revelation was the latest in what officials called a series of missteps and failed safety measures that culminated in the firefighters' deaths on Friday. Investigators were trying to determine why the building's sprinkler system had been shut off, why city inspectors apparently had failed to detect the problem, and why the fireproof door to the woman's apartment had been tampered with. The firefighters died as they were trying to rescue the woman, Jacqueline Pinder, from her burning apartment on the top floor of a 10-story building for the low-income elderly at 17 Vandalia Avenue near Starrett City, officials said. They were unaware that she had already been pulled to safety by a neighbor. Ms. Pinder, who remained in critical condition at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, was able to speak to investigators in detail for the first time yesterday, officials said. A law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Ms. Pinder acknowledged that she caused the fire through ''smoking carelessness'' and that she waited to call 911 while trying to put it out. ''The woman made repeated attempts to extinguish the blaze herself, and in fact a significant delay was experienced in notification of the department,'' the official said. A full 10 to 12 minutes before the first 911 call was logged at 4:54 A.M. on Friday, the official said, Ms. Pinder's downstairs neighbor called the building's management office to complain that water was seeping through her electrical fixtures. The fire may have been burning for 20 minutes before other neighbors called 911, the official said, adding, ''The woman also said that she may have left the door open when she left the apartment.'' The fireproof steel door of Ms. Pinder's apartment, 10D, had been tampered with to keep it from slamming shut, as it is designed to do, officials said. This is often done by residents afraid of being locked out, officials said, but in this case it may have had a deadly effect: a fireball blew from the apartment into the hallway, engulfing the firefighters. Also, a sprinkler system designed to douse the hallway had been shut off, officials said. City inspectors apparently failed to detect this even though they are supposed to make monthly inspections of the building, which was built with Federal funds in 1983 and is managed by the New York City Housing Authority. The firefighters who died -- Lieut. Joseph P. Cavalieri, 42, who left behind a wife and two daughters; Christopher M. Bopp, 27, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, and James F. Bohan, 25, who lived with his parents -- were with the department's forcible entry team, an elite unit trained for dangerous rescues. Fire marshals, police investigators, the city's Department of Investigation and the Brooklyn District Attorney's office are all conducting inquiries to determine whether there was any criminal liability. Ms. Pinder, officials said yesterday, has not been accused of any crime. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the disabled fireproof door may have had more to do with the tragedy than the fact that the sprinkler system had been shut off. ''The doors were made to be fireproof, and the doors worked, except that somebody had detached the self-closing mechanism,'' he said. ''And therefore, when the woman left the apartment in haste, the door didn't close behind her. So the fire inside her apartment was allowed to spread into the hallway.'' But a second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: ''If someone intentionally turned off the sprinkler system, that could be gross negligence.'' Firefighters Bohan and Bopp are to be laid to rest today. Lieutenant Cavalieri is to be buried tomorrow.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 199-> UMass's Title A Turnaround
Mark Whipple believes in winning titles wherever he coaches. But even he did not expect Massachusetts to go from 2-9 to champions in one season. ''I couldn't have told you it would happen in a year, but I thought it would be here down the road,'' Whipple said after his Minutemen upset No. 1 Georgia Southern, 55-43, on Saturday for their first Division I-AA championship in his first season as coach. Georgia Southern (14-1) was seeking its fifth national title, but the Minutemen (12-3) forced a team that had only 13 turnovers all season into six fumbles and one interception. The Eagles lost the ball four times in the first quarter.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 200-> SPENDING IT; Information Age? Maybe Not, When It Comes to Prices
EVEN as the Internet has given consumers a powerful tool for learning what things cost, sizable chunks of American business seem determined to make price comparisons hard, sometimes frustratingly so. Consider the Oreck Corporation, which boasts that its compact XL vacuum cleaner has been embraced by luxury hotels and that the XL's four-pound supplementary vacuum is so powerful that it can pick up a 16-pound bowling ball. Oreck promotes these products heavily on radio and television, on fliers accompanying credit-card bills and in such mass-market publications as Parade magazine. But the prices of these marvels are not divulged: The potential buyer must mail or phone a request for an ''information kit'' to learn them. A consumer may also be frustrated when banks post or orally quote mortgage rates but refuse to actually make agreements on these terms until he plunks down cash to ''lock in,'' typically hundreds of dollars. ''This sure discourages comparison-shopping,'' contended Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, which has mounted a campaign against the practice. Then there is America Online, which was luring new subscribers with offers of free time but without specifying the costs at the end of the trial period. The company agreed this spring to explain its charges more clearly as part of a broad settlement with 44 state attorneys general. Except in financial services, there are few laws or regulations requiring sellers to disclose prices to prospective buyers, whether the item in question is a house or car -- both usually subject to negotiation anyway -- a box of cereal or even the product widely considered to serve as the economy's most visible barometer, a gallon of gasoline. For the most part, the Government just polices advertising to keep it from being false or misleading. ''Our interest gets piqued if it's a way to restrain competition or if there's consumer deception involved,'' said Willard K. Tom, deputy director of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission. (In a recently settled case over competition issues, the F.T.C. had contended that a group of farm-equipment dealers in Kentucky and Indiana had withheld advertisements from an industry journal after it published ads by other dealers featuring prices lower than those offered by the group members. The F.T.C. had also contended that the journal later agreed to stop accepting ads that included prices.) One obvious reason that consumers are often left to guess at prices is that manufacturers and retailers know that general American prosperity has reduced the need for many people to watch how they spend each nickel and dime. But there is more to it than that, marketing and advertising specialists say. Generally speaking, marketers say they are finding an emphasis on price to be a poor, often self-defeating strategy. It tends to erode consumer perceptions of product quality, and also eventually loses impact even with shoppers whose primary consideration is price. That's because the bargain-hunters wait to buy only during the inevitable sales. The notion of buying goods at sale prices ''becomes an entitlement,'' said Tom Lawson, managing partner at Arnold Communications, an advertising agency in Boston. Just as important, others say, is a desire not to unnecessarily intensify competition. ''Marketers aren't pushing prices because they don't want to get into wars,'' said Audrey Guskey, professor of marketing at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. And manufacturers see little to gain by parading before Wall Street their current inability to raise prices in a minimum-inflation climate. Asked about his strategy of deferred price disclosure, David Oreck, the chief executive of the vacuum cleaner company, said it was a matter of practicality. ''We have several different models and there's just so much you can say in an ad,'' he said. Perhaps, the specialists suggested, the Oreck strategy is to concentrate on prospects who are motivated enough to request price information, at the risk of losing some potential customers who assume that Oreck cleaners are priced beyond their means. The products, which Mr. Oreck calls ''kind of mid-range,'' average $300 to $400. It is clear, though, that the rapid proliferation of Internet technology has complicated marketing strategies. ''A whole new source has emerged for price information that wasn't there before,'' said Joseph Plummer, director of brand strategy at McCann-Erickson Worldwide. Some sellers, though, avoid electronic commerce ''for fear that people would go on the Internet and comparison-shop,'' perhaps unfairly penalizing goods that should command premium prices, said Frank Torres, a spokesman for Consumers Union. YET according to a study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College of Business, consumer sensitivity to price ''tends to be lower on line'' than in stores, particularly when the sales pitch describes a product's other attributes, like nutritional value of a food product. In some cases, of course, the lack of a price tag is pure snob appeal, its absence intended to suggest that the product ''is for the kind of people who don't have to worry about the price,'' said Diane Cook-Tench, director of the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University. Or, as has been said about yachts, if you have to ask what one costs, you can't afford it.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 201-> SPENDING IT; Studying the Fine Print In Tuition Saving Plans
WHEN Michael Cryans had to save for college for his older son, Cameron, now 22 and entering his senior year at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, he did it the old-fashioned way: He put aside about $25,000 in savings bonds and passbook accounts. Now in a second marriage, Mr. Cryans has a 1-year-old son, Connor. And this time, Mr. Cryans has a new range of financial instruments at his disposal -- a good thing, too, because that $25,000 would barely cover half the projected cost of a year at a private school by the time Connor enrolled. ''Having had the opportunity to put one child through college already, I can appreciate the commitment you have to make to be prepared,'' said Mr. Cryans, who is 47 and a small-business consultant. Indeed, he and his wife, Julie, have already started to save for Connor in one of a growing number of college savings plans run by state governments. Last year, amid considerable fanfare, Congress created the Education I.R.A., similar to an individual retirement account, in which parents may save for their children's education. But somewhat overlooked were steps Congress took to clarify the tax status of the state-sponsored plans, which permit much larger contributions than allowed by the Education I.R.A. and are thus likely to attract much more consumer interest. Among other things, Congress allowed the state plans to expand beyond tuition to cover room and board, effectively doubling the amount of money that families can save through them. The range varies from state to state, but many allow total contributions of as much as $100,000. In response, the number of state-sponsored college savings plans is expected to double this year, to 41, according to the College Savings Plan Network, a nonprofit organization that tracks and advises the funds, with almost all the growth coming from a breed of state plans that resemble mutual funds. Indeed, the New York metropolitan region is seeing a sprouting of such funds: Connecticut started its program in January; New Jersey's began earlier this month, and New York's will commence in September. Though college savings plans vary from state to state, there are two basic varieties: the older type, which guarantee returns, and the newer, which don't. Until this year, most plans came with guarantees to lock in tuition rates at current prices. In Ohio, for example, parents of a newborn who paid $3,655 last year can be sure their investment will cover a year at a state-run college or university. Generally, should a child ultimately not attend a public college in that state, the sum can be transferred to another institution -- in or out of state -- or to a sibling. It can also be refunded, minus a small penalty fee. Guaranteed plans are intended to do no more than keep up with the ''college inflation rate'' -- the rate of increase in tuition, which is now 6 percent to 7.5 percent. The new savings plans aim to do better. These plans, many of them managed by professional investment powerhouses including Fidelity Investments and T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., typically take greater risks in hopes of earning higher returns. And like the bonds and stock mutual funds in which they invest, the new plans come without safety nets: Thus, investors' nest eggs could sour as easily as they could soar. Guaranteed or not, are the state-sponsored plans a smart way to save? Despite the new tax advantages, most financial planners are cool toward both concepts. With college inflation running several percentage points below the 10 percent average annual return on stocks, guaranteed-plan investors can do better elsewhere, said Ray Loewe, president of College Money, a financial planning firm in Marlton, N.J. Financial advisers are also suspicious of the nonguaranteed plans, pointing out that most are too new to have the track records they look for. And while these plans deliver tax savings, they also tack on more fees than popular no-load mutual funds. For example, to participate in New Hampshire's plan, the Cryans will pay annual charges of $3 for every $1,000 they have saved. The plans are also not as flexible as regular mutual funds. For example, if Connor decides not to go to college or the Cryans need money for an emergency, the family will owe taxes and a 15 percent penalty on the account's investment growth. And though financial aid rules vary from college to college, many count state plans as scholarships or a child's property -- treatment that can compromise eligibility for grants. Still, for many people, the tax benefits may outweigh these disadvantages. Gains on investments in regular mutual funds are taxed at a parent's capital-gains rate, generally 20 percent, but growth in a state plan is taxed only when used, and then at the child's tax rate, which is usually 15 percent. Many states also exempt gains in their plans from state taxes. Moreover, several new plans use an asset-allocation method that financial planners favor, investing in portfolios of several stock and bond funds that grow more conservative as a child ages. Fidelity, which edged several rivals to win the new plan business for Delaware, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, sees it as an important part of college financing's future. Fund companies cannot sell the plans directly because only states can legally sponsor them. ''When we looked at the changes in the tax laws, these programs represent for most people the best alternative,'' said Stephen Mitchell, senior vice president at Fidelity. THOUGH less popular now, the guaranteed plans would be revitalized if stocks sank or college inflation accelerated. Indeed, risk-averse investors seem willing to shed a few percentage points of gains for the security of a guarantee. ''I don't feel like we are losing anything,'' said Gwen Martino, a school librarian in Brookfield, Ohio. By saving $100 a month for the last six years, she and her husband, Daniel, have amassed nearly enough to buy Daniel Jeffrey, 9, and Alessandra, 6, a year's tuition each at an Ohio public college. ''Granted, we could make more, but isn't that always the gamble with the stock market? You could make more but you could also lose your shirt,'' Mrs. Martino said. As for the Education I.R.A., contributions are limited to just $500 annually; its biggest selling point is its tax-free status: all gains accumulate free of Federal taxes, provided the funds are used for school. That makes it ''the hands-down winner in terms of tax advantage'' among college financing alternatives, Mr. Mitchell said. Parents thinking about investing in both a state-sponsored plan and an Education I.R.A. should think again. You cannot contribute to both, at least in the same year.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 203-> Rape Resists the Inroads Of the City's War on Crime
In an era of plummeting crime rates, there is one category of violent offense that has resisted the trend: rape. New York City's murder rate has plunged 60 percent in four years; robberies have dropped nearly 50 percent. But reports of rape are down only 13 percent in the same time period and have shown only a small decline this year, police statistics show. The many factors credited with making New York's streets so safe -- the new policing tactics, the quality-of-life crackdown, the waning crack epidemic, the booming economy -- have had only a limited effect on the rape rate, the police and prosecutors say. The reasons are varied, they say, but all serve to underscore their belief that among violent crimes, rape stands apart. ''It's a completely different animal that you can't prevent through traditional crime-fighting techniques,'' said Marjory D. Fisher, who heads the Queens District Attorney's special victims bureau. ''When you flood a corner with police officers or attack quality-of-life crimes, you may affect the gun rate or the drug arrest rate, but you aren't going to affect the rape rate.'' A primary reason, Ms. Fisher said, is that in most cases, rapists know their victims, exploiting an intimacy that allows them to attack behind closed doors, away from other people, beyond the reach of the police. In such circumstances, placing bars on windows, avoiding dark alleys and not talking to strangers are no protection. Of the 2,779 rapes reported in New York City last year, more than 75 percent were said to be committed by an acquaintance or relative of the victim's, the police said, a figure that they said was borne out year to year. Police Commissioner Howard Safir points to this statistic as the best explanation for the relatively slow decline in rapes compared with other violent crimes. The number of reported rapes remains high simply because women are far more likely now than in years past to report acquaintance rape, he said. The Commissioner and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have repeatedly commended the efforts of the Police Department to expand resources used to combat rape and to remove the stigma that has kept many victims from going to the police for help. ''Many of those rapes would not have been reported in the past because people did not have the confidence that they would be treated with sensitivity and anonymity,'' Mr. Safir said. Over the years, the police and prosecutors' offices have established special units of investigators trained to deal with the particular difficulties that emerge when questioning victims of sex crimes. Many hospitals also have hired counselors to assist rape victims. Coverage of some of these innovations by the news media has prompted some rape victims to report their assaults, said Casey Jordan, an associate professor of justice and law administration at Western Connecticut State University. Even coverage of some notorious rape trials like those involving William Kennedy Smith in Florida and Alex Kelly in Connecticut have encouraged some to come forward, she said. ''The outcome of these cases is irrelevant,'' said Ms. Jordan, who specializes in studying rape trends. ''The message that women have gotten is that the victim has fought to see a rapist brought to justice and these victims have been seen as heroines.'' Another factor affecting rape statistics, the police say, is the difficulty in capturing the small but troubling number of rapists who repeatedly attack strangers. The number of rapes by strangers has risen 8 percent in New York City this year, after a 20 percent drop in the previous three, police statistics show. Prosecutors said they do not believe that there are more rapists on the loose, only that they have been able to cover their tracks even after multiple assaults. Many rapists have been able to circumvent recent advances in DNA fingerprinting and fiber analysis by such simple acts as wearing gloves, masks and condoms, investigators say. One rapist who has eluded capture by using these tactics is a man thought responsible for more than 30 attacks in the last four years on women in upper Manhattan and the Bronx. The police said he has disguised his appearance with scarves, bandannas, handkerchiefs and ski masks. He attacks women quickly from behind as they enter apartment buildings, elevators or alleys from Harlem to the northeastern Bronx, they said. His constant characteristics appear to be that he carries a black gun, takes only gold jewelry, orders his victims not to look at his face, and uses condoms. The police say condom use among rapists is on the rise, noting that some rape victims have pleaded with their attackers to use them because of the fear of AIDS. While that may minimize the health risk for the victim, the use of condoms denies investigators an important type of evidence, the so-called genetic fingerprint that forensic experts can recover from semen. These factors add to the already peculiar difficulties that detectives face in trying to capture the rapists who are strangers to their victims: unlike most other criminals, they nearly always work alone, seldom brag about their exploits and usually commit the act at a time and in a place they have scouted out and chosen precisely for its lack of witnesses. ''Unlike homicide or a robbery, very rarely do they say to their buddies, 'Hey, I raped that woman in the paper yesterday,' '' said Lieut. Susan Morley, head of the Police Department's sex crimes liaison unit. ''You really don't get many tips on these crimes,'' she added, noting that homicides usually involve a connection between victim and assailant, and that robbers can often be traced through the property they have stolen. And even if a rapist is caught, there is no guarantee that he will go to prison. While the conviction rate in homicide cases routinely reaches above 85 percent, the rate for rape cases usually is 40 to 50 percent -- making it more likely that some rapists will be freed to rape again, prosecutors say. Despite the encouraging increase in the willingness of women to report rape, many experts say that sexual assaults continue to be the most underreported of all major crimes and that they are believed to occur twice as often as the statistics show. According to a well-regarded 1992 independent study, ''Rape in America,'' 13 percent of all women have been raped at least once. And 62 percent of the rapes happened before the age of 18, according to the study, conducted by the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina and by the National Victims Center in Arlington, Va. Dr. Eleanor Pam, who heads the research and resource center on domestic violence at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that while it was impossible to determine if the number of rapes are really rising or falling, the increase in the number of women willing to report the crime was a significant bellwether. She said that she took little comfort in it. ''These statistics show that violence against women continues unabated and that we haven't done anything significantly to impact it,'' she said. ''We are just beginning to acknowledge it as a crime and accept the scope of its diversity.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 204-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Cryptic Snippets About the 'Lonely Species'
ROADSIDE DOG By Czeslaw Milosz Translated by the author and Robert Hass. 208 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22. The full text of one of the briefer (though not the briefest) of the several score brief chapters in this collection of anecdotes and ruminations by Czeslaw Milosz is this: ''It looks as if that, ready, formed in every detail, waited nearby, at a hand's stretching, and had I caught it, I would not have drawn the thing out of the nothingness all around, but taken, as if from a shelf, an object already existing.'' You want to read that sentence a few times, striving to absorb its meaning, to puzzle out the identity of the rather vague ''that'' that is ''ready'' and ''formed in every detail.'' It seems most likely, though far from certain, that ''that'' is a poem or another work of the imagination and Mr. Milosz, the Polish writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, is commenting on the difficulty inherent in poetic creation. The already existing, he seems to be saying, has a power that can block the writer's struggle to bring creation out of nothingness, so that the poet instead falls back on words, ideas, phrases already on the shelf. Mimicry, an unconscious absorption of the rhetorical culture, can take on an illusory sort of originality when in fact they make the poet not a creator but a conformist. Mr. Milosz's ''Roadside Dog'' is an elusive as well as allusive work, a book not exactly of poetry but not of prose either. It is composed mostly of fragments more or less in the tradition of Pascal's ''Thoughts,'' though generally it has more of a valedictory tone than a classically philosophical one. Some of Mr. Milosz's subjects are what one might expect of a poet whose life has extended for most of the century: memory, forgetfulness, aging and the depths to which human beings are capable of falling. Mr. Milosz, born in 1911, writes about writing, about poetry and about those very human frailties of resentment and self-importance. ''To believe you are magnificent,'' goes one very lapidary and especially valedictory passage. ''And gradually to discover that you are not magnificent. Enough labor for one human life.'' ''Roadside Dog'' is, in other words, a difficult pleasure, but it is a pleasure. Mr. Milosz speaks, as he has in his many earlier works, in phrases that seem almost ordinary, stylistically unexceptional, but that are in fact cryptic, compact and as closely carved as pieces of Chinese ivory. It is difficult to isolate an overriding preoccupation here, but one can recognize a basic recurring concern in Mr. Milosz's mystical and difficult fragments. It is the battle against nothingness, the need to forge some sort of order, moral and spiritual, out of the chaos represented by the history of recent decades. In one passage, for example, titled ''Watering Can,'' Mr. Milosz talks of the way in which the movies and photography have created the habit of paying attention to things as well as people, to ''a multitude of objects.'' He concludes, ''Precisely in this, in our clinging to distinctly delineated shapes, does our hope reside, of salvation from the turbulent waters of nothingness and chaos.'' In one of his more explicitly political ruminations, Mr. Milosz writes of the slaughter of the Warsaw ghetto and how such a tragedy might in a way be easier for an atheist than a believer. The atheist, Mr. Milosz writes, is freed ''from a quarrel with the Creator who must be held responsible for the suffering of human beings.'' The atheist ''should accept the world as it is'' with murder of the weak by the strong an ordinary part of nature. Butit is ''whence comes our protest, our scream: No!,'' he writes, that separates humans from nature and ''makes us a lonely species.'' Is this argument for the ''peculiar place of man'' an argument for the existence of God? Mr. Milosz, who writes of being a Roman Catholic but makes few other explicit references to religion, seems to be speaking for the existence of a higher power. But he speaks for that presence directly in a few concise sentences and without flinching in the face of the most powerful case that can be made against it. Other fragments are less weighty, including some brief reminiscences about Poland and the world before the cataclysm of World War II. The very phrase roadside dog that gave Mr. Milosz his title comes from a memory (or perhaps from Mr. Milosz's imagination) of traveling in a horse-drawn cart from village to village in some unnamed old country at the beginning of the century. Always, Mr. Milosz writes, ''we were barked at by a dog, assiduous in its duty.'' The suggestion is that these essays are like apocrypha, secondary and somewhat random reflections, not part of one's main body of work. In one of the longer chapters that come in the second half of the volume, Mr. Milosz writes about fleas, about how we have forgotten that for much of history people lived lives afflicted by parasites that ''the civilization of politeness'' required them to pretend did not exist. Often Mr. Milosz seems to invoke secondary events to shed light on more central concepts. He begins a chapter called ''Ancestors,'' for example, with the startling statement: ''To tell the truth, we should not exist.'' He reminds us of the unspeakable hardships suffered by past generations who ''died like flies from epidemics, from starvation, from wars, and though children swarmed, for every 12 of them only one or two survived.'' For one family line to have survived is veritably miraculous, Mr. Milosz concludes, leaving us with one of his densely suggestive ideas: ''Our species should have disappeared a long time ago, and it is still alive, incredibly resistant. That you and I happen to be part of it should be enough to give us pause for meditation.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 205-> SOCCER; U.S. Soccer Picks President
The United States Soccer Federation elected Dr. Bob Contiguglia as its new president today, ending the eight-year reign of Alan Rothenberg. Contiguglia, a 56-year-old kidney specialist from Denver, will have no honeymoon. The selection of a new men's national team coach is certainly next on his agenda. The job has been vacant since Steve Sampson resigned after the United States's dismal result at the 1998 World Cup. ''We really don't have a set date yet for hiring a national team coach,'' Contiguglia said via a conference call from Hawaii. ''International experience is a big factor, but we don't have to make a decision right away.'' Earlier, Rothenberg had said he would name a new coach from a list that has been shortened to Bruce Arena, coach of Major League Soccer's D.C. United, and Bora Milutinovic, the former United States coach. Rothenberg later retracted that. ''Obviously the federation is considering me,'' Arena said last night after his team's 2-1 victory over the MetroStars. ''I haven't expended a lot of energy campaigning for the job, but I think it was a good move to delay the announcement until the election of a new president.'' Asked to respond to the notion that he does not have enough international experience, Arena said: ''I don't understand that perspective. I think I know the difference between good and bad players.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 207-> POLITICAL BRIEFING; Money Speaks Louder Than Governor Bush
The polls indicate that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the early favorite among Republicans to be the Republican nominee in the 2000 Presidential contest. But the Governor says the only thing he's running for at this point is re-election. As if to underscore that contention and lower his political profile, Mr. Bush recently has been noticeably absent from some big national Republican gatherings and was a no-show at the annual National Governor's Conference in Milwaukee. But follow the money . . . . The latest campaign finance report from the Bush camp shows that between March 1 and June 30, he raised $4.4 million, with just under half of it -- $1.9 million -- coming from beyond the Lone Star State. A lot of big out-of-state companies and big people have major business interests in Texas and would like to see the former President's son win a second term. But those same companies and people also like to hedge their Presidential bets. More than $500,000 of the out-of-state money collected by Mr. Bush in the spring came from California, always a cash cow in Presidential elections. That kind of generosity for a Texan could hardly please California's Governor, Pete Wilson, who has been talking about running again for President -- if he can raise the cash. Mr. Bush also received almost $300,000 last spring from Washington. Many of the capital's big-name lobbyists and lawyers have big interests in Texas. How did Mr. Bush's Democratic challenger, Garry Mauro, fare in the spring cash contest? He got $54,475 from the Washington lawyers and lobbyists and $15,175 from California, with all but $175 of the California money coming from the musician Don Henley of the Eagles.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 208-> Q&A/William R. Dyson; Politics With a Very Personal View
WILLIAM R. DYSON has served in the Connecticut General Assembly for 22 years, representing the 94th district in New Haven -- a mostly low-income and mostly minority district. Mr. Dyson, with a master's degree in urban studies and an education certificate from Southern Connecticut State University, has taught in the New Haven public schools since 1970, currently assigned to the Sound School, where he counsels troubled students. His job, he says, gives him the flexibility he needs as a chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee for the past 10 years. During a recent interview in his home, Mr. Dyson was wearing his signature attire -- creased blue jeans with shirt and tie. He took advantage of the venue to iron as he talked. A Democrat, he is nevertheless a tough man to categorize politically -- and he made it clear he likes it that way. Following are excerpts from the conversation. Q. What legislative accomplishments are you proudest of? A. It changes. I was pleased that in 1977, '78, '79, '80, I was able to increase support for people on public assistance. I was having an impact on the lives of people who were in desperate need. Support for education -- I felt that impacted large groups of people and it was basic to what we should be about. And that included higher ed. Health is another, most especially the needs around AIDS, needle exchange, the Leeway nursing home. Q. A couple of years ago, a lot of UConn people were very disappointed in you. Why? A. A few years ago, we were about the business of cutting support away from those who could least afford it -- from General Assistance. And then along come individuals from an institution of higher ed, demanding that they get more, or at least not have to be dealt with in the same fashion as other people. Q. So you thought it should be equalized pain? A. You better believe it! Q. When the welfare reform bill was passed, its 21-month limit was the strictest in the nation. You supported that. Why? A. It was risky, because the governor had proposed something far worse. I had no doubt that he could succeed, so the tack I took was, let's compromise. It's turned out O.K. We got a lot more day care money, a lot more job training money. Q. You supported the controversial fingerprinting of welfare recipients. Why? A. I wanted to prove once and for all that the fraud that people claimed was there, wasn't there. The only way was to put the fraud detection apparatus in place. Q. What do you see as the role of racism in the legislative process? A. The legislature represents the broader society. What exists in the broader society exists there. I've had to work with a lot of people. I've had to learn to accept the notion that my view isn't the only one, that my experience isn't the only one, that other people have other experiences that they hold just as dear as the ones that I have. Q. When Irving Stolberg was the Speaker of the House, and you didn't get the Appropriations Committee spot that you now have, you felt that racism played a role, didn't you? A. I felt that my color had something to do with it. Q. A few years ago you were very critical of people you called ''liberales.'' These were people who had supported the same goals as you . . . A. As long as they were the ones who thought it up. The moment I started thinking about the approach, then I'm being contrary and difficult to work with. If you seek to lead, people are going to have problems with that, especially people who have always done the leading. Q. What's your relationship with those people now? A. People have gotten to see me in a different light, as a person with an opinion that's just as valid as theirs. I don't seek to be their leader; they don't necessarily seek to be mine. If we're going to work together we're going to come to the table as equals. Q. Would you say your views have changed over time? A. No. I'm kind of conservative in my opinions, in my values and what I believe. I'm viewed as somewhat progressive or liberal on issues related to education or civil rights. But basically, I find myself more moderate or conservative. It isn't a change. Q. If you had to put a label on yourself . . . A. Realist. Q. And you don't want to be called a liberal or a progressive or a conservative? A. Right. To deal with the notion that one is conservative or liberal is to say that one's right and the other one's wrong. Who determines what's right and wrong? Each person. The ''liberale'' crowd wants to categorize so quickly, and you can't do that. I'm not going to fit your mold. I'm going to be here, I'm going to be there. It's not simple. I'm complex. Q. But you like that, right? A. Yeah. Q. You've said that you get along much better with Republican leaders like Gov. John G. Rowland than the people you call the ''liberales.'' A. We can be realists together. We can come to an understanding and move on. It's not a question of whether I'll work with him -- he's the governor. Am I going to act like a ''liberale'' and say that I'm not going to work with him? Then I'm forgetting the people I represent, because half of them may like Rowland. Q. Do you think that's helped move things through in the last couple of legislative sessions? A. Yes. For example, if I was going to fight Rowland on the issue of public assistance, the person receiving public assistance paid the price. So what's the point of the fight? Q. But people take on what they think are losing battles all the time, and they don't lose, because they rally people, or whatever. A. When you're sitting with 151 people, and you know you have 58 of them who are going with the other guy, and you know you have 20 who are with you, I count the numbers. That was the breakdown on the welfare reform issue. The rally ain't gonna work. I'm being a realist. Q. Some people say you've gotten more subtle. Do you agree? A. Yeah. I don't need to hit somebody with a two-by-four just to put a knot on their head. If there's a way I can do it, and not even have my fingerprints on it, I'm happy with that. Q. Others have called you brilliant and bitter. Is that right? A. Well, brilliant, I don't know. I try to pay attention to the details, and especially to people. I don't think I'm bitter so much as angry. Angry about lost opportunities. Q. Do you think people underestimate you? A. I try to have people underestimate me. It puts them off guard. Q. Have you seen a blurring of the differences between the two main parties, and is that a problem? A. Political lines are getting less well defined. That's probably a negative, because there is very little debate about the merits of issues. My own actions determine to some degree whether there will be debate. That's a conflict for me. For example, if I just insert money for needle exchange programs into the budget, I have stopped the debate on that. The budget is a statement of the state's priorities. I represent my district, the city of New Haven, the state. My ethnicity is always there, influencing all that I do. In the case of needle exchange, it was for my district, and I did it. Who's going to challenge me? Q. How often have you done that? A. A bunch of times. Q. Where are you headed? A. To try for majority leader. Q. You're really going after it? A. Yes. Q. Do you expect a tough race? A. Yes. Q. Do you expect to get conservative support? A. I know I will. Q. It's too bad the Republicans can't vote, don't you think? A. I wish they could. Q. There is speculation that if Governor Rowland is re-elected, he's going to appoint you his budget chief. What do you say about that? A. Get outta here. But why does it matter? I'd be in a position to set budget priorities, which is what I do now. But I understand. It's political. Is Bill Dyson a real Democrat, or is he a closet Republican? Q. Do you feel you've made any compromises in principle? A. I don't compromise if it violates a principle to a degree that I can't live with. Q. Has the ability to live with violations of your principles changed? A. I think the things I may have held a deep and abiding view on and held dearly years ago may have mellowed out some. I may have learned things about other people and just ways of doing things that has caused some adjustment.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 209-> A Priestess of Zen Adornment
You may admire Kazuko's work, but don't call her a designer. ''I don't design,'' she said emphatically the other day. ''I make things.'' What she makes are one-of-a-kind necklaces, pins, earrings and bracelets of precious and semiprecious stones wrapped in gold wire; evening belt purses of antique fabric trimmed with pearls and crystals; hand-painted stationery, and vests made of antique laces adorned with delicate stones. Her jewelry has earned her a loyal following in the 10 years it has sold at Barneys New York stores, but the newer note cards and fabric pieces have created the impetus for an exhibition of Kazuko's work planned for spring at the Holly Solomon Gallery, 172 Mercer Street. Kazuko considers herself an artist. Others may call her an artisan. She makes everything herself, with no assistants, working on the floor of her all-white apartment high above West 57th Street. ''I call this a high-rise loft,'' she said, pointing to a view of Central Park and beyond through uncurtained windows. ''I'm obsessed with light. When I meditate, I look at the clouds.'' She lives with almost no furniture, stacking her belongings on the floor and covering them with white fabrics like dropcloths. ''I grew up very modern in Japan, and now I live very Japanese,'' she said. Her piles of books are blanketed with gauze. ''I cover them because they talk too much,'' she said. ''They have too much energy coming out.'' Her computer, which is also white, sits shrouded on the floor of her bedroom, though she prefers to write everything by hand, even invoices and faxes. The only color comes from spindly plants, tiny animal figurines, framed photographs and, when she works, colored stones like coral, tourmaline and aquamarine. A diminutive, birdlike woman with long black hair, Kazuko wore nothing but black for many years, until her acupuncturist told her that black attracts negative energy. (Tell that to the fashion flock.) Now she wears only white, usually voluminous swaths of fabric from designers like Issey Miyake, Fernando Sanchez and Yeohlee. ''I totally believe in fashion,'' she said. ''Fashion is like Zen. What we put on our body is as important as what we eat and breathe.'' She wears a bracelet encasing three large clear crystals on one wrist and a changing assortment of necklaces holding colored stones and crystals around her neck. The stones she chooses carefully each day, not for color but for symbolism. She believes in the power of crystals, attributing special properties to each stone and calling her jewelry ''healing sculpture.'' ''You feel a healing energy when you stitch each bead,'' she maintained. ''Your heart has to be in the right place. If I'm angry, I can't make these things. The needles cut and the wires bruise my skin.'' She said that when someone first suggested rubbing a stone for 15 minutes a day to release its healing power, she was skeptical. ''I tried it for two weeks and began to feel better,'' she said. ''I began to study crystals. This belief in crystals didn't start in the 60's. It has been throughout history. I envisioned the caveman seeing a crystal in his cave and rubbing it until it shined.'' Some of the women who wear her jewelry believe, like Kazuko, that it has talismanic properties. Kitty D'Alessio, a former president of Chanel and of Josie Natori, wears Kazuko's clear crystal bracelets all the time since a bout with cancer five years ago. Holly Solomon says she never leaves the house without a Kazuko crystal heart. ''I wear her pieces because I have luck with them,'' Ms. Solomon said. ''Every time I wear them, I make a deal.'' Gloria Vanderbilt, Anne Slater and the chef-restaurateur Daniel Boulud also collect Kazuko's jewelry. (Men tend to wear small stones pinned inside their jackets.) In New Age-speak, clear quartz crystal can balance the emotions, stimulate the brain and dispel negative energy. But it's a good bet that most women who wear Kazuko's jewelry aren't interested in magical qualities. They just admire it for its beauty, which is both primitive and sophisticated -- and because it is instantly recognizable and rarely fails to elicit admiring comments. That's certainly why fashion magazines photograph the jewelry, and why it has retained a prominent spot in every Barneys store. It fills two showcases inside the main entrance to the Madison Avenue store and is displayed in the tallest fixture on the main floor of the Beverly Hills branch. No one who enters a Barneys could avoid seeing it and usually stopping to look, if not to buy. Although Kazuko, who uses just one name (''like Cher and Madonna,'' she said), studied painting as a child in Tokyo, she dabbled in many arts after arriving in New York in 1968 on a scholarship. ''I studied theoretical drama at N.Y.U. and went to La Mama and worked there for a year,'' she said. She then became interested in photography and exhibited her hand-painted photographs in a SoHo photo gallery in 1972. When she developed an allergy to the chemicals, she looked for a new outlet for her creativity. ''I became a technojunkie and started making videos,'' she said. ''I was making avant-garde videos, trying to express everything poetically. I wanted to make technology my slave, but it didn't work out. Technology was not making me happy.'' Her friend Robert Frank, the photographer, told her to do something simple, ''something that makes you happy.'' Since she had been collecting antique fabrics and beads, she started to make scarves and adorned them with beads. ''I wanted to do something one of a kind that comes out of my hand and my heart,'' she said. ''I used to wrap the stones with silk threads, but I had no idea silk wouldn't hold the stone.'' That's when she discovered gold wire and developed the cagelike wrapping that became the Kazuko signature. Soon her scarves were in an exhibition at Robert Lee Morris's Artwear gallery in SoHo and she was making the wedding veil Madonna wore in her ''Like a Virgin'' video. When a scarf ended up in a window of Barneys for the opening of the women's store on 17th Street in 1986, the Barneys connection was forged. Simon Doonan, the store's creative director, says Kazuko is to Barneys what Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso are to Tiffany's. ''The first jewelry we had in the store was the single stones of clear crystal with bold wrapping,'' said Judy Collinson, an executive vice president of Barneys. ''They were mostly pendants to be pinned on. Then she did hearts, and I didn't understand. 'Barneys is not a heart store,' I told her. But she kept bringing them back, and it became the right thing.'' ''Then necklaces began to evolve,'' Ms. Collinson said. ''Then the big bracelets of three big stones. Then the jewelry became more delicate, more weblike, with tiaras you could wear as chokers.'' The current pieces continue in that delicate vein, with multiple tiny stones strung on fine wire, which is sometimes twisted or braided. Braided wires also hold detachable evening bags and cell phone pouches. When Ms. Collinson started to ask for earrings, Kazuko said she couldn't make them. ''Earrings have to match, and that's not what I do,'' she said. Eventually, she found herself making earrings that don't quite match. One-of-a-kind items are never perfect matches and are often not symmetrical. But now asymmetry is acceptable, even desirable, in fashion. Zen or no Zen.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 210-> Report on the Sound: Good and Bad
IT used to be known as a jubilee, the summertime event when crabs ''walked'' out of the sea. For shellfish lovers, the phenomenon continues to be an occasion for a feast. For scientists, it is a cause for worry. So far this year, no mass exodus of oxygen-starved crabs from Long Island Sound has taken place, but signs of trouble abound. There are indications in many locations that water quality in the Sound has been steadily deteriorating, and, in part, global warming is to blame. ''Weather conditions have been just right for a crash,'' said Steve Yergeau, research director for Save the Sound, an environmental group in Stamford and Glen Cove. ''The warm, wet winter primed the pump, and the hot, humid summer allowed the water to stratify.'' Oxygen levels in most sections of the Sound are low, with some locations below three parts per million -- a condition known as hypoxia, which puts stress on marine life and can cause the shellfish to flee. Mr. Yergeau and about 250 volunteers this summer sampled water quality along the shoreline in Westchester and by late July had come up with sobering findings: hypoxic conditions existed at Milton Harbor in Rye, Mamaroneck Harbor and Echo Bay in New Rochelle. ''This could be fatal,'' Mr. Yergeau said, explaining that when striped bass, blue fish and bait fish are deprived of oxygen, they often charge en masse to harbors and become trapped. There are, however, some optimistic signs in the Sound -- indications that despite the unpredictability of weather trends, other factors affecting the Sound are being controlled. Rainy weather last week stirred the waters and helped oxygenate the Sound. But environmental efforts -- like sewer repairs, a cap on the amount of nitrogen flowing into the Sound from sewage treatment plants, restoration of streams and adoption of local ordinances -- may also be helping. ''We're hoping our efforts are finally paying off,'' said Paul Stacey, chief environmental analyst with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. ''Given the weather conditions during much of this summer, water quality has not fallen off as much as it might have.'' Mr. Stacey said he observed less decaying material in the Sound this year, a sign that the reduction in the amount of nitrogen going into the water may be helping. Nitrogen from fertilizer, which flows off lawns, and nitrogen in the effluent from treatment plants encourages the growth of algae, which, when it decays, consumes the oxygen that fish need. The Sound -- an estuary where salt water from the ocean mixes with freshwater from inland streams and rivers -- is bounded by Connecticut and Westchester to the north and Long Island to the south. In New York City, the Interstate Sanitation Commission also reported critical conditions in some parts of the East River and along sections of the north shore of Long Island. Howard Golub, executive director and chief engineer for the tri-state environmental agency, described the situation as very worrisome. There have been scattered reports of fish kills, Mr. Golub said, although those have not been officially substantiated. In Connecticut, the Department of Environmental Protection reported that the fish kills occurred in Hempstead Harbor on Long Island, and it reported that severe hypoxic conditions were recorded in Norwalk. But at Save the Sound, John Atkin, the president, observed that the policy of no net increase of nitrogen going into the Sound seems to be helping. ''Knock on wood,'' he said, ''although we certainly still have alot of work ahead of us.'' Part of that work will take place in Westchester as part of an agreement signed last Monday between the county and the State Department of Environmental Conservation. Under continuing pressure from the state, Westchester agreed to correct longstanding inflow and infiltration problems in the county's sewer system to prevent unpermitted discharges from county sewage treatment plants to the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. John P. Cahill, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, called on the county to upgrade its sewer systems immediately. Under a consent order, the county will repair deteriorating sewage-collection systems in 30 municipalities served by treatment plants in Yonkers, New Rochelle, Rye and Mamaroneck. The purpose is to prevent ground water, which is rich in nutrients like nitrogen, from entering sewer systems -- a problem known as infiltration. The estimated cost of the improvements is $50 million. In addition, Westchester will also pay a $100,000 penalty to the state and pay for $500,000 in environmental projects on the river and the Sound. On the Sound, the projects include retrofitting storm water management basins in Rye and New Rochelle, stabilizing stream banks at the junction of the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers and restoring Beaver Swamp Wetland in Rye and Harrison and Pryer Manor Marsh Tidal Wetland in New Rochelle. The consent order also requires municipalities to disconnect all illegal sewer connections from the county's lines, which contributes to the problem known as inflow. Illegal hookups from private homes and businesses must be disconnected by 2002, the state said. The county initially agreed to attend to the problems in 1992, and again in 1996, but failed to comply with terms of the agreement and did not compel its municipalities to do so. In a separate effort to improve water quality in the Sound, five Westchester communities recently pledged to work together and with the county to reduce levels of nutrients entering the water. A committee made up of representatives from Harrison, Mamaroneck Village, Port Chester, Rye Brook and Rye City released a management plan earlier this summer to guide the communities in cleaning up the estuary and the many streams, ponds and wetlands within their borders. The document was released by what is known as a watershed advisory committee, a group of municipal representatives that studied an 11,755-acre area, including the watersheds of Blind and Beaver Swamp Brooks and Port Chester and Milton Harbors, all of which drain into the Sound. A citizens' group called the Committee on Nonpoint Source Pollution in Long Island Sound, established in 1992 by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, set up six watershed advisory committees the next year to study intermunicipal planning efforts. One of the advisory committees, which studied more than 6,600 acres in New Rochelle, the town and village of Mamaroneck, Larchmont, Pelham and Pelham Manor, was the first to complete its plan -- in May 1997. A major focus of the remedial plans is on nonpoint- source pollution, a prime source of contaminants. The Rye City Council and the Boards of Trustees of Harrison, Mamaroneck Village, Port Chester and Rye Brook all adopted resolutions endorsing the plan's principles. In addition to providing official support for the plan, the resolutions will enable the communities and the county's Planning Department to seek grants and other funds to put the plan into effect. Nonpoint-source pollution is carried by storm water runoff into the Sound and can include anything that gets into the ground and is washed off by rain and melting snow and ice into streams, ponds and storm sewers. Those pollutants include petroleum, pesticides, antifreeze, road maintenance chemicals, fertilizer and animal waste. Gina D'Agrosa, the county's director of environmental planning, said that the findings of local watershed advisory committees would serve as models for future proposals in obtaining Federal grants and money from the state's Clean Water-Clean Air Act. This year, the county received $3.8 million from the bond act for a demonstration project at the Mamaroneck Sewer District to remove nitrogen and other pollutants going into the Sound. The 1998 allocation also included $34,500 from the bond act to restore native vegetation in a marsh area in Mamaroneck, $50,000 for aquatic plantings to reduce runoff and sediment in one area of New Rochellle and $141,000 to reduce the amount of sediment washing into New Rochelle Harbor. Rob Doscher, a County Planning Department researcher, said the county had also received a $600,000 Federal grant to restore tidal marshes and other wetlands and freshwater streams in the watershed. Among them are the shoals and islands in and around the Echo Bay portion of New Rochelle Harbor. Although severely degraded by the late 1960's, the Bay has experienced a ''modest but encouraging'' colonization by shellfish and smooth cordgrass over the last five years, Mr. Doscher said. Earlier this year, Federal and state officials adopted a 15-year, $650 million plan to upgrade sewage treatment plants along the Connecticut and New York shorelines. Those initiatives are part of the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for the Sound, first approved by state and Federal agencies in 1994. Lisa Holst, a spokeswoman for the division of marine resources for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, said that in Connecticut alone, there has been a 70 percent loss of forests since the 1700's. Throughout the Sound, there has been a 30 percent loss of tidal wetlands. Loss of habitat, the department has shown, means a reduction in an area's natural ability to assimilate pollutants and flush them out. Just how much all of the early efforts are working to improve the water's quality is difficult to know yet, most scientists and researchers agree. Looking at Milton Harbor in Rye, where Mr. Yergeau at Save the Sound has been sampling water every year at six different stations throughout the summer, no pattern of improvement has emerged. ''We will need another decade to chart the long-term progress of our efforts,'' he said. As Mr. Atkins, the president of Save the Sound, said, ''We may have come a long way, but it is clear that we're still not out of the woods.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 211-> CHINA SENTENCES 3 FOR THEIR DISSENT
By sentencing three of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners to long prison terms, China has taken its harshest step yet in its current crackdown on organized political opposition. On Monday, after a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli -- at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy -- was sentenced to 13 years for ''subversion of state power.'' Mr. Xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad. Also sentenced on Monday, to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, the founder of the China Democracy Party, which has now been suppressed. Mr. Wang was tried on subversion charges on Thursday in the eastern city of Hangzhou. A third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, whose trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday, was sentenced today to 12 years, also for subversion, family members said. The Chinese Government was harshly criticized by the State Department, which in turn came under fire by human rights groups for its policy of engagement with China. [Page A6.] The sentences this week came just six months after President Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to move quickly toward political reform. The severe punishments appeared to spell the effective end here of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds of lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months. The sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals in China that Beijing's warming relations with Washington in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring a significant easing of political controls. Mr. Xu was tried on Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence, Mr. Xu stood up and shouted, ''I protest!'' said his wife of 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He and lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were illegitimate. With the sentencing of Mr. Xu, China's Communist Government has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Mr. Xu first came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970's, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. Mr. Qin, too, first became politically active in the late 1970's. He has served 10 years in prison or labor camps. In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out and making constant use of fax machines and E-mail, Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin tried to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants it had signed -- one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil and political rights. In the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings, they continued their activities. Mr. Wang, in contrast, first became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate student in physics in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After the student movement was smashed by the army, he was placed on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent two years in prison. During President Clinton's visit to China in June, Mr. Wang announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around the country, including Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin, began promoting the idea. But while the Government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has not allowed any challenges -- in print or in the form of organized groups -- to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the President and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the party, saying, ''The Western mode of political systems must never be adopted.'' After learning of the sentences on Monday, the American Embassy here, which has spent the last two years building improved relations between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation of what it termed the ''deplorable decisions.'' ''We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,'' the statement said. ''No individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including those guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which China has committed itself.'' Like the trials on Thursday, both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned off by the police or detained, the proceeding on Monday for Mr. Xu showed that in cases involving security issues, the police and courts can write their own rules. According to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but Mr. Xu was told only 4 days ago that his trial would be on Monday. His wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30, was told 3 days ago. Under the law, defendants also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Mr. Xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last week. Before the trial on Monday the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, an associate of Mr. Mo's said. Mr. Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial. ''Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,'' she said this weekend. Responding to the accusations during the Monday trial, Mr. Xu's lawyer argued that Mr. Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, an associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that was clearly preordained, the court declared Mr. Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Mr. Xu was interested in politics even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960's, as an idealistic Marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend a university. He served in the Navy for five years, then became an electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with the democracy movement and going to prison. On Monday afternoon, in a police station hours after the trial finished, Mr. Xu was allowed a half-hour with his wife. ''He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' she later recounted in a telephone interview. ''He said that this would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has happened.'' Ms. He, who has been married to Mr. Xu since 1971, said she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple has a daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston University. In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested on Nov. 30, Ms. He said Mr. Xu had told her, ''I can't change the way I am.'' If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should go on and enjoy her life. ''And if I die,'' Mr. Xu said as they parted that day, ''please plant a tree for me.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 212-> PLUS: TRACK AND FIELD -- EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS; Italians Sweep The Marathon
Stefano Baldini led an Italian sweep in the men's marathon yesterday at the European championships in Budapest. Baldini, 27, made his winning surge with about a half a mile to go to break away from Danilo Goffi. Vincenzo Modica was third. The Italians left Jose Ramon Rey and Alejandro Gomez trailing after 21 miles. The Spaniards had been the only ones capable of staying with the Italians when they broke from the lead pack of 20. Jonathan Edwards, Britain's triple jump world record-holder, needed just one jump to qualify for today's final, although he had to take it twice after he clipped the long-jump launching board, which runs alongside the triple-jump run-up. He then said that he was concerned about his right ankle. Edwards, who won in Zurich 10 days ago, qualified second behind Alexander Glovatskiy of Belarus, who jumped 17.10 meters (a little under 56 feet).

Aug. 23, 1998-> 213-> Sports of The Times; The News Is Out: Popeye Spikes His Spinach
THE long batting practice home runs soar like golf balls and elicit the reactions of a Fourth of July fireworks display. One after another, on his first 11 swings at Shea Stadium Friday night. The Mark McGwire Over America's Fences tour is deep into its fifth month, about to begin a historic last lap. But here, suddenly, comes the potentially myth-debunking news that Popeye supplements his spinach with a testosterone-producing pill. McGwire says he has been taking an over-the-counter substance called androstenedione that is banned in some sports, and now that this little-secret-he-apparently-wasn't-hiding has come out, what are we supposed to make of the fact that there is artificial flavoring inside the Natural? How do we respond to the report that McGwire uses a substance doctors say is the equivalent of a steroid? ''Everybody I know in the game of baseball uses the same stuff I use,'' McGwire told The Associated Press after acknowledging he has -- he says for about a year -- been taking androstenedione, as well as creatine, the more commonly used muscle builder. If he's right, could it be that it's the bodies, not the balls, that are juiced? For the record, McGwire is the only player admitting to using androstenedione. He has also broken no laws, no baseball rules, and it is not as if he was some slap-hitting wimp at any point in his career. He hit 49 home runs as a rookie in 1987. He has for years been a pre-game spectacle. I remember watching him and Jose Canseco play Top This in batting practice a decade ago when the Oakland A's were in Boston and thinking it was one of the best shows in sports. Nonetheless, there were those two strike- and injury-shortened seasons in 1993 and 1994 when McGwire hit a combined 18 home runs in 151 games, when he seemed on an inevitable slide, in need of some career pick-me-up. Since he has passed 30 years of age, he has gone straight to home run heaven, from 39 to 52 to 58 to 52 and counting, after a first-inning shot against the Pirates last night. Now that the 34-year-old Cardinals' slugger has officially announced that Roger Maris has been put on notice, the dissection of McGwire will begin in earnest. Which of the global media conglomerates will be first on the air with the McGwire Channel? All Mark, all the time. The Mets drew close to 100,000 for consecutive doubleheaders with McGwire's Cardinals. The majority weren't there for the wild-card race, or to boo Mike Piazza. At Shea on Friday night, there was an explosion of flash photography on every pitch to McGwire, the first time I have seen that for an athlete not named Jordan. Even the Pirates have sold out consecutive dates this weekend at Pittsburgh's typically roomy Three Rivers Stadium for the first time. If McGwire thought the attention was annoying these last five months, he should know that the Monica Network is about to suffer a serious ratings decline and upon his sturdy shoulders will the country's news media take its Indian Summer ride. McGwire should be rooting hard for Sammy Sosa to stay with him, though that will only be temporary relief, the equivalent of a commercial break, from what he is going to face. ''It's been this way in Houston, Colorado, Chicago,'' Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager, said, soaking in Friday night's batting practice hysteria. ''Unbelievable.'' Of course we would all like to believe that Paul Bunyan has no chemical charge, the way we assume his bat has no hollow center filled with cork. So how do we deal with an issue that has been dutifully avoided as McGwire mounted his home run assault with a body that vaguely resembles the one he once had? It is easy for sports journalists to condemn a cheat like Ben Johnson, or ridicule the dirty cyclists in the Tour de France. This is baseball, not a sport we visit every few years, and this home run quest is one that reaches deep into our childhood souls. Forget for a moment that leaderless baseball hasn't banned this substance the way the National Football League and the Olympics have. When the shot-putter Randy Barnes is found to have used the very same substance and is banned by his sport, we are dismayed because he betrayed the spirit of fair competition. Athletes like Barnes make us ask a question that John Lucas, basketball's drug mentor, raised when we spoke recently about the current enhancement rage in sports. ''How do we know,'' Lucas said, ''if we are watching the athlete or the drug?'' No one wants to question whether McGwire would be closing in on Maris without his bottled helpers. But if we're going to direct them at easier targets, at athletes in sports we don't care too much about, then, yes, there ought to at least be debate about Mark McGwire, too. ''Obviously, if there's more research and it's shown that it's harmful, we'll make people aware,'' a baseball spokesman, Rich Levin, told The Associated Press, referring to androstenedione. It would be something it if were one day banned, and became an asterisk to McGwire's home run record.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 214-> POLITICAL BRIEFING; Nevada Senate Race Is Gaining Importance
From the start, the United States Senate race in Nevada has been rated ''one to watch'' because of the potential vulnerability of the two-term Democratic incumbent, Senator Harry Reid. But if recent polls are on the mark, the contest might well be upgraded to ''one of the most important to watch.'' The surveys indicate that Senator Reid leads his Republican challenger, Representative John Ensign, by only five percentage points or so. Perhaps more politically portentous, the Senator's ''negatives'' in the polls are rising more rapidly than the Representative's. As political pros see the race, Democratic leaders in the Senate should not yet bank on Mr. Reid to help them hold the line against Republican gains this fall. Mr. Ensign is unusually well positioned to fight it out with Mr. Reid on Nevada's key political battleground, Las Vegas, which is where the votes and the dollars are in an otherwise mostly empty state. He hails from the city. Mr. Ensign is a conservative Republican, but not so conservative that he cannot go after some of the moderate Las Vegas Democrats who have been critical to Mr. Reid's election successes. And as for Las Vegas money, particularly the big casino industry money, Mr. Ensign's family is in the gambling business. Nevada has about as many Democrats as Republicans, and that balance is adding to the tightness of the Reid-Ensign contest. In the latest effort to break the race open, both camps, and the national political parties, have begun spending heavily on television advertising, so heavily that the race may end up being the most expensive waged in Nevada. Rather than address issues substantively, many of the ads are negative almost to the point of being mean-spirited. A soundbite from an Ensign ad: ''That old card shark Harry Reid sure talks a good game. Call that card shark Harry Reid. Tell him on taxes and negative ads . . . start dealing straight.' A quotation from a Reid ad: ''Beware. Be careful, Congressman Ensign. This sleazy commercial can come back and bite you.''

Dec. 22, 1998-> 215-> Beijing Presses Manila to Free 20 Fishermen
Relations with the Philippines could be hurt if the country does not soon release 20 Chinese fishermen under arrest here, the Chinese Ambassador, Guan Dengming, warned in transcripts of an interview released today. ''We have sent severe protests to the Philippines to facilitate the release of the Chinese fishermen but nothing has been done so far,'' he said in the interview, with a local reporter on Sunday. ''They are still languishing in jail.'' Mr. Guan did not say what would happen if the Philippines did not release the fishermen. Ambassador Guan was in Zamboanga to meet with the local ethnic Chinese community. A Philippine Navy patrol arrested the 20 fishermen last month and seized their six boats near the Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. The arrests came amid intensified Philippine patrols in the Spratlys following a diplomatic protest over China's expansion of its structures on Mischief Reef.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 216-> POSTINGS: Gwathmey Siegel to Do Building Near U.N.; Architect Set for U.S. Mission
A longterm plan to replace the building that houses the United States Mission to the United Nations with a new and larger one on the same site has taken a step forward with the selection of the architectural firm that will design it. The firm of Gwathmey Siegel Associates of Manhattan was chosen from among 30 entrants in a Design Excellence Program sponsored by the United States General Services Administration, which is responsible for the design and construction of Federal buildings. The United States Mission building is at 799 United Nations Plaza, on the southwest corner of 45th Street and First Avenue. A 12-story structure with 98,000 gross square feet of space, the building is too small to provide for the mission's current needs, said William Jenkins, assistant regional administrator of the General Services Administration. Studies of alternatives began in 1992. The decision ultimately was reached to demolish the building, which was completed in 1961, and replace it with a structure of 141,000 square feet. With the choice of Gwathmey Siegel, contract negotiations will begin; design funding is an item in the Government's fiscal 1999 budget, currently under consideration in Congress. If all goes smoothly, Mr. Jenkins said, demolition of the existing building will start in 2000 -- with employees housed in temporary office quarters in the vicinity -- and a new building will be finished in 2003. Mr. Jenkins said that it was premature to discuss design concepts for the building.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 217-> CABARET REVIEW; Holiday Toast With Oil and Water
The pairing of Claiborne Cary and Phillip Officer at the Garrick Gaities, a cozy new cabaret in the Hotel Mayfair (242 West 49th Street, Manhattan) demonstrates the folly of randomly throwing two performers together and expecting magic. Ms. Cary, a 60-something comedian and singer with a mop of blond hair and the raucous demeanor of the noisiest person at a cocktail party, and Mr. Officer, a starry-eyed romantic with the gee-whiz enthusiasm of a Midwesterner who has just stepped off a Greyhound bus, make an exceedingly odd couple. Although the pair have several duets in their joint show, which plays through New Year's Eve, they fail to connect. Ms. Cary, who can be amusing in a solo context, needs more room than this show allows for her brand of urbane wisecracking to pay off. As her loudmouthed attitude butts up against Mr. Officer's ingenuousness, they are like oil and water. Joining voices on Saturday for ''I Wish I Were in Love Again'' and ''Thanks for the Memory,'' their camaraderie was excruciatingly forced and unconvincing. Mr. Officer fared better than Ms. Cary in his solo numbers, imparting a dewy-eyed intensity to ''I Didn't Know What Time It Was'' and ''My Favorite Year.'' Ms. Cary sidestepped the complicated essences of songs like ''Blizzard of Lies'' and ''Here's to Life,'' and remained content to punch them out with a blunt detachment. When she suddenly injected whimsy into ''As Time Goes By,'' translating the words ''I love you'' into ''I wuv woo,'' it was enough to make you wince.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 218-> Put Your Ad Here
Your fashion feature ''Put Your Ad Here'' (Aug. 2) raised an interesting question: Why should parents spend money ($43 for a Tide jacket, $22.50 for an American Airlines cotton turtleneck, $29.95 for Microsoft overalls) to turn their children into billboards for companies worth billions of dollars? Until corporations treat kids the same way they treat television networks and magazines -- that is, by paying them for advertising space -- I can't see why children should promote their products.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 219-> ARTS ABROAD; The Mystique of the Maya With a Subtle Difference
Of the many empires and cultures that flourished in pre-conquest Mesoamerica, the Maya have enjoyed the best press. The European travelers who rediscovered their ruined cities imagined them idealistically as a spiritual, artistic and pacific people. They were, it was said, the Greeks to the Aztecs' Romans. To this day, their majestic temples at Palenque, Uxmal, Chichen Izta and Tikal are among the most admired pre-Columbian sites. ''The Maya,'' an exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi here through May 16, confirms their privileged status. The Fiat-owned gallery on the Grand Canal has previously organized thematic blockbusters on the Phoenicians, the Celts and the Western Greeks. But this is the first time it has put the spotlight on a non-European civilization, bringing together 600 objects and artifacts from 40 museums in Mexico, Central America, the United States and Europe. Yet what makes this show different -- it also calls itself the ''most comprehensive and most meticulous presentation of Maya culture to date'' -- is that profiting from epigraphic and archeological breakthroughs of recent years, ''The Maya'' has been able to go beyond stereotypical images of the people and their art to show the workings of their society and religion in a more complex and subtle light. The organizers remain humble. ''Today we know much more about these peoples,'' Mercedes de la Garza, a Mexican expert, writes in an introduction to the catalogue, itself a remarkable compendium of current Maya scholarship. ''But this does not mean that we have the absolute truth and that the 21st century will not reject many of our interpretations, just as we have discarded those of the 18th and 19th centuries.'' Still, one fundamental reading of the Maya has not been challenged. It is that they had a cosmic vision of life, one that conceived their gods, nature and man as inseparable (with the first humans born of the sacred corn). Thus, their entire existence was dictated by religious beliefs, with their study of astronomy and mathematics, their social and political organization, their artistic creation and even their wars all a function of their faith. Yet scholars believe they have recently learned much that is new about each of these facets of Maya life. Turning their focus from the gods toward the people, they have begun investigating everyday life, settlement patterns, farming practices and relations between different Maya city-states and between the sprawling Maya region (covering today's southern and southeast Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and part of Honduras and El Salvador) and other important ethnic groups, notably the Olmecs and Toltecs. As a result, the Palazzo Grassi has chosen not to follow the more traditional approach of presenting the Maya chronologically through their three identifiable periods: Pre-Classic (1800 B.C. to A.D. 250), Classic (A.D. 250 to 900) and Post-Classic (A.D. 900 to 1524). This approach also tends to emphasize the so-called collapse of the Maya Empire in the late Post-Classic era, when many great urban centers of the Yucatan Peninsula were abandoned for mountain and jungle refuges. Instead, the exhibition is displayed through themes that explore different aspects of Maya life. First, in the atrium, it presents monumental works too heavy to be shown elsewhere. These include a large stele representing a ruling lord from the Calakmul site in southeast Mexico and an ornate altar portraying a feathered serpent from Copan in Honduras. More familiar is Chichen Itza's ''Chac-mool,'' a stone figure in a reclining position with a tray on its stomach for sacrificial offerings. The exhibition proper opens with the Maya and their relationship to nature, with fish, animals and insects portrayed delightfully on ceramic plates and in ceramic and stone sculptures, including one of a turkey, which is native to the Americas. Many of these objects date from the Classic period, when Maya artistry was at its most delicate. The show then turns to the urban environment and social organization of the Maya, illustrated with different examples of temple decoration, jade sculptures and jewelry found in tombs and stone statues and painted ceramic vessels suggesting clothes and ornaments worn by important local personalities. Some of the most touching ceramic figures are the smallest, many from Jaina Island off Campeche, among them one just seven inches high showing what appears to be an orator in full voice. Special emphasis is given to the section dealing with everyday life. Once again, the story is told through ceramic and stone objects found at Maya sites, but now it dwells on hunting, fishing, cooking and weaving. A stone metate, used to grind corn into a soft dough in the late Classic period, is similar to those used to prepare corn tortillas in Mexico today. Where the exhibition sometimes falters is in linking the objects on display with the Maya sites where they originated, making it more difficult for visitors who have not traveled there to imagine grandiose pyramid cities, often hidden by jungle. But some amends have been made by a reconstruction of one of the rooms from the Bonampak Maya site with frescoes of battle scenes offering an inkling of what can be found in situ. The second part of the show addresses spiritual aspects of the Maya, although it is now thought that Maya lords also associated themselves with the gods to enhance their earthly powers. The gods themselves are portrayed in myriad forms, sometime as fertility figures, other times as warriors, often as birds. The religious ballgame called pelota, in which the ball, like the sun, was to be kept in permanent motion, is illustrated by two small figures from Jaina Island showing ball players in action. The Palazzo Grassi has also benefited from progress made in recent years in understanding both the glyphic writing and numbers used by the Maya, and it offers a quick lesson in how they worked. The Maya's grasp of mathematics and astronomy was particularly noteworthy: they invented the concept of zero a millennium before it was introduced in Western civilization, while their numerous calendars included one of 365 days. More alarmingly, they calculated that the Maya era began on August 11, 3114 BC, and will end on Dec. 21, 2012. On the other hand, such is the strength of Maya culture that it is no more likely to disappear 14 years hence than it was after Hernan Cortes sent Francisco de Montejo to the Yucatan in 1527 to complete the conquest that he had begun in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan six years earlier. Much of the area was subjugated by 1546, but one mountain region to the south held out until 1697. Even then, the fashionable pacific image of the Maya seemed out of place. There were sporadic Indian uprisings until, in 1847, a broad Maya rebellion known as the Caste War erupted in the Yucatan. (With Mexico itself in disarray at the time, the besieged elite of Merida even offered to become an American colony in exchange for protection against the Maya.) The uprising was eventually put down with huge loss of life, although some Maya communities were not pacified until 1900. More significantly, despite hardship and loss of land, Maya culture survives today, through the languages, costumes, social organization and religious practices of more than a score of ethnic groups in Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas and in Guatemala. Perhaps the link between these peoples and the exhibition in Venice may at times seem tenuous, yet the new rebellion launched by the Zapatista National Liberation Front in Chiapas on Jan. 1, 1994, would suggest that, 500 years after the Spanish Conquest, a Maya identity remains intact.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 220-> PRO FOOTBALL; Conway Competing With Hall For Jet Job
Brett Conway took to the practice field as a Jet for the first time today, exuding confidence. But John Hall, who once seemed to be the team's kicker for the new millennium, seemed to be distracted. Conway became a Jet on Friday after Hall produced a disastrous performance against the Giants on Thursday night: three straight squib kickoffs, a missed extra point, a blown 37-yard field goal that went so far left, it looked like a foul pop into the third-base seats. Hall is still a Jet, but Conway will handle all the kicks during Friday night's preseason finale at Chicago. Hall will essentially have to not merely boot the ball into the end zone consistently, but also show Coach Bill Parcells he can be successful on 75 percent of his field-goal attempts. Conway was one of the best kickers in college during his Penn State career. His final boot for Penn State came in the closing seconds against Michigan State in 1996 and lifted the Nittany Lions into the Fiesta Bowl. ''I've been reading that a lot of people think he's got a stronger leg,'' Conway said when asked about Hall. ''We'll see. I had five preseason kickoffs and three were touchbacks.'' Hall, meanwhile, declined to meet with reporters today. As he entered the cafeteria at Hofstra University, he was swinging a key chain. When he saw a clutch of reporters gathered on the other side of the automatic doors, he began to nervously swing the chain furiously. The doors closed on him as he went through them. He was unhurt. ''I'm not worried about anything,'' Hall said of the kicking situation. He then said he would be back for interviews after lunch. Instead, he left through a back door. Conway's route from Green Bay to the Jets isn't so surprising considering that the Jets and the Packers have been involved in two other trades in the last year. The Packers' general manager, Ron Wolf, and Parcells are not only longtime admirers of each other's football acumen, but also neighbors in Florida. And Parcells rated Conway as the best college football kicker available in last year's draft. Wolf, however, drafted him in the third round. ''They pretty much handed me the job last year,'' Conway said. ''Drafting a guy in the third round and not signing your kicker of eight years.'' The Pack had dropped Chris Jacke. But Conway suffered a quadriceps injury. ''I never got back on track,'' he said. ''I kicked too much the next week.'' Ryan Longwell became the Packers' kicker and Conway sat out the season. In this year's camp, Conway said, ''the last couple of weeks I was kicking really well.'' But he could not unseat Longwell. ''I don't look at it as not making the Packers,'' Conway said. ''They were going to get a draft choice for either one of us, whoever they traded.'' Conway will be working with an inexperienced holder, punter Nick Gallery, as was Hall. Gallery replaced Brian Hansen, who was traded to the Packers last Monday. When Hansen held for Hall last year, the kicker was successful on 27 of 36 field-goal attempts -- or 75 percent. But when quarterback Glenn Foley held, Hall was a 20 percent kicker, hitting only 1 of 5 field goals. Before leaving Green Bay, Conway had a conversation with Wolf about Parcells. Then the kicker met the Jets coach. ''He said, 'You've heard stories about me, I'm sure,' '' Conway said, adding that he replied, ''Yes, sir, I have.'' EXTRA POINTS Among eight players the Jets cut today was quarterback CHUCK CLEMENTS. That saddened RAY LUCAS, who was battling Clements for the third-string job. ''You're supposed to feel happy,'' Lucas said. ''But he helped me the most last year. It was good and terrible. You say, 'I made it,' but then somebody else didn't make it.'' Coach BILL PARCELLS said he had chosen the versatile Lucas because ''Ray brings something different to the table than the other two quarterbacks'' -- GLENN FOLEY and VINNY TESTAVERDE. As the Jets got down to 64 players -- they must reach 60 by Tuesday -- the others cut were: defensive tackle SHANNON BROWN, center J. R. CONRAD, cornerback CEDRIC DONALDSON, wide receivers JASON GRAHAM and ALONZO JOHNSON, linebacker JOHN MUNCH and tackle DERON THORPE. None were draft choices. . . . Foley collaborated 6 times for 99 yards with wide receiver KEYSHAWN JOHNSON in Thursday's 27-23 victory over the Giants. ''Keyshawn has made a lot of strides this year,'' Foley said. ''He ran real good routes and made their cornerbacks look bad. People got a good glimpse of when Keyshawn's on, how good the offense can be.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 221-> Ruble Down, Prices Up: A Russian City Flinches
It has been a long time since anyone in this pretty but forlorn city on the Oka River in central Russia heard any good economic news. Local industrial and agricultural production has dropped 22 percent in the last four years. Doctors, teachers and most factory workers have not been paid in months and their salaries, when they get them, are on the average a paltry $110 a month. Bad news, on the other hand, arrives regularly. And this week, while the ruble tumbled, it was coming in by the truckful as shipments of imported goods pulled up to Kaluga's crowded street market with prices on Turkish jackets, Polish boots and Korean blankets already as much as 10 percent higher. In the circumstances, what is a Kaluga street vendor to do? ''We have raised our prices a little, but there is so much competition we can't raise them too high,'' said Oleg, 34, who left his job at a local military plant four years ago to try his hand at selling shoes. ''If you raise them too high,'' added Oleg, who would not give his last name, ''people won't buy because they just don't have the money.'' As the value of the ruble fell after the Russian Government's sudden shift in economic policy, people here in Kaluga, 100 miles south of Moscow, were poised for the worst. Many flocked to the local offices of Russia's Government-backed savings bank, some to withdraw funds, others to switch their accounts from rubles to dollars, which, to their relief, they discovered they could do. Still others found refuge in jewelry shops. Only a few managed to exchange rubles to dollars before local currency offices were shut down early Monday afternoon. Four days after the crisis hit, early signs of panic had subsided. When the currency offices reopened on Wednesday, the ruble was trading at roughly 7.9 to the dollar, a drop of 15 percent from last week's levels, but less than the 30 percent plunge some had feared. Prices were going up, but in a country where everyone, including the the Government and the banks, is running out of money, that does not necessarily mean inflation; it just means people are going to have to do with even less than the little they have. ''In Russia, it is just a matter of survival,'' said Lena Petrukhina, 27, who sells shoes in a tent next to Oleg. ''Right now, things are very tense. I don't see how it will get any better, if it ever does get better. '' For most people in Kaluga, this week has been just another chapter in a crisis that dates from 1991, to the collapse of Communism and of a way of life that was, if nothing else, secure. Since then, they have lived through worse: the soaring inflation of the early 1990's utterly wiped out people's Soviet-era savings. This time, their savings accounts have remained secure -- at least for now. What has made this week's events so painful, and so bitter, was the reminder that the seven-year crisis is not over, not by a long shot. A year ago, the Kaluga regional government thought that by 1999 the region would be on the threshold of economic growth. Last week, its expectations, already lowered, were that the economy next year would stay at 1998 levels. By the end of this week, Maksim Akimov, deputy director of the region's economic department, was predicting things would only get worse. Mr. Akimov, 28, is not so worried about inflation, or the value of the ruble, which he, like many others, now believes will be held at more or less its current level by the Central Bank. His worries are about the freeze on capital investment, domestic and foreign, that this region of 1.1 million sorely needs to pull itself out of its economic mess. ''The main problem is how debt crisis affects investments,'' he said. ''The reaction of capital markets will be, 'Better not to even touch Russia,' and who can blame them? If I were an investor, I would take my money and run.'' Like so much of Russia, the Kaluga region was heavily dependent on the military-industrial complex, which here, as elsewhere, has sunk into terminal depression. Factories that once employed 14,000 now employ 4,000 and those that still have jobs have seen paychecks buried in a mountain of backed-up debt, starting with $34 million that the Russian Defense Ministry still owes the region for unpaid orders. ''I can name you 10 factories in the whole region that pay their workers on time,'' said Yuri Rastorguyev, business manager at the local government newspaper Vest. ''So you can understand, if people haven't gotten their salaries in six months, and they raise prices, where does that leave them? Basically, the system is in total collapse.'' Yet people do survive, or as Denis Skyanik, a 25-year-old violinist, noted, ''Nobody is going to die of hunger.'' In his case, he supplements his 300-ruble monthly salary from the Kaluga Orchestra by playing on a street corner, weather permitting. He also plays at parties. ''Russians like to drink and have fun,'' he said. ''So that business will always be there.'' To make ends meet, Igor Babichev, editor of a private financial newspaper that by his own admission makes no money, sold shoes, imported Spanish wine and dabbled in real estate before settling on a side business of campaign consulting. ''Everybody here has a hobby,'' he said almost cheerily, ''and no one will tell you how much they earn.'' Getting a handle on Kaluga's economy is one the lcoal government's next orders of business. According to Mr. Akimov, traders on the Kaluga street markets will soon be required to install cash registers, to issue sales slips and to pay a single simplified tax. ''For some people, it will make life easier,'' he said, ''but there is no doubt it will be a lot harder for those who aren't paying any taxes, and they are many.'' The drop in the value of the ruble could prove a boon for local industries that produce consumer products, from building materials to food processing, Mr. Akimov said. But such industries account for only 13 percent of local production, another harsh legacy from the Soviet era, and many of those have done little to adapt to a market economy. As it is, Kaluga gets 40 percent of its food and 70 percent of its consumer goods from abroad, a fact that many see as an example of their economic humiliation. ''Before, in Soviet times, people had money, but they had nothing to buy,'' said Aleksei Slabov, a political commentator for the newspaper Vest. ''Now they can buy anything they want, but they have no money. Basically, it comes to the same thing. Nothing has changed.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 222-> Top Dissident Gets 13 Years After Trial In Beijing
After a three-hour trial, the most prominent democracy advocate remaining in China was sentenced to 13 years in prison today on charges of seeking to overthrow the state. The harsh sentence for Xu Wenli, 55, who previously spent 12 years in prison for peacefully advocating democratic change, showed the firm determination of the Communist Government to stamp out a new democratic political party Mr. Xu had promoted, and any other effort to organize alternative political groups. After the judgment was announced, Mr. Xu condemned the sentence as ''political persecution,'' according to a person from the court-appointed law firm that had been given just four days to put together a defense. The person from the law firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Xu initially said he did not want to appeal the verdict. On Friday, two other men who promoted the new political party, Wang Youcai, 32, and Qin Yongmin, 45, were also tried on subversion charges, but results have not been announced. Like the Friday trials -- both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys -- today's proceeding showed that in cases involving security issues, the police and courts can write their own rules. According to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but Mr. Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be today. His wife -- who has not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30 -- was told only three days ago of the trial date. Defendants also have a legal right to a lawyer of their choice but Mr. Xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last week. Before this morning's trial the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, only saw his client for one brief meeting, his associate said. Mr. Xu's wife, He Xintong, refused to meet the lawyer herself, saying he could not possibly mount an effective defense. ''Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,'' she said in a telephone interview this weekend. The person from the defense lawyer's office said prosecutors had dwelled this morning on three issues: that Mr. Xu had in statements to foreign journalists and others called for independent trade unions; that he had accepted money from foreign hostile forces, and that he had been active in organizing the China Democratic Party. The defense argued that Mr. Xu had been peacefully expressing his own views and that they did not amount to subversive activities against the state. But the court quickly declared Mr. Xu guilty and is sending him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. -------------------- Activist Freed and Exiled BEIJING, Dec. 20 (Reuters) China freed a prominent labor activist and sent him and his family into exile in the United States today, apparently in an effort to deflect international criticism on the eve of Mr. Xu's trial. The activist, Liu Nianchun, 50, left for New York with his wife and 11-year-old daughter, human rights groups and the state media said. The official Xinhua news agency quoted a Justice Ministry spokesman as saying that Mr. Liu was released on medical parole ''taking into consideration his behavior at the center for education through labor and his health.'' Mr. Liu, who tried to set up independent labor unions, was arrested in 1995 and sentenced without trial to three years in a labor camp for drafting a petition calling for an official reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The term was later extended, again without judicial process. Mr. Liu was tortured and denied food and water after he protested the extension and suffers from high blood pressure and intestinal problems, the New York-based Human Rights in China said. -------------------- Dissident Arrives in New York Mr. Liu, dressed in a double-breasted suit and looking underweight, arrived at Kennedy International Airport with his family around 9:30 last night to a warm welcome from about 30 people. Although he said through an interpreter that he was glad to have arrived safely, he added, ''It's very sad that the Chinese Government uses hostage politics and their own citizens to bargain with the U.S.'' Mr. Liu's older brother, Liu Qing, a former dissident who was deported to the United States in 1992 and is now chairman of Human Rights in China, said Liu Nianchun ''used to be very healthy and strong,'' but now ''looks older than I do,'' adding, ''This is what you have to be prepared to accept in the human rights struggle.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 223-> 'Street Furniture Stuck in Gridlock'
To the Editor: Your article ''Street Furniture Designs Stuck in Gridlock'' [Aug. 9] bemoans the loss to the city of beautiful new bus shelters, newsstands and street toilets because of the Mayor's cancellation of the Coordinated Street Furniture Project. But it does not have to be a loss, especially when it comes to newsstands. The Mayor was absolutely correct in stopping the project. The contract was much too big, lasted too long, was too intrusive into individual newsstand operators' businesses and, ultimately, was not needed. New York City is not Kansas. Why have 300 newsstands that look exactly alike? Once the City Council later this month repeals the balance of the C.S.F.P. laws, as is expected, we can move forward. And there is a solution, one that is easy to implement, will result in new newsstands in only a matter of months. It empowers the mom and pop operators rather than forcing them into subservience as the C.S.F.P. would have done, and it does not require the city to enter into a huge contract with a single company invariably represented by government insiders. Simply allow the current newsstand operators -- who own their newsstands and paid to build them -- to individually contract with any qualified company to replace their existing old structures with beautiful new ones, in exchange for the same advertising rights that the city was prepared to give under the C.S.F.P. And the city can share the advertising revenue with the newsstand operators. The right of individual businesses to contract with a qualified company of their choice is exactly the approach the city has taken with advertising on public telephones. By giving the newsstand operators an economic incentive to replace their old newsstands and the freedom to choose whom to work with, everyone wins. The operator gets a new structure that will meet the needs of his particular newsstand business, the city gets the same advertising revenue it would have received under the C.S.F.P., the public gets a variety of new well-maintained newsstands and the publishers get a new generation of street newsstands from which their newspapers and magazines are sold. And all of this without any controversy. Why not give it a chance? ROBERT S. BOOKMAN Counsel, New York City Newsstand Operators Association Manhattan

Every action has a reaction. The newest men's shirt collars, which are wider and longer, demand a chunky knot, so along come beefy neckties of wool and cashmere fabrics, many in suiting patterns like herringbone and plaid. Allan Flusser makes a blue herringbone cashmere tie ($125) and a wool blend tie with diagonal stripes ($120). Ermenegildo Zegna has a gray cashmere tie with a green silk grid pattern ($110), and Giorgio Armani has solid wool ties in pale or charcoal gray ($131). All are at Saks Fifth Avenue. Barneys New York has a textured gray cashmere tie ($78) with the store label; Luciano Barbera's cashmere plaid ($125) and brown wool ties with diagonal beige stitching ($98); Gucci's brown wool with a camel grid ($105), and Drake's tiny chevron in wool ($88). For someone in the Christmas spirit, there's a whimsical red wool tie with a pattern of tiny deer and trees by Holland & Holland ($98 at Saks).

Dec. 21, 1998-> 225-> Uganda's Helping Hand to Congo Rebels Raises Questions About Motives
There is a certain touchiness among Ugandan soldiers posted here in Congo about what they are doing in the middle of someone else's rebellion. ''We are just with our friends -- no problems,'' one soldier at the airport said. ''People should not tell you lies that Uganda is fighting the war,'' said Balam, 25, a second lieutenant who uses only one name, as he sped away down a jungle road in a pickup truck. ''We are just peacekeepers.'' But four months into the war in Congo -- which has drawn soldiers from at least seven nations and has defied solution at every round of peace talks -- things do not seem quite that tidy. While Ugandan officials say they are not engaged in fighting, the nation's huge military presence here, the center of its operations in Congo, has become routine, with near-daily flights carrying men, food and materiel. Uganda says that its only real interest is the security of its border from attack by rebel militias based in Congo. Yet rumors abound here of deals in gold, and dealers in diamonds talk about a mysterious Belgian who they believe is buying lots of them on Ugandans' behalf. ''What are they doing 1,000 kilometers from the border if this is a question of security?'' a priest here asked of both Uganda and Rwanda, the two nations that are supporting the rebellion. ''This is not a problem of security. This is another problem.'' The priest's words were echoed last week with a skepticism that Uganda's president, Yoweri K. Museveni -- an ally of many Western nations, especially the United States -- is unused to hearing from foreign friends. At a meeting in Uganda of rich nations that give money to poor ones, the European Union released a statement recognizing Uganda's ''legitimate security concerns'' in Congo. ''At the same time,'' the statement said, ''it is doubtful that the current level of military presence and activity up to 700 kilometers away from the Ugandan border serve that purpose.'' What, exactly, Uganda is doing in Congo seems to be a bit of a mystery even to Uganda itself, if one takes the nation's leaders on their word. But the general contours are clear: since August, Uganda has lodged its presence deep into its neighbor's territory, aside a group of rebels and Rwandan soldiers seeking to overthrow the Congolese President, Laurent Kabila. Only last year, Uganda and Rwanda helped Mr. Kabila to take power in a similar war. No one wept then for Mobutu Sese Seko, for 32 years the dictator of what was then known as Zaire. This time, though, there is no pretense that Uganda and Rwanda are not key players -- to the point that at least four other African nations have intervened against them. All four accuse Uganda and Rwanda of invading another sovereign nation. As diplomats around the world worry that a full-scale regional war is boiling over in Africa, Uganda protests that this is a war it did not want but has been unable to avoid. ''We are not there voluntarily,'' said Amama Mbabazi, the Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of regional cooperation. ''We are forced by circumstances to be there.'' He said that relations between Uganda and Congo had been souring because Mr. Kabila did not control rebels who initiate attacks into Uganda from the other side of the Congo border. Since last spring, 1,500 Ugandan troops have been stationed inside Congo, flushing out these fighters with the help of Congolese soldiers. In August, Mr. Mbabazi said, those same Congolese soldiers started the rebellion against Mr. Kabila. ''When they mutinied, what could we do?'' Mr. Mbabazi asked. ''Either we had to continue with them or maybe fight them.'' Critics of Mr. Museveni, and many admirers, say this is not the whole story. But many outside officials and experts says Rwanda was the prime mover behind the rebellion because of its own deeper border worries, in which the forces that carried out the 1994 mass killings there have been launching their own attacks from Congo into Rwanda. Uganda, under this theory, went along with the rebellion because it thought Mr. Kabila would fall easily. He did not, largely because Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad rushed to his defense. Two questions muddy Uganda's protests that its involvement in Congo is limited and reluctant. The first is the extent to which its well-trained and disciplined army is actually fighting the war. The second is how much Uganda's commercial interests, which have grown since Mr. Kabila came to power, play a role. Neither question can be answered with certainty. On the issue of fighting, outside experts are divided as to whether Ugandans are the main force pushing in the northwest along the Congo River toward the capital, Kinshasa, or whether their role is merely advisory. There have been no reports of Ugandan soldiers dying in Congo. But there are thousands of Ugandan soldiers in Congo, perhaps 6,000 or more, and there is much speculation that Uganda helped create a second rebel force northwest of here led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, the son of one of Congo's richest men. Uganda says its troops only operate in the same areas as Mr. Bemba, but they do not seem to have made any efforts to stop him. The question of commercial interests is complicated because of Congo's great wealth in natural resources and the assumption that every outside force is fighting for some piece. During the last several years, Ugandan traders have opened up a growing market in eastern Congo, selling beer, soap, salt and household goods. But the charges that some in Uganda are happy to fight the war because it opens up the path to gold and diamonds are raising more questions for Mr. Museveni. In September, a plane crashed in the Ruwenzori mountains, along the two countries' mutual border, carrying a Ugandan colonel, several gold traders and business associates of Mr. Museveni's brother, Salim Saleh, a general in the Ugandan Army. Here in Kisangani, diamond traders described a Belgian buyer named Filippe, who has visited at least twice since August, demanding low prices as one of the few foreigners in town. Elumbu Kalokola Kennedy, the president of the dealers' association and a supporter of the rebellion, said the assumption is that Filippe operates on behalf of Ugandan business interests. Whatever Uganda's mix of interests, the soldiers themselves are popular here, though the rebellion itself is not. For all the hostility to Rwandan soldiers, whom local residents accuse of looting and killings here during the last rebellion, Ugandan soldiers are regarded as polite and well behaved. They pay their hotel bills, while the Palm Beach Hotel here is still trying to collect $75,000 from the Congolese rebels. But people say that with all Congo has to offer, they doubt that anyone's motives are pure. Congo, said Louis Kembo, 42, a businessman here, is ''very rich.'' ''Once you taste it, you find it is very nice,'' he said. ''You can't leave it.''

Summer can bring out the most memorable in corporate gamesmanship -- not the backstabbing kind, but those company-sponsored sporting events that can be a lot of laughs in spite of, or maybe because of, the players they attract. There are three-mile runs that appeal to hard-charging Type A's and softball games that sometimes draw the far less athletic. And, of course, some competitions get way too competitive.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 227-> BASEBALL; Henderson Leads Off With Optimism
On Friday, he will turn 40, an age when most baseball players have long ago said goodbye to the game and when the few remaining old-timers are icing their aching muscles more, playing less and trying to hang on to fat salaries. Not Rickey Henderson, soon to start his 21st major league season, this one as the Mets' new left fielder and leadoff man. He is, as General Manager Steve Phillips said, ''arguably the best leadoff hitter in the history of the game.'' At a news conference yesterday at Shea Stadium, the Mets introduced Henderson, casually elegant in a plum-colored wool suit; gray, figured shirt (no tie) with R.H. embroidered on the cuffs, beige leather-and-snake loafers and a standard-issue Mets cap. He said he was dedicated to pulling the Mets out of the shadow of the champion Yankees. ''I'm hoping I'll change the Mets' image,'' Henderson said. ''I can create runs. I steal bases. I make things happen. We have guys like Mike Piazza who want to be with a winning team, so I'm hopeful we can get good.'' Having added Piazza in a midseason blockbuster deal, then picked up Bobby Bonilla and Robin Ventura during the off season in addition to Henderson, the Mets are hopeful that they can improve on their 88 victories last season. Henderson's achievements with his hometown Oakland Athletics, the Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays, the San Diego Padres and the Anaheim Angels have him on course for the Hall of Fame. He is the career leader in stolen bases (1,297). He ranks third in walks (1,890), sixth in runs (2,014), 29th in games played (2,612), 30th in at-bats (9,473) and 52d in hits (2,678). If he stays healthy, the next two years could send him past Babe Ruth (2,056) and Ted Williams (2,019) in walks and Ruth and Henry Aaron (both 2,174), Pete Rose (2,165) and Willie Mays (2,062) in runs. ''I think that's what keeps you going,'' Henderson said. But even he is amazed at his longevity. ''When I was 20, 24,'' he said, ''I just wanted to last five years. I've always said age doesn't make a difference.'' After last season, when he batted a career-low .236 for the A's, he became a free agent. He said three or four clubs wanted him, but he picked the Mets because he felt they were on the rise. He signed a one-year contract for $1.8 million. The Mets hold an option that will guarantee him $2 million for the year 2000 if he makes 500 plate appearances in 1999. If not, there is a $500,000 buyout. He made 670 plate appearances this year and will have the same opportunity because he will be the Mets' starting left fielder. And, he warned, do not write this off as his final contract. ''A couple of years ago,'' he said, ''I said I might play to 50. I don't have any idea how long I can play. If I still love the game and if I stay healthy, there is no limit.'' Still, he bemoaned that baseball has changed. ''Now it's more business than family,'' he said. ''We used to care about one another and could stay with one club longer. Now you don't know where you're going to be. You do whatever you can do for your club, and the next day you may be gone.'' Henderson is gone from Oakland, where he spent most of his career. Meanwhile, the Mets were concerned that they stole only 62 bases last season. (Henderson alone stole 66). And their leadoff batters combined stole only 15 bases, with an on-base percentage of .321. They started looking for help. ''We saw some who could steal but not get on base,'' Phillips said, ''some who could get on base but couldn't steal.'' Then there was Henderson. ''He might have lost a step,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said, ''but he has the ability to make havoc.'' Some of that havoc was obvious last season, when Henderson, a right-handed batter, led the major leagues in walks (118) and stolen bases. Some was hidden in esoteric statistics that showed he also led the majors in pitches per at-bat (4.43) and pitches seen (2,903). In other words, he made pitchers work hard, he got on base often, he stole his way into scoring position and he scored often. ''I don't look for walks,'' he said. ''I like to go deep in the count so the other guys can see what the pitcher is doing. When I played in San Diego, the National League pitchers were new and I took more pitches. But then you get in a rut and you've got to be more aggressive. If my team needs me to be on base more, I'll take pitches. If the team is hitting, I won't.'' Desire, he said, is a key to base-stealing. ''You have to want to steal a base,'' he said. ''Some guys get caught and won't run the next 50 times. I can get caught nine times in a row, but I keep trying and I can make the 10th.'' He said there was no mystery to his success. ''I've never lost my desire,'' he said. ''I still love the game. I don't think anything is left now in this game for me but to be a winner. The best thing is to be a winner. The worst thing is losing.'' To maximize Henderson's effectiveness, the Mets must find an ideal No. 2 batter. Valentine said that Edgardo Alfonzo was the probable choice, with occasional switches to John Olerud, Ventura and Brian McRae. To Henderson, it's all the same. ''Bobby hasn't told me who's going to bat second,'' Henderson said, ''but he's going to have a great year, whoever it is.'' INSIDE PITCH The Mets signed PAT MAHOMES, a former major league pitcher, to a minor league contract yesterday and said they would invite him to spring training. Mahomes, a right-hander, pitched six seasons for the Minnesota Twins and Boston Red Sox, with a 21-29 record and a 5.88 earned run average in 135 games (51 starts). Last season, he pitched for the Yokohama Baystars of the Japanese League, where he was 0-4 with a 5.98 e.r.a. . . . The Mets also signed Jody Treadwell, another right-hander, to a minor league contract and will place him on the roster of their Class AAA Norfolk team in the International League. Treadwell pitched seven seasons in the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization before playing last season in Taiwan.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 228-> Struggling To Bring Back The Glitter; Today, the Diamond District Is More Crass Than Class. Can It Survive? Solomon Gad's Offspring May Hold a Clue.
THE Orthodox Jewish men in the broad-brimmed black hats stopped talking business long enough to turn their heads and stare. It wasn't that the sight of women in the Diamond Dealers Club was such an oddity, but five women walking through together was somewhat unusual, particularly one in such a short skirt with such long legs. That was Nicole Hendelman, 26, who had come to the club to have lunch with her mother and three aunts in the kosher restaurant, where white cloths cover cafeteria-style tables, and meat and milk cannot be served together. Nicole's grandfather, Solomon Gad, the 74-year-old family patriarch, was treating. That it was Ms. Hendelman's first time in the club was surprising, given that her entire family is in the diamond industry, that she has been designing jewelry since she graduated from Syracuse University and that many young people starting out in the business use the club's trading floor to make contacts, a kind of temporary office as they become more established. While much of New York's diamond industry remains a closed, male-dominated network concentrated on a single block -- 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas -- Ms. Hendelman seems very much at home there and confident about her prospects. ''You need a big mouth,'' she said. ''And I definitely have one.'' Perhaps aggressiveness, and the optimism that comes with youth, are essential. But the city's diamond industry, which handles more than 90 percent of the diamonds that come into this country, has also changed over the last 20 years, opening up to a younger generation, a wide variety of ethnic groups -- Indians, Russians, Koreans -- as well as to more women. The city has also made a concerted effort to address the tarnished reputation of the diamond district, long thought of as a teeming, disreputable bazaar where wide-eyed suitors in the market for engagement rings are easy marks for high-pressure hucksters. Last year, Mayor Giuliani designated the area a business improvement district, allowing it to assess some 2,600 business owners nominal dues -- landlords pay 25 cents per square foot -- for uniformed security officers on foot patrol from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. every day but Sunday, street cleaning and new lights. These capital improvements began just last week with the repair and expansion of the curbing and the pouring of glittering concrete. The work is due to conclude by Christmas, with the installation of diamond-shaped illuminated pylons that will be suspended at the corners of the district to create two twinkling gateways. ''It will enhance the look of the street,'' said Terrence Clark, the executive director of the BID, ''and be fitting of what the diamond district stands for, which is glamour and sparkle.'' People who work in the district say security has already increased. ''It's a kinder, gentler place,'' said Eli Hass, who runs a diamond-cutting import-export business, E.N.H. International. ''The security has improved so markedly in the last five, seven years.'' Mr. Hass was recently re-elected to a second two-year term as president of the Diamond Dealers Club, which offers its 1,800 members a 35,000-square-foot trading floor at 580 Fifth Avenue in which to meet one another and to buy and sell gemstones. Those in the diamond industry say these improvements, coupled with a strong economy, have made their field increasingly attractive to young people who once might have rejected it as cloistered, unscrupulous or both. Mr. Hass said he hoped to attract more young people with an apprentice scholarship training program, which he is starting in the next month or so, to teach diamond cutting to those who want to go into the business but don't have family connections. ''The industry has opened up in many, many ways,'' said Mr. Hass, who was recently elected vice president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, an international association of diamond organizations. ''It was a very mysterious type of industry, and the only ones who came into the industry were people who had family in the business. These days, all kinds of people come in.'' Ms. Hendelman is someone who has benefited from the industry's new openness to women and young people, as well as from a family that is well known throughout the industry. Many of her relatives in the business are women, who have tried to protect her from some of the struggles they went through and helped pave the way. Of the seven children born to her grandfather, Mr. Gad, a longtime diamond dealer, six are women, all of whom have worked or are working in the district. They are not the street-level retailers many shoppers associate with the district, the ones who preside over counters full of pricey stones while outside neon signs blink ''Buy and Sell.'' They are the people behind the scenes, wholesalers in office towers several floors above the stores who buy, sell and cut diamonds, and design and manufacture diamond and other jewelry. Nicole Hendelman and her mother, Ruth, work on the 24th floor of 580 Fifth Avenue, known as the Diamond Building. The Diamond Dealers Club is on the 11th floor. Mr. Gad works down the hall from it. Osnat Gad, 51, the eldest child, works a few floors down, running her own business importing colored stones and manufacturing wedding bands. A sister, Zipora Eisenberg, 50, works one block up with her husband, Larry, who specializes in emeralds. Her twin sisters, 45, both work for their brother, Isaac Gad, 33, in a building across the street: Ahuva Nazarian as an office manager, and Dalia Gad, in sales. The youngest sister, Liza Rosenthal, 36, used to work for her father but is now home on Long Island raising her three children. ''Most of what we call the wholesale diamond trade is vertical in the sense that it's upstairs,'' Mr. Hass said. Strides, Yes, but the Path Has Not Been Smooth Ruth Hendelman, 48, a compact woman with an expansive warmth and wide smile, has been designing and selling diamond rings for 24 years. ''I grew up with emeralds,'' she said. ''I used to wear rings on every finger.'' She shares her 22-by-10-foot office with Nicole, who said her mother has been invaluable in helping her with designs and pricing as well as vouching for her with new clients: a necessary blessing for those getting started in the business. Despite the strides they have made, these women say their paths have not been smooth. They insist that the diamond business is still a male-dominated industry in which men do not trust women as much as they do each other. At the most conservative end of the spectrum, Hasidic men -- who are still a major force in the business -- are prevented by Jewish law from even shaking a woman's hand. ''In this industry, women are second class,'' Ruth said. Although Osnat has up until now employed only women in her company, which buys and sells colored stones, she said she had recently hired a man to make things easier with suppliers and customers. ''Men want to hear men,'' she said. ''They talk to him, they call him back, they have much more respect for him.'' A soft-spoken, elegant, worldly woman, Osnat said she had a difficult time when she began her career 18 years ago, especially when she traveled to foreign countries to buy gems: Sri Lanka for sapphires, Thailand for rubies, Colombia for emeralds. ''Women are second-class citizens,'' she said, echoing her sister. ''Men don't understand a woman separating from her family in the sense of making her own money.'' Clients kept her waiting, she recalled. They made her alter her demeanor, forcing her to appear far more retiring than she was. ''I would have to create myself in their image,'' she said. ''I couldn't show my strength. I would have to always manipulate them to get what I wanted.'' And, some of the Gad sisters say, they did not feel their father was behind them. He traveled throughout his career and only recently has become a stronger presence in their lives. ''Did he encourage me?'' Ruth said. ''No. Did he help me? No.'' Osnat added: ''My dad, I would say, only after 15 years has given me a lot of respect. He has not told me in words, but I think he has shown me. ''He always says he wishes he had six boys,'' she went on. ''That used to hurt me.'' All of Solomon Gad's daughters say their father made it desperately, demonstratively clear how much he had wanted a son. ''It was a big disappointment for my father,'' Zipora said. ''We grew up wanting it because that's all that was discussed and we were part of it, wanting it. We didn't know any different. Since I was a little kid, we knew we needed a son to carry his name.'' So Mr. Gad and his wife, Shoshana, kept having children until, finally, Isaac was born 33 years ago. ''I cannot explain to you in words the day my brother was born, what a joy it was for my father,'' Zipora recalled. But Isaac Gad, 33, says that although he was the long-awaited son, he did not have it much easier than his sisters. As a young boy, he spent summers working for his dad, sorting diamonds, doing paper work, accompanying his father on buying and selling trips. ''He was definitely grooming me,'' Isaac said. ''I was pressured extensively to go into business with my father.'' Instead, Mr. Gad went to law school at New York University. ''It was never my intention to go into the business,'' he said. ''I felt it was too Old World, backward. I wanted to be a lawyer.'' Then, he said, he disappointed his father yet again by dropping out of law school. He did go to work for his father at that time, but said he had lasted only about a month. ''He's just a very tough, tough individual,'' he said. ''Things had to be done his way or no way.'' Isaac Gad, an easygoing talker who wears loafers without socks, said his relationship with his father has improved over time, especially since he has now made something of himself in the business. In 1990, he began working as a loose-diamond distributor for his mother's brother, David Vardi. Today, he specializes in manufacturing mass-market ''bridal wraps,'' rings that fit over solitaire diamonds and that sell for an average of $399. (At first, he called his company Vardi & Gad Corp., but later changed it to Paul Winston because, he said, it sounded more American and summoned up images of the prestigious jeweler, Harry Winston.) Now he has 23 people working for him in New York, 8 salespeople on the road and 200 in his factory in the Dominican Republic. He said his business registered $5 million in gross sales in 1997, up from $850,000 in 1992. And his father? ''I speak to him once a day,'' Isaac said. ''I use him as one of my key advisers in dealing with the bank, customers, vendors.'' Neither Age Nor Illness Stops the Family Patriarch Solomon Gad still commutes to work on the subway four days a week in his black yarmulke and white cardigan, even though he has been ill since he suffered a ruptured esophagus and lost about 100 pounds. He said he had planned to retire seven years ago but decided to keep reporting to work until his body stopped him. ''I like to come,'' he said. ''I like to go.'' Mr. Gad was born in Afghanistan in 1924. At age 19, he said, he was already a successful rug trader when he met his wife, Shoshana Vardi, then 16. The Gads moved from Peshawar, Pakistan, to Bombay to Israel and finally settled in a six-bedroom English Tudor house in Forest Hills, Queens, in 1962. In the 1950's, Mr. Gad started selling emeralds with one of his eight brothers, a partnership, he says, that ended amicably in 1972. His children say it wasn't so amicable. ''The division of the merchandise was a big conflict,'' Zipora recalled. ''The more money they made, the more greedy they became.'' Although he already has 12 grandchildren, Mr. Gad told his daughters over his plate of salmon at the Diamond Dealers Club -- after scolding them for ordering only salads -- that he would give each of them a mink coat for every new grandchild. Nicole said she has to get married first before she thinks about children. Her wedding to Brian Dersovitz, a college sweetheart, is scheduled for next Sunday at the Pierre Hotel. She plans to come down the aisle to ''Sunrise, Sunset,'' wearing a silk organza gown and a three-carat diamond engagement ring that was designed by her mother. Mr. Gad's children describe the family as generally close, although Osnat does say that father chides her for not keeping in touch. ''He calls me and tells me I never call him,'' she said. ''You get busy during the day, and he's not as busy as he used to be.'' Ruth said she spoke to her father and mother every day, to Osnat every day, to Ahuva every other day. They spend holidays together, eating their mother's Persian rice pilaf and other Middle Eastern specialties. While family members are sometimes competitive when it comes to business, they also like to keep it in the family. Ruth and Isaac buy their colored stones from Osnat. Isaac buys some diamonds from his uncle, Mordechai Vardi, in Israel. ''I have at least 15 cousins who are all within the industry,'' Isaac said. Much of what his children now recount Solomon Gad remembers differently. He fondly recalls how, during several summers when his wife visited family members in Israel with Isaac and Liza, he took the five older girls on car trips. They sang Hebrew songs on the road and one time had to leave a restaurant without eating because the waiter kept bringing shellfish, which is not kosher. He says that he has always encouraged his daughters in their careers and that he was not profoundly disappointed when Isaac or any of his other children ultimately chose to go into business for themselves, rather than with him. ''At the beginning, it was hard for me, but now I understand,'' he said. ''They are good. They are succeeding.'' A World of Handshakes And Old-Fashioned Trust While the people in the diamond industry have changed significantly in recent years, Solomon Gad says, the terms of deal-making remain the same. It is a business that relies on trust -- a handshake, somebody's word. This kind of old-fashioned negotiation is on full display amid the buzz at the Diamond Dealers Club. Members huddle under long-necked table lamps and in various corners to work out their trades, unwrapping diamonds from their pockets or bargaining over prices. There is a synagogue on the premises, racks of Jewish newspapers, clocks that show the time in Ramat Gan, Israel, New York and Antwerp, Belgium, a major diamond center. Mr. Gad said there was a time in his early days when it was essential for him to start the day at the club. He would arrive at 8:30 most mornings to find a table with good natural light. Now it is merely a place he drops in on occasionally to keep in touch with old associates. Aside from providing a trading floor, the club does not get involved in members' businesses, Mr. Hass, the president, said. Should problems arise over the terms of an agreement between dealers, the club has a dispute resolution system, but Mr. Hass said such cases were rare -- perhaps 120 a year, most of which were settled amicably. He emphasized how much the club's makeup had changed over the last decade. Ten percent of its members, for example, are Indians, up from about 2 percent 10 years ago. ''Today, it's as open an admission policy as you can possibly imagine,'' he said. Although women have been eligible for admission since the club was founded in 1931, Mr. Hass said, they did not begin to join until the 1960's. Even today, he said, there are only about 100 women among the 1,800 members. While Mr. Hass described this as progress, women in the Gad family seem to feel differently. ''Why should I go there?'' Ruth Hendelman said. ''Did you see how everybody was looking at us? Do you need people staring at you? I'm there to do business. They just see women. It's a man's club.'' The difficulties they encountered when they started out in business are one reason that Osnat and Ruth have sought to give a leg up to Nicole, a high-energy, upbeat woman who majored in metalsmithing at Syracuse. After Nicole worked for Fabrikant & Sons, the jewelry manufacturer, Osnat hired her niece part time, and eventually Ruth invited her daughter to share her office space. ''She always worked with her hands, which I cannot do,'' said Ruth, who keeps a record of every magazine mention of her daughter's work. ''I don't have that talent.'' Nicole Hendelman uses her tiny, shared office for attending to the sales side of her growing business and her Upper West Side apartment to create her own line of jewelry, Nicole Hendelman Ltd. Her first customers were her friends. Now Henri Bendel and Nordstrom have carried her handmade necklaces and earring in 14-carat gold and sterling silver with semiprecious stones like smoky topaz, citron, amethysts, black onyx and pink tourmaline. Her pieces, which sell for $120 to $195, have been featured in magazines like Glamour and Accent. She said she got ideas for her designs by looking at people on the street and flipping through magazines. ''I have it all in my head,'' she said. ''I don't put it on paper.'' But she would never wear her designs on 47th Street. ''Everybody copies,'' she said. ''Everybody tries to make it cheaper.'' As for her relationship with her grandfather, Ms. Hendelman says it has been nothing but mutual affection. ''He brings me fruit every day,'' she said. ''He's so caring with his grandchildren. He absolutely adores each and every one of us.'' While Mr. Gad still clings to the memory of his once-bustling daily routine, he seems at peace with his slower pace. In large part, this appears to be because his children -- and at least one grandchild -- are carrying on in his business. Indeed, despite the ways in which their father may have failed them, Solomon Gad's children seem grateful for all that he has taught them, proud of their history and excited to be in an industry that has long been such a part of their lives. ''I think in the end, all parents just want their kids to grow up and be happy,'' Isaac said. ''He sees that I've already done that. He's content. He's done his job.'' Ring Maven and Amateur Psychiatrist LIKE all of those who deal in diamonds, Ruth Hendelman spends her days evaluating the icy, sparkling stones based on cut, color and quality, deciding which to use in the rings she makes to order. The better the color and quality, the higher the price. ''I think color is very important,'' she said. ''All the young people are looking for color.'' Color grades are denoted by letter, she explained: D through F mean colorless, G and H near colorless, K through M faint yellow, N through R very light yellow and S through Z light yellow. Most stones that she sells, Mrs. Hendelman says, range from D through F. ''You train your eye,'' she said. She hunches over the diamonds, spread, small and sparkling, on her desk, searching for imperfections with her 10-power magnifying glass. If she sees nothing, the stone is perfect, but that is rare. Often there is a featherlike line or a slight tint. Flaw rankings descend from flawless to VVS1 (very, very small imperfection), VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI2 (slightly imperfect) and SI-1. Most diamonds Mrs. Hendelman sells range from VVS-2 to SI-1, she said, and the authenticity of almost all have been certified by the Gemological Institute of America. After a client chooses a diamond and decides whether he wants stones on the side, like baguettes, Mrs. Hendelman fashions the ring in wax for final approval. Then the ring is cast in platinum, 18-carat or 14-carat gold, depending on the client's choice, the diamond is set and the ring is polished. Mrs. Hendelman says she comes up with her prices -- from $5,000 to $40,000, depending on the size of the diamond -- by consulting the Rapaport Diamond Report, a weekly newsletter published by the Rapaport Corporation, which details the prices of diamonds in the wholesale marketplace. Mrs. Hendelman says she usually offers a discount -- she declined to say how much -- to try to insure that customers return. ''I make less money so they will come to me for other things,'' like wedding bands, pearls or diamond stud earrings. But, unlike the practice on the street, there is no haggling. ''My price is a final price,'' Mrs. Hendelman said. Business is good these days, she said. Classic styles are in: antique settings, white diamonds, platinum and pearls. ''People, this year, you cannot imagine what they were spending,'' she said. ''They were spending like $10,000 to $40,000 on gifts for their wives.'' Laughing, she admits to a personal sales technique. ''I don't usually let people out of the office'' without making a purchase, she said. ''I talk nonstop.'' And she functions as an amateur psychiatrist to the prospective grooms who are buzzed inside. ''There are a lot of problems when they get engaged,'' she said. ''He will be sweating -- dripping literally. His underarm is completely wet -- it doesn't matter what age -- and his hand is shaking, he cannot hold the tweezers, and they're very cute and I try to make them more comfortable.'' Mrs. Hendelman said that like one young customer who popped the question on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard, at least half the men who buy her rings call her after they have proposed to tell her how it went. ''Some of the stories,'' she said, ''are wonderful.'' ROBIN POGREBIN

Aug. 23, 1998-> 229-> Splice Einstein and Sammy Glick. Add a Little Magellan.
There are just a few hours left before the start of the Newport-to-Bermuda yacht race, and the Sorcerer, J. Craig Venter's 82-foot-long, million-dollar-deep dazzler of a boat, is not even close to being ready. A frenzy of activity fills the teak and cherry cabin as the galley chef stocks the custom-built refrigerator-freezer with provisions for the 635-mile trip: spinach lasagna, Catalina chicken, broiled lamb chops with pesto sauce. Assorted crew members bound up and down the stairs between the two front staterooms with word of the latest glitches: ''The inverter is out,'' meaning there will be no on-board power for things like computers and electronic charts. ''The cockpit radio's totally dead.'' ''I can't get the turbos to kick in.'' A more usual man might be concerned by all of this. Craig Venter, on the other hand, sits calmly in the cockpit, surrounded by dozens of dials and gauges, wearing the crew uniform -- a polo shirt bearing the logo of the Sorcerer -- and looking downright pleased. Bald and fit, with wizardly eyebrows that are in keeping with the mystical name of his boat, the 51-year-old Venter is a man who speaks in metaphors and who sees his life as a series of ongoing aphorisms. His favorite: They said it couldn't be done, but I did it. He particularly likes that theme lately, now that he has entered the biggest race of his career, one that has nothing to do with the Sorcerer. The yacht, after all, is just a distraction, something he's indulged in since he's become extremely rich. When not at sea, he is a scientist -- arguably the most prodigious and best-financed molecular biologist in the world. His success comes from codifying shortcuts, doing things in less time and for less money. ''Quick,'' he says, ''does not mean dirty,'' although his critics would argue otherwise. Recently, he has elbowed his way to the center of what may turn out to be the most significant race in the history of modern medicine. The finish line (which, in many ways, is really a starting point) is a map of the entire human genome, the 80,000 genes that are thought to exist within our dna. Altogether, this means finding more than three billion microscopic pieces of information -- nucleotides, or bases, that are the molecular equivalent of letters -- then putting them all in the right order and learning how to read them. If the poet Alexander Pope was right and ''the proper study of mankind is man,'' there is no more elemental way to look at humanity than this. After the genome is sequenced, a new era in human health could, theoretically, begin. Drugs could be made to neutralize the genetic codes of infectious agents -- h.i.v., tuberculosis, hepatitis -- like a new program in a computer. Others could replace the disease-prone genes of humans -- cancer, diabetes, heart disease -- like new spark plugs in an automobile. Genomic scientists (the field is so new that the term was coined only a few years ago) liken knowledge of the genome to that of electricity. When the first wires were strung, no one could envision the computers they would eventually power. In genomics, too, they say, the possibilities are so vast they are beyond imagination. If the dream proceeds as planned, it will make today's treatments look as clumsy and archaic as blood-letting and cupping. ''Most historians will look back on this project as the most important thing we did in science at the turn of the century,'' says Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees the Human Genome Project. It is a huge undertaking, administered by the Department of Energy and the n.i.h., costing $3 billion in the United States alone and involving hundreds of scientists in universities and private laboratories around the world. ''This is more important than putting a man on the moon or splitting the atom,'' Collins says. ''Biomedical research will be divided into what we did before we had the human genome and what we did after.'' But ''after'' depends on completing the genome, and that is where Venter comes in. In the spring, he announced that this Holy Grail could be got privately and that he, in partnership with one of the nation's largest manufacturers of laboratory research equipment, was planning to get it. It would cost not $3 billion, he said, but a mere $300 million. He would be doing it not for the sake of public knowledge alone but also on behalf of big business. And he would be finished by 2001, four years ahead of the Government's target date. It was as if private industry had announced it would land a man on the moon before nasacould get there. As if an upstart company intended to build the first atom bomb. The response among scientists, ethicists, businessmen and legal experts was as dramatic as the announcement itself. ''Overnight, he changed everything,'' says James Weber, a senior research scientist at the Marshfield Medical Research Foundation. ''Government labs are scrambling to keep from being eclipsed. Even if he never intended to do it himself and just wanted to stir things up, he did it brilliantly.'' There were attacks on Venter's methods, charges that his shortcut would result in a genome filled with errors and gaps, a slipshod substitute for the real thing. ''A rough draft,'' says Collins dismissively. ''Is this the Book of Life we signed up for and that will stand the test of the decades? No.'' There were also attacks on Venter's motives. Was it only money he was after, his critics and competitors wondered, or was it something more chilling: that he might somehow come to own the operating system for the human body. ''The question scientists are asking,'' says Lori Andrews, a professor of law at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, ''is does he want to be the Bill Gates of the human genome?'' As with most things in the realm of the double helix, however, the controversy goes beyond what can easily be seen. Venter's announcement threw a powerful lens on this world -- a discipline that is still in its infancy yet already reinventing itself. It is a place where the lines between the goals of science and those of industry are increasingly blurred, where countless genes have been quietly claimed by patents, and where, long before Venter's announcement, companies were already well on their way to owning the Book of Life. Here, personalities can matter almost as much as results. And differences in methods -- arcane and incomprehensible to those of us who are outsiders -- can make all the difference in our future. As for the man at the center of the shouting, he is as complex as his science: a multimillionaire who insists he is not interested in the money, a late-bloomer who craves the approval of the academic world yet delights in attacking the establishment from the rear. ''They don't like me,'' he says, fiddling with a temperamental computer screen on the Sorcerer, trying to adjust the color of the water on the navigational map, which is a stubbornly murky purple. ''I keep changing the rules,'' he adds. 'People hate you when you do that.'' He smiles the same kid-in-trouble smile he wore when he learned that the inverter had broken, the radio had ceased to work and the turbos wouldn't fire. The fastest boat in the 40 previous runnings of this race took 57 hours to finish, leaving on a Friday afternoon and reaching Bermuda near midnight on Sunday. Venter stares at the seas on his computer screen, which, after all his adjustments, have turned a brilliant blue. ''We'll be in,'' he says, ''by Sunday night.'' No one has ever accused Craig Venter of being too modest. He tries self-deprecation once in a while, offering up an anecdote, say, of how he was a mediocre student back home in the San Francisco Bay area. But by the time he gets to the end of the story, it has turned into something else entirely. ''When I close my eyes,'' he begins, ''I see nothing. I can't picture my wife's face; I can't picture my boat.'' His inability to remember visual images, he says, was why he nearly flunked out of high school, barely passing each grade before finally receiving his diploma in 1964. ''All my thinking is totally conceptual,'' he continues, beginning his segue from short-lived humility back to cheerful boasting. ''I can see things that other people can't see. And I'm usually very good at predicting the future. It makes me very frustrated waiting for everyone else to catch up with me.'' At age 17, Venter drifted south to Newport Beach, working at night so he could spend his days surfing. Drafted during the Vietnam War, he found himself at a hospital near the front lines. Trained as a medical corpsman, he was given the job of triaging severely wounded soldiers based on his best guess of who would live and who would die. By the time his tour was completed, his goals had expanded beyond his surfboard. ''Everybody has some sort of life-altering experience,'' he says. ''I couldn't be a frivolous surfer after what I went through.'' Beginning with junior college, he earned both his bachelor's degree and his Ph.D. in physiology and pharmacology from the University of California at San Diego within six years. In 1976, he moved to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he met his wife, Claire Fraser, then a graduate student in microbiology, who has been his professional colleague and confidante ever since. Once he got started, he would always be in a hurry, as if making up for a late start, doggedly determined to prove that he belonged in this most intellectual of worlds. The world he entered, however, was not in a hurry. In the late 70's, the way to find a gene was to read the genetic alphabet one letter at a time. Researchers sat squinting at narrow columns of magnified dna, scanning across and down, trying to parse out which sections represented genes and which represented the filler, known as ''junk dna,'' between them. Working at this pace, it took Venter 10 frustrating years, until 1986, to find his first gene -- one that produces a protein that serves as an adrenaline receptor in brain cells. There was already talk of a Human Genome Project when Venter made his breakthrough, but it was little more than talk because the technology of the day would have meant a project of 30 or 40 years. That changed overnight, however, with the invention of an ''automated sequencer,'' which replaced much of the squinting with lasers and computers. In 1987, Congress approved the first budget for the Human Genome Project. It would be administered by the n.i.h. office of human genome research under the direction of James D. Watson, the Nobel laureate who along with Francis Crick described the double-helix shape of dna in the first place. That same year, Venter, who was running his own laboratory at the n.i.h., arranged to have the lab designated as a test site for the machine. Within two years, he had found eight new genes. It was, at the time, a dizzying rate of discovery, but it was still not fast enough for Venter. By 1991, the year after the Human Genome Project officially started, he had devised a shortcut -- one loved by industry but questioned by scientists, a theme that would come to define the rest of his career. Rather than looking for genes in the full string of dna, Venter trawled through something called cdna (complementary dna), which is manipulated chemically to contain the genes but not the filler. His approach rarely resulted in an entire gene sequence, but provided enough to indicate that the gene is there. He called these bits and pieces ''expressed sequence tags,'' or e.s.t.'s. Critics point out that he was not the first to realize the potential of cdna for this purpose. (Actually, critics point out that nearly everything Venter has done over the years has been thought of first by someone else.) But he was the first to do something about it on a large and dramatic scale. Venter applied for a $10 million grant from the n.i.h. for e.s.t. research. His goal, he said, was to find every human gene. He was turned down, probably because the amount of money he requested was a substantial percentage of the yearly Genome Project budget. Venter believes it was more personal than that. ''Watson turned on me,'' he says. Venter's theory is that Watson feared that the shortcut might cause Congress to question the $3 billion it was paying for the slower, more precise sequencing method chosen by the Genome Project, a method that includes pinpointing not only the genes but also the filler between. Watson said at the time that he'd had nothing to do with the e.s.t. grant request, which had been rejected ''at a level I couldn't reverse.'' Whatever the reasons, this was the start of the bad blood between Venter and Watson, a chill that continues to this day. When asked to discuss Venter's newest controversial plan, Watson says, gallantly but firmly, ''I think it's best if we say nothing of each other.'' Venter experimented with his e.s.t. gene fragments anyway, using money from his general lab budget. This, too, would become a pattern in his life -- circumventing the lengthy peer-review grant process and improvising other ways to finance his research. Within months he had found pieces of a remarkable number of genes. By June 1991, he had located 347. A year later, 2,375 more. Six months after that, an additional 4,448. By 1991, all the scientists in the world had found fewer than 2,000. Craig Venter was locating 25 genes each day, and raising questions of ethics and commerce at about the same rate. How, exactly, does one measure the value of a gene? Is its worth determined by its function within the body? Is a gene that influences intelligence more or less valuable than one that influences health? Or talent? Or beauty? Or perhaps the value should be measured by the profits to be seen from sales of gene-based pharmaceuticals? And to whom, then, does the discovered gene belong? To the scientist who conducted the research? To the entity that financed it? To the whole of mankind, which shares that gene in common? Is it blasphemous to patent the building blocks of our very existence? Is it shortsighted not to patent them? If all genes are in the public domain, would any company invest the tens of millions necessary to transform that nonexclusive knowledge into practical therapy? If they are not in the public domain, do those who own them privately also own a blueprint for humanity? Over the past two decades, law and practice have evolved to treat genes as they would any other commercial product -- meaning they are subject to patents. It happened quietly, and there are many who now question whether it should have happened, but, being students of technology, they understand there will be no going back. What Venter was discovering expanded the debate beyond the patenting of genes. That is because he was not discovering full genes but pieces thereof, raising an entirely new set of questions. Can you patent a gene before you know what it does and how it can be used? The n.i.h. technology transfer office decided to try, applying for patents on thousands of Venter's e.s.t.'s. Those who had kept silent while gene patents became the norm now raged at double volume over the patenting of genetic pieces. This was governmental hubris, academic scientists protested, and would lead to a biological gold rush, a mad scramble to stake claims in uncharted territory. Although the patents weren't Venter's idea (he had at first been opposed to the proposal), most of the backlash was directed toward him. Watson publicly criticized those within his own agency who made the patent-application decision, calling the plan ''sheer lunacy.'' A colleague of Watson's then attacked Venter's e.s.t. approach as something ''any monkey'' could do. Days later, a scientist in Venter's lab came to work dressed in a monkey suit and his colleagues took a photo of him reading a book written by Watson. Eventually, the patent applications were withdrawn, but not before Watson resigned from the Human Genome Project in protest. (He is now at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.) Craig Venter, in turn, packed up his entire 30-person staff and also left the n.i.h., lured by $70 million from Wallace Steinberg, a venture capitalist who thought all this talk of making money on genetics was not ethically troubling at all. Under a glass case in Craig Venter's expansive office is a model of the Sorcerer -- its hull sapphire blue, its sails full to the wind. The mahogany of the antique desk and conference table is highly polished. The rugs are dark and thick. The walls are filled with nautical sketches, save for a single photograph -- an aerial shot of the Sorcerer and its crew taken from a helicopter. The office is part of the Institute for Genomic Research, Venter's own personal research institute, where he has worked since his departure from n.i.h. in 1992. Wallace Steinberg, chairman of the Healthcare Investment Corporation until his death in 1995, pledged his $70 million to establish the institute ( known as tigr and pronounced like the wild animal). At the same time, he spent $3 million to set up a sister company, Human Genome Sciences, or h.g.s. There were no restrictions on Venter's research, but -- this was a business venture, after all -- he was required to give h.g.s. a six-month exclusive look at tigr's results. If h.g.s. was interested in pursuing a patent on a particular gene, then tigr could not publish that information for another 12 months, giving h.g.s. time to apply for the patent. Venter, who says he had $2,000 in savings at the time, accepted the offer from Steinberg, receiving 10 percent of h.g.s. stock when the company first went public in December 1993. (He sold that stock in the spring of 1994 for more than $9 million; he says he did not want to be personally beholden to h.g.s. ''It shows you I'm not in this for the money,'' he says. The price as of Aug. 12 was 37, three times what it had been when Venter divested.) By 1994, tigr and h.g.s. had found e.s.t.'s for 35,000 genes, almost half the genes in the human genome. At about that time, Venter ran into Hamilton O. Smith, who had won a Nobel in 1978 for work he had done using the Hemophilus influenzae bacterium, which causes ear infections and meningitis. Smith knew of Venter, whose unorthodox reputation was growing within genomics. Intrigued by this rebellious bad sheep, Smith accepted Venter's invitation to dinner one night. The conversation turned to new software being developed at the institute that could reassemble and analyze ever-larger chunks of a genome. Smith suggested that Venter try out the assembler on the nearly two-million-base-pair H. influenzae. At that time, the only full genomes that had been sequenced were viruses, and as genomes go, they are tiny: from 10,000 (h.i.v.) to about 200,000 (smallpox) base pairs. Several labs were trying to sequence bacteria, but they were doing it the old-fashioned way -- one section at a time. The standard technique was to first create a ''map'' of chemically known signposts along the dna, then sequence the spaces between the signposts. Because the map always gives you an idea of where along the genome you are, the pieces are easier to put back together. What Venter and Smith agreed to do was skip the mapping stage. Instead, they relied on the tigr software program to fit together the pieces. The largest number of bases anyone had reported subdividing and reassembling at that point was 48,000. Now Venter and Smith were trying to take on 1.8 million. The two applied for an n.i.h. grant to finance the project, but because they were creating the software as they went along, Smith says, ''we realized we probably wouldn't get the money.'' So, in the meanwhile, the team began the work on their own, using tigr funds. In time, n.i.h. did turn down the request. While the agency's confidential report was careful to say that the idea was ''worth pursuing,'' it also expressed doubt that it could be done as proposed. ''To date,'' the report concluded, ''there is no successful example of assembling 2 Mb of finished sequence. And there is no indication that this can be achieved by the tigr group.'' But by the time the grant was rejected, Venter and Smith had completed 90 percent of the sequencing and another chapter had been added to the evolving Venter myth. With a flourish, the partners announced the completion of the H. influenzae genome to a microbiology conference 10 months later and followed that with a pullout centerfold in Science, the most prestigious of journals: four pages of 1,749 separate genes, laid out in rows, a first glimpse at a Recipe for Life. Even James Watson had good things to say: ''I think it's a great moment in science.'' Although the science was going well at tigr, other things were not. Venter's relationship with h.g.s. meant that he could not publish many of his discoveries until months after they were made, and to an academic scientist, publication is confirmation of one's existence. h.g.s. policy allowed other scientists to see the findings, but only after they signed an agreement saying they would not use the data for commercial purposes. Free access to information is tantamount to religion among scientists, and they once again directed their anger at Craig Venter. One pharmaceutical company, Merck & Company, went so far as to announce a new partnership with the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, pledging that all e.s.t. discoveries would be put immediately into the public domain. You can do well while doing good, the announcement seemed to say. Venter saw the announcement as a direct slap, and he felt the sting. Despite his pride at tweaking the establishment, Venter also craves its approval, and the ties between Venter and Human Genome Sciences became increasingly strained. Last summer, the partnership was officially dissolved. Venter gave up the $38 million that was owed to tigr by h.g.s. over the next five years -- money he says he will not miss. The sum of his public and commercial grants was about $30 million last year, he says, one of the highest levels of per capita grant funding in the country. On the day that the dissolution of the tigr-h.g.s. partnership was made public, Venter made his own separate announcement: that tigr would post a treasure trove of new information into genetic data banks, including the full genomes for Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes ulcers. That done, Craig Venter began looking around for something new and controversial to do. Francis Collins, who replaced James Watson as the head of the Human Genome Project, does not have any yacht dioramas in his laboratory office. There is no fireplace, no plush carpet, no antique artwork. The view out his window is of a construction site. The differences in decor say a lot about the varying budgets of public and private science. They say something, too, about the core differences between these formidable men. Venter is ever restless and impatient; Collins is methodical and precise (although, it should be said, he rides a red Honda Nighthawk motorcycle to work every morning). Not surprisingly, these two give every impression that they do not like each other. ''We don't go drinking together,'' says Collins of Venter. ''I wouldn't describe us as friends.'' ''Francis is not a competitor,'' says Venter of Collins. ''He's a Government bureaucrat whose job is to hand out money to help get the genome done.'' Craig Venter called Francis Collins on a Thursday afternoon in May and asked if the two might meet the following day. The meeting took place in a lounge at Dulles airport, and Venter brought along Michael W. Hunkapiller, senior vice president of the Perkin-Elmer Corporation and president of its biosystems division, which sold almost $1 billion in life-science research equipment last year. Hunkapiller was Venter's new business partner. Perkin-Elmer was about to unveil a new sequencing machine, Collins was told, one that is not only far more powerful than the current version but that also changes the entire sequencing process. It is so fast and so automated that the new Venter-Perkin-Elmer labs will far exceed the total sequencing capacity of all the existing genomics labs in the world. The new company that would run those labs would be named Celera Genomics -- from the root word ''celerity,'' meaning ''swiftness of action.'' The company's goal: nothing less than to sequence the entire human genome, faster and cheaper than Collins and the n.i.h. were planning to do -- faster and cheaper than anyone had thought possible. Three days later, a still-stunned Collins agreed to appear at a joint news conference with Venter and several Perkin-Elmer officials. Everyone smiled. Some looked more sincere about it than others. Collins now says that he was, in fact, deeply troubled by what he was hearing from Venter, but thought it would make no sense to start off this relationship with public rancor. ''This was a real opportunity not to get off on the wrong foot,'' he says. But Venter's assumption that the entire Human Genome Project would come to a halt more than rankled. ''There was the expectation that we would be sufficiently convinced that their strategy was going to work quickly, that we could turn our attention to other things now and wait and see how they did,'' he says with a tone that lies somewhere between astonishment and anger. ''It never occurred to me to seriously consider that we would back away from the effort on the human genome.'' When early news reports painted the new partnership as the end of the Human Genome Project and when Congress subsequently announced it would hold hearings on the continuing need for such a project, Collins grew more alarmed. So did many in the scientific community. To portray Venter's pursuit of the genome as a clash between a bloated Government bureaucracy that costs billions and a feisty, efficient start-up venture that will spend mere hundreds of millions is ''just nonsense,'' says Maynard V. Olson, director of the University of Washington Genome Center and a participant in the Government's research. ''The numbers that are being compared are not comparable,'' he says. ''It's worse than comparing apples and oranges. It's like comparing all of city planning in Paris with the building of the Eiffel Tower.'' To start, project defenders say, it is not true that the Government's approach will take 15 years, compared with Venter's 3. The years invested in the Human Genome Project thus far have been spent on technical preparation. Full-scale sequencing began last month, meaning the Government will take 7 years to sequence the human genome, not 15. In addition, they say, it is inaccurate to compare the $3 billion being spent on one project with the $300 million being set aside for the other. The public budget is paying for far more than human genome sequencing. It is also paying for all the advance work done to date, as well as the parallel sequencing of other organisms and a cluster of related projects. The money that will be spent on the actual sequencing: $500 million. The more accurate comparison, therefore, is that Venter will do in three years what will take the Government seven years. And he will do for $300 million what the Government says will cost $500 million. Why is his plan still cheaper and faster? The answer is one of the few things about which Venter and his critics agree: Venter does not do as much work. The n.i.h. approach involves three steps. The first is mapping, which means plotting reference points along the dna. It has the additional result of dividing the genome into workable sections. Instead of tackling a full encyclopedia, you can approach it entry by entry. The second step is the actual sequencing: taking the individual entries, ripping them into small pieces and then putting them all back together. The analogy favored by nearly every scientist interviewed for this article was the shredding -- only figuratively, mind you -- not of an encyclopedia but of this particular newspaper. ''You take 10 copies of the Sunday New York Times,'' says Eric Lander, director of genome research for the Whitehead Institute at M.I.T. ''Then you divide each one into random 500- word segments and scramble them up.'' Imagine that those segments are on pieces of transparent plastic. If you wave them over one another, or do the computational equivalent, eventually you will find clauses, even sentences, that match. By sticking the overlapping sections on top of one another, you can, eventually, reconstruct the original whole. The final step is ''finishing,'' which means filling in the gaps and correcting all errors and ambiguities in the text. ''Sequencing is large-scale factory work,'' Lander says. ''Finishing is the master craftsmanship at the end.'' Venter plans to leave out the first step, the mapping, and much of the last step, the finishing, an approach that would greatly reduce costs. To do only the middle step, which Lander estimates at a cost of 12 cents a base pair for three billion pairs, would result in a total expenditure of $360 million at current prices, which are steadily coming down. What then is the Government buying for its extra effort? Is it worth the additional time and money? Critics of Venter's approach say his work will result in a genome sequence, but it will be a mess. By skipping the mapping process, they say, Venter runs the risk of sticking the wrong parts of the chromosome together. Without mapping, the potential for inadvertently splicing together sentences referring to the Nixon White House and the Clinton White House increases exponentially. Venter counters that mapping does not provide nearly the information that its proponents say it does. As for finishing: ''It gives people something to complain about. They have to complain about something because otherwise what is their justification for continuing to spend all this money?'' His best evidence that his approach will work, he says, is that he used it on H. influenzae. Collins responds that bacteria genomes and the human genome are different. Not only is the human genome 2,000 times as big, but bacteria do not have repeat sequences of dna -- strings of letters that appear in the same order in many places in the genome. In bacteria, less than 1 percent of all dna is repetitive. By contrast, 70 percent of human genes are repetitive. Venter's results, Collins says, will be useful, but his shortcut will mean they will not be accurate enough. ''You want the whole thing,'' he says. ''You want it done right. You want no mistakes if you can help it, and you don't want gaps in the assembly. That is the potential risk -- that victory will be declared and we will be left with a rough draft rather than the real thing.'' While some scientists are worrying about the quality of the results, others are worrying about access to those results. In the years since the fight over the patenting of Venter's e.s.t. gene fragments, the world of genomics has become increasingly privatized: in genetic research, private financing now outpaces public financing; the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued more than 1,800 patents on full gene sequences, according to John Doll, director of biotechnical examination at the Patent Office. Most, he says, have been for plant genes, although the past two years have seen ''a tremendous increase'' in applications for human-gene patents. Licenses on many of those human-gene patents have been granted to pharmaceutical companies. Amgen, for instance, paid Rockefeller University $20 million to license a gene thought to regulate metabolism, with an agreement to pay many times that amount if the gene proves useful in treating obesity. ''You no longer have a clearly bounded territory of open noncommercial science,'' says Rebecca Eisenberg, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a specialist in biotechnology patents. ''It's hard to tell public from private. It's like a lottery of sorts, and no one wants to discover they've just parted with a winning lottery ticket.'' The result, she says, is that the world of genomics is becoming a place where ''people are much more reluctant to share.'' That get-out-of-my-sandbox approach to science would be fine, some theorists say, if private control over genes spurred companies to develop genetic therapies. But in recent months, Eisenberg and others have published arguments in leading science journals arguing that the privatization of this research could inhibit that process instead. In the May 1998 issue of Science, Eisenberg and a co-author, Michael A. Heller, write that the existence of multiple and overlapping ''owners'' of genetic material makes it difficult for anyone to get all the necessary permissions to use the material. It is a situation, she says, that will worsen when the Patent Office does what it has balked at doing for nearly a decade but now seems poised to do in the future -- allow patents on gene fragments, or e.s.t.'s. ''More intellectual property rights,'' Eisenberg predicts, ''may lead paradoxically to fewer useful products for improving human health.'' Celera, she fears, is one more major step in that direction. Tony White, Perkin-Elmer's chief executive officer and the chairman of Celera, promises that Celera will place the actual genome sequence, the three-billion-letter string, in the public domain. Every three months, he says, the latest results will be entered into GenBank, the Internet directory that tracks the accumulating information. (The n.i.h., in contrast, updates that database every 24 hours.) But that does not mean that everything the company discovers will be made public. ''We didn't say we would put everything in the public domain,'' Hunkapiller says. ''We said we'd put in the basic sequence.'' What the company will not give away is its interpretation of the data, particularly the valuable polymorphisms -- the genetic differences among human beings that are the core of all gene therapy. That will be available to pharmaceutical companies -- for a price. In addition, Celera will retain the intellectual property rights to ''some number'' of genes, White says, ones that show particular commercial promise. Using the three-month lead time, Celera can identify those genes that are of greatest interest to pharmaceutical companies. If past trends are a prediction of the future, the most marketable genes will be not only for those that cause cancer but also for those that cause such problems as obesity and baldness. ''We don't intend to just go ahead and patent everything that comes out of our machines, willy-nilly,'' White says, ''but this is a commercial venture. We intend to get a very good return to our shareholders on this.'' There are some who go so far as to suggest that all of this is not really about sequencing the genome. Business, not science, they say, is at the root of this announcement. And the business in question has nothing to with gene patents. Instead, they say, it is a creative way for Perkin-Elmer to sell more of its sequencing machines. ''When all is said and done it will have been a great marketing coup for Perkin-Elmer,'' says Randy Scott, president of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company that earned a $10 million profit against $90 million in revenue last year marketing a similar database to pharmaceutical companies. ''That's what this comes down to, great publicity.'' Says Tony White: ''I sell tools and I want that data out there so people will start using our equipment to mine that data. We think it's going to create increased demand for our primary division.'' But if there is reason to believe that Perkin-Elmer is less interested in science than in commerce, there is also evidence that Venter, who will own 5 percent of the new company, is motivated by something that does not have to do with money at all. He gave a speech in Stockholm recently, a guest of the Nobel Symposium. He spoke in the very hall where the most prestigious prizes in science are presented. The Nobel is not something one is supposed to campaign for. It is not even something one is supposed to lust for aloud. But in this area, too, Craig Venter likes to break the rules. ''Do I wish?'' he said shortly after that speech. ''Every scientist does. If the scenario works as we envision it.. . .'' He trailed off, midthought. Even he is too superstitious to complete the sentence. The cabin of the five-passenger Lear jet is cramped and noisy, but it provides status, efficiency and privacy. Venter, as one of his corporate perks, leases private planes often lately, when commercial airline schedules can not get him to all the places he needs to be in one day. On a recent morning, the trip is particularly bumpy, the cloud cover is dense and Venter is full of metaphors. ''Look out the window,'' he says. ''You can't see anything, but you can still get where you're going. That's something only the human mind is capable of: envisioning what it can't see.'' Pointing toward the two pilots in the cockpit, he says: ''They have their instruments and their maps. My brain is my map.'' Suddenly, the plane dips below the clouds, and the ground appears as if from nowhere. ''This is genomics,'' Venter says, sweeping his hand theatrically toward the horizon. ''The big view.'' Let others worry about each little gene, he says, his plan is to ''look at the whole world.'' He has been traveling relentlessly since plans for Celera were unveiled, leaving the day-to-day operations of tigr in the hands of his wife, Claire Fraser, who is expected to be named president soon by the board of directors. He is vilified at some stops, hailed at others. Through it all, he looks dazed but buoyant, like one of those inflatable clowns that pop up smiling, no matter how often they are hit. Soon after the plans for Celera were first announced, for instance, he was the hastily scheduled guest speaker at a long-planned meeting of genome scientists at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, James Watson's lab. It was not one of Venter's more welcoming audiences. During his presentation, Venter explained that his predictions of success were based on a particular mathematical formula, the Lander-Waterman equation. That was when Eric Lander, co-author of that equation, raised his hand and said that Venter had misapplied the formula because, among other things, the equation assumes a perfect situation, including a genome with no repeats. Later at that meeting, Venter announced that Celera would not start on the human genome immediately, but would first sequence Drosophila -- the fruit fly -- as a test run. During this first phase, he said, he would have the cooperation of Gerald M. Rubin, a professor of genetics at the University of California at Berkeley, who has spent years (and expects to spend years more) sequencing Drosophila. The ensuing discussion after Venter had left was loud and nasty. A number of people at the meeting say Watson invoked the specter of Hitler and Munich in describing Venter's ambition. (Rubin was Poland.) Watson says he never mentioned Hitler. Then what did he accuse Rubin of? ''Of collaborating with Venter,'' Watson says, effectively taking the word that scientists regularly use to mean ''cooperation'' or ''sharing'' and using it to mean ''helping the enemy.'' Things went a little better for Venter a few weeks later, when he testified before a Congressional subcommittee. By that time, there had been a meeting of the group responsible for the next five-year-plan for the Human Genome Project, and the Government-financed scientists discussed giving some ground to Venter by altering their own schedule to include an ''intermediate sequence product,'' similar in quality to the one Venter proposes, then fine-tuning it later. Appearing before Congress, therefore, Collins was most solicitous of Venter. ''Let me assure you,'' Collins vowed, ''we will work together.'' He nodded toward Venter, who, to the discomfort of both men, was dressed in almost the same jacket, shirt and trousers as he was. ''If you doubt that, notice Dr. Venter and I seem to have worn the same clothes today without intending to. We are intending to be partners in every possible way, so let this be a symbol thereof.'' By far the most enthusiastic receptions, not surprisingly, have come from the pharmaceutical companies that are Celera's prospective clients. If Celera is to be successful, Venter has to sell his anticipated database, but these are the audiences that make him most uncomfortable, most aware of the border he is crossing between science and industry. One June afternoon, the Lear jet has stops scheduled in Westchester County, just north of New York City (for a meeting with SmithKline Beecham); then Groton, Conn. (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals); then Teterboro, N.J. A stretch limo meets Venter at Teterboro and drives him to the New York Hilton in Manhattan, where he is to be the keynote speaker at Bio '98, a meeting of 5,000 representatives of the biotechnology industry. The lights in the Grand Ballroom dim. Three sequined dancers take the stage, performing a Broadway medley that includes ''This Is the Moment,'' the show-stopper from the musical ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' sung right before the maverick scientist, Jekyll, drinks the drug that transforms him into the monstrous Hyde. Soon after, the floodlights swoop, the music blares and Venter stands at the sparkling podium. At the end of his presentation, the dancers return and they hand Venter a top hat and cane, expecting him to join in as they soft-shoe off the stage. Venter stares at the props, but refuses to take them. ''I'm willing to do a lot of crazy things,'' says the man who wardrobes his yacht crew in identical outfits, who dressed a lab member in a monkey outfit, who blithely headed for Bermuda not knowing whether his engine was working. ''But somewhere you have to draw the line.'' The 1998 race from Newport to Bermuda turns out to be the slowest in 20 years. The wind is so weak that at times the Sorcerer sails backward, carried along by the Gulf Stream. On the first leg of the race, the only option is to drop the sails and bob helplessly in the Atlantic for 18 hours. Venter, certain he can never win, talks of ''motoring back to Hyannisport and saying to hell with it.'' But he does win. At least for a moment. He sails into Hamilton at 10 P.M. on Wednesday. That is days later than he had planned to arrive, but sooner than any other boat in his division. Shortly before the awards dinner, however, he learns that several competing boats have reported a rule infraction to the race committee. There had been confusion back in Newport about the class in which the Sorcerer was entered and about whether or not the crew could use the spinnaker. Venter thought he could -- he was particularly proud of that sail, which carries a 20-foot- high sketch of himself wearing a peaked wizard's hat. Now he is being told that the spinnaker was in fact banned in his class. Exhausted and disappointed, he withdraws his boat from the race and skips the dinner altogether. And what is the metaphor here? That breaking the rules sometimes has consequences? That figuring it out as you go along might not be the best idea? That shortcuts are not always the right approach? That unforeseen circumstances can slow you down? No, Venter says, none of those. The lesson he has learned? ''Maybe sailing isn't really a metaphor for life.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 230-> PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: RIVERDALE; Images: Fractured, Shaken, Stirred and Rebuilt
A PERHAPS not-so-well-known fact about the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale is that it is a member of the American Association of Museums, and as such, houses a collection of 20th-century art, regularly exhibited for its residents and the public. Through Sept. 24, the home is displaying a series of 12 photomontages by Claude Samton, an artist, photographer and architect who lives in SoHo. Mr. Samton's work captures ordinary images in an extraordinary way. His photomontages are constructed from multiple snapshots, rebuilt and reformatted, shattered, flattened and duplicated to create a three-dimensional series. In his work, a Venetian piazza explodes with activity, or snapshots of Chinatown (shown here) create a fractured New York City landscape. Mr. Samton's photomontages seek to explore the frantic as well as the serene, and will include images as diverse as Siena, Italy, and Rollerblading in Riverside Park. Claude Samton photomontages at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale; 5901 Palisade Avenue (at 261st Street); through Sept. 24; Sundays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.; free; (718) 405-8803.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 231-> PLUS: GYMNASTICS -- U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP; Maloney Defeats Defending Champion
A consistent performance in all four events paid off for 17-year-old Kristen Maloney as she won the United States Gymnastics women's championship last night in Indianapolis. Maloney, fourth in the national championship all-around competition last year, finished with 76.749 points to hold off the challenge of the defending champion, Vanessa Atler. Atler was second with 75.762. The Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu placed third with 75.161 and Jennie Thompson placed fourth at 74.837. Maloney, who will be a high school senior in Pen Argyl, Pa., in the fall, entered the all-around finals yesterday leading Moceanu by .715 points. Atler was in sixth after having problems on the uneven bars, in which she received a 8.225 from the judges. Maloney, who competed with a stress fracture in her tibia, finished first in a field that included three former national champions -- Atler, Moceanu and Kim Zmeskal.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 232-> Streetscapes/Straus Park, 106th Street and West End Avenue; A Restored Memorial to 2 Who Died on the Titanic
LAST year's restoration of Straus Park, at 106th Street and West End Avenue, came just at the start of the hoopla surrounding the Broadway musical and Hollywood movie based on the sinking of the Titanic. The park wasn't part of the hoopla, but it could have been. Isidor and Ida Straus, to whom the park was dedicated in 1915, died together on the ship in 1912. The Strauses had a country home at 105th and West End; after they died the park was built, and their home was demolished and replaced by a blockwide apartment house. In the early 1800's, downtown New Yorkers built country houses on the Upper West Side, where the river views and breezes made the area a summer resort. The area had been fairly rural through the 1860's. One of the last rural houses went up in 1866, on what was later the northeast corner of 105th Street and West End Avenue -- at the time most of the area's streets were delineated only on maps. Later photographs show a clapboard, Italianate-style building with a mansard roof, particularly ornate dormers and a six-sided cupola on top, all topped with spiky iron cresting. The house was built by Matthew Brennan, a volunteer fireman who became a city official and allied himself with William M. (Boss) Tweed. In 1872 The New York Times, which had begun to expose the Tweed Ring in 1871, said that Brennan, then Sheriff, had collected $150,000 in fees for escorting 5,627 prisoners to prison, when in fact there had not been more than 340 prisoners. ''Who Would Not be a Sheriff?'' The Times headlined indignantly. Brennan soon became Tweed's jailer, and when a Tweed associate, Henry Genet, escaped, Brennan was sent to jail himself for a month for dereliction of duty. He returned to his house on 105th Street, and continuing difficulties brought on an attack of apoplexy. Although Brennan was supposed to have become rich, he had mortgaged his house, and his 1879 obituary in The New York Tribune said that ''he died a poor man.'' The Brennan house went through several owners until 1884, when Isidor Straus bought it. Straus had been born in Bavaria in 1845 and came with his father, Lazarus, a peddler, to the United States in the 1850's. Around 1870 Isidor took over the china department of R. H. Macy & Company, becoming a partner in 1888. With his brother, Nathan, Isidor also created the Abraham & Straus department store in Brooklyn. When Isidor and Nathan became sole owners of Macy's in 1896 Nathan built a comfortable town house at 27 West 72d Street, then the most fashionable street on the West Side. But Isidor apparently felt comfortable in his 30-year-old building even though it looked odd surrounded by a new wave of brownstones and small apartment houses. ISIDOR was living in this house when he and Nathan conceived Macy's move from 14th Street and Sixth Avenue to 34th Street and Broadway, accomplished in 1902. In 1910 the census taker recorded Isidor Straus, 65, living in the house with his wife, Ida, 61, and their coachman, George Harris, 30. Isidor and Ida Straus were on the Titanic on April 14, 1912, when the ship hit the iceberg that sank it. Many passengers who survived saw Mrs. Straus, who was urged to take her place in a lifeboat, decline and rejoin her husband. The Times quoted Mrs. Paul Schabert of Derby, Conn., as saying, ''Mrs. Straus declared she would not leave her husband. . . . They were standing arm in arm as the last boat left. As she refused, she clung to him, and they went down arm in arm with the boat.'' Maurice Rothschild, a New York stockbroker, identified Isidor Straus's body in Halifax, Nova Scotia, soon after the sinking, but the funeral was delayed in the hope that Ida Straus's body would be recovered for a double funeral. It never was, and on May 8 the 105th Street house was banked all the way around with floral pieces for Isidor Straus's funeral, followed by a public memorial service at Carnegie Hall. Ten days later the Straus family sold the property to Harry Schiff, a developer. He finished the Clebourne apartment house, at 924 West End Avenue, on the site in September 1913. The Straus house had been one of the last of the country houses to survive. The peculiar trapezoidal shape and great breadth of 924 West End make it well known in the area. At the same time, plans for a memorial to Isidor and Ida Straus were moving ahead. On April 15, 1915, Straus Park, the triangle bounded by Broadway, West End and 106th Street, was dedicated with one of the most evocative pieces of sculpture in the city. Designed by the architect Evarts Tracy and the sculptor Augustus Lukeman, the park was centered on ''Memory,'' a reclining female figure in bronze, eyes downcast into a triangular sheet of water. The figure rests on a slightly curved plinth of granite, with another, larger plinth in the rear forming a bench and inscribed with a biblical phrase from II Samuel: ''In their death they were not divided.'' The Times reported that the Straus family wept aloud during the tributes. Most memorial sculptures try to endow their subjects with grandeur; this one is exquisite in its understatement. There is no plaque on the site of the Straus house -- indeed its former existence has not been widely known. But last year a restored Straus Park was opened, and summer is a cheerful time to visit what is essentially a somber place. The simple sheet of water has been cut far back and mostly replaced by a garden; now children play with watering cans under ''Memory,'' or ride her like a horse, with squeals of adventurous joy. Toddlers practice walking back and forth on the granite bench; sometimes they pause, and idly finger the inscription from Samuel.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 233-> PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK; Woodson Star Quality Could Help Draw Fans
The Oakland Raiders have a tradition of good defensive backs, like the Hall of Famers Mike Haynes, the smash-mouth cornerback; Jack Tatum, nicknamed Assassin, and Willie Brown, who scored on a 75-yard interception return in Super Bowl XI. While it is early to put the rookie corner Charles Woodson in that class, if his preseason play is any indication, he is on his way. Woodson can be a savior to the team in several ways. He can be the iron that the team's soft defense, constantly ranked among the worst in recent years, has lacked. And the Raiders, once one of the top draws in the National Football League, have not been able to put people in the stands. So by helping the Raiders win games, Woodson can also bring fans back to the team. Woodson has had a great training camp, but last week was his coming-out party. Coach Jon Gruden raised some eyebrows on the coaching staff when he decided to start Woodson against the Green Bay Packers in a nationally televised game. The Packers have one of the best offenses in the game, and starting a rookie against that group is like throwing meat to the wolves. It turned out Gruden's decision was a smart one. In the first quarter, Woodson made a jarring hit against wide receiver Antonio Freeman that forced the ball loose. It was picked up by safety Eric Turner, who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. Later, quarterback Brett Favre threw Woodson's way once more, and the ball bounced off Freeman's chest with Woodson hounding him. The Raiders' defense caused three turnovers, and that was the biggest reason Oakland won, 27-21, giving the Packers their first loss at Lambeau Field since Sept. 17, 1995, a span of 33 games, including 5 exhibitions. For years, the Raiders have needed a toughening of their defense. Their offense has not been the problem, with the powerful arm of Jeff George at the helm. The problem has been drafting top defenders and finding solid defensive free agents, especially in the secondary. One of the most valuable positions on the field is cornerback, and if you can find a great one, it can free the rest of the defense to do other things. Woodson is what the Raiders have wanted for years. They tried with Larry Brown, the former Super Bowl most valuable player, but that turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. He is now with the Minnesota Vikings. ''Charles is really aggressive and alert,'' said Raiders corner Charles Allen, a six-time Pro Bowler. ''He doesn't seem like a rookie. He already understands how offenses will try to attack him.'' Willie Shaw, Oakland's defensive coordinator, said, ''As far as intelligence and feel for the game, he's probably ahead of most rookies I've seen.'' Last week in practice, the Raiders got a major scare when Woodson went down while backpedaling during a passing drill, injuring his knee. He was helped off the field before limping to the trainer's room. But the knee was only bruised, and he is scheduled to play against Tampa Bay tomorrow. Where Woodson can definitely help the Raiders, if the team wins, is bringing fans to the Oakland Coliseum. Because the Raiders won only four games last season, the team has 25,000 unsold season tickets for the 63,000-seat stadium, a staggering number for a professional football franchise. At this time last year, the Raiders had 21,000 unsold season tickets. Last season, the Raiders played before 18,000 empty seats a game in their home stadium, leaving attendance at 40,000 to 45,000 fans a game. By comparison, the last time the Giants averaged under 60,000 fans a game was the strike season of 1987. It may take some time for the Raiders to bring in those kinds of numbers. But Woodson will help the team get there. He is such a dynamic athlete, he could almost single-handedly change the fortunes for the Raiders, on the field and in the stands. Kicker Wide Right of Parcells Playing for Jets Coach Bill Parcells is tough enough, but for a kicker, it can be brutal. Just ask John Hall. Against the Giants on Thursday night, Hall flubbed three kickoffs and missed one extra point and a field goal. That did not make Parcells happy. The coach blasted Hall in front of just about the entire team in the locker room afterward, screaming that since his only job is to kick the ball he should be doing better at it. Normally, Hall is. Last season, many of his kickoffs would sail into the end zone. But last year means nothing to Parcells, which is why he brought in the former Green Bay kicker Brett Conway. He is either competition for Hall or his replacement. Debt Raised to Pay Rookies Quietly, the N.F.L. made a move that will affect the way teams sign players, especially high-priced rookies with huge signing bonuses and top free agents. Late last month, N.F.L. owners voted to raise the allowable debt limit a team can carry from $75 million to $100 million. In other words, a team can go $100 million into debt -- normally in the form of bank loans -- without the N.F.L.'s stepping in. The change was basically made because signing bonuses for rookies and veteran free agents are getting bigger and bigger. Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning recently received an $11.6 million bonus, a record for a rookie. Some teams pay for those bonuses by taking out loans. But as the bonuses have got bigger, so has the debt, and some teams found themselves needing the higher ceiling to afford those soaring salaries. One team was at the former limit of $75 million and could not sign its top two draft picks. When the new limit was approved, the owner took out a loan and was able to sign them. Some owners hate the new rule, saying the debt ceiling was already high enough, and some voted against it, including the Jets. At Camp Vermeil, Rams Ache One of the more intense camps in the N.F.L. this summer has been that of the St. Louis Rams. Coach Dick Vermeil runs double sessions of some three hours each. Players say there is more hitting and running than they have ever experienced at any level of their careers. They are complaining of dead legs, and the season begins in just a couple of weeks. Some of the coaches say their meetings are marathon sessions. Vermeil, they say, has endless energy, and he expects a lot from his coaches. ''I'm getting too old for this,'' joked one. Of course, if the Rams make the playoffs, something that has not happened since 1989, the players and coaches will feel like teen-agers.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 234-> Bearing Gifts Into the Dark Streets of Poverty
When the 11 P.M. Christmas Eve service ends at South Presbyterian Church here, most people will head back to warm, festive homes, some to sleep, some to become groggy Santas, preparing -- with ribbons, bows and imagined stealth -- for the vast transfer of merchandise just hours away. But two dozen or so will instead climb into vans and head 20 miles south to spend several hours with the homeless on Manhattan's streets. For more than a decade, Westchester groups have been making such nighttime treks three nights a week, bearing sandwiches, coffee, blankets and clothes into Manhattan's heart of poverty. This time, the trip -- which has come to be called a Midnight Run -- will have a holiday air, with seasonal cookies and drinks added. Midnight Run has become a significant institution in Westchester. More than 100 organizations -- churches, synagogues, schools, civic groups -- send groups now. But how did it start? Turn, for the answer, to one of those who will be climbing into a van, Joseph H. Gilmore, senior minister at South Presbyterian. On Saturday morning, Mr. Gilmore, a lanky, mop-haired man of 54, sat on the third floor of the manse, next to the church -- the Hudson River visible through bare trees, impeachment fury rising from the television below -- and told the tale. ''In 1982, I volunteered at a soup kitchen at 114th and Broadway,'' he said. ''Gradually, it wasn't enough to put soup down in front of people, and I started to sit down and say some version of 'How are you?' That was the awakening.'' Mr. Gilmore began to face the fact that the poor were more than just mouths to feed. ''If you display genuine interest in a life,'' he said, in measured tones, ''a story will unfold: here's why I'm in the streets. Here's what I'm afraid of. Here's what hurts. Here's how my life unraveled. Here's my plan. Here's my hope.'' Some people started asking for containers to take soup to those unable to come themselves. ''And that's where Midnight Run started,'' Mr. Gilmore said, ''with the generosity of the homeless themselves.'' The generosity did not stop there. ''Once, at 3 A.M.,'' he said, ''I was on the streets, and police cars converged from two directions. 'What are you doing?' one cop asked. 'I'm feeding the poor,' I said, ready to add, 'What's it to you?' But he pulled out a notebook and said, 'Look here for people, or look here.' '' Mr. Gilmore returned repeatedly to the theme that he was just the conduit and that the energy, the generosity, behind Midnight Run was born on the streets. But it was he who gave shape to that energy, who put that generosity on wheels. The first wheels: his old Volkswagen Beetle. ''I asked the congregation to bring in empty containers,'' he said, ''and I started driving in with three or four people to the soup kitchen.'' In early 1984, the church took in a half-dozen of the homeless for a few days and started a newsletter to tell others where to get a meal, where it was safe to sleep, where to get cardboard. ''Long before there was a Midnight Run,'' Mr. Gilmore said, ''there were people who would say, 'Here are the places where you will be treated like a human being.' '' While the homeless were staying at the church, a friend of Mr. Gilmore's filled a laundry basket with sandwiches, blankets and coffee and took them by train to Grand Central Terminal. ''The third or fourth time,'' he said, ''I finally went with her.'' Volunteers also parked a van next to the station and handed out food. ''But the able-bodied would get it first,'' he said. ''Fighting and shoving were the norm -- it made the line waiting to get food terrifically dangerous. ''A small community of the frail elderly were afraid of that line. So, I thought, why not load my VW with coffee and sandwiches and join others already going to find them? The first time I went, when I understood about kneeling in a doorway and asking, 'Is there anything you need?' -- that's when Midnight Run was born. I realized that by adding the tremendous resources in Westchester to the generosity of the poor themselves -- wow! ''There's a conspiracy of invisibility about the poor. There are no places to shower, no toilets. Each time you have to urinate in a corner, each time your body smells, there's damage done to the self. ''When you kneel down and ask, 'What do you need?' and a hand comes out of a cardboard box, and you are able to talk -- what that does is subvert that conspiracy. Somebody is noticed.'' He told of going up to one homeless man several years ago. ''I went through my litany -- Do you want coffee, a sandwich, a blanket? -- and he leaned into my arms sobbing. He'd been in New York three weeks, and nobody talked to him. What he was most desperate for was for someone to acknowledge him -- to say, I see you.'' In 1985, Midnight Run got its first vehicle, a donated station wagon. But Mr. Gilmore needed more than wheels. ''After a year or so, I was tired,'' he said, but stopping was not an option. ''I wrote a letter to the local clergy, and four or five congregations said, yes, we'll help. Now we took turns. But all the blankets and clothing piled up at South Presbyterian, and this became an issue here.'' Criticism is not new for him: He and the church have faced it for performing ''holy unions'' -- not, he stresses, ''marriages'' -- for gay couples. In 1986 came more wheels -- an old green-and-white bus given to him by a friend. Today, various battered vehicles later, the group has two vans, one a new one bought two years ago. As Mr. Gilmore focused more on the homeless, he occasionally put himself in their shoes. ''In 1987, I went to a conference on poverty in Washington and slept on the streets. On the third morning, in Union Station, I saw a woman with a young girl. I was missing my young daughters, and, forgetting how smelly I was, I went over, knelt down, and said, 'Hi, there.' The mother said, 'Get out of here, you creep.' '' He paused. ''I don't blame her.'' Why go at midnight? ''If you want to find the homeless in the same place, you have to go at night,'' because by day they are constantly told to move on. Mr. Gilmore couldn't remember just when the name Midnight Run was born. It just evolved. ''In the early days, we'd leave at 11, get to the streets about midnight. It was a run into the midnight darkness.'' ''As we got larger, we needed money, and people were very generous throughout Westchester,'' he said. Cash donations to Midnight Run as a whole typically run $100,000 or so a year, but add in the value of donated goods, and it is at least $1 million. Mr. Gilmore was visibly troubled by a society that tolerates homelessness. ''The health of the economy depends on fewer and fewer of us,'' he said. ''The homeless poor represent those among us who are not necessary to the economy, and that's scary. Midnight Run pays attention to bodies floating in the cultural stream -- but what's happening upstream? Why are those bodies there?'' His answer: this is ''a society of greed, as opposed to one in which there'd be enough for everybody.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 236-> Strike Called By Workers At SNET Over Contract
Workers at Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation went on strike early this morning after a midnight deadline for a new contract passed without a settlement. SNET, which provides phone service to nearly three million people in Connecticut, and the Communications Workers of America, which represents 6,300 workers negotiated through last night, but talks broke down and workers called a strike at one minute past midnight. Company officials said the strike will not affect local calls, but customers may experience some difficulty reaching directory assistance or getting new lines installed or repaired. Beverly Levy, a company spokeswoman, said SNET was prepared to assign managers to union jobs. ''We're still miles apart on major issues,'' said John Miceli, statewide mobilization coordinator for the communications workers union in Connecticut. ''If we were close and there was a reasonable proposal on the table, we would have extended the contract and continued to talk. But things don't look good at this point.'' While the company was willing to make progress in a two-tier wage structure where workers doing the same job where being paid different wages, the union contends that its workers, on average, are paid as much as 25 percent less than the industry standard. ''They weren't willing to come up to the standard,'' Mr. Miceli said. The union said it was willing to continue talks while the workers formed picket lines around company facilities and the homes of executives, but SNET officials balked at the idea and broke off talks. SNET had wanted to extend the expired contract another day while talks continued. ''The union has been unwilling to meet us halfway, and instead has chosen to call a strike. We have said all day that we are confident we could reach an amicable settlement. We had been making good progress,'' the company said in a written statement. Union officials said that as of Thursday, they had access to $170 million in strike funds paid in by 700,000 members across the country. ''We can wait this thing out indefinitely,'' Mr. Miceli said. Currently, 34,000 members of the communications workers union are on strike against US West, a regional Bell company based in Denver that provides telephone service to 25 million customers in 14 states. At issue is a company proposal of performance-based pay, a change in health benefits and mandated overtime, all of which the union opposes. SNET, which has agreed to be acquired by SBC Communications Inc., the nation's second largest local phone company, is seeking to keep its more experienced workers while cutting costs to compete with local carriers that use nonunion labor. SBC said it would honor any agreement reached.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 237-> The Picture of Bill Clinton
The sight of Bill Clinton striding into the White House in his role as Commander in Chief and the general support for his strike against terrorism remind us of the power inherent in even a wounded Presidency. It also reminds us, in the case of this particular Presidency, of its missing parts and of what might have been. The nation's immediate feelings about Mr. Clinton can be judged by the wide gaps between poll questions about his performance and those about his character. But now, if these last days of summer allow a breather for the President and the public, there may be time for deeper ruminations on the issues of trust and privacy in American politics. The polls indicate that more Americans trust Monica Lewinsky's word than Mr. Clinton's. Yet no one who voted for him -- or endorsed him as this page did -- had any illusions about his personal history. Indeed, everyone assumed that the public ''bimbo eruptions'' were just part of a much gamier story. Why then should Mr. Clinton be blamed for a failing that was known in advance and is shared by millions of citizens? The answer, we suggest, is the American people expect a measure of self-discipline and dignity from Presidents while in office. The Clintons' performance on ''60 Minutes'' in 1992 certainly encouraged voters to believe that he would carve out a window of discretion for the Presidential portion of his life. Even his most tolerant supporters would not have expected reckless behavior in the Oval Office. The plain fact, then, is that the standards of trust that Mr. Clinton had to meet were not set particularly high, but he managed through persistence to violate them. Does it follow that by dishonoring himself, Mr. Clinton has harmed trust in the Presidency? Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan, in their very different ways, demonstrated that not even the grander failures of Richard Nixon had permanently damaged American respect for the office. Equally exaggerated are the speculations that the already limited privacy rights of the Presidency have been ripped apart. It was, after all, Mr. Clinton who opened the door to his world, through attacks on former lovers, through the use of private detectives and through refusal to make a pragmatic settlement in the Paula Jones case. Ironically, the ''zone of privacy'' envisioned by Hillary Rodham Clinton may actually be enlarged for future Presidents, simply because viewing her husband's private life has been as jarring to adult eyes as getting a glimpse of the mess in an adolescent's room. Mr. Clinton's defenders keep arguing for a suspension of judgment about his personal failings on the grounds that the Presidency is being damaged as an institution by the powers of independent counsels and by the erosion of executive privilege. This White House's advancing of specious claims of executive and lawyer-client privilege has resulted in court rulings that some regard as constricting for future chief executives. Between them, Kenneth Starr and Attorney General Janet Reno have created terrible publicity for the Independent Counsel Act, putting Congress in the mood to dump it. The role of Congress is a key point. Any problems with privilege or independent counsels can be fixed by legislation and need not live on as a permanent memorial to the Clinton Presidency. So what will Mr. Clinton's memorial be? Part of it will be the dizzying week in which he became the first President to have to appear before a grand jury and then, at his political nadir, launched a bold military strike. His decisiveness illustrated how quickly a President can rewrite the lead on one day's news story. The event is also a reminder that fate and fortune may not be through with this President. But if he goes into history on the current basis, the picture of Mr. Clinton emerging from Marine One and moving with martial tread across the South Lawn will always be a sad one. For it will remind us not of how much was accomplished by Bill Clinton, but of how much was missing within him.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 238-> SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1998: COMPETITIONS; I Think I Can
Starting tomorrow, nearly 3,000 people from around the world will gather in London for the second annual Mind Sports Olympiad, a sort of Goodwill Games cum spelling bee for people who would rather flex their cerebral cortices than their muscles. Contestants square off, wonko a wonko, in more than 35 ''Mind Sports,'' including backgammon, bridge, checkers, chess (Chinese and regular), cribbage, Othello, poker and (thank goodness!) Stratego. One highlight is the Memoriad, where participants are tested on their ability to recall and regurgitate facts and figures: 100 names and faces, memorized in 15 minutes; a 2,000-digit binary number in an hour. Winners get cash prizes and medals. The event is the brainchild of Tony Buzan -- a smart guy and co-author (with Raymond Keene) of ''Buzan's Book of Genius'' -- who dreams of a world where ''more people watch us than any other sporting event.'' Is intellectual gymnastics really a sport? Absolutely, he says. ''In a major mind-sport match, a person uses as much muscular energy and oxygen as in a standard international soccer match.'' Good enough. Let the flexing begin.

Dec. 22, 1998-> 239-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Town and Country Player Comes Calling Again
He has gone from the Bronx to Bluegrass country. He has survived two days of staring at his telephone and waiting for a coach he met at a basketball camp to say he was good enough for the program that Rupp built. He has experienced two delirious minutes cutting down a national championship net for yet another coach who had inherited him. Then there's Heshimu Evans's Manhattan passage. He was reminded of that, too, today, when he looked up in the Continental Arena and saw his former Manhattan College coach, Fran Fraschilla, in the stands. Fraschilla was watching No. 3-ranked Kentucky get ready for Tuesday night's game with No. 2 Duke in the Jimmy V. Classic. It was Fraschilla's move to St. John's in 1996 that sent Evans, then a sophomore, to Kentucky. He was brought in by Rick Pitino, and was guided by Tubby Smith, Pitino's successor, to a national title last season. ''We had a break so I went and said hello; it was brief,'' Evans, a 6-foot-6-inch Wildcat senior, said after a closed practice here. ''I try to talk to Coach Fran as much as I can. I learned a lot from him.'' Coach Fran had vanished by the time Coach Smith turned his team loose on reporters today, but Evans, the Boston Road prodigy from Evander Child High School, has done everything but disappear for the 10-1 Wildcats. Last year, he was the Wildcats' sixth man, the frenetic particle that increased Kentucky's controlled chaos factor. This year he's a starter who is leading Kentucky in scoring and minutes played -- 14.8 points on 50 percent shooting in 28.7 minutes. He is tied for the team lead in assists, averaging 3.5, and is second in rebounds, with 6.1. Against second-ranked Maryland nine days ago, he scored a career-high 31 points in a 103-91 Wildcat victory. Off the court, according to Smith, Evans is so neat and regimented that it translates order to his teammates in a way that has the Wildcats' game as sharp as the crease in Evans's always-pressed pants. ''He's comfortable,'' Smith said. ''He's improved his outside shot. We've challenged him to be even more of a defender. I don't see much difference in the talented player who was at Manhattan to the athletes we have at Kentucky. Players are players.'' Evans has waited a long time for a coach to say that about his game, though when his collegiate odyssey began he had no idea it would be Smith who said it. In high school, Evans was a member of the famed summer league all-star team, the Gauchos. But he was a supporting player to teammates such as Felipe Lopez and Stephon Marbury, who wowed the college scouts. His best scholarship offers came from Xavier, Louisville and West Virginia, so Evans chose Manhattan, where his friend and mentor Fraschilla was building winners and his coaching profile. He was named the top freshman in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, then averaged 13.9 points to lead the Jaspers to a 17-12 record as a sophomore. But after the 1995-96 season, Fraschilla accepted the job at St. John's and promised Manhattan that he would not take any players with him. So Evans called Kentucky, where he had attended basketball camps. He started at the basketball office and asked for Pitino, but got passed to an assistant coach. He hesitated -- and what was planned as a bold request to become a Wildcat became a face-saving exercise in backpedaling: ''How about recommending a school?'' Evans asked. ''I was very, very nervous,'' Evans said, now able to smile. He waited, refusing to be out of ringing distance. One day. Nothing. A second day and the vigil begot an audience -- his mother, Eleanor, sisters, cousins, about 10 people, all waiting for Pitino to call. He did and Evans was Lexington-bound, though he had to sit out a year as a transfer. It was the year Kentucky would lose the national-championship game to Arizona. It also was Pitino's last year; he moved to the Boston Celtics, leaving Evans to believe that he might be back where he started. ''I didn't know him, but I was sure that if Rick and his staff thought he belonged here, he did,'' Smith said. ''I knew if he worked and he practiced hard against really good players, he'd help us.'' How much Evans contributed last year as perhaps college basketball's best sixth man was evident in the second half of the title game against Utah. Though his 8.8 points and 5.4 rebounds appear modest for a season, his points in one game helped spark Kentucky's dominating tournament run. With the Wildcats down 10 to the Utes, Evans went on a two-minute scoring binge that trimmed the lead to 5 points, kicked Kentucky into high gear, and put him on a ladder and in position to cut the net from the rim after the game. ''The goal is to get back to that place again,'' Evans said. ''But you don't think of that, only the next team on the schedule.'' Tuesday night, it is Duke, in a game not far from Evans's home, before 89 friends and family members. Evans says he doesn't think too hard about how Fraschilla left him or how Pitino bolted for Boston. Or how he and Smith -- neither of whom had anything to do with the other being at Kentucky -- need each other to defend Kentucky's national title. ''It just worked out for me,'' he said. ''That's all.''

Aug. 23, 1998-> 240-> Some Favorite Old Things in Stamford
IT was a whimsical thought turned into a summer exhibition: ''A Few of Our Favorite Things,'' at the Stamford Historical Society's Hoyt Barnum House in downtown Stamford invites the public into a former blacksmith's circa 1699 home for a house-enhancing exhibition. ''At the heart of every historical society is its collections, and the Stamford Historical Society is no exception,'' said Linda Baulsir, the society's executive director. ''For this exhibit the society's board members, past and present, were invited to select an object that had special appeal to them, and represented the time frame 1641 to 1850.'' Their choices illustrate the diversity of the collections as well as hint at life in Stamford in that earlier time. The little red post-and-beam house, now enclosed by a corporate world, has been spruced up. ''We spent last year painting and doing grounds work,'' Ms. Baulsir said. ''We removed the 1920's garage, so now the property looks as it probably did in the mid-1800's. When you stand in the back of the property you can almost imagine what it looked like before modern Stamford started to encroach.'' Surrounded by the police station, a new 12-story courthouse rising as its backdrop, and across the street a hotel, ''it's a bit of precious preservation,'' added Margaret Bowen, a volunteer on the collection committee. ''It's over an acre of open space and a rare piece of landscape to be found in downtown Stamford.'' Objects are arranged in the Hoyt bedroom, a hearth room graced with traditional fireside implements and a parlor. Then there is the buttery, its name derived from storing staples like grain and flour in the hollowed-out butt of a tree. There are about 31 objects or groups of objects in the house. And, of course, as is the point in this exhibition, everyone has a favorite. The reasons are shared on labels. One highlight, the oldest object in the show, is a 17th-century English or Dutch cradle. It was probably made for a Puritan family and combines red oak with yellow wood inlay and carvings of doves, the sun and a tree of life. ''The wonderful symbolism in the carved details speak to us of the faith and hope of the family,'' said Brian O'Neill, a former board member now on the Stamford Board of Representatives. A display of early lighting devices including, among others, a tin petticoat lamp, a camphene lamp and a lamp stand, were chosen by Donald Levine, former owner of an electrical supply and lighting fixture house. ''They speak for themselves,'' Mr. Levine said. A friendship quilt, with multicolored stars signed by friends, gussies up the bed in the Hoyt bedroom. Jane Connochie chose it because of her penchant for quilts and the feeling that ''quilting was a very important creative and social outlet for women in the 1800's.'' An American sampler, now gracing a wall, was made in 1842 by a 10-year-old named Mary Jane, a direct descendant of Samuel Hait (later called Hoyt). ''Mary Jane's father was the master of a schooner and is buried in Baltimore, Md.,'' writes Grace Bounty of her choice. Other favorites include Margaret Bowen's selection, a Windsor highchair; Gwen Ketchum's portrait doll with painted kid and neck; Valerie Hermann's child's sled, its runners ending in graceful double curls; Dodie Acklie Nakajima's commemorative redware plate and Dr. Bernard O. Nemoitin's folk art child's chest. On the entrance wall is an affidavit, dated 1692, attesting to the character of a woman accused of witchcraft. And in the back, just for fun, is ''Betsey's Buttery, Collectible and Not Quite Antique Shop'' for browsing and shopping. The collections help interpret the past -- ''the way people lived, worked and died, the clothes they wore, the political climate, the evolution of Stamford from its agricultural beginnings to the computer age 'edge city' reputation it enjoys today,'' Ms. Baulsir said. Hoyt Barnum House, 713 Bedford Street, Stamford (parking across the street at Stamford Suites Hotel), open Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 4 P.M. through Sept. 6. The number to call for further information is (203) 329-1183.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 241-> Percentage Game
To the Sports Editor: Dave Anderson's column (''Yanks Chase the Ghosts of 1906 Cubs,'' The Times, Aug. 7) on the Yankees' pursuit of the record for the most victories in a season now held by the 1906 Cubs missed an important point. If the 1998 Yanks win 117 games and beat the 1906 Cubs' record of 116 victories, the Yanks' winning percentage will be .722, assuming they play all 162 scheduled games. The 1906 Cubs' winning percentage was a much better .763 because they played only 152 games that season. To really beat the 1906 Cubs, the Yanks will have to win 124 games to have the best one-season winning percentage in major league baseball history. This may be akin to the old debate over the Maris vs. Ruth single-season home run record, but the distinction was not totally lost then and should not be lost now. THOMAS D. UCKO Summit, N.J.

Nov. 15, 1998-> 251-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW: THE BIG EAST; UConn Has Physical Edge, and Seeks a Mental One
The reasoning goes like this: A team that finished with a record of 32-5 last season and returns five starters should be great this season. Maybe even a national champion. Coach Jim Calhoun of CONNECTICUT does not argue with the logic, but he will argue that his team is not great yet. Calhoun is hoping that if the mind is conditioned for greatness, the body will follow. For the first time in his 13 years at UConn, Calhoun has enlisted a psychiatrist to counsel his players. He said the head games he plays to make his charges work harder can only go so far. A few of his players need to boost their self-esteem, he said, and all of them could use help on focusing through the blur of expectations. ''I want them to understand the interdependence they have on each other,'' Calhoun said after the Huskies' public scrimmage at Hartford Civic Center last week. ''We do truly not just need our talent. We really need to be tight together. That's what made us so good last year.'' A crowd of 6,000 showed up at the Civic Center just to watch the Huskies play each other. Calhoun feels the love of his loyal following, but the flip side is never far away. UConn opens today against Quinnipiac at Storrs, Conn., and the state is restless. Connecticut, the Big East's most prolific winner of the decade, has made the final eight of the national tournament three times but has never advanced to the Final Four. Calhoun said the Huskies got a bad break last season when they faced North Carolina and lost, 75-64, in a home game for the Tar Heels disguised as a regional final in Greensboro, N.C. This time, UConn, picked No. 1 in several preseason rankings, is expected to create the bad breaks. The doctor is in. ''I don't really get down with people like that,'' said the junior Richard Hamilton, last year's Big East player of the year. ''I'll have to go in another room.'' The Huskies will most likely forgive Hamilton's aversion to therapy, considering his 21.5-point average last season. The 6-foot-6-inch swingman can hurt opponents with a slash to the basket or a perimeter jump shot. A legitimate concern is whether Hamilton can avoid hurting himself. A deep thigh bruise hampered him his freshman season, and a broken right foot he sustained during training for the world championships in July has slowed his preparation. The sophomore point guard Khalid El-Amin (16 points and 4 assists a game), the Big East's rookie of the year, gives UConn energy and nerve. This is where the exclamation marks end and the question marks begin. The Huskies' other three starters -- forward Kevin Freeman (10.3 points, 6.6 rebounds), guard Ricky Moore (7.5 points) and center Jake Voskuhl (6.9 points, 7.1 rebounds) -- must expand their supporting roles, Calhoun said. The swingman Rashamel Jones (4.4 points), the frontliner Souleymane Wane (1.9 points), forward Edmund Saunders and guard E. J. Harrison will vie for playing time in Calhoun's eight-man rotation. Can any team in the Big East stop the Huskies? ''I don't think anybody is going to mail them the trophy,'' Georgetown Coach John Thompson said. SYRACUSE, 26-9 and a round-of-16 qualifier last season, returns forward Ryan Blackwell (12.6 points, 8.2 rebounds), guard Jason Hart (10.2 points) and perhaps the Big East's best center, Etan Thomas (11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds). Mike Jarvis, the new coach at ST. JOHN'S, has the brashness of forward Ron Artest (11.6 points, 6.3 rebounds), the promise of the freshman point guard Erick Barkley and a bevy of role players. MIAMI, which squeezed into the 1998 national tournament with an 18-10 mark, will count on forward Tim James (16.8 points, 9.4 rebounds). PITTSBURGH is capable of breaking into the upper pack, but its ironman guard, Vonteego Cummings (19.5 points, 40.1 minutes a game), could use some comp time. GEORGETOWN has two capable guards in the newcomers Anthony Perry and Kevin Braswell, but the Hoyas looked weak under the basket in opening losses to Temple and Illinois. VILLANOVA, behind guard John Celestand (13.2 points), could crack .500. RUTGERS will need more production from guard Geoff Billet (13.9 points, 4.1 assists) and forward Rob Hodgson (13.2 points, 5.4 rebounds) to offset a shortage of big people to score and muscle up. The swingman Jeff Greer (10 points) adds an athletic touch. WEST VIRGINIA, 24-9 last season, could suffer the most drastic fall in the conference, returning just the reserve forward Marcus Goree (8 points, 5.2 rebounds). Count on the Mountaineers to press and gamble. Tommy Amaker of SETON HALL has proved he can coach, squeezing 15 victories out of a marginal team last season. But can he recruit? Point guard Shaheen Holloway (15 points, 6.5 assists) needs help immediately. Guard Gary Saunders, a transfer from Georgia Tech, should provide offensive punch. Duane Jordan (6.5 points, 6.7 points) is the best returning player from an uninspiring front line. The Hall lost early to Indiana (understandable) and to graduation-depleted Valparaiso (hmm). PROVIDENCE Coach Tim Welsh inherits Jamel Thomas (18.5 points, 6.9 rebounds) and not much else. At BOSTON COLLEGE, the unexpected departure of Kostas Maglos to the Greek professional league leaves the Eagles with one part-time starter back, guard Kenny Harley (4.5 points). NOTRE DAME no longer has Pat Garrity; it has center Phil Hickey (10.7 points, 8 rebounds), a promising point guard in Martin Ingelsby (6.6 points, 5.6 assists) and a cold winter ahead.

Sept. 9, 1998-> 253-> $25 AND UNDER; From Afghanistan, a Patchwork of Cuisines
THE food of mountainous Afghanistan is simple and satisfying, and much of it seems familiar, as well. The kebabs that are the specialty of this bright, pleasant restaurant, which opened just last month, resemble those found at Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern restaurants. The rice and curries come from India, the dumplings may be Chinese and the yogurt may be Russian. The combination of all these elements, though, is purely Afghan, reflecting the country's surroundings and suggesting the waves of other cultures that have tried, over the years, to make Afghanistan their own. Balkh, named after a town north of Kabul, is a simple restaurant with a breezy garden in the rear. The dining room is adorned with colorful rugs and oil paintings, including a portrait of a somewhat stern, berobed fellow who is not a political or religious figure, as I had assumed, but a popular singer -- ''the Sinatra of Afghanistan,'' I was told. The waitresses are friendly and helpful, and the owners, Mohammad Nasim and Abdul Jabeer, make it a point to stop by your table to make sure everything is all right. Kebabs may be the restaurant's namesake, but for me the highlight of the menu is the dumplings -- either ashak ($5), a lacy ravioli stuffed with scallions and served in a wonderful sauce of yogurt and grilled onions, or manto ($6), stuffed with ground beef and served in the same sauce. Bolani ($4) is another excellent appetizer, flat bread stuffed with potato puree, fried crisp and served with a soothing yogurt sauce. Main courses come with enormous portions of rice, like kabli kofta ($8), in which a mountain range of brown rice is blended with sweet cooked carrots, raisins and bits of tender lamb, along with a side dish of lamb meatballs in tomato sauce. Sabzey chalow ($7), a mild lamb and spinach curry, likewise comes with a heap of white rice. Most dishes are served mild, and benefit from a jolt of the vinegary green hot sauce on the table. A dish of turshie ($2), spicy pickled vegetables, also helps. Kebabs, though the specialty, are the least interesting of the dishes. The tika kebab ($5), grilled chunks of lamb, and the keema kebab ($5), cylinders of ground beef, are fine, but both the morgh kebab ($5), made with boneless chicken breast, and the salmon kebab ($5) are overly dry. The menu at Balkh is fairly limited, missing some of the more interesting Afghan vegetarian dishes, like stewed pumpkin and baked turnips. And the restaurant does not serve alcohol, but it does serve lassi ($1), the yogurt drink, in either refreshingly sweet or salty versions. The only dessert is the ubiquitous rice pudding ($2), made here Indian style, very creamy and flavored with rose water. But if you are lucky, you may be offered a free bite of sherperah, a wonderful sweet pistachio pastry that is reminiscent of marzipan. As you leave, be sure to take a spoonful of the blend of fennel seeds, coconut and sugar resting in a bowl on the counter. It is a remarkably effective palate cleanser. Balkh Shish Kabab House 23-10 31st Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 721-5020. BEST DISHES: Ashak, manto, bolani, kabli kofta, sabzey chalow, turshie, tika kebab, keema kebab, lassi, rice pudding.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 257-> Subway Rape Raises Concern About Reduced Train Crews
The news that a woman had been raped this weekend aboard a G train operated without a conductor shocked women riding the line yesterday -- but the assault was not the only source of their dismay. ''I thought every train had a conductor on it,'' said a passenger, Carol Johnson, as she waited yesterday for the G train at the Smith-Ninth Streets station in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. ''Now I'll be looking. If I don't see someone, I'm not going to get on a train.'' Riders like Ms. Johnson, 41, who transfers to the G train every day on her way from Coney Island to her job as a housekeeper in Clinton Hill, may not have much of a choice. To save money, New York City Transit has been operating G trains without a conductor on late nights, weekends and holidays for five months. When the change was started, transit officials said the G train, which snakes through Brooklyn and Queens, was selected because it was one of a handful of lightly used lines. Yesterday, transit officials said they would not make a decision about continuing or suspending the practice based only on the Saturday night assault. ''One incident can't make or break anything,'' said James Anyansi, a transit agency spokesman. As of Aug. 9, 10 rapes had been reported in the city's subway system, according to the latest figures available from the Police Department. The police had no information yesterday on whether any had occurred on trains without conductors. By the end of September last year, there had been only one rape in the subway system. Normally, trains are staffed with an operator, who runs the train, and a conductor, who opens and closes the doors and makes announcements. The practice of running one-person trains, on which the operator assumes the conductor's responsibilities, was begun nearly two years ago on several short shuttle trains, including the Franklin Avenue line in Brooklyn and the Rockaway Park line in Queens. The Transport Workers Union Local 100 and some riders' groups have vehemently opposed the practice, but transit officials said their own studies of the shuttle lines showed the one-person trains to be safe. Other riders' groups expressed support for the change, saying the cost savings would allow the city to run trains more often, drawing more riders and making the system safer. The transit agency had announced plans to start one-person operations on nights and weekends on the C line, as well as on the 6 line north of 125th Street in Manhattan. Yesterday, Mr. Anyansi said those plans had been postponed until the G train practice has been evaluated. He said he did not know how much money had been saved. Saturday's attack prompted a riders group, the Straphangers Campaign, to urge the agency to suspend the one-person operations. ''I don't know the circumstances of this particular crime,'' Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer with the group, said yesterday. ''But putting that to one side, we believe that conductors on subway cars are an important deterrent to crime, both by their physical presence and their quick ability to signal for help.'' At the Smith-Ninth Streets station, the first stop on the G line, each four-car train that left yesterday morning was without a conductor. Occasionally, a car was altogether empty or carrying only one or two riders. At the same station shortly after 11:30 P.M. on Saturday night, a 21-year-old woman boarded such a train. The police did not say where she was going, only that her attacker was her sole companion in the car. The police said she was robbed and raped before the train reached the Fulton Street station, the fifth station on the line, where the attacker left. The woman was treated at Brooklyn Hospital Center and released. By yesterday evening, no arrests had been made. The Smith-Ninth Streets station's steep, often empty escalators and corners boarded up for construction make it one of the less inviting in the city. Women waiting on the long open-air platform yesterday said the station could be desolate at night. They spoke of how they preferred a packed car, or one with a conductor nearby. And they wondered aloud, with considerable anger, how they would manage with only a train operator several cars away. ''If something happens, somebody has to walk all the way over to the motorman?'' asked Cheryl Waymer, 34, of Red Hook, clutching her 4-year-old daughter to her lap. ''By that time, you could be raped or killed or whatever.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 258-> Sole Gay Synagogue Finds Itself Robust at 25
In 1973, Jacob Gubbay, a Jew from India, placed a tiny classified advertisement in The Village Voice that read ''Gay Synagogue: Friday Night Service.'' Ten people turned up at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Ninth Avenue and West 28th Street. A year later, Mr. Gubbay moved to Australia, but what he left behind -- the foundation of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, the first and still the only synagogue for gay people in New York -- has expanded and thrived against a backdrop of social change. As it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, the congregation has grown so large that for Friday evening services -- the most heavily attended of the week -- it has had to move out of its quarters in the Westbeth complex at 57 Bethune Street and back to its original site at the church. Last week, in a joyous ceremony, members carried Torahs into the church to mark their return to a former home. The move is not intended to be permanent. The congregation's leadership is beginning discussions this month on a capital campaign so it can buy or build its own synagogue. The congregation has about 800 dues-paying members and hundreds more who regularly attend services, classes and concerts. For the High Holidays, it moves to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to accommodate the 3,000 or more people who come to pray. ''It is interesting to think of what the world was like 25 years ago,'' said the congregation's rabbi, Sharon Kleinbaum, who was hired in 1992 after 19 years of lay leadership. ''There were no gay rights organizations, no lesbian or gay community services, no Gay Men's Health Crisis. AIDS was not recognized until 1981. Not one national Jewish organization supported gay rights nor did any synagogue welcome gay people on an official basis. ''At a time when religion was often the place where people were most deeply rejected, a small group came together with the radical idea that it was possible to live both openly gay and proudly Jewish,'' she continued. One sign of the mainstream Jewry's increasing acceptance of the synagogue came this year when the Jewish Continuity Foundation of the UJA-Federation of New York, the prominent philanthropic organization, gave it a four-year $168,000 grant to expand educational efforts. The first year's funds were used to establish Lehrhaus (House of Learning), which has 18 faculty members and offers courses for adults in topics from Talmud and Hebrew to ''Biblical Perspectives on Coming Out.'' A children's program is planned for next year. ''This is one of the big changes since 1973,'' Rabbi Kleinbaum said. ''No one in the original group could have imagined that we would be exploring the question of Sunday school, but there is a baby boom going on now among gays and lesbians. People are giving birth to children, they are adopting or they have children from previous heterosexual relationships.'' Rabbi Kleinbaum herself is bringing up two daughters with her partner. The response to the synagogue within Judaism falls along predictable lines -- the Orthodox branch rejects it outright, the Conservative accepts gay worshipers but not gay rabbis, and the Reform and Reconstructionist offer unqualified approval. Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, which represents 800 synagogues around the country, said, ''My hope is that the day will come when all people would be comfortable in all synagogues and there wouldn't be a need for a separate synagogue for gays and lesbians.'' Though many gay people attend ''mainstream'' synagogues, members of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah say they could not possibly leave their spiritual home, nor could they duplicate in other congregations the bonds they have with their fellow worshippers and their rabbi. Take, for example, the case of Mark Janover, whose partner, Clinton Wilding Smith, bought him a membership before dying of AIDS three years ago. Mr. Janover found Rabbi Kleinbaum to be a source of steadfast support. ''She was at my house the night he died, and the next morning showed up to get things set up and determined what I wanted to do,'' he said. ''She called my father and my aunt and told my sisters to come to Friday services with me to say Kaddish,'' the Jewish mourning prayer, he said. In his loss, Mr. Janover said, his connections deepened. ''There are not a lot of other places to get validation as an AIDS widow,'' he said. Two weeks after Mr. Smith died, Rabbi Kleinbaum gave Mr. Janover an assignment: ''Somebody's partner just died, and she wanted me to give him comfort,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Rabbi, my Clinton is barely cold,' to which she responded: 'Mark, you know a week's worth more about grief. You could help him and lead the way.' '' Now Mr. Janover, who has AIDS himself, leads a committee of 75 people who visit the sick. When he was hospitalized with dementia, he said: ''I would call people at 3 A.M. and they came. I wouldn't be alive today if not for the love and support of that community.'' Rita Fisher, who was stunned when her son Jay announced 14 years ago that he was gay, found herself marching up the aisle for a double ceremony in 1993: renewal of her vows with her husband, Alex, who has since died, and a commitment ceremony for her son and his partner, Michael Lehrman. ''Whoever dreamed, in my wildest dreams, that I would walk my child down that aisle,'' she said. When they went to the synagogue in 1975, Connie Kurtz, the mother of two, including a Hasidic son, and Ruth Berman, mother of three, were struggling with what it meant to be a lesbian couple after having been in longterm marriages. Ms. Kurtz was the first to attend services at the synagogue. It was there, ''I discovered that I could be a whole human being, a mother, lover, Jewish woman activist, that I didn't have to fragment myself,'' she said. ''All these things extended from the synagogue and I shared that with Ruthie who was in such turmoil.'' For Ms. Berman, the synagogue helped clear the path on her journey from heterosexual marriage to lesbian partnership. ''It was important in my personal coming out to accept the fact that I was O.K. as a lesbian, that I could practice being a Jew fully, excitedly, joyously.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 259-> PRO BASKETBALL; N.B.A. Players Say a Settlement Is Near
As if the season were nearing the halfway point, Karl Malone has been running hills, lifting weights and playing pickup games with Utah Jazz teammates. His feelings about the labor dispute resemble those of most of his locked-out peers -- he thinks the owners' offer is fair, and he believes there will be a season. ''It's not even something I'm thinking about, that there might not be a season,'' Malone said before he and a group of National Basketball Association All-Stars played a game for charity here on Saturday night. ''This isn't one of those games where you say, 'This might be the only game we play.' '' Tim Hardaway, whose 19 fourth-quarter points led his team to victory, said: ''Come on, you know we're going to be playing. It's just a matter of time for them to work things out and take care of business.'' Either 430 players are not taking seriously N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern's comments about losing the season, or they know something the rest of America does not, and perhaps a settlement is close. Stern and Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, waged an Express Mail war last week. After Stern forwarded the league's most recent proposals to the players on Wednesday and Hunter issued a response on Friday, both sides said they were far apart on many key economic issues. Yet most players who competed in The Game on Showtime on Saturday sounded as if training camps would open by mid-January. To have between a 40- and 50-game season, the season will have to start by the first week of February. ''To me, a deal is just about in place,'' Malone said. ''I was looking at what Stern sent to us in the mail. It's a fair deal, but some things still need to happen for us to accept it.'' Malone said that the majority of the players would probably accept the owners' proposal, a statement that could hurt the union's leverage as it heads for the final stages of negotiations. To which Hunter replied, ''Karl has his own opinion.'' An agreement would not be voted on by the union's general body until the players' negotiating committee approved the deal. And it should be noted that Malone's public musings have been more provocative than substantive. He had said that he would not play in Utah again, but recanted a few days later. But his comments reflect a feeling among players that the owners and players will figure out how to divide the league's $2 billion in annual revenue before the season is lost. Stern has left for Aspen, Colo., and plans to spend at least a few days at his vacation home. Hunter is expected to leave for his home in Oakland, Calif., early this week. Neither union nor league lawyers expected more talks before Christmas. During a Dec. 12 negotiation, the players made a major concession by suggesting a $10 million limit on the amount paid to players with less than seven years of experience -- Kevin Garnett, who was the fifth pick in the 1995 draft, is scheduled to make about $14 million this season. But the owners are still trying to limit high-end salaries. While both sides are close on other issues, they cannot agree on the percentage at which an escrow system would be triggered. The players' lowest offer is believed to be 56 percent, and the owners are at 53.5 percent. Meanwhile, a group of current and former All-Stars played one of the few organized games since last season. Some, like Shawn Kemp and Patrick Ewing, appeared a month away from N.B.A. game shape. Others, like Hardaway, Malone and Reggie Miller, looked as if they could play 48 minutes today. ''It was nice to finally get up and down the court and see some fans in the stands again,'' Hardaway said. ''No question, it will take a while to get all of them back after this is over. But we'll do what we have to do to get it done.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 263-> Sports of The Times; Men's Game Displays a One-Name Marquee, and It Says Sampras
THE storm came. The storm passed, much like the unfocused lightning in Marat Safin's racquet. Pete Sampras weathered the wave of humidity, a touch of tension, posed by an 18-year-old with a future which, for the sake of men's tennis, can't come soon enough. For the time being, though, it was business as usual at the United States Open yesterday. Sampras took care of the rookie Safin in the Round of 16, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, and then went home to wait on Andre Agassi, which he has been doing for most of his professional tennis life. It was a long, unfruitful wait. On the brink of elimination last night, trailing by two sets and by 2-4 in the third to Karol Kucera of Slovakia, Agassi resorted to boorish, Connors-like tactics. His mimicking of Kucera's aborted service tosses and his moon-balling tactics won him the third set. When more rain came, Agassi led an obviously distracted Kucera, 3-0. The Agassi-Sampras quarterfinal the Open has been counting on for a surge of electricity was still alive. Though that in itself would not make this tournament, any more than it has saved this decade from being pretty much a one-man show. ''It's not going to happen with one match,'' said Sampras, never happy when people fail to appreciate the effort it takes to carry his sport, year after year. It was unfair to expect heavy lifting from Safin, the latest tennis teen-age titan, as even he had predicted the other day that he had ''no chance'' against the world's No. 1. Sampras again demonstrated that he is unimpressed by raw power. If you want to push him on the hardcourts of the Open, you'd better be able to keep the ball in play. Safin had a few moments, in the form of two early service games, when he forcefully announced himself from Russia, at love. Then, as the sky darkened in biblical proportions over Arthur Ashe Stadium, Sampras broke Safin at 15 in the 10th game with a reflex volley forehand to win the first set. By the time they returned, two hours later, Safin may as well have been back in Moscow, 12 years old and unable to beat Anna Kournikova, the reigning kid queen of his club. ''The first set, I couldn't believe the pace of his serve,'' Sampras said, referring to the 130-mile-an-hour blurs. ''I heard from other players he had a big game. But you need to find that medium game. If I were coaching him, he doesn't have to hit the ball so hard.'' While Safin and a few others learn the difference between touch and go, the men's game will continue in its holding pattern, waiting for someone with Sampras-like talent to show up and stick around at the top. That's where Agassi was supposed to be, challenging Sampras's serve-and-volley precision with his baseline power. Beyond one glorious year, when he was No. 1, Agassi has proved most adept at making the art of reinvention routine. Agassi has taken too much grief for this, for not having Sampras's resolve in the ranking. The truth is that he has been more the rule than the exception, since the big money came into tennis and allowed the best players a life-style cushion when they began to mentally flab out in their tennis middle age. The Bjorn Borg-John McEnroe rivalry lasted only until Borg realized right here at the Open that he couldn't beat McEnroe, and then he slipped into a limousine and into retirement. When McEnroe, in turn, surrendered the hill to Ivan Lendl a few years later, his passions soon turned to music and art. Boris Becker said goodbye last year at Wimbledon, the lawn he loved most, by shaking the hand of the new champ, Sampras, and wishing him well. Sampras doesn't win every Grand Slam, and could very well lose tomorrow if he has to face Kucera, who hammered him in January at the Australian Open. He actually twice fell to No. 2, on computer points, earlier this year. But this is how serious the sport is about Marcelo Rios, who briefly displaced Sampras in the ranking and was seeded second here: While Rios was facing elimination in the fifth set against Magnus Larsson on Sunday night, the USA Network broadcasting team, starring Mad Dog McEnroe, was fielding phone calls from fans. With Safin a memory, with Agassi fighting for survival, someone wanted to know if Sampras thought the defending champion, Patrick Rafter, had achieved superstar status. Sampras's smile almost turned to laughter. ''To do it for many, many years is a true sign,'' he said, diplomatically. ''That's the way I look at it.'' He has always saved most of his compliments for Agassi, his Nike compatriot, who proved in 1995 he had the style and talent to be No. 1 and proved again last night that he can stir emotions and make the match. Agassi just never had what it took to stay in focus, in position. No one has, and it remains to be seen if anyone soon will. ''Oh, very tough, I think I can't play this game,'' Safin said, when asked if he had his sights set on Sampras. ''To be half of Pete Sampras is enough for me.'' Men's tennis, unfortunately, needs more than that.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 264-> Patents; Wearing a computer may be more fashionable when the processor isn't part of the ensemble.
WEARABLE computers are considerably less geeky than they used to be. But the day when the average American wears one as nonchalantly as a Walkman CD player is still several years in the future. When that day does come, though, the Xybernaut Corporation contends that it will be poised to reap the rewards from a patent portfolio that it has been building since the early 1990's. This month Xybernaut received its ninth and, the company says, most substantial American patent. The latest patent covers, for example, a headset operated by a remote computer through radio, satellite or cellular transmissions. ''That means you don't have to wear the processor,'' said James Ralabate, who was the Xerox Corporation's general patent counsel during the 1970's and who is now with Xybernaut. ''You could have several headsets functioning off a remote host computer, for example,'' he said. ''And it covers three types of activation: voice, eye and brain activation.'' Not that Xybernaut has such a product on the market just yet. Last week it announced its latest model: a mostly speech-activated computer powered by a 22-ounce processor that straps onto a person's belt and contains 128 megabytes of RAM and a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive. This version has a head-mounted display system, which gives the same viewing ability as a 15-inch monitor viewed at two feet, the company says. ''What you're wearing on your belt is essentially your laptop,'' said Michael Jenkins, chief technology officer at Xybernaut. Among those testing Xybernaut's technology, the company says, are the United States Customs Service, Mercedes-Benz, Lockheed-Martin, and the United States Navy. Xybernaut's president, Edward G. Newman, called the latest patent the linchpin in the company's patent portfolio. ''With this you can have multiple headsets operated by a remote computer, like nodes on a network,'' he said. ''It totally frees up the paradigm of wearables. This is the patent we've been waiting for.'' The actual technology will require more waiting, however. The company said it could not say exactly when such computers would be on the market. Xybernaut received patent 5,844,824. Using Trees As Grave Markers Many patents cover gravestones, coffins and other aspects of the funeral industry. But Mac Truong of New York City has patented an altogether different concept: the planting of trees to pay tribute to the dead. The patent covers trees ''grown from seed or seedling in a nutrient composition featuring the dirt-like material, preferably ashes, derived from the remains of a deceased human.'' Mr. Truong envisions a ''memorial forest,'' with each tree bearing a plaque identifying the person whose ashes the tree was grown in. He received patent 5,799,488. Royalties Rise At Universities The amount of money that universities received in patent royalties more than doubled in five years, according to a report released last week by the Association of University Technology Managers. Universities and research institutions received $611 million in licensing fees during 1997, up from $248 million in 1992. Even so, licensing income in 1997 was less than 2.5 percent of the total that universities spent during the year on overall research. The universities reaping the most from patents in 1997 were the University of California ($67 million), Stanford ($51.7 million), Columbia ($50 million), Florida State ($29.9 million) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ($21 million). Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 265-> TV SPORTS; No. 61 Leaves No Time For Poetry
Mark McGwire slugged his 61st home run with such ferocity yesterday that Jon Miller of ESPN could not muster a classic call. Miller was jolted out of a discussion of Roger Maris's family and the health woes that prevented Maris's widow, Pat, from attending the game when McGwire unleashed. ''That ball is gone if it's fair,'' Miller said, providing the basics. ''It is a home run. No. 61. He has tied Maris.'' Miller then said nothing for 1 minute 45 seconds as a montage of 25 images rolled by -- from McGwire picking up his son, Matthew, to McGwire's parents embracing to the Cubs' Sammy Sosa applauding in right field -- before he added, ''Ray Lankford is the hitter, although I don't think anyone has noticed.'' On KMOX-AM, Jack Buck set up the count and the matchup between McGwire and Cubs pitcher Mike Morgan, then said: ''Lookit there. Lookit there. Lookit there. McGwire's No. 61. Flight 61, headed for Planet Maris. History. Bedlam. What a moment. Pardon me while I stand to applaud.'' On Saturday, to call McGwire's 60th home run, Buck also made sure his words would enliven eternity's highlight reel, saying: ''Wake up, Babe Ruth, you're about to have company. And his name is Mark McGwire.'' That call echoed Milo Hamilton's of Hank Aaron's 715th home run: ''There's a new home run champion of all time, and his name is Henry Aaron.'' Fox made McGwire the undisputed centerpiece of its telecasts. And rightly so. Who else cared Saturday or Sunday about a Reds-Cardinals game? Why else would Fox lobby for Sunday's game, then switch its start time from 2 to 4 P.M.? ''If you think the first three innings of this game have had a slant toward Mark McGwire,'' Joe Buck, Jack's son, said on Sunday, ''you're right.'' On Sunday, Fox spent 26 minutes 53 seconds focused on McGwire -- Fox's cameras found him 132 times -- in the St. Louis dugout, the on-deck circle, at first base, running the bases, at bat. Consequential time was spent with a camera lingering almost longingly on shots of McGwire's back, mostly as he stood at the Cardinals' helmet rack. Yesterday, with the story line McGwire and his 60 home runs versus Sosa and his 58, ESPN put McGwire in a far brighter spotlight. McGwire's first-inning home run made ESPN's choice easy, but ESPN almost froze out Sosa. McGwire would naturally get more time, largely because there are many more plays at first base than in right field. But ESPN favored McGwire with many more long dugout and on-deck shots, and many more of his reactions to Sosa's at-bats than Sosa's expressions when McGwire was batting. ESPN simply seemed to have better camera angles for McGwire than for Sosa. ESPN's cameras cut to McGwire 180 times, totaling 26:55, nearly twice Sosa's 14:49, in 64 sightings. Both networks were in excellent form. Joe Buck enhanced his standing as the best play-by-play announcer after Vin Scully, and ESPN's Joe Morgan keeps battling Tim McCarver for analytic supremacy. Morgan aptly used his memory of standing at second base when Hank Aaron hit his 714th home run, while McCarver argued vociferously for his friend Maris's induction into the Hall of Fame. ESPN deftly used split-screen videos to compare McGwire's and Sosa's swings as well as the leveling of the uppercut in McGwire's swing, from 1991 to 1998. But for McGwire's 61st home run, why didn't ESPN break out its vaunted Bat Track, which would have measured the bat speed of the historic home run? Fox will carry tonight's Cubs-Cardinals game at 8 o'clock Eastern time, which will pre-empt the season premiere of ''King of the Hill.'' In deciding to snap up the game, you can hear Fox executives weigh the ratings potential of broadcasting home run history versus showing a fiery propane explosion that might kill Hank Hill at the Mega-Lo-Mart. Decisions, decisions.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 268-> Would Repentance Help Clinton?
To the Editor: You advise the President to ''throw away the blame script and switch to contrition'' (editorial, Sept. 3). This would only substitute an unfelt, dishonest strategy for a heartfelt but barely repentant one. You ask: Can he? The better question is: Should he? Adapting one more public relations device compounds our problems and avoids his. Real contrition rests on awareness and regret, not political expediency. Can the President ''do contrition''? His remarks during his Martha's Vineyard vacation and his Kremlin and Ireland press conferences suggest he can, but always begrudgingly and as a victim. Can he really appreciate the enormity of what he has done to us (and not just himself) and truly come to regret it? The answer to that question, sadly, is much less optimistic.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 270-> U.S. OPEN; Sampras Keeps the Future in Its Place
When the sky went from gray to green to black yesterday afternoon, Pete Sampras looked up, registered moderate apprehension and played on. After all, the spotlights were eerily blazing inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, and he was scant serves away from taking a 6-4, 2-1 lead over Marat Safin in a match that eventually became a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 rout and landed the four-time champion in the United States Open quarterfinals. As it turned out, the rest of the men's matches were washed out, leaving the stubborn Sampras a solitary quarterfinalist. On the women's side, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, fifth-seeded Venus Williams and 13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer had enough time between cloudbursts to attain the final eight. Owing to a less violent but persistent return of the rain last night, Sampras never did learn the identity of his adversary: Andre Agassi had just finagled his way out of a two-sets-to-none predicament against another king of unreturnable returns, ninth-seeded Karol Kucera, when their mean-spirited Round of 16 clash was postponed with Agassi up by 3-0 in the fourth set after scrambling through the third, 7-6 (7-5). Taking advantage of the eighth-seeded Agassi's initial lack of composure on the same court where he won his only Open championship in 1994, Kucera had outplayed Agassi with impunity to claim the first two sets, 6-3, 6-3, in Louis Armstrong Stadium. The tide turned when Agassi, annoyed by Kucera's tendency to repeatedly toss the ball on his serve, began mimicking the Slovak's finicky behavior and knotted the third set at 4-4. While it took only a nighttime sprinkling to drive Agassi and Kucera from their match, in Sampras's case, it was a midafternoon monsoon in the second set. But Sampras, with his tunnel vision intact, was not budging until he had to. ''It was a scary sight,'' he said later, ''really, it was like green out there. It was. Maybe it was going to rain money.'' The harried tournament officials, warned by their in-house radar that a storm on the scale of the humdinger that sent Dorothy to Oz was on the doorstep, had shut down the day session on a dozen courts, including the stadium where Williams, last year's runner-up, was halfway through a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) defeat of 12th-seeded Mary Pierce. But the one court they had not evacuated was their biggest, Ashe Stadium, and their frantic signals there from the sidelines to Sampras on the service line went ignored until he had secured his 2-1 lead. At that point, the loudspeaker ordered spectators to do what the electronic message on the scoreboard had been suggesting for 45 minutes: leave their seats and seek shelter from a hard-driving thunderstorm, which was five minutes from striking the National Tennis Center. The evacuation went smoothly with the exception of minor injuries sustained by two spectators who ventured outside amid the wind and lightning and fell on the rain-slicked concourse. After a two-hour delay, the squeegee patrol dried the courts and Sampras, Safin and the rest were back in business. Sampras and Safin, the 18-year-old Russian sensation, did not take much time to complete their encounter. Sampras, who spewed 18 aces to 10 by his outclassed challenger, needed just 1 hour 17 minutes to send the teen-ager back to the drawing board. ''I have to improve many things to be like Pete,'' Safin said. ''He played tennis perfect, almost perfect. He has unbelievable serve; he put many pressures all the time because he's moving to the net all the time.'' In his Davis Cup debut this spring, Safin took Jim Courier to five sets before losing the deciding match, and a month later he defeated Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, but Safin described Sampras as an opponent from a superior planet. ''In the summer I play against the guys who are more or less my level; this unbelievable level is No. 1 in the world, it was impossible to break him,'' Safin said. ''To be half of Pete Sampras is enough for me.'' According to Sampras, Safin is already a better player at 18 than he was. ''I was pretty flaky; I'm not really sure at that point what I really wanted from tennis, I was still trying to make my mark, still trying to break into the top 50, the top 20, and I did that just about when I turned 19 and won here,'' Sampras said of his first Grand Slam title. Sampras is three rounds from a fifth Open championship, which would tie him with Jimmy Connors for the Open record and tie him with Roy Emerson for the men's lead in Grand Slam titles. Sampras would not say that his flirtation with the record books is causing undue stress. ''Wimbledon was a huge confidence booster,'' said Sampras, who tied Bjorn Borg's record five titles there by defending his 1997 title and defeating Goran Ivanisevic in the final. ''I feel pretty relaxed. Now at 27, I've been through enough situations to hopefully handle it. Whoever I play, I feel like I'm ready,'' he said, referring to his imminent quarterfinal against Agassi, his victim in the 1990 and 1995 Open finals, or Kucera, who dethroned him at the Australian Open earlier this year. MATCH POINTS Fourth-seeded ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO of Spain, the reigning French Open champion and the Open's 1994 champion, eliminated 15th-seeded ANNA KOURNIKOVA by 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in a match that was delayed by the rain and moved to the Grandstand court because of a weather-related schedule shuffle. Sanchez Vicario will meet VENUS WILLIAMS in the quarterfinals . . . In a minor fourth-round upset, 13th-seeded AMANDA COETZER of South Africa outlasted No. 7 CONCHITA MARTINEZ, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, in a balloon-ball-filled encounter that took 2 hours 38 minutes to reach a resolution. Martinez, who complained of chronic neck pain during and after the match, had beaten Coetzer in 12 of their 13 previous meetings. Coetzer's quarterfinal opponent is second-seeded LINDSAY DAVENPORT, a 6-4, 6-1 winner against 10th-seeded NATHALIE TAUZIAT. . . . The men's doubles, devoid of its top-seeded team because of JACCO ELTINGH's withdrawal to attend the birth of his first child, also lost the second-seeded team of TODD WOODBRIDGE and MARK WOODFORDE: Australia's Woodies, owners of nine Grand Slam crowns, were upended, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, by SANDON STOLLE and CYRIL SUK. . . . The defending men's champion, PATRICK RAFTER, led GORAN IVANISEVIC, 6-3, 3-2, last night when play was rained out.

Nov. 15, 1998-> 271-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; Rhode Island In the Mix
Atlantic 10 PLAYERS TO WATCH -- James Posey, forward, Xavier (15.3 points, 8.4 rebounds a game last season); Lamar Odom, forward, Rhode Island; Bevon Robin, guard, Fordham (18.3 points). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Temple, Rhode Island, Xavier. COMMENT -- Xavier and Temple are projected by many to dominate. But Rhode Island Coach Jim Harrick could coax enough out of a mediocre backcourt to give Odom and swingman Darnell Williams (17.3 points) the feeds they require. Come tournament time, the Rams might do the most damage. Northeast Conference PLAYERS TO WATCH -- Richie Parker, forward, Long Island University (15.9 points, 7.3 rebounds); Frantz Pierre-Louis, center, Wagner (13.6 points, 9.4 rebounds); Gregory Harris, guard, Mount St. Mary's (15.5 points, 5.6 assists). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Fairleigh Dickinson, Mount St. Mary's (Md.), Long Island University. COMMENT -- Fairleigh Dickinson Coach Tom Green went to Europe again and brought back the 6-foot-8-inch Belgian twins Tom and Wim Vanderkeere. They will be joined by the conference's best new player, guard Lamont Perry. The Knights are somewhat of a mystery, but Green will solve it by season's end. L.I.U.'s Charles Jones, the nation's leading scorer last season, and forward Mike Campbell have departed. If Long Island's new coach, Ray Martin, can get the Blackbirds to play real defense, Parker can do enough offensively to keep them in the race. Ivy League PLAYERS TO WATCH -- Gabe Lewullis, forward, Princeton (14.2 points, 5.3 rebounds); Brian Earl, guard, Princeton (13.1 points); Gary Raimondo, guard, Columbia (14.7 points, 7.1 rebounds). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Princeton, Columbia, Pennsylvania. COMMENT -- Princeton might have to actually sweat out a few Ivy League games, but the talent gap is still enormous. Gone are center Steve Goodrich and guard Mitch Henderson. Arrived is the sought-after center Chris Young, to join Earl and Lewullis. Columbia Coach Armond Hill may not have the talent of Pennsylvania or even Cornell, but he will squeeze a surprising year out of four returning starters. Metro Atlantic PLAYERS TO WATCH -- Kashif Hameed, center, Iona (15.3 points, 6.2 rebounds); Jim Cantamessa, forward, Siena (14 points, 4.9 rebounds); Jason Rowe, guard, Loyola (Md.), (18.1 points). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Siena, Iona, Niagara. COMMENT -- How can Iona possibly lose in this conference? Because even if the new coach, Jeff Ruland, has the returning M.A.A.C. player of the year in Hameed along with forward Tariq Kirksay (13.2 points, 7.2 rebounds), when he heals from a broken right knuckle, he does not know yet if he has the backcourt to get the ball to them. John McDonald, the heart of the Gaels' run to the N.C.A.A. tournament, is gone, leaving playmaking duties to Jason Young (5.2 points), an untested underclassmen. Siena is not as athletic, but the Saints shoot a ton and they have the conference's best coach, Paul Hewitt. America East PLAYERS TO WATCH -- Craig Claxton, guard, Hofstra (16.3 points, 7.2 assists); Mike Pegues, forward, Delaware (16.8 points, 6.8 rebounds); Joe Linderman, center, Drexel (18.4 points, 8.5 rebounds). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Hofstra, Drexel, Delaware. COMMENT -- Claxton and four other returning starters have Hofstra poised for its first tournament berth since 1977. Drexel's lineup is also back, with guard Mike DeRocckis (15.4 points) as an explosive complement to Linderman. On paper, Delaware, with the league's best forward tandem in Pegues and Darryl Presley (12.9 points, 4.8 rebounds), looks to be the favorite. But Claxton and crew do not play on paper. Patriot League PLAYERS TO WATCH -- Brett Eppehimer, guard, Lehigh (24.7 points); George Tatum, guard, Army (13.1 points); Skip Victor, guard, Navy (8.9 points). TEAMS TO WATCH -- Navy, Lehigh, Lafayette. COMMENT -- Lafayette would have been the favorite, but lost center Stefan Ciosici to a torn knee ligament. Brian Ehlers (16.3 points, 5.4 rebounds) will not be able to shoulder the burden alone. That leaves the door open for Navy, which will contend for another tournament appearance with defense and an athletic lineup, including Victor and forward Sitapha Savane (5.4 points, 4.4 rebounds). Eppehimer will need to average 30 points a game to keep Lehigh in the picture -- not such a bad bet. RON DICKER

Dec. 21, 1998-> 273-> Relating to the Redeemed Scrooge, and the Nasty Old Man
A sampling of observations about Scrooge from actors who portray him: HAL LANDON, 57, South Coast Repertory Theater, Costa Mesa, Calif., who has played the role for 19 years: ''We admire people who are good at what they do, and there is a purity about his miserliness.'' TONY RANDALL, 78, who played the role in Madison Square Garden in 1996: ''He's at a point in life where he's nothing but regrets, excluded from happiness by his own acts, and he knows it. He's so ready to change, he's like a girl whose virtue depends only on the fact that no one's ever asked her.'' BOB THOMPSON, 71, Pollard Theater, Guthrie, Okla.; seven years as Scrooge: ''Most people would spend a significant portion of their lives like Scrooge if they thought they could get away with it.'' RAYE BIRK, 55, Actors Conservatory Theater, San Francisco; three years as Scrooge: ''There are people in the audience who get off on Scrooge's meanness, particularly as you get closer to Christmas and they get more fed up. As the hassle quotient goes up, the arm's length at which people hold Scrooge gets shorter.'' TOM MULA, 47, Goodman Theater, Chicago; seven years in the role, this year appearing in his own one-man show, ''Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol'': ''If you're honest, the part gets into you a little bit. You pick up a little of the meanness, the misanthropy. I would wake up in the morning with Scrooge on my face. That's not a pretty thing.'' JARLATH CONROY, in his 50's, Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis; has played the part four times: ''What I've tried to do this time around is put more of the journey Scrooge goes through into the play. That means you have to explore your own feelings of what Scrooge lacks, what it is to live without compassion, what it is to regain compassion, what it is to confront death. The older one gets, the more one is prepared to look back with compassion, which is a very relevant thing for Scrooge.'' BILL NORRIS, 50, Goodman Theater, Chicago; played Scrooge for last 12 years, this year appears as Fezziwig: ''The whole point of the character is that here's a man who has killed the child within himself and has to bring the child back to life. In the end he becomes impulsive. Not childish. Childlike.'' SEAN GRIFFIN, 56, A Contemporary Theater, Seattle; played Scrooge three times: ''Nowadays, I think a lot of people identify with the first Scrooge, the pre-redemption Scrooge. With so many homeless people begging on the streets, a lot of us do walk by with eyes turned away. He calls on the shame that people walk around with. Maybe we think we are that nasty old Scrooge.''

An article on Friday about United Nations arms inspections in Iraq misspelled the name of a London-based Arab-language newspaper that interviewed Secretary General Kofi Annan. It is Asharq al-Aswat, not Ashraq al-Aswat. The article also included an incorrect rendering from the newspaper for a comment by Mr. Annan. In discussing the chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, Mr. Annan did not tell Asharq al-Aswat that Mr. Butler's diplomacy ''is seasonal.'' The newspaper said that it had erred in transcribing Mr. Annan's remarks and that he had called Mr. Butler's diplomacy ''seasoned.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 276-> Would Repentance Help Clinton?; No Rules on Resignation
To the Editor: Re ''Senate Democrat Rebukes Clinton'' (front page, Sept. 4): Overlooked in discussion of a possible Clinton resignation is the fact that there is no provision for resignation in the Constitution. At the time President Richard Nixon decided to resign, his lawyers simply invented a process under which he would write a letter to the Secretary of State. Thus a precedent was established, albeit an extra-constitutional one. The absence of a provision demonstrates that the Founders did not consider any contingency other than death that would overturn the results of a national election. One cannot imagine their countenancing a resignation growing out of a President's private behavior or relating to civil offenses he may have committed prior to becoming President. Nixon resigned because he committed crimes against the Constitution, crimes for which he would have been impeached and removed from office. M. J. ROSENBERG Chevy Chase, Md., Sept. 4, 1998

Sept. 8, 1998-> 277-> Unwinding to a Caribbean Rhythm
Normally, Marjorie Smith, 50, is a manager of the administrative staff at the World Bank in Washington, an office where people are not known for excessive dress. But yesterday Ms. Smith, who was born in Trinidad, got herself into an enormous blue and white feathered costume, had her face painted to match, then danced down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. ''This is my stress-buster,'' she said. That seemed to be the theme of the 31st annual West Indian American Day Carnival, a pageant that has surpassed the Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day parades as the largest and most elaborate in the city. Yesterday the two-mile route stretching along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, in Brooklyn's Caribbean heart, was jammed with revelers. They ate jerk chicken, curried goat and black pudding, dressed up in thongs and as peacocks, and danced to a throbbing calypso beat on trucks advertising Guinness stout and Hennessey cognac. Police last night did not have a firm estimate of how many people attended. The day was stifling until showers cooled things off. The mood was an island sultriness combined with New York attitude. ''Buy six beers, and I'll get you a free face painting,'' said a vendor, Jerry Vento, 27, of Canarsie, as a woman passed by. ''Six beers -- you can paint my body, baby,'' the woman shot back. The parade is the biggest event of the year for New York's burgeoning West Indian community, whose numbers are estimated at 600,000. ''I wait for this,'' said Reshonah Bennett, 22, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. ''Fall is coming, so it's like a brand new start.'' Ms. Bennett was born in the United States but her parents were born in Trinidad, and yesterday she and four other families from the second floor of her Eastern Parkway apartment building were selling food and drinks along the parade route. They hoped to make $3,000 by 1 A.M. Dee Baker, 39, of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, was selling jerk chicken on the parade route for a catering service called Goodies, and dancing at the same time. She came to New York from Jamaica two years ago, and misses home. ''It's not often you get the chance to get the spirit of the old things,'' she said. ''And you can behave in a way that people don't think is strange. It gives us a chance to be Jamaican.'' Ms. Baker works part time as a nanny on Long Island, which has made her wonder about why people here work so hard. ''Even though you see the wealth, the people don't act like there's wealth,'' she said. ''People get up in the morning and go to work and then they come home late at night. But at home, we have a life style. You go to work, you leave, and you might call your friends up. We have a lot of entertainment places along the beaches. Or you might meet at a pool. It's definitely less stress.'' The usual clutch of politicians made pilgrimages to the parade site. Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, who is running for the Senate, arrived in a coat and tie, but was later spotted in a ''Taste of the Tropics'' T-shirt as he waved from the top of a double-decker bus and swayed gingerly to a calypso beat. Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is running for governor, wore a blue business suit and blue pumps and danced down the street with the Mystic Promise band. ''We're teaching her,'' said Tessa Caesar, 24, a member of the band. Many things were for sale, like pina coladas served in pineapples with paper parasols, dolls, jewelry and clothes. Among the T-shirt slogans: ''When I Die and Heaven Doesn't Want Me, Take Me Straight to Trinidad''; ''Trini to the Last Drop,'' and ''Every Sister Should Have a BMW -- Black Man Working!'' The skies above the parade darkened ominously at 2:30 P.M., and soon after that, they opened, sending some people screaming for the subways. Others ran for cover under the nearest food tent, which created some interesting groupings. Up near the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Patricia Brown found herself covering up the carrot cake she was selling and standing in her tent next to Sonya Smith, 29, a woman who calls up people who have not paid their Bell Atlantic phone bills; Ms. Smith's son, Deshawn, 9; a man without a shirt who would not reveal his name, and a newspaper reporter. Ms. Brown said she led spiritual and holistic retreats to Jamaica, and loved the West Indian parade. As it rained, the anonymous man made a garbage bag raincoat for Deshawn, who was cold. ''That's $500, custom,'' the man said. ''This is an original. Stop shivering.'' Then he inexplicably started haranguing the group about Monica S. Lewinsky. Ms. Smith rolled her eyes. ''Wrong event,'' she said.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 278-> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Photos That Changed Pollock's Life
The figure of Jackson Pollock -- action painter, dancing dripper, sullen rebel -- was formed in Hans Namuth's camera. Namuth's camera helped make Pollock famous, Namuth's camera was blamed for Pollock's demise and, after Pollock died in a car crash in 1956, Namuth's camera tried to catch the artist in his coffin. (The funeral home didn't allow it.) Now, on the occasion of Pollock's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Namuth's camera is there again. Namuth himself died eight years ago (also in a car crash). But his photographs and films are being used to strip away the layers of paint and lore that have covered Pollock since the 1950's. Of course, the stripping is tricky, because Pollock's tortured relationship with Namuth is itself part of the myth. In the late summer of 1950, Namuth, a photographer for Harper's Bazaar with a marginal interest in Pollock, arranged to shoot him painting in his studio. But when Namuth got to Pollock's house in Springs, in East Hampton, N.Y., he was told there was nothing to shoot. Pollock had just finished a painting. He and Lee Krasner, his wife, took Namuth out to the barn to look. ''A dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor,'' Namuth recalled in ''Pollock Painting'' (1980), a book of his photographs. ''Blinding shafts of sunlight hit the wet canvas, making its surface hard to see. There was complete silence.'' Namuth went on: ''Pollock looked at the painting. Then unexpectedly, he picked up can and paintbrush and started to move around the canvas. It was as if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished. His movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more dancelike as he flung black, white and rust-colored paint onto the canvas.'' Namuth started photographing Pollock at work on the painting that would become ''One: No. 31, 1950.'' Krasner sat on a high stool, watching. When Namuth showed the proofs to Pollock and Krasner, they let him loose in the studio. Namuth took more photographs, capturing the beginning stages of ''Autumn Rhythm: No. 30, 1950.'' But it was not enough. Namuth decided he wanted to catch the painter in motion. He shot a black-and-white film of Pollock painting, first from eye level, then from a loft high above the barn floor. Still not enough. Namuth wanted a movie of Pollock in color. Paul Falkenberg, a film editor who had worked with Fritz Lang, agreed to help. At first Namuth filmed Pollock painting outside on a red canvas that is now lost. Pollock did a strenuous grapevine dance step as he worked along the length of the canvas. Namuth got Pollock's characteristic strokes: the way he drew with paint by gently rotating his wrist, finishing with his palm up, and the way he splatted by snapping his wrist and finishing with his palm down. Still not enough. Namuth was unhappy about having to choose between focusing on the painting or on Pollock. He wanted to catch painter and paint at once. Finally, as Namuth remembered later, he dreamed up a solution: ''The painting would have to be on glass, and I would film from underneath.'' Pollock built a wooden platform to hold the glass. And Namuth crouched under it to ''record the loops of liquid paint as they fell,'' as Barbara Rose, an art historian and critic, wrote in an essay in ''Pollock Painting.'' As Pollock painted on the glass, the paint covered up his view of Namuth beneath him, but in the film it was just the opposite: Pollock's face and figure were gradually veiled by his own paint. At last, the marathon photography session ended dramatically on a cold November day in 1950. Namuth and Pollock were winding up their work. Krasner was inside the house preparing a feast to celebrate the end of the filming. Pollock was tense. As the 1989 biography ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, tells it, Pollock was sick of putting on his paint-spattered boots again and again for the camera, shaking an object out of one boot again and again, getting ready to paint again and again, and asking Namuth again and again: ''Should I do it now, Hans?'' He was ready to blow. When Pollock and Namuth came in from outside, blue from the cold, the first thing Pollock did was pour himself a tumbler of bourbon. It was the beginning of the end. Pollock had been sober (some say) for two years. Soon Namuth and Pollock got into an argument -- a volley of ''I'm not a phony, you're a phony.'' Then Pollock tore a strap of cowbells off the wall and started swinging it around. With the dinner guests seated and food on the table, Pollock and Namuth continued to argue. Finally Pollock grabbed the end of the table, shouting ''Should I do it now?'' to Namuth. ''Now?'' Then he turned over the whole table, plates, glasses, meat, gravy and all. (There is a scholarly disagreement about whether it was turkey or roast beef.) The dogs lapped at the glassy gravy. Krasner said, ''Coffee will be served in the living room.'' After that night, Pollock never stopped drinking. He didn't bring in the glass painting (''No. 29, 1950'') until it was covered with rain and leaves. He returned to a more figurative style of painting. Six years later, bloated, depressed and drunk, he drove his car into a tree, killing himself and a friend. According to Pollock lore, his relationship with the camera was a Faustian bargain. No one has ever said it bluntly, but the implication is that Namuth killed Pollock, that the photographs stole the artist's ''savage'' spirit. In doing things for the camera that he once did more spontaneously, Pollock came to feel he was indeed a phony. The photographs that made him famous also sealed his doom. Images Seized Public's Imagination The Namuth photographs have had a life of their own. They were first published in 1951 in Portfolio, a review edited by Franz Zachary and Alexey Brodovitch. Soon after, Art News magazine published them to illustrate Robert Goodnough's influential essay ''Pollock Paints a Picture.'' Later in 1951, the Museum of Modern Art screened the color film. And after Pollock died, the pictures really took off. Articles on Pollock were often illustrated with Namuth's photographs rather than the paintings. Why? It was Namuth's images more than Pollock's paintings that grabbed the public's imagination, Ms. Rose wrote in ''Pollock Painting.'' A rhetoric developed around them, a language of trances and rituals, boxing and dancing, rhythm and randomness. Even the critics based their theories on the photos. Harold Rosenberg's famous 1952 essay in Art News, ''The American Action Painters,'' was not about painting at all, Ms. Rose suggests. Rosenberg ''was describing Namuth's photographs of Pollock.'' The photographs changed art and art history, Ms. Rose wrote, by focusing ''on the act -- the process of art-making -- instead of on the static object.'' Pollock's early critic, Clement Greenberg, had seen an allover, knit-together style in the paintings, a disembodied, optical web, and he studiously avoided analyzing how Pollock achieved it. But thanks to the photographs, a new generation of artists -- including Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Eva Hesse and Claes Oldenburg -- saw something else. They weren't just looking at Pollock's paintings, they were looking at Pollock painting. Hailed as Founder Of the Happening One of those artists was Allan Kaprow. In ''The Legacy of Jackson Pollock,'' published in Art News in 1958, he credited Pollock with destroying painting by placing ''an almost absolute value on a kind of diaristic gesture.'' Pollock was hailed as the founder of the Happening, the man who embodied a new generation's ''ambitions for absolute liberation.'' Namuth's photographs inspired new kinds of art in the 1950's and 60's. In the 1970's and 80's, they were read as art criticism. In ''Hans Namuth: Art Critic,'' a 1977 essay, Jean Clay, an art historian, observed that when Namuth photographed Pollock from above, he intentionally mimicked Pollock's relationship to the canvas, to point out how radical it was to paint on the floor. In an essay in ''Pollock Painting,'' the art historian Rosalind Krauss took a similar tack. She suggested that by taking aerial photographs, which make the ''sculptural dimensions of reality'' ambiguous, Namuth was trying to emphasize the unreality of the paintings, ''that gravity-free, optical space to which Greenberg refers in his descriptions of Pollock's art.'' But Namuth's photographs went beyond Greenberg, she suggested. Because they were shot from above, they showed the very real, physical manner in which the paintings' optical effect was created (from above). Ms. Krauss turned Namuth into a critic of a critic. Now, judging from Pepe Karmel's essay on Namuth's photographs in the catalogue for the Pollock retrospective, the use of the photographs is changing again. Mr. Karmel, in effect, puts the paintings back on the wall. He treats the photographs not as criticism but as hard evidence to settle some unsolved mysteries: Was Pollock controlled or wild? What is the anatomy of a splat? Are there figures hiding in the webs of paint? How did Pollock get rhythm? For the first time, the full sequence of Namuth's still shots is available, revealing the evolution of a few paintings. The distortions of foreshortening and the dizzying angles of those photographs have been undone (by computer), so the paintings in them look as undistorted as if they were on the wall. Mr. Karmel has used Namuth's color film to dissect Pollock's gestures with the brush. And he has analyzed the black-and-white film, which he has identified as a chronicle of ''No. 27, 1950,'' to study the underlayers. From the black-and-white film, Mr. Karmel learned that Pollock did not begin with abstract splats but with carefully dripped figures. Pollock drew two humanoid figures and a she-wolf and then buried them in a web of splats. When the web covered the pictographs, the eye could no longer focus on them, but instead jumped from splat to splat. Thus, Mr. Karmel concludes, Pollock's work was divided into two campaigns, first figurative drips, then abstract splats. From the still photographs documenting ''One'' and ''Autumn Rhythm,'' Mr. Karmel learned that Pollock painted figures, obscured them, then overpainted the abstract layers with more figures, creating a semi-abstract, semi-figurative web. Rhythmic Energy From Alternation What makes Pollock Pollock, he says, is not the drip technique, which other painters used, nor allover abstraction, which other painters achieved, but the rhythmic energy that comes from the alternation of figure and splat. Pollock was not a man in the grip of a savage dance. He was always in control. As Pollock himself once reportedly put it, ''I choose to veil the image.'' Mr. Karmel has confirmed Pollock's self-report. But questions still remain: Why did he veil it? And why did he stop veiling it in 1951? After Pollock watched ''projections of himself working,'' Ms. Rose said, he abandoned the poured technique and returned to a more figurative style. Did he feel that hiding the figures in his abstractions was futile after Namuth exposed them? Was he trying to develop a painted image that could compete with his own heroic figure in Namuth's photographs? Did he come to think the drip paintings were phony because they were so photogenic? Or was he simply ready to move on?

Dec. 21, 1998-> 279-> Pinching Pennies in a Land of Copper
Five months ago, the copper mine where Mario Olivares had dug, drilled and hammered for the last six years shut down under the pressure of collapsing world copper prices. From a monthly salary of more than $400, he now earns less than a dollar a day selling flavored ices from his wooden shack. The change in fortune for Mr. Olivares is a direct result of the economic slowdown in Asia, which has pummeled the prices of many commodities that are the economic lifeblood of developing countries. About 1,000 miners have lost their jobs this year in this town of 14,000 people set in the desert badlands of northern Chile. The earnings of thousands more have been reduced by more than 20 percent. Strapped for money, the local Government has been forced to cut housing subsidies and hours in the local health clinic. Drug addiction and alcoholism are on the rise, local officials say. Attendance at the local school on Saturdays to make up for class time lost during a teachers strike has been surprisingly high, administrators say, because the children want the free lunches. ''My family could use more food,'' said Mr. Olivares, 36, who has begun looking for seasonal agricultural work at a far lower salary than before. ''I see more poverty in the future.'' Chile has been South America's economic model for the last 20 years, with growth rates averaging more than 8 percent a year during the last decade. The country led the way in privatizing inefficient state-owned businesses, and its privatized pension system has been adopted by Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. But now Chile's economic miracle is stumbling, mostly because nearly 40 percent of its export earnings come from copper. From a price of $1.19 per pound in June 1997, the price of copper on the world market has declined to 65 cents a pound, its lowest level since 1987. That has meant a loss of $1.5 billion in export earnings in the first 10 months of this year. The effects could have been far worse had oil prices not also tumbled, saving Chile more than $200 million over the same period. Nevertheless, the signs of a painful adjustment are everywhere in a country that has become increasingly middle class over the last generation. Sales of cars, televisions, houses and apartments have dropped sharply in the last few months. Sixty-five percent of those questioned in a poll published last week said they would spend less on presents this Christmas than they did last year. Distribucion y Servicio, the country's largest supermarket chain and retailer, originally intended to open nine new stores next year, but now plans to open only two. The economy, which grew by more than 7 percent in 1997, will grow by only 4 percent this year. That would not be bad if most of the growth had not come before June. A zero-to-negative growth rate for the fourth quarter is expected by most economists to remain constant for at least the first half of 1999. Unemployment has increased to 6.9 percent from 6.5 percent in the last year, and Government economists predict a continuing deterioration to at least 8.5 percent by June. ''At the end of 1997, we predicted an 11 percent increase in construction for this year,'' said Horacio Pavez Garcia, president of the Chilean Chamber of Construction. ''We've had to change our projections four times, and now we'll be lucky to reach a growth rate of 1.5 percent.'' But for all the bad news, a consensus has emerged among local businessmen and economists, Government officials and Wall Street experts: Chile should rebound in the second half of next year, unless a Brazilian financial collapse shakes the entire South American economy or if Gen. Augusto Pinochet's extradition proceedings in London should set off political turbulence here. The experts note that the Chilean peso has remained stable, the local stock market has revived in recent months and the Central Bank has lowered interest rates several times during the last two months after several rate increases earlier in the year that stalled the construction and retail sectors. While the flow of foreign investment has slowed, Exxon and Procter and Gamble have recently announced major new investments. And unlike several Asian economies that have been shaken by the collapses of weak banks, strong Government regulation and the emergence of many foreign banks in recent years have kept the Chilean financial sector sound. Chile's percentage of past-due loans to total loans is projected to be a modest 2 percent by the end of the year, compared with 13 percent in Argentina and 5 percent in Brazil, according to a report by Santander Investment. ''We have an economy that's decelerating very sharply,'' said Jose de Gregorio, an economist at the University of Chile. ''But over all, the country is strong. It's an open economy, there's low corruption and the financial system remains strong.'' Nevertheless, to the desert towns like Tierra Amarilla that depend on small copper mines, a recovery looks like a mirage. Four of eight local mining companies have closed in the last year here, and a persistent drought has slowed a transition to grape farming. Domingo Cortes, 49, a copper miner, has seen his earnings drop from $250 to $180 a month, forcing him to take up seasonal tomato and onion farming to supplement his living. ''I'm always in debt,'' he said, while hammering rocks looking for blue veins of copper. ''One month I pay the electricity bill, another I pay the store. It will be a very different Christmas this year. I had to tell my children they won't be getting presents.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 280-> Where Young Viewers Go (and Ads Follow); The WB Network, With a Narrow Focus, Grows 20 Percent
One upstart network has made its name by appealing to teen-agers with shows like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' starring a sexy high school misfit with supernatural powers, and ''Dawson's Creek,'' where teen-agers talk bluntly about masturbation and impotence and one boy loses his virginity to his over-30 English teacher. The other is best known for ''Star Trek: Voyager,'' ''Love Boat: The Next Wave'' and a declared mission to appeal to as broad a swath of Middle America -- in age, geography and household income -- as possible. Which is more likely to succeed? Logic might point to UPN, the one with the broader focus. But the smart money's on the one with the teen-age target. The WB network, home of the sultry Buffy, the angst-filled Dawson and the five rambunctious siblings of ''Seventh Heaven,'' was the only broadcast television network to show audience growth last season. And it grew by about 20 percent, even as the general defection of viewers to cable networks accelerated. ''When I was a kid, my father told me, 'Find a need and fill it,' '' Jamie Kellner, the president of WB, said in an interview. ''We saw other networks' shares were declining, at a fairly sharp drop, among households with nonadults. And we saw a place to build our business.'' Build they did. WB has focused relentlessly on attracting people aged 12 to 34. Though that audience may seem narrow, it is also elusive, even fickle. Scores of shows will reach older viewers, but relatively few can be counted upon to draw the under-30 crowd, so advertisers will overpay to reach it. Advance bookings of advertising time on WB for the fall season are double what they were last year; more than two-thirds of that revenue, Mr. Kellner said, came from advertisers seeking the 12-to-34-year-old audience. ''Another good thing about our audience is it replenishes itself,'' Mr. Kellner said. ''Kids move into teens, teens move into 18-to-34's. We're focused on 12-to-34's, but with a big spillover both up and down.'' But detractors accuse WB of behaving like a cable network, trolling for adolescents the way Nickelodeon does for children, and in the process helping to fragment American families by inducing children to watch different shows from their parents. ''We certainly are not a teeny-bopper network, as some people try to paint us,'' Mr. Kellner said. ''We are a family network. Our definition of family is households with adults and nonadults watching television, hopefully together. It doesn't mean G-rated shows; a 14-year-old girl and her mom can have a great time watching 'Buffy' together, for example.'' Still, he never lets his staff lose sight of their main target. For example, a comedy being produced for midseason, ''Zoe Bean,'' is already being called '' 'Seinfeld' for teens.'' ''We knew 'Seinfeld' was one of the top-rated shows with teens, and we tried to analyze why,'' said Susanne Daniels, WB's executive vice president for programming. ''The pacing, the kinds of stories, not too emotional storytelling, very physical. Nobody's ever worried about their finances; it's all fun. We thought we could take that format and use younger characters. We decided to set it in New York because New York's one of the few places where teen-agers can get around and do things on their own without driving.'' The result is a show about the misadventures of fraternal twins, a boy and a girl, and their best friends, also a boy and girl. ''Because they're teen-agers, it's a lttle less cynical than, say, George Costanza is,'' she said, referring to the ''Seinfeld'' character. ''It has some of that cynicism, but not at that level.'' For another new show, Ms. Daniels said, ''We asked Joe Dougherty, 'Can you write the kind of male relationships you wrote on ''Thirtysomething'' a little bit younger for us.' '' The result is ''Hyperion Bay,'' a show on the fall schedule about a small town and two brothers, one who never left and one who has returned home as a successful entrepreneur to try to revive the town's business fortunes. Pop music plays a big role, both in the shows and in promoting them. WB bought the rights to use Madonna's most recent single, ''Power of Goodbye,'' released on Aug. 25, in movie trailers and television promotional spots for ''Felicity,'' a much-hyped new show for fall about a vulnerable and beautiful college freshman. Many people dispute Mr. Kellner's contention that WB is a family network and that adults will watch these adolescent shows with their children the way they watched ''Ozzie and Harriet'' or, later, ''The Cosby Show.'' But industry experts say most American television households are fragmenting anyway, like it or not. ''There is no longer a family television audience,'' said Gene DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media, a major commercial-buying firm. ''Most homes have multiple sets, and most people watch their own programs. The WB strategy is simply a recognition of that.'' Dean Valentine, the new president of the struggling UPN, disagrees. ''If you extend the logic'' of narrowcasting to specific audiences, Mr. Valentine said, ''you'll have 18-year-olds watching the 18-year-old network, 21-year-olds watching the 21-year-old network, 26-year-olds watching the 26-year-old network. ''And I also believe passionately in the role network television plays in society. It has had a deep and important role in uniting a country that doesn't have many things left uniting it.'' Mr. Valentine said broadcast networks could succeed with shows for a broad age range and for childless adults as well as those with families. And he refers not just to ''water-cooler'' hits -- shows the whole country seems to talk about, like ''E.R.,'' ''Seinfeld'' or, in years gone by, ''Dallas'' or ''Cheers'' -- but also to moderately popular shows like ''Touched by an Angel,'' ''Spin City'' and ''Third Rock from the Sun.'' Mr. Valentine said UPN could succeed with ''shows that appeal to adult, middle-class America, not just people in their 20's or 30's who live in L.A. or Manhattan.'' But many television experts say that in today's multi-channel world, a new broadcast network has to forge a distinctive identity to get the public's attention. ''Dean would be on a whole lot safer ground saying that if he were running NBC,'' said Sandy Grushow, a former president of entertainment for the Fox network and now president of a major production studio, 20th Century Fox Television. ''The best way, if not the only way, for a new upstart network to get into the game is by targeting an underserved segment of the audience with an alternative programming voice or point of view.'' Both UPN and WB started up in January 1995, with two nights a week of network programs. Their affiliated stations filled the other nights with syndicated shows, movies, sports and reruns. This fall each will have five nights of network programs. In New York, WB is seen on Channel 11, UPN on Channel 9. The Model Is Brash And Slightly Vulgar Mr. Kellner and his two top programming executives, Garth Ancier and Ms. Daniels, say they are using -- to a point -- a template they learned at Fox, where they all worked until Mr. Kellner left to lead the new WB and the others followed. At Fox, the plan was to start by attracting young viewers with a brash, slightly vulgar, clearly different tone and later to broaden the reach. Speaking of Rupert Murdoch, president of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, Ms. Daniels recalled, ''Eventually Rupert actually said: 'We don't want be the fourth network any more. We want to broaden our audience and take on NBC and ABC now.' ''Garth and Jamie have said the opposite: they want to keep this network young. They're very happy with our median age being 25, and they'd like to keep it 25, and they're sure we can can build a successful network that way.'' Younger Viewers Are Hard to Catch If Mr. Kellner and the other experts like Mr. Grushow are right, then UPN is in a difficult position because there is no audience segment left untargeted or underserved. Mr. Valentine and his colleagues almost have no choice but to try a broad range of shows and hope that some catch fire. ''It's really all about putting on a hit show, not about narrowcasting for buyers of commercials,'' Mr. Valentine said. ''People want compelling stories.'' But advertisers know that older people and middle-aged middle Americans are already watching television in large numbers. The people advertisers find hard to reach are the younger ones, those who don't want to watch the same thing their parents watched and who are quick to change to a cable channel, pop in a video or click on their computers. ''We know who those advertisers are, and it helps us tremendously on the program side, too,'' Mr. Kellner said. ''We know this show isn't for us or this show is for us. Our casts should be in this age range, not that age range. We don't do shows with Ted Danson, we do them with Joshua Jackson or Sarah Michelle Gellar.'' Mr. Kellner says the WB's target audience of 12-to-34-year-olds constitutes more than 100 million people, ''a huge target,'' as he put it. He noted with pleasure that many WB-affiliated stations had bought the reruns of NBC's hit sitcom ''Friends'' and would use it as early-evening fare, leading into WB's prime-time lineup. ''It'll be like a rocket ship in terms of delivering more young adults and teens and kids into our schedule,'' Mr. Kellner said.

Sept. 9, 1998-> 281-> THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATE; McCaughey Ross Assails Vallone, Chief Party Rival, in TV Debate
The most heated exchange yet in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination came last night in a televised debate, as Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross went on the offensive against her chief rival, Peter F. Vallone, blaming him for the ills of New York City's public schools. Ms. McCaughey Ross, who had refrained from attacking the other three candidates in past debates, said of Mr. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, ''Peter often says that he has experience money can't buy, but we have paid for it with crumbling schools and low reading scores.'' As he has throughout the campaign, Mr. Vallone responded by questioning the Lieutenant Governor's commitment to the Democratic Party. She became a Democrat just last year, after a long feud with her onetime mentor, Gov. George E. Pataki. Her assault on Mr. Vallone, which began with her opening statement, seemed a clear acknowledgment that he has opened a lead in recent opinion polls, and that something was needed to inject life into her badly flagging campaign with just a week left until Tuesday's primary. Her campaign revealed its first television ads yesterday, which are to be shown today. The winner of the primary will run in the November election against Mr. Pataki, a Republican. Mr. Vallone, who has strived to appear above the fray in this contest, did not attempt to defend himself against Ms. McCaughey Ross's charges in the debate on the cable television channel New York 1, broadcast live from its studios at 42d Street and 10th Avenue. But his aides quickly pointed out that the City Council has never had any direct influence over the schools; for instance, it has no role in selecting the Board of Education or the Schools Chancellor. They argued that Mr. Vallone has taken the lead in providing more financing for schools. ''It's all ridiculous, and if she knew anything about the school system, she would know that,'' Kevin McCabe, Mr. Vallone's campaign manager, said. As in three past televised confrontations, the other three candidates -- Mr. Vallone; Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and James Larocca, a former State Transportation Commissioner -- criticized Ms. McCaughey Ross, who was once widely seen as the front-runner. In particular, they attacked her for accepting the Liberal Party nomination and pledging to campaign in the general election on that line even if she loses the Democratic primary. In meetings late last year, ''All four of us gave our word to Democratic leaders at the time that we were Democrats and we would not do that,'' Mr. Vallone said. Mr. Larocca, turning to the Lieutenant Governor, said: ''You will be aiding and abetting the re-election of George Pataki if you stay on the Liberal line and run against the winner of this primary. But I'm not surprised. You've changed your parties, you've changed your positions more times than I can keep count of.'' Ms. McCaughey Ross painted her party switch as one of idealism, not an act of convenience after a feud with the Governor. ''I made a tough decision,'' she said. ''I didn't just go along to get along. I made the decision to put my principles ahead of party and to change parties.'' On Sunday, after the last debate, Ms. McCaughey Ross said she had consciously sworn off assaults on the other candidates, adding, ''People don't want to hear attacks.'' But yesterday, she was on the offensive from the beginning, devoting more of her opening statement to Mr. Vallone's shortcomings on education than to her own record. She said repeatedly that Mr. Vallone had been a Councilman for 25 years, reminding viewers that he is a career politician, stressing the contrast with her own short career in public life. ''Nothing personal,'' she said, ''but Peter Vallone waited 25 years and then ran ads about his commitment to improving public education. Peter Vallone has 25 years' experience as a politician making the same old promises.'' When each of the candidates was given a chance to ask a rival a question, Ms. McCaughey Ross, trying to embarrass Mr. Vallone by making him appear uninformed, asked if he knew what percentage of high school graduates obtained a Regents diploma. He said 27 percent, and she quickly corrected him, saying that it was 38 percent. Mr. Vallone laughed and said, ''I was pretty close.'' Mr. Larocca, whose remarks were the most stinging of the night, turned his sights at one point on Mr. Hynes, who has made much of being the only candidate to oppose the death penalty, and to promise to overturn it. Mr. Hynes is also the only prosecutor in the state to have obtained a capital punishment verdict. ''I don't quite see, Joe, how you can have it both ways,'' Mr. Larocca said, using Mr. Hynes's nickname. But for the most part, Mr. Vallone, Mr. Larocca and Mr. Hynes kept the cozy tone that has characterized their statements about one another. Given a chance to ask questions of their opponents, they did not hit hard. The other two noted their support of Mr. Vallone's positions more often than they took issue with them. Mr. Hynes and Mr. Larocca argued that Mr. Vallone, as the most successful fund-raiser of the four, would be least able to make the case for campaign finance reform. But in the next breath, Mr. Hynes agreed, as Mr. Vallone often argues, that the New York City campaign finance law that Mr. Vallone helped create is one of the country's finest. Mr. Larocca defended Mr. Vallone's proposed referendum on whether to build the Yankees a new stadium in Manhattan. ''What the Speaker has done,'' he said, ''is give the people of the city of New York a direct opportunity to state their case, and I commend him.'' Mr. Hynes quipped, ''I wish we'd get off this topic, because it's only helping Peter in the polls.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 282-> PRO FOOTBALL; Vikings' Rout Sends Jets Home for Playoffs
The biggest Minnesota Vikings fans, for about 32 hours anyway, were sitting in their homes more than 1,000 miles away, scattered throughout the New York area. They were the Jets players and coaches. J-E-T-S. Vikings, Vikings, Vikings? When, as one Jets player said, he was going to wear purple pompoms and underwear all day Sunday while rooting for Minnesota, you know this was serious. Indeed, a Vikings victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars meant that the Jets would claim a No. 2 seeding in the post-season and thus a bye week and a home playoff game. No wonder there was a sudden interest in the Vikings' well-being. Minnesota was happy to oblige for its own selfish reasons. The Vikings, trying to lock up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, pounded the Jaguars, 50-10, before 64,063 at the Metrodome. The victory gave the Vikings their first unbeaten record at home since 1989 and just their second since 1976, the last time they went to the Super Bowl. The 50 points gave them 530 for the season, the second most in National Football League history and 11 short of the record set by the 1983 Washington Redskins. Facing a blitzing, gambling Jacksonville defense, the Vikings started slowly, leading by 3-0 after a quarter and by 12-3 at halftime. Then the team went to its most explosive target: wide receiver Randy Moss. After a flea-flicker from running back Robert Smith to quarterback Randall Cunningham, Moss was single-covered by safety Travis Davis. No contest. Cunningham, who fractured his nonthrowing hand in the first half but played well into the third quarter before being replaced by Brad Johnson, lobbed the ball high, and it landed right in Moss's chest in the end zone for a spectacular 43-yard score. The Moss catch, one of three touchdown passes by Cunningham in the second half, gave Minnesota a 26-3 third-quarter lead. Minnesota's defense took control in the fourth quarter, scoring on an interception and returning a fumble inside the 5-yard line to put the game well out of reach. With the victory, Minnesota (14-1) clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs and remains a strong favorite to get to the Super Bowl. Jacksonville, which had already earned a playoff berth before the game, fell to 10-5. ''We feel great,'' Vikings Coach Dennis Green said. ''It's an important win for us because as you know, no domed team has ever won home-field advantage, and with our team speed, getting home field gives us the best chance to win a championship.'' Minnesota entered tonight's game knowing that Atlanta had beaten Detroit. So, while the Vikings had won the National Football Conference Central Division and clinched a first-round bye, they still had to win to stay ahead of the Falcons for home-field advantage. The Vikings have been unstoppable, winning seven straight games. At one point this year, it looked as if the Jaguars were also headed deep into the playoffs, but the team was crippled by injuries, including the Pro Bowl quarterback Mark Brunell's severely injuring his left ankle. The Jaguars may still be a post-season force -- they clinched their first division title this week -- but Jacksonville was forced to start the third-stringer Jonathan Quinn at quarterback against Minnesota. Quinn is a rookie out of Middle Tennessee State, and played like one. The Jaguars crossed midfield only three times, and Quinn completed 12 of 27 passes for 88 yards and 2 interceptions, one returned 30 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter by Jimmy Hitchcock. Quinn also called a timeout once when the crowd got so loud that he could not call signals, and there also was confusion with some of the hand signals he used at the line of scrimmage. Cunningham, often with a defender in his face, was off target with some of his throws, too. Moss, who leads the league in touchdown catches with 16, did not have his first reception until there were seven minutes left in the first half. Wide receiver Cris Carter had dropped two passes. But this Vikings offense has numerous weapons, and if one is shut down, another two respond. One bullet is Gary Anderson, whose field goals of 48 and 53 yards gave the Vikings a 6-0 lead. Then came Smith, who in Minnesota's final drive before halftime had crucial runs of 22, 9, and 3 yards. That led to a 14-yard touchdown catch by tight end Andrew Glover, and a 12-0 lead when the 2-point attempt failed. Jacksonville, with no time on the clock, got a 25-yard field goal from Mike Hollis to trail by 12-3. The Jaguars were helped by a pass interference penalty on cornerback Ramos McDonald, who did not turn to look for the ball while covering wide receiver Jimmy Smith. ''We're happy, but we're focused enough to understand that this is just one step along the way to trying to win a championship,'' Glover said.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 283-> PLUS: ASIAN GAMES; China Wins Medals Race
Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn formally closed the Asian Games last night in Bangkok as a barrage of fireworks punctuated the end of two weeks of sport that temporarily diverted Thailand from its economic crisis. The games were carried off after last-minute work rescued an event that had been in jeopardy at various stages during years of preparations. China came out far ahead in the race for gold medals, winning 129 of the 378 awarded. South Korea took the last one, reaching 65 with the Olympic silver medalist Lee Bong-ju's victory in the marathon yesterday morning. Japan had 52 golds, and the top two winners in voting for the games' most valuable athlete -- the sprinter Koji Ito, a triple gold medalist, who ran a 10.0 100 meters in the semifinals, and Naoko Takahashi, who missed a world record by just one minute in the games' opening event, the women's marathon. Looking ahead to 2000 and the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, was a major theme for China, South Korea and Japan, while smaller teams celebrated their chance to shine on the Asian stage. Host Thailand finished with 24 gold medals, double its initial target and double its best previous finish -- 12 in 1966.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 284-> PRO FOOTBALL; Different Giants Odysseys, But Reaching Same Point
KENT GRAHAM and Conrad Hamilton work on opposite sides of the football and sit at opposite ends of the Giants' locker room. Their careers lie at opposite poles. Yesterday the veteran quarterback and the young cornerback nudged the Giants a step closer to a playoff berth -- a berth as improbable as the roles Graham and Hamilton have played in getting them there. Graham, who turned 30 on Nov. 1, has emerged as the fiery leader the Giants' offense has sorely needed. Hamilton, who turned 24 on Nov. 5, has quietly become one of the most dependable members of an inconsistent defense. ''We've struggled as a team,'' said John Fox, the Giants' defensive coordinator, ''but Conrad never has been one of the guys who's struggled. He had to fill some big shoes and all eyes were on him. But he hung in and stepped up. I've always had strong feelings about Conrad.'' Graham has been a quarterback in search of a home throughout his career. He began his college career at Notre Dame and transferred to Ohio State to get more playing time, though he didn't start until his senior season. With the Giants, Graham was regarded as a castaway quarterback at the beginning of the season. The perception was from the residue of his original tour of duty with the Giants. Graham went through an emotional wringer in his first tour of duty with the Giants, who drafted him in the eighth round in 1992. He played sparingly in 1994 and was released before the 1995 season. Graham was quickly signed by Detroit but was inactive for most of the 1995 season. He was granted unconditional free agency afterward and was signed by the Arizona Cardinals for 1996. That is where he met Coach Jim Fassel and earned the starting job in 1997 until he injured his ankle -- against the Giants. ''There weren't a whole lot of people out there that thought I was anything of a quarterback to be reckoned with,'' Graham said. ''Coach Fassel was really the only guy that I think had the confidence in me from Day One. I never wanted to leave there.'' A week after leading the Giants to a remarkable upset victory over Denver with a last-gasp pass, Graham came back with a less dramatic but solid performance yesterday as the Giants beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 28-7. He threw 33 passes, completed 16 and even caught one for 16 yards. He threw a 12-yard touchdown pass and ran three times for 17 yards and another touchdown. When he finally left the game with 6 minutes 30 seconds to play, fans stood and applauded. Graham said he felt a rush. ''Guys who were here with me when I first came to New York know how I felt,'' he said. ''They know how important it was for me to come back here and do well. That's why hearing the fans, seeing them standing, was so emotional.'' Hamilton's tenure has not been so dramatic. His three-year career with the Giants has not been punctuated by sharp ups and downs or the politics of N.F.L. life. That may soon change. Hamilton's odyssey started during the exhibition season this summer when Jason Sehorn, the Giants' All-Pro cornerback, suffered a season-ending knee injury. Hamilton became a starter and for the first six games felt that he was simply house-sitting. Now that the season is almost over and he has gained experience, Hamilton said he liked being a starter. In fact, that he can't envision himself in any other role. ''Going into this last game, I know it's my job,'' Hamilton said. ''But it's not set in stone yet. I guess I've still got to earn my stripes.'' Hamilton is a restricted free agent after this season, which means the Giants have the right of first refusal on any offer he receives. ''I don't want to come back here as a nickel back,'' he said. ''What kind of man would I be to come back and settle? I don't want to settle. I see myself differently now. I feel comfortable and confident of my skills; all I ever asked for is the opportunity to compete.'' Fox, the defensive coordinator, concedes that he has thought about the impending traffic jam at cornerback. ''It does cross your mind,'' he said. ''Jason will come back, he'll have his job back and we'll have tremendous competition. It'll make us a better team.'' For now, the Giants' season has come down to mathematics, hopes, prayers and miracles. Their only hope of reaching the playoffs is defeating Philadelphia on Sunday and having Arizona and Tampa Bay lose. The Giants play in a late game on Sunday, as does Arizona. Tampa Bay plays in an early game, and the outcome of that one could make the Giants brace for a dramatic victory and a possible playoff berth or prepare them for a miserable anticlimax. Graham doesn't want the season to end. He's enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime run. ''I just want the season to keep going,'' he said, ''and we have a shot to do it.'' Opportunity knocks, miracles happen, careers are resurrected. Ask Hamilton; ask Graham.

Nov. 15, 1998-> 285-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; EARLY RETURNS POINT TO THE CARDINAL
Joe Drapt chooses 16 teams with the weapons and the nerve to make a run at the Final Four, which will be at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Last season's record in parentheses.) Last Team Standing STANFORD (30-5) Three all-America candidates - point guard Arthur Lee, forward Mark Madsen and and the 7-foot-1-inch center Tim Young - are among 11 lettermen returning from last season's Final Four team. In seniors Lee (14.5 points, 4.6 assists a game) and Kris Weems (12.6 points), the Cardinal boasts the headiest backcourt in the nation. In addition to Madsen (11.7 points, 8.2 rebounds) and Young (11.3 points, 8.1 rebounds), who will break Adam Keefe's school rebounding record this season, Peter Sauer (9.2 points, 4.6 rebounds) returns to an equally heady front line. Three That Could Meet in St. Pete CONNECTICUT (32-5) The only player in the way of Richard Hamilton (21.5 points) repeating as Big East player fo the year is his point guard, Khalid El-Amin, who was the Big East rookie of the year and averaged 23 points in four national tournament games. El-Amin will trigger one of Coach Jim Calhoun's deepest and most talented teams; all five starters are back, and last season's run to the final eight gave them seasoning. Teh key to the Huskies' first visit to the Final Four is consistent play from tw juniors, 6-11 Jake Voshuhl (6.9 points, 7.1 rebounds) and 6-7 Kevin Freeman (10.3 points, 6.6 rebounds). DUKE (32-4) Coach Mike Krzyzewski calls this season's Blue Devils, virtually exeryone's preseason No. 1, one of his most talented teams. The fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon is an all-American who shoots better than 40 percent from 3-point range and is the on-court vessel for the Blue Devils' heritage of defense and will to win. The 6-9, 270-pound sophomore Elton Brand is probably this season's player of the year - he missed 15 games as a freshman with a broken foot, but still averaged 13.4 points and 7.3 rebounds. The sophomore William Avery takes over at point guard for Steve Wojciechowski, and his growth will determine how far the Blue Devils go. WASHINGTON (20-10) The other Huskies came within a point of beating Connecticut and advacing to the round of eight last year. Coach Bob Bender is a Krzyzewski protege and has ingrained the Duke toughness in a team that may have the best individual talent in the Pacific-10. The 7-foot Canadian Todd MacCulloch (18.6 points, 9.7 rebounds) has led the nationa in field-goal percentage twice. Guards Donald Watts and Deon Luton combined for 32 points a game. Four That Could Knock on the Door MICHIGAN STATE (22-8) Mateen Cleaves (16.1 points, 7.2 assists), a player-of-the-year candidate, is the best thing that has happened to Spartan basketball since Magic Johnson. The 6-2 junior leads a team rare for the Big Ten: it is as graceful as it is bruising. The senior Jason Klein (11.2 points) shot 41.1 percent from beyond the 3-point line. Another senior, Antonio Smith (7.9 points, 8.7 rebounds), helped Michigan State outrebound Big Ten opponents by nearly 9 a game. KENTUCKY (35-4) The defending national champion lost its leading scorer, Jeff Sheppard; its force in the middle, Nazr Mohammed, and a classy starter in Allen Edwards. But forward Scott Padgett is a star to build around. He was third on the team in scoring (11.5 points), second in rebounds (6.5) and steals and shot 85 percent from the foul line. Coach Tubby Smith has made five consecutive trips to the round of 16 with three different teams. TEMPLE (21-9) The Owls will never be up-tempo, but they will have more pop than any of John Chaney's recent teams. Lamont Barnes (13.8 points, 8 rebounds) has plenty of help inside with the addition of the 6-10 McDonald's all-America Kevin Lyde. Another McDonald's honoree, Mark Karcher, averaged 27 points in 1996-97 at Baltimore's St. Francis Academy before sitting out last season. Temple benefits from playing in the ultra-competitive Atlantic 10, which put five teams in the tournament last year. INDIANA (20-12) Bob Knight should have one of his most talented and athletic Hoosier teams in years. The junior A.J. Guyton averaged 16.8 points and shot 43.9 percent from 3-range; he is the only Indiana player other than Isiah Thomas to produce at least 400 points, 100 rebounds and 100 assists in each of his first two seasons. The sophomore Luke Recker (12.8 points) leads a brigade of quick swingmen, including Michigan's 1997 Mr. Basketball, Dane Fife. Eight That Could Hang Around Late TENNESSEE (20-9) The Vols, not the Lady Vols. Coach Jerry Green returns all five starters from a team that last season made its first tournament appearance since 1989. MARYLAND (21-11) The Terps are led by a couple of self-made stars in Obinna Ekezie and Laron Profit. They have improved each year, and along with Terrell Stokes they give Gary Williams solid leadership for a deep run in the tournament. UTAH (30-4) Coach Rich Majerus will let Andre Miller loose because he has to. Miller, the point guard and player of the year candidate, and the 6-10 Finnish forward Hanno Mottola (12.5 points, 5.3 rebounds) are the only seasoned contributors remaining from last season's tournament runner-up. ARKANSAS (24-9) The senior backcourt of Kareem Reid and Pat Bradley makes the Hogs dangerous at tournament time. Reid is an assist king; Bradley (14.8 points) led the Southeastern Conference in 3-point goals the past two seasons. KANSAS (35-4) Low expectations are what the Jayhawks need to exorcise the demons of early tournament exits. Ryan Robertson (8.3 points, 6.4 assists) looks like a prototypical Kansas point guard. But the 6-8 power forward Lester Earl, who transferred two years ago from Louisiana State, might be the undisciplined spark that Jayhawk basketball needs. NORTH CAROLINA (34-4) Ed Cota and Ademola Okulaja are not at the same level as the departed Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison. But Coach Bill Guthridge will rely on them while he tries to brig the freshman Jason Capel ad Ronald Curry, the football team's quarterback, around in time to make the round of 16. U.C.L.A. (24-9) If Baron Davis is truly recovered from knee surgery, his court savvy - 11.7 points, 4 rebounds and 5 as sists a game, plus 77 steals - could hold together a remarkably young ad talented team. The 6-11 freshman Dan Gadzuric could be the Bruins' best big man since Bill Walton. TEXAS CHRISTIAN (27-6) Lee Nailon entered the National Basketball Association draft, then reconsidered and brought his 24.9 points a game back to Fort Worth. The dependable point guard Prince Fowler will get him the ball. Coach Billy Tubbs has reloaded with junior college transfers for his brand of ball: pressure defense, run up the score.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 286-> SOCCER: NOTEBOOK -- EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP; Surprises In Early Qualifying
The World Cup finals seemed a lifetime away for some of Europe's most powerful nations as they misfired over the weekend in their opening qualifying matches for the 2000 European Championship. France, crowned world champion less than two months ago, could only draw, 1-1, with Iceland in Reykjavik, while Spain lost to lowly Cyprus by 3-2 in Larnaca, Cyprus, and England was defeated, 2-1, by Sweden in Stockholm. Bulgaria sustained a 3-0 loss to visiting Poland in such a convincing fashion that yesterday it brought the resignation of Coach Hristo Bonev. And Norway, which reached the 32-team World Cup finals in France, fell at home to Latvia by 3-1, Norway's first loss at home since 1991. Defeat was especially bitter for the new Norwegian coach, Nils Johan Semb, in his first major test since taking over from Egil Olsen. Croatia, a World Cup semifinalist, lost its opening match to Ireland in Dublin by 2-0, while Russia lost to Ukraine in Kiev, 3-2, in the first meeting between the two former Soviet republics. The economic crisis in Russia played a role in that game: the owners of the airline charter company that was to take the Russian team to Ukraine refused to fly until it was paid in hard currency. The Czech Republic went to Toftir in the tiny Faroe Islands and struggled to win by 1-0 in thick fog, scoring a goal five minutes from the end. Greece and Slovenia played to a 2-2 tie in Athens, Macedonia beat visiting Malta by 4-0 and Portugal defeated Hungary in Budapest by 3-0. GERMANY The German Soccer Federation announced yesterday that Berti Vogts had stepped down as coach of the national team. Vogts had been under fire since Germany's shocking 3-0 defeat by Croatia in the World Cup quarterfinals. A spokesman for the federation said that Vogts, 51, made his decision after a telephone conversation with the federation's president, Egidius Braun. Playing their first matches since their World Cup exit, the Germans failed to shine in two exhibitions last week. A narrow midweek victory over lightweight Malta, followed by a tame 1-1 draw with Romania on Saturday, went down badly with the critics of Vogts, who played 96 times for his country and was appointed national coach in 1990. The front-runner to replace Vogts is Jupp Heynckes, a former member of the national team, who is available after his contract with Real Madrid expired at the end of last season. COLLEGES The expansion of the women's National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament from 32 to 48 teams is further evidence that the women's game is getting bigger than the men's at the college level. After the success of the American women in the World Cup, which will be staged in the United States next summer, and their gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, nearly every major school now has a women's program while many schools are without men's teams. The men's Division I tournament will again have 32 teams, but it has gained increased credibility in recent years. After success at Davidson and Richmond, which will play host to the tournament for the last time this season, the Final Four will be staged at 70,000-seat Ericsson Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., next season. A number of coaches have been pushing the N.C.A.A. to allow men's Division I programs to move to a split fall-spring schedule, extend the existing fall schedule or at least allow schools to double their spring exhibition schedules. But their efforts have been ignored by the N.C.A.A., which has also refused to increase the number of teams in the men's national tournament. The N.C.A.A. has agreed to only one demand by Division I men's programs: no longer must all three N.C.A.A. divisions agree on issues. That has brought some renewed hope among Division I schools that the N.C.A.A. will allow the divisions to function separately. Men's programs have been losing players to the United States Soccer Federation's and Major League Soccer's developmental program, called Project-40, but there is still plenty of talent around to make the men's tournament competitive. Unlike the women's tournament, which has been dominated by North Carolina -- the Tar Heels have won 14 titles in the tournament's 16 years -- the men have crowned four different champions the last four years.

Nov. 15, 1998-> 287-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; Rivals Say Tennessee Is Still the Team to Conquer
The beauty of sports is that no matter how unbeatable someone looks, there is no sure thing. The 49ers and the Packers lose. Tiger Woods and Martina Hingis lose. Later or maybe sooner, the Yankees and the Bulls will lose. But will the Tennessee women's basketball team ever lose? The Lady Vols have won 45 consecutive games and the last three national championships. In separate preseason polls, 42 news media members and 40 coaches have unanimously chosen them to repeat. Even such major rivals as Louisiana Tech and Connecticut say that Tennessee seems almost a sure bet. Louisiana Tech, with its great basketball tradition, has the depth and up-tempo game to challenge Tennessee, but Coach Leon Barmore said Tennessee was so deep that it could probably beat an all-star team from all the other colleges combined. And as Geno Auriemma, the UConn coach, said, ''The only thing that would hurt Tennessee is if they lose interest.'' ''They put better players out there,'' Auriemma said. ''That's 75 percent of the battle. They've got tremendous players. They've got a tradition where they're expected to win and they expect to win. They've got terrific coaching. They play hard. They know what they're doing. Before you walk on the court against them, you have to believe you're a better team.'' Connecticut may not be a better team, not yet, anyway, but it has exciting possibilities. For all of Pat Summitt's huge coaching success at Tennessee, Auriemma has also had a big run at UConn, with the best record in the nation (166-11) over the last five seasons. His teams have played in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament the last 10 seasons and have won the Big East regular-season and tournament titles the last five seasons. And while Tennessee has the best player around in 6-foot-2-inch Chamique Holdsclaw, and all those gifted sophomores, UConn has great potential from its latest superstar in waiting and a freshman class almost as promising as Tennessee's was last year. If UConn is to threaten Tennessee for national supremacy, it must get peak performances from many players. Start with its 6-2 Russian, Svetlana Abrosimova. Last year, as a 17-year-old freshman struggling in a strange country, she was tough on and off the court. She would stay up to 4 A.M. writing papers in a language she was still trying to master, and then she would play basketball with stunning offensive skills. Over the last five seasons, UConn has turned out such all-Americans and national players of the year as Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti, Kara Wolters and Nykesha Sales. Comfortable or not, and she is not thrilled by it, Abrosimova is the designated successor. ''She needs to be great because she can be,'' Auriemma said. Abrosimova is resigned to the challenge. ''I feel people are expecting me to be the best player on the team,'' she said. ''I don't think seriously about it. I don't want to force anything, just do my part.'' Abrosimova likes to handle the ball, and Auriemma kids her about it. ''Whenever we do defensive drills,'' he said, ''she comes up with an injury that sends her to the trainer's room. When we do offensive drills, she has a miraculous recovery.'' Aside from Abrosimova, UConn's best returning players are 6-5 Paige Sauer, who is becoming a dominant post player; 5-11 Amy Duran, an outside gunner, and 6-0 Shea Ralph, whose fiery drives to the basket have not been tamed by two reconstructions of her right knee five months apart. Enter that gifted freshman class of five high school all-Americans. Three of them -- Swin Cash, Tamika Williams and Asjha (pronounced Asia) Jones -- are 6-2 power forwards. The two others -- 5-9 Sue Bird and 5-8 Keirsten Walters -- are guards. At the moment, Bird, a shooting guard in high school, is starting at point guard and Cash at forward. Auriemma said all five were playing instinctively and learning quickly. ''They are going to have to contribute significantly on a regular basis,'' he said. ''It may not be realistic to expect all of them to be great every day, but we need two or three every day, every game. Some days, all five will play terrific and the returning guys will, too, and we'll look terrific. And some days we're going to struggle. ''The freshmen are good and they have personalities that fit in. You never see that attitude that if I don't get the ball three or four times in a row, I'm going to break out in a rash. They've been around. They've played overseas. It's a different world from when kids thought they needed a visa to get from New Hampshire to Storrs.'' Ralph sat out last season after her two potentially career-ending knee operations. Now, as in her freshman year, she will probably be the first player off the bench. She acknowledges she has lost a step, but her enthusiasm, which had always been near the boiling point, is undiminished. ''I didn't know how much I loved basketball,'' she said, ''until it was taken away from me. I feel like I've been given a second chance.'' Auriemma marvels at her return. ''She used to be Barry Sanders: get the ball, weave, get to the basket, score, get fouled,'' he said. ''Now she's more like Ironhead Heyward: put your shoulder down and run over people. We're trying to get her to be a combination of the two.'' No matter how good Ralph and her teammates become, Tennessee's veteran team, 39-0 last season, looms large. The starters are Holdsclaw, the senior small forward; 5-10 Kellie Jolly, the underrated senior point guard, and three of those super sophomores -- the 6-1 power forward Tamika Catchings, the 5-10 shooting guard Semeka Randall and the 6-3 center Teresa Geter. The only place the Lady Vols needed help was at center, because 6-3 LaShonda Stephens, last year's starter, is sidelined by arthritic knees. Their only two recruits were centers -- 6-5 Michelle Snow and 6-3 Shalon Pillow. Summitt seems worried about complacency. ''We're certainly not as strong a team as you saw in March,'' she said. ''This team looks very human, very beatable at times. It puzzles me that it is not the defensive team I'm accustomed to. We need to get back to a blue-collar mentality and influence opponents. For the first time with this group, I'm concerned about a lack of commitment to defense and rebounding.'' For all of Summitt's fears or rhetoric, her fellow coaches say Tennessee's dominance is good for the sport. ''When the men's collegiate game really took off,'' said Coach Chris Gobrecht of Southern California, ''is when all the Cinderella teams started to appear in the tournament. Schools began to realize anybody could do this. They could all share in this magic. It began to intrigue the general public so much.'' And Coach Joe Ciampi of Auburn said: ''I'm not tired of talking about Tennessee. You need an example of what you're shooting for. Size is still important, but it really comes down to having players with the right combination of athletic ability and basketball skills.'' Tennessee has that. As Summitt said, ''I feel pressure when we don't have players.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 288-> Who Invited You?
Labor Day is over. The phone has stopped ringing. You don't have to wonder, Should I pick it up? You don't have to wonder, Is is them? Good guests are the people you see in the winter, too. Good guests don't bring corn from the city or dried blueberry pancake mix in an Easter basket. Good guests don't expect you to drive them to Jacob's Pillow just because they're near the state. They don't get ballistic because you have Nutrasweet instead of Sweet 'n Low. Good guests carry Sweet 'n Low with them if that's what they have to have. Decaf, too. Good guests clear, scrape, rinse and load. Even if you say: ''Sit! I love doing this!'' Good guests get their own breakfasts. They don't use all the hot water and then blow dry their hair while everyone sits drumming fingers on the kitchen table as all hope for catching a rainbow trout on a dry fly disappears because pretty soon the water will be too hot for surface feeding. Above all, good guests don't ask the following: ''Is this the same chicken you made last night?'' ''You don't have mint jelly?'' ''How come there is only one bathroom?'' ''Was that a wasp? Omigosh, that was a wasp, wasn't it?'' ''I forgot my meds. Do you know a doctor up here who would give me a prescription for three lithiums?'' ''Did I forget to tell you I'm a vegan now?'' ''Isn't it breezier at the Vineyard? Am I right? Doesn't it bother you that it's not breezier?'' ''Why don't you let me do lunch? Got any nuoc mam sauce?'' ''Does anybody mind if I do the crossword puzzle?'' ''Could I have my salad without dressing?'' ''How come this water tastes different?'' ''Did you know there's mildew in your shower?'' ''Paw. Paw, Munro, paw. Good boy. You never met Munro?'' ''Got any hard pillows?'' ''How can you not have air-conditioning?'' ''Is it O.K. if I make one quick call to Barbados?'' ''You don't care if I change the baby on your bed, do you?'' ''How come you invited [good guest]?'' Labor Day is over. The phone has stopped ringing. You don't have to wonder, Should I pick it up? Not for 361 days.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 289-> U.S. OPEN; Williams Wins 2 (Well, Officially Just 1)
Venus Williams got credit for winning only one round yesterday at the United States Open, but those who managed to wait out the weather and return to their seats at Louis Armstrong Stadium know that Williams won two very different matches against Mary Pierce. The first one was played in the early afternoon and was as dreary as the leaden sky. Williams won that encounter, 6-1, 1-0, with surprising and stultifying ease, before a stiff wind and some large raindrops sent the two players and about 9,000 fans scurrying for shelter. The second match was played two and a half hours later and was much better theater, in part because Pierce suddenly remembered that her shots needed to land in the court to count, and in part because Williams suddenly forgot how to step in and smack a service return for a winner. But Williams is an 18-year-old with an uncommon knack for staring down big expectations, and, by raising her game and volume, she found a way to win this encounter, too. She triumphed in a high-velocity tie breaker to close out a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) victory and earn a date in the quarterfinals with the French Open champion, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain. ''It's not the easiest thing to play error free, and sometimes you just have to go for your shots,'' Williams said of the final tie breaker yesterday. ''You just can't let someone step up before you do.'' When it ended, with a Pierce backhand floating past the baseline, Williams did some different sorts of steps: dancing to some rhythm that only she could hear before giving Pierce's hand a firm and delighted shake and then dancing some more after she reached her chair. ''I really shouldn't have done the dance,'' she said. ''I should have waited until later. I don't know why I did it. I hadn't planned to do the dance at all. I really had just planned to win the second set real easy.'' The second set might have been a struggle, but Williams, who reached the final here last year in her first Open and is seeded fifth this time, has still dropped only 12 games in her first four matches. She is moving well despite tendinitis in her knee. The first time Williams played Pierce, that knee was her undoing, as she had to default trailing by 4-0 in the third set in the quarterfinals in San Diego. She then had to withdraw from her next two tournaments. ''It was terrible because I just couldn't give my best,'' Williams said. ''And I really never had that situation before where I couldn't move, because movement is really an important thing in this sport. Especially for me, because I'm a good mover, and I can make you hit that extra shot or hit a little closer to the line, which is tough to do.'' Pierce, seeded 12th, had great difficulty keeping the ball anywhere inside the lines in the opening set, in which she appeared tight and off balance. ''It was like one of those days where you're totally off,'' she said. ''I didn't really feel my strokes. I didn't feel like I was in the match. ''Every point was going by too quickly without me really realizing what was going on. I was just, you know, grateful for Mother Nature to let me have that break.'' After she and Williams took turns sprinting across the concourse in the wind and rain to the refuge of the players' lounge, Pierce listened to music and talked with her coach. When she returned, she flirted much more regularly with her considerable potential: changing pace occasionally and doing her best to approach the net. But more often than not, it was a case of ''can you top this?'' with two of the most powerful women in the sport each trying to dictate play. Williams broke Pierce in the 11th game -- a game that encompassed nine deuces -- but Pierce promptly returned the favor to force the tie breaker. Pierce jumped out to a 4-1 lead, but Williams roared back to win the next 6 points. The dancing could begin, and why not? After all, how often do you win two singles matches in a single day at the United States Open?

Dec. 21, 1998-> 291-> PLUS: SOCCER -- EUROPE; English Executive Denies Bribe
Graham Kelly, who quit as English soccer's top executive because of a $5 million loan to the Welsh federation, insisted yesterday that the payment was not a bribe. A bribe to me is somebody slipping something into somebody's back pocket and then they go away and stash it in the Bahamas, he said. Kelly and the Football Association chairman, Keith Wiseman, promised the money to the Welsh Football Association without telling the rest of the executive committee of the English association. The payment has been interpreted as a bribe to gain a Welsh vote in Wiseman's favor in an election regarding FIFA, soccer's ruling body. Kelly has denied that was the motive in what has become the biggest scandal in the English association's 135-year history. He acknowledges the payment was in keeping with the English association's policy of helping cash-strapped soccer federations, and he saw nothing wrong if that policy aided England's bid to win the 2006 World Cup. What I was doing was in the best interests of English football, he said. I went into it with the very good intentions of trying to seek to strengthen England's position in world football generally and in connection with the World Cup 2006 campaign. Kelly said the World Cup bid did not need much help anyway. If the 2006 World Cup is decided on the strength of the bids, then England is in fine shape, he said. It is in the best position at the moment. It has the best case, the best grounds, the best infrastructure and I believe it will stay that way up until the time the decision is taken in March 2000.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 292-> Depression Caused Union Chief to Take Funds, His Lawyer Says
The lawyer for a New York City union leader who was expelled for embezzling more than $1.7 million said yesterday that the official, Charles Hughes, had psychiatric problems and had taken the money without criminal intent. Gerald L. Shargel, the lawyer for Mr. Hughes, the longtime president of a local representing 22,000 school cafeteria aides and crossing guards, said his client should not be charged with a criminal offense because his judgment had been badly impaired by manic depression. In June, the local's parent union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, expelled Mr. Hughes after an internal judicial panel found that he had misappropriated large sums from the union treasury. The panel found that he had his local pay $329,000 for his personal credit card bills and $685,000 for fraudulent overtime expenses, with Mr. Hughes claiming he had worked 35 hours' overtime every week for four years in a row. ''He has been unfairly maligned,'' Mr. Shargel said in an interview. ''This is a good and decent soul. In 1996 and 1997, he was going through some very dark and difficult days. I don't want to get into the personal details of this suffering, but by any analysis, his judgment was impaired. This doesn't make what he did criminal.'' The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, is investigating Mr. Hughes as part of a broad inquiry into allegations of kickbacks, embezzlement and vote fraud at his local, which is part of District Council 37, New York City's largest municipal union. The District Attorney has subpoenaed records from all 56 council locals. Union officials have also faulted Mr. Hughes for receiving more than $500,000 in payments that he said were owed to him for a $1,000-a-month stipend that he said was approved in 1971 as compensation for attending executive board meetings. He said he never received the stipend money until last year, when he demanded it retroactively, with interest. The panel also said he misappropriated other funds, as well. Mr. Hughes, who headed his local for 27 years, was widely respected in labor circles for helping his members get one of the best benefit packages for part-time workers in the country. Yet, other union leaders said, he behaved erratically in recent years: sometimes he gave speeches that mesmerized his local's members, and sometimes his speeches were nearly incoherent. Mr. Hughes was one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's most visible union supporters last year, holding a fund-raising party for him and appearing in a campaign commercial. Mr. Hughes's annual salary was $241,000. Many members of his local said they were shocked that so much money had been misappropriated. Yesterday's interview provided the first indication of what legal defense Mr. Shargel might present. He said his position that psychiatric problems drove Mr. Hughes to take the money was supported by a nationally known forensic psychiatrist, who found that Mr. Hughes's bipolar disorder had distorted his judgment and prevented him from having criminal intent. ''In any case of fraud, there has to be a contemplation of harm coupled with criminal intent to act with a bad purpose,'' Mr. Shargel said. ''I feel confident that any jury in New York hearing those instructions would acquit Charlie Hughes.'' Insisting that the payments were openly requested and approved, Mr. Shargel said it was improper for Mr. Hughes's critics to assert that he embezzled money. When Mr. Hughes asked for the $685,000 in overtime, he provided a memo saying it was approved by his executive board. Pointing to that approval, Stanley Hill, the council's executive director, authorized the payment, but the judicial panel later found that the executive board's approval was transparently fraudulent. ''He decided that it was appropriate to ask for more money,'' Mr. Shargel said. ''There were procedures in place that should not have permitted that to happen. But his detractors make it seem as if he went under dark of night and stole the money. He asked for the money. He received the money. He accepted the money. There's nothing about any of it that was done with some bad or criminal purpose.'' Mr. Shargel added: ''The money from D.C. 37 -- the retroactive overtime -- a memo went in asking for it. If it was inappropriate, under normal circumstances, someone would say, 'Charlie, you're a great guy but this is inappropriate.' But they gave it to him.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 293-> PRO FOOTBALL; Often Pugnacious Parcells Shows a Pensive Side
Bill Parcells, that old softie, wiped his eyes, celebrated with a chicken pot pie for a late-night supper and then went to bed Saturday, having taken his third National Football League team to a division title. And why not allow a bit of a smile -- even tears -- in the locker room where the Jets were celebrating their 17-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills, having become American Football Conference East champions after having won only one game only two seasons ago. And they did it in Parcells's second season with memories remaining among the players of the 1996 team that went 1-15, a season when fans who spelled out J-E-T-S claimed it stood for ''Just End the Season.'' Equally impressive, the Jets secured a first-round bye last night when Jacksonville lost at Minnesota, 50-10. Parcells had said the result of last night's game would not alter his decision on who would start in the regular-season finale next Sunday against the New England Patriots at the Meadowlands. ''You want your team to be playing well as you go,'' Parcells said yesterday, after having had only about four hours' sleep, his norm for the night after a game. ''I've noticed with a lot of teams trying to rest their players at the end of the year, it never seems to work out. I've seen teams do that and get eliminated.'' But Parcells wasn't all business yesterday. He was uncharacteristically reflective. ''You know, this is a team that initially I was a little more distant from because a lot of the players weren't sure how to take me and didn't want to cross my path, just be inconspicuous,'' he said. ''Now I think it's different. They've been around me, the guys I inherited and some of the new ones; they know what to expect.'' He thought about the holdovers from 1996, when the Jets completed a two-season run of 4-28 with Rich Kotite as the head coach. Not many are left -- less than a third of the team. ''The 1-15 guys, those are the guys that said, 'O.K., we're just going to blindly follow and hope we'll just get there,' '' Parcells said. ''There's a lot of days in the weight room when you say: 'Why are we doing this? Isn't there a better way or an easier way?' '' But, as with the Giants and with New England, there is only the Parcells way. And on the Jets, he has the total control and unquestionable authority handed down from the owner, Leon Hess. ''I know there's only one way to do it,'' Parcells said. ''Now I think I've become a little more flexible as I've gotten older, but I don't think I've ever been a guy to take pressure off my team. Pepper said you've got to be a certain kind of guy to take it and that's what I believe. It's what I've been taught; it's the way I know.'' Pepper Johnson is one of his Giants guys, like Curtis Martin is one of his Patriots guys. But now, somehow, they are all his Jets guys. ''I said to Victor Green: 'So what do you like better, Vic? Which way is better?' '' Green, a Jet since 1993, didn't have to answer. It was, of course, a rhetorical question. ''When you saw those players,'' Parcells said of the emotional locker-room scene, ''you know the game isn't about money. It's about achievement.'' The Jets have done what he believes good teams are supposed to do. Indeed, the Jets now fit his definition of a good team. They have won in the clutch, on the road. ''I feel pretty good about being able to win on the road,'' Parcells said. ''A team has to have those attributes before being any good. What makes me feel good is going to Miami, a real big game, a national game, their crowd in it and the Jets do well. Now another national game, we've got to go to Buffalo. That's a good sign for a team. We didn't play great football Saturday, but we played just to do enough. That's why you win the division.'' These are among the accomplishments that have eluded so many other Jets teams: *Three straight victories in December for the first time since 1979. *A winning record on the road for only the second time in the 1990's. *A five-game winning streak in the second half of the season for the first time since 1981. ''I think I go on the field now without worrying about what's being said,'' Parcells said. ''I think we laugh a little more now. I think they understand my personality, which can be volatile.'' He spent the rest of yesterday worrying about Christmas, what time the players will get off on Christmas Eve. He gave them off yesterday and today, and will hold practice tomorrow. The 57-year-old coach repeated another favorite motto: ''I keep saying I'm too old to lose.'' ''Not too many players understand that,'' Parcells said. ''But some of my players understand it. I understand it. When you win, it makes it all worthwhile.'' So he is hardly worried that his team -- finally, his team -- gets what he is driving at. He was asked if was concerned about how hard they would play against the Patriots. ''I don't think I'll have to stress it that much,'' he said. EXTRA POINTS It is going to be crunch time in practice this week. The Jets are putting the pads back on after Coach BILL PARCELLS had them practice for two games without pads. He believes that is why the Jets' offensive and defensive lines did not do better against the Bills in the running game. CURTIS MARTIN gained only 38 yards in 20 carries, while Bills runners picked up 146 on 36 attempts. ''When you don't practice in pads, it affects your techniques,'' Parcells said. . . . VINNY TESTAVERDE's stretch of avoiding sacks had extended to 18 quarters, including three full games. But after 153 passes, Buffalo's TED WASHINGTON took him down.

Sept. 9, 1998-> 295-> THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTION LAW; Late Primary: Just Who Does It Hurt or Benefit?
When Robert Abrams won the New York Democratic primary for Senate six years ago, his candidacy was instantly debilitated by two political realities. The first was that a rancorous primary fight had left him short on both campaign funds and good will from voters. The second was that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato had five times as much money, an advantage the Republican incumbent demonstrated the morning after the primary with a flood of advertisements attacking his new Democratic opponent. Mr. Abrams quickly disappeared from public view to raise money to pay for television advertising. But with just seven weeks between the primary and the general election, he ran out of time, and Mr. D'Amato won re-election by a single percentage point. Many Democrats believe that Mr. Abrams lost that election in those first days after the primary, a defeat that is viewed today as testimony to another way that New York State's notorious election laws protect incumbents: setting a primary so late that challengers have no time to prepare for the general election. And with this year's primary falling on Sept. 15, there are a number of Democrats who are resigned to history repeating itself. ''The late primary is a disaster for Democrats, and I think a disservice for the public as well,'' Mr. Abrams said in an interview yesterday, reflecting a criticism voiced by government watchdog groups. In Albany, one of the candidates running in the Democratic primary for governor, Peter F. Vallone, offered a similar complaint. ''I think it's a shame that we have such a late primary,'' Mr. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, told reporters. But such objections aside, it is far from clear that New York's late primary inevitably runs to the disadvantage of challengers, as was the intent of Republicans in Albany 25 years ago when they passed legislation moving it from June to September. And that might never be more true than this year. Democratic strategists looking beyond next Tuesday's primary now see a handful of scenarios in which there might be real advantages to some of the candidates, particularly in the Senate race, that might at least counterweigh the disadvantages that challengers have found with such a late primary. That kind of outcome is contingent on the primary being won by a candidate who is perceived as a long-shot candidate (correctly or not), who would benefit from the instant excitement that would attend an unexpected victory and that could well survive a short general-election campaign. Such a development seems best suited for the Senate primary and would probably apply if either Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn or Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, were to defeat Geraldine A. Ferraro. Ms. Ferraro would probably not enjoy such a slingshot effect, if only because she has repeatedly presented herself as the front-runner in the Senate primary campaign. Accordingly, her advisers seem the most concerned about the late primary. ''The earlier you know the nominee, the easier it is to run,'' said Stephen Gaskill, her communications director. ''It would be fortuitous to have an earlier primary.'' New York's is one of eight primaries that will be held on Sept. 15 this year. The others are in Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Washington. Hawaii holds its last-in-the-nation primary on Sept. 19. The accepted wisdom is that a late primary makes it more difficult to knock an incumbent out of office. Mr. Abrams is the most cited example. After his primary victory in 1992, he confronted a party that was beset by division, and he was out of money. Given the quick general-election contest that faced him, Mr. Abrams said yesterday, he should have turned first to trying to heal the rifts in the Democratic Party and begin campaigning across New York State. He could not, and instead found himself forced to make fund-raising calls in an unsuccessful effort to counter Mr. D'Amato's advertisements. ''I contend that Bob Abrams would be the incumbent United States Senator today if the primary in 1992 had been held in June,'' said Ethan Geto, who was Mr. Abrams's campaign manager. Mr. Geto called the late primary ''a scandal exceeding the swamp of special interest money.'' ''It's an incumbent protection club,'' he said. ''You have a June primary, you have the time to rest, you have the time to raise money, you have the time to get your campaign into fighting shape.'' But there are strong arguments that Mr. Abrams's problems were particular to Mr. Abrams and that returning to the original June primary might not help the out-of-power party. Had the Democrats picked a candidate for Senate by now, he or she would almost certainly have been the subject of a summerlong barrage of attacks by Mr. D'Amato, who has raised more than $20 million. What is more, the Democrats have taken a number of steps to avoid a repeat of 1992. The state's Democratic Party has assigned a senior official to work full time on preparing for the general-election campaign. Given Mr. D'Amato's perceived vulnerability, whoever wins the primary is likely to enjoy an immediate transfer of funds from national Democratic organizations in Washington, as well as contributions from Democrats across the nation who want Mr. D'Amato ousted. And unlike 1992, one of the candidates -- Mr. Schumer -- is extraordinarily well financed. He has raised more than $12 million, and could have about $4 million left after Primary Day. If Mr. Schumer is the nominee, it seems unlikely that Mr. D'Amato will enjoy the advantage of 1992, when he was able to run ads against his opponent in the days after the primary election without a response. There is clearly a consensus among Democrats running this year to move the primary back to June. ''It is unfair to voters and candidates alike to have the height of the campaign occur during a hot summer, when people are otherwise engaged,'' Mr. Green said. But that seems unlikely for the very reason that the date was changed in the first place. The people who control the State Legislature -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- are not about to change it, a point emphatically made by legislative aides over the weekend. Ultimately, though, it may not matter, and no one knows that better than any of the state legislators who were around in 1974 to vote on moving the primary from June to September. The change was pushed by Republicans trying to help Malcolm Wilson, the Lieutenant Governor who had just become the Governor. He had replaced Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had become Vice President under President Gerald R. Ford. In that first late Democratic primary, in September of 1974, another Brooklyn Congressman came out of nowhere in a crowded field to become his party's nominee, creating a storm of excitement. And that January, Hugh L. Carey was sworn in as Governor.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 296-> PRO FOOTBALL: EXTRA POINTS; Busy Debut For Rookie
According to Giants quarterback Kent Graham, the rookie wide receiver Brian Alford was the team's ''secret weapon'' in yesterday's victory over the Chiefs. Though Alford, who was playing his first game for the Giants this season, caught just 1 pass for 11 yards, he wasn't hard to notice. Alford was open often, using his speed to streak behind defenders. ''It was pretty easy to see the potential,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ''He's fast and he knows how to get open. I liked what I saw.'' Said Graham: ''Brian has progressed tremendously since the early part of the season. I think you'll see a lot of him from now on.'' Under pressure in the pocket during one first-half pass, Graham was forced to throw late to Alford, who had two steps on his defender as he ran into the end zone. The pass was batted away. In the fourth quarter, the third-string quarterback Mike Cherry also missed connecting with Alford on a possible 50-yard pass play. Williams Optimistic Giants center Brian Williams, who hasn't played the last two seasons because of double vision caused by a training camp injury before the 1997 season, was examined yesterday by team doctors. ''The doctors are optimistic and I am, too,'' Williams said. ''We'll know more later.'' Williams, 33, will meet with Fassel today to discuss his future. Big Day for Bratzke Defensive end Chad Bratzke had a career-high two and a half sacks in what may be his last game in Giants Stadium. Bratzke will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. ''Knowing that was a possibility added a lot of emotion for me,'' said Bratzke, who sacked Rich Gannon on the first play from scrimmage. Bratzke now has 12 1/2 sacks for the season, a career high. 1,000 Candles Players presented the co-owners Bob Tisch and Wellington Mara with game balls commemorating the franchise's 1,000th regular-season game. . . . Chris Calloway had four catches, moving him into third place on the Giants' career receiving list. BILL PENNINGTON

Dec. 21, 1998-> 299-> PRO FOOTBALL; Giddy, Gritty Giants Are Not Through Yet
In the penultimate week of their regular season, these Giants behaved and played like a new team, as if confidence and know-how had slipped through the transom of the locker room door and drifted from player to player. Today, the 1998 Giants find themselves bemused by the possibilities of this undefined season and giddy from the unforeseen playoff drama that is percolating in their midst. Last week's stunning upset of the Denver Broncos and today's wire-to-wire 28-7 thrashing of the Kansas City Chiefs have emboldened the Giants (7-8), and the reverie is spawning fantastic dreams. Their playoff hopes, though still remote, grow less remote with each Giants victory, and it has the players feasting in the whimsy of their situation. ''I have a funny feeling about this year,'' Corey Widmer, the Giants' middle linebacker, said with a wily smile. ''There's a vibe going on. Strange things happen in sports. People might just see something special this year.'' One wonders if the rest of the National Football League would call an 8-8 playoff team special, but the Giants are coming from the perspective of a team that was 3-7 five weeks ago. With Kent Graham at quarterback, the Giants have won four of their last five games and three in a row. Today's thorough domination of Kansas City (6-9) has turned optimism into conviction. ''I think this thing could happen just the way we want it to,'' said Graham, who had his second consecutive strong effort, guiding the Giants to a 28-0 lead by the third quarter. The way the Giants want it to happen is this: First, Tampa Bay (7-8) must lose at Cincinnati early Sunday afternoon, and later that same day, the Giants must win at Philadelphia and the Arizona Cardinals (8-7) must lose at home to San Diego. Because of tie-breaking procedures, any other combination of results in those three games means the Giants do not make the playoffs. If the Giants win and Tampa Bay and Arizona lose, the Giants will play in the first round of the playoffs at Dallas. That the Giants are still involved in the high drama -- or high camp -- of a playoff chase at this late stage of the season had Coach Jim Fassel marveling at his team's turnabout. ''It is amazing, it really is,'' he said moments after today's victory, which came in the 1,000th regular-season game in Giants history. ''I mean, the way the season is going and who is beating who right now. It may be a little late for us, but I thought a while ago that an 8-8 record might be good enough. ''All we can do is take care of our last game. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.'' After their poor start, most Giants, like Fassel, had a fatalistic approach to the rest of the season, though it was mixed with a newfound bravado for the challenge. ''I think the Denver game gave us a confidence we may have been missing all season,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''I wish we had played Denver in the 10th game of the season. Maybe we'd have a few more wins now. ''The confidence we built against the Broncos definitely carried over to today's game.'' The team the Giants most resembled today was last year's Giants, whose ferocious pass rush and opportunistic secondary took over several games. It was a formula the Giants employed early and often today. On the first play of the game, Kansas City quarterback Rich Gannon was sacked and had to temporarily leave the game with a knee injury. Two plays later, Gannon's replacement, the former starter Elvis Grbac, threw behind wide receiver Derrick Alexander, the ball deflecting off Alexander and ricocheting to Giants safety Percy Ellsworth, who caught the ball at the Chiefs' 43-yard line. Ellsworth returned the interception virtually untouched for a touchdown. It was the second interception return for a touchdown this year by Ellsworth, who would add another interception in the second half. ''A defensive turnover for the first score of the game is often really hard to overcome; it sets a tone,'' Fassel said. ''That's the kind of thing we did to other teams last year.'' Cornerback Phillippi Sparks and linebacker Jessie Armstead also had interceptions in the second half, thwarting the Chiefs' rather timid attempts at rallying. While the Giants' secondary and defensive front four were harassing Kansas City quarterbacks -- Gannon returned to the game and was forced to leave again with a head and neck injury -- the Giants' offense was also attacking with an early charge. The Giants' first possession was 12 plays and covered 83 yards, concluding with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Graham to Amani Toomer, the same combination that won the Giants' game against Denver. Former mates on the Giants' second unit, Graham and Toomer clearly exhibit a football rapport and an ability to produce pass plays deep downfield. The length of the passes Graham attempts to throw is the biggest difference in the Giants' passing game since Danny Kanell was benched. Graham today completed 16 of 33 passes for 167 yards, but he did not throw an interception. He connected with Ike Hilliard for a 32-yard gain, and he completed eight other passes for 10 or more yards. The Giants added to their 14-0 lead in the second quarter on a 1-yard touchdown run by Gary Brown, who had another steady game, rushing for 103 yards on 25 attempts. The Giants also benefited from nine penalties against the Chiefs, who are the most penalized team in the N.F.L. In the third quarter, a pass interference penalty on Kansas City's Mark McMillian gave the Giants the ball on the Kansas City 18. Four plays later, Graham sliced up the middle of the Chiefs' defense for 6 yards and the Giants' fourth touchdown. A 4-yard touchdown pass from Grbac to Tony Gonzalez ruined the Giants' shutout late in the third quarter. Although the fourth quarter was the last Giants football inside Giants Stadium this season -- they cannot be host to a playoff game -- few of the 66,040 spectators who attended the game remained in their seats to see it. What they missed was more lifeless play by the Chiefs and a Giants team already casting its dreams for a miraculous playoff stretch run. ''Nobody gave us a shot,'' Graham said. ''People said our schedule was too tough. And it has been tough. But we've won these games. And right now, the playoffs could happen for us.'' Widmer, meanwhile, who composes classical music in his spare time, was still painting the Giants' playoff situation in almost mystical terms. ''Sometimes things evolve, like they're just supposed to happen that way,'' he said. ''Funny things happen.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 301-> Two Old Foes in Ulster Wars Speak Directly in First Meeting
Two of the bitterest perennial enemies in the war and peace in Northern Ireland spoke directly to each other for the first time today in a brief polite dialogue aimed at furthering the peace effort. Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army, and David Trimble, the Protestant First Minister of the new provincial Assembly, exchanged mild statements in a meeting that just a few years ago most people here could not have foreseen. The meeting was an otherwise dull preliminary session of leaders of the assembly, established to put in place political changes that would give Catholics added power in this predominantly Protestant province and the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in northern affairs. But when Mr. Trimble, who is also head of the Ulster Unionist Party, addressed the Sinn Fein leader by name, another modest historic step was taken in the five-year-old peace effort. Neither leader had any emotion in his voice, according to people at the meeting, which was closed to reporters and camera crews. For years Mr. Trimble refused to meet Mr. Adams, who, he said, represented the I.R.A., an illegal organization that had killed hundreds of Protestants. Mr. Adams has said the only way to deal with sectarian problems was direct talk. Mr. Trimble described the meeting, at the Stormont government complex in Belfast, as ''workmanlike.'' Mr. Adams said it had been a ''good engagement.'' The men are to meet alone on Thursday, presumably to discuss the issue that threatens to impede the work of the Assembly, the disarmament of the I.R.A. The two leaders did not discuss disarmament, called decommissioning here, but made oblique references to the problem. ''The word 'decommissioning' was not used by anyone,'' Mr. Adams said. Mr. Trimble spoke of the responsibility of ''paramilitary-related parties,'' a clear reference to Sinn Fein and the disarmament issue. Essentially, Mr. Trimble, as chairman of the Assembly, is insisting that there be some I.R.A. disarmament before the next step is taken. That is the creation of a Cabinet to enact the provisions of the peace agreement that party leaders and referendums here and in the Irish Republic approved in the spring. Mr. Adams says disarmament should not be a precondition for Sinn Fein's gaining ministerial posts in the new provincial executive body to be created by the Assembly. The executive Cabinet is to create cross-border institutions in which politicians from both sides of the border cooperate in areas like tourism and agriculture. The I.R.A. said last week that it had no plans to disarm. Just before President Clinton's visit here last week Mr. Adams said that he thought that the I.R.A. campaign of violence was a thing of the past. But Protestant leaders were quick to point out that he did not state that the I.R.A. had permanently abandoned violence. Mr. Trimble has been slow to deal directly with Mr. Adams and Sinn Fein, because that would leave him open to attacks by dissident members of his party and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley, who boycotted the meeting today in Parliament Buildings, the former site of the provincial legislature that Britain dissolved in 1972, at the height of the sectarian violence. ''We are not negotiating the future of our province with them,'' Mr. Paisley said of Sinn Fein. ''Nor are we taking part in acts of government with them.'' -------------------- Dissidents Call Cease-Fire 'Complete' DUBLIN, Ireland, Tuesday, Sept. 8 (AP) The Irish Republican Army dissidents responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity called a ''complete'' cease-fire today but did not apologize for their actions. Unwilling to accept the I.R.A.'s July 1997 cease-fire, the splinter group, known as the Real I.R.A., committed the Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 29 civilians and wounded more than 330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. On Aug. 19 the dissidents declared a ''suspension'' of what it called their ''military operations,'' a step short of today's decision to call a formal cease-fire. In its statement issued to the Irish state broadcasters RTE, the dissidents -- calling themselves simply I.R.A. or its traditional Gaelic sister label, or ''Soldiers of Ireland'' -- said they had decided on ''a complete cessation of all military activity.''

Nov. 15, 1998-> 302-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; Coaches Try To Keep Up With Game
There are enough familiar schools at the top of the preseason men's polls (Duke, Connecticut) to comfort college basketball aficionados. There are some names on the all-America lists (Elton Brand, Richard Hamilton) that promise electrifying drama as the season arcs toward one more show-stopping national tournament. So will college basketball be good? And, more important, is college basketball well? Surprisingly, no one rushes in with a resounding ''yes'' to either question. The game is changing at warp speed, and some of its most respected caretakers aren't sure they are equipped to keep up. The parade of players who left college early to join the National Basketball Association has become a stampede, as even high school players insist on drop-stepping straight to the pros. North Carolina's Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter were among eight players who left college early and were drafted in the National Basketball Association's top-10 picks last spring; one of them, Larry Hughes, left St. Louis after his freshman year. Point-shaving scandals surfaced at Arizona State and Northwestern, reminders of how easily these threats can take hold in a supercharged atmosphere. Constant recruiting violations; crimi nal behavior off the court; summer leagues for high school players in which many teams pay for play -- all threaten to knock college basketball off its wobbly pedestal. ''Our game is in great shape and it is in poor shape,'' said Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. ''On the court, it is played passionately at a high level. But it's getting knocked back and back because the rules governing college basketball haven't kept up with this fast-break of changes. The house is still beautiful, but we may have termites.'' Those changes -- especially the early flight of players to the N.B.A. -- have already affected everything from coaching and recruiting philosophies to the caliber of play. No one suggests they are killing the game, but they are dramatically reshaping how coaches assemble and run their teams -- and how good those teams are. Krzyzewski has been to the Final Four seven times and won two national championships. His current Blue Devil team is rated No. 1 in most preseason polls, which he believes is an honest assessment of a talented bunch. But Krzyzewski doesn't hesitate to say that the Johnny Dawkins-led 1986 national runner-up was much better, and that the Christian Laettner-Grant Hill back-to-back national champions of 1991 and '92 were better still. ''There has been a narrowing of the gap between the top-10 teams to, what, the top 100 or so because of how fluid things are,'' he said. ''But there's no doubt the dominant teams, in the days when kids stayed all four years, played better basketball than today. The downside was that there was a greater gap between these dominant teams and everybody else.'' Last spring's National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, as well as this year's preseason favorites, illustrate the shifting dynamic. A senior-laden team from tiny Valparaiso drove into the round of 16. Rhode Island, with an unheralded, veteran backcourt of Tyson Wheeler and Cuttino Mobley, made it to the round of eight. Stanford and Utah, neither with a super talent, made the Final Four and the Utes lost in the final to Kentucky. ''You look at the guys who have left North Carolina and Kentucky, and you wonder if you can get kids a level below that and keep them four years,'' said Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery. ''Look at the Rhode Island guards. I don't know where they were drafted, but they weren't lottery picks and they took them to the brink of the Final Four.'' Mobley and Wheeler were both drafted in the second round. Montgomery's Stanford team returns 11 lettermen, 5 seniors, all of its starters; it is projected to contend for the title. In fact, the top spots in the preseason polls are crowded with teams from which most people could not name a star. Washington, Xavier, Tennessee and Temple are hardly known for producing lottery picks among their younger players. ''When you come in together and then stay, you experience the same difficulties and joys and it makes you closer,'' said Mark Seaton, the Stanford senior forward. The coaches concede that it makes for a far better team, too, and most have accepted that having a super talent who is around for his senior year is rare. Utah's point guard, Andre Miller, is one, but his choice made sense because he did not begin to create lottery buzz until late in Utah's superb season. Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun has lost Ray Allen and Donyell Marshall early to the draft, and last spring he almost lost Richard Hamilton, the Big East player of the year. Hamilton, now a junior, decided to return. He, along with the sophomore Khalid El-Amin, gives the Huskies perhaps their best chance ever to crack the Final Four. There is a sense of urgency -- both will probably be gone after this season. Like most coaches, Calhoun says he does not recruit the Hamiltons and El-Amins believing they will leave early. But somewhere along the way, the hard truth sets in. ''I've never done a study of theater, but I don't know what happens if a brilliant young actor in his junior year decides to leave,'' said Calhoun, who believes the college game must just soldier on. ''I don't know if it's particularly bad for the symphony at the university when someone gifted goes on. People don't necessarily have to see superstars. They have to see super competition.'' The competition on the court remains of high quality, but Krzyzewski argues that those who govern the game need to be more active in identifying potential problems and solving them. One of the boldest proposals comes from the Big Ten commissioner, Jim Delany, who suggested making freshmen and junior-college transfers ineligible, eliminating summer recruiting and encouraging the N.B.A. to set up a minor league for athletes not interested in college. To illustrate just how quick things come up, Krzyzewski likes to tell of how in the summer of 1990, before Grant Hill's freshman year at Duke, no one ever asked Hill if he intended to play professional basketball. Now, for the first time in his 18 years at Duke, Krzyzewski has a player -- Brand -- who is not likely to stay all four years and graduate with his class. What was once a sure-fire, three-prong recruiting pitch, Krzyzewski says, has become partly obsolete. ''I could tell them: One, you'll become a better player here. Two, you'll earn a degree -- a real one, not one to keep you eligible. Three, in four years you'll make more money as a player -- the bottom line will improve. ''Now only the first two are true.'' So come tournament time, older teams with slightly lesser talent may keep going deeper than expected. The superstars can't afford to stay around.

Christer Olsson scored twice, leading world champion Sweden to a 5-3 victory yesterday over Russia in Moscow, capturing the Baltika Cup, the third tournament on the European hockey tour. Thomas Johansson and Olsson scored just over a minute apart early in the second period to break a 2-2 tie. Then Samuel Pahlsson connected early in the third for the winners. We are satisfied with the results, Swedish Coach Sune Bergman said. We tried out several new players for the world championships. Sweden leads the overall standing with 13 points. Finland has 10, the Czech Republic eight, and Russia 5.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 305-> Diagnosis in the I.C.U.
To the Editor: Dr. Sandeep Jauhar, in his essay ''When a Stay in Intensive Care Unhinges the Mind'' on Dec. 8, is correct that invoking the term I.C.U. psychosis often deters investigation for a possible organic cause. And, despite much literature supporting his view, common practice, especially with children, is to treat neither the symptoms nor the cause until the episode has become severe enough to pose a management problem for staff. Lack of appropriate diagnosis and treatment not only risks life and may prolong the hospital stay, but often results in unnecessary suffering. It has long been established that even very low doses of anti-psychotic medication may substantially relieve symptoms. Perhaps Dr. Jauhar's article will remind physicians that I.C.U. psychosis is not a diagnosis until more substantive possibilities have been ruled out. MEREDITH M. PLATT New York

Dec. 21, 1998-> 306-> Supporters Hoping for Clemency For Woman Who Killed Abuser
Advocates for battered women are hoping to persuade Gov. George E. Pataki to commute the sentence of a Queens woman convicted of killing her boyfriend. The woman, Linda White, has been imprisoned for nine years, following her conviction for shooting her boyfriend, John Strouble, five times with his gun following years of alleged torture and abuse. Ms. White says that on the night in October 1989 that she killed Mr. Strouble, he had pressed his gun to her head and pulled the trigger on an empty chamber in a game of Russian roulette. Advocates who celebrated Mr. Pataki's decision to grant clemency to Charline Brundidge, the first battered woman to be granted clemency in New York State, said they were watching closely to see how he handles Ms. White's case. ''We didn't want Charline to be the only one,'' said Mary Lynch, an Albany Law School professor who spearheaded Ms. Brundidge's successful clemency petition in 1996. ''This will give us a chance to see if this was an aberrational blip or something that will continue out of a concern for the issue of domestic violence.'' A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, would not comment on what the Governor might decide. Gubernatorial clemency decisions are usually announced just before Christmas. In many ways, the Brundidge and White cases were similar. Neither had a criminal history, and both appeared to have snapped after years of abuse. Both turned themselves in immediately after the shootings. After her mother died, Ms. White, now 51, supported and reared her four younger siblings, in addition to her own three children. One of those brothers, Leon Meyers, once banged on a neighbor's door in the Queens housing project where they lived, pleading for help after Mr. Strouble had allegedly left Ms. White bound naked to a chair. Ms. White says Mr. Strouble would frequently hit and punch her. She said he would shoot his gun out the window to show her it was loaded then jam it against her head and pull the trigger. Neighbors who saw and heard Mr. Strouble beating Ms. White testified at her trial to back up many of her claims of persistent abuse. Forty-nine people have written letters on her behalf. Ms. White was convicted of second-degree murder in 1990 and sentenced to 32 years to life in prison. Ms. Brundidge of Rochester, was serving a sentence of 15 years to life for murdering her husband with five .38-caliber shots in the head and chest when Mr. Pataki commuted her sentence.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 307-> PRO FOOTBALL; Battered but Unbowed, Patriots Make Playoffs
So many New England Patriots have spent nearly as much time on ice in the training room as on the field this season. Today against the San Francisco 49ers, the Patriots entered with more players ailing and out, chief among them quarterback Drew Bledsoe (broken finger), receiver Terry Glenn (broken ankle) and linebacker Willie McGinest (pulled groin). That is three starters contributing zilch, two of them Pro Bowlers. Glenn, too, is Pro Bowl caliber, the Patriots' best deep pass-catching threat. ''With those guys out and all our starters basically here, the odds are that you would expect us to win,'' 49ers linebacker Lee Woodall said. ''We just played a Monday night game at home where we stopped Barry Sanders, and then we come here a let a rookie get a lot of yards on us. What's that all about?'' Good question. What is it about the 49ers that makes them unbeaten (7-0) at home and just average (4-4) on the road? What was it today about their offense, which produced 21 first-half points and then nothing in the second half? The Patriots think they have the answers after beating San Francisco, 24-21, before 59,153 fans at Foxboro Stadium, and joining the Buffalo Bills in gaining wild-card playoff spots today. ''Those guys have won a lot in the past,'' Patriots cornerback Tebucky Jones said of the 49ers, ''but they ran into a team today that knows in the N.F.L. that backups have to perform like the starters -- and we did. In the fourth quarter our defense, our whole team, was amped up. We took the momentum.'' Patriots linebacker Chris Slade, who had nine tackles and a sack, said: ''They're the 49ers -- they expect to win. But we have goals, too. We went to the Super Bowl two years ago. We made the playoffs last year. We've become accustomed to winning, and this game meant as much to us as it did to them. And that's how we played.'' It meant making the playoffs for the third consecutive season, a franchise record. The Patriots are 9-6, with their regular-season finale at the Jets next Sunday. San Francisco slipped to 11-4 and will finish against St. Louis at home. The game was won on Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal with three seconds remaining. Down by 21-14 at halftime, New England scored 10 points in the final quarter to swipe the victory. It was a steady second-half showing by the Patriots' defense. It was a heroic effort by the backup quarterback Scott Zolak and the rookie running back Robert Edwards. Zolak, an eight-year veteran, was making his first pro start in three years. Bledsoe had started the last 58 Patriot games, but Zolak was asked to replace the injured Bledsoe and guide the Patriots with the best he could produce. ''Early, he was struggling some, rushing things,'' Patriots receiver Shawn Jefferson said. ''He was saying that the game was a lot faster than in practice. But he had confidence in himself. He got the game going for us.'' Zolak finished with 205 passing yards, completing 14 of 30 passes. He threw two touchdowns and two interceptions. He was comparable to the 49ers mainstay Steve Young, who had a 267-yard passing day with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. Zolak tossed a 19-yard swing pass to Edwards for a touchdown, which opened the scoring with 2 minutes 56 seconds left in the first quarter. After San Francisco tied it in the second quarter with a Young-to-Jerry Rice score of 75 yards, Zolak showed a strong arm and nice touch with a 61-yard scoring strike to Jefferson. The 49ers blitzed, the Patriots provided maximum protection and Zolak stood tall in the pocket, throwing the football deep down the right sideline and hitting Jefferson in stride. ''Everybody doubts this team a lot,'' Zolak said. ''There are injuries all over the place. People just keep stepping in, and now we're in it again.'' The 49ers' second touchdown of the second quarter was followed by a third, an unusual aborted field-goal attempt that turned into holder Ty Detmer's 25-yard scoring toss into the end zone to tight end Irv Smith as time expired in the half. It looked as if the 49ers would have the edge in spirit in the second half. But after gaining 14 first downs in the first half, they had only 7 in the second. They punted only once in the first half but three times in the second. And though Garrison Hearst rushed for 107 yards and has 1,549 for the season, eclipsing Roger Craig's 49ers single-season rushing mark of 1,502 yards set in 1988, Hearst gained only 45 second-half rushing yards. ''They played strong football,'' Young said of the Patriots. The Patriots shut the 49ers down in the final 30 minutes, with Patriots safety Willie Clay intercepting Young early in the fourth quarter at the San Francisco 49. That set up a drive that Edwards finished with a powerful 5-yard scoring run up the middle. The score was tied at 21-21 with 7:34 remaining. The 49ers' offense sagged to three plays and a punt on their next two drives. New England got the ball at the San Francisco 41 with 1:48 left and Edwards ran for 10, 3, 1 and 5 yards to set up the winning field goal. ''I'm starting to know what to do, to see my blocking well,'' Edwards said. ''I'm growing up as a football player.'' He rushed for 101 yards and has 1,068 for the season, only the third Patriots rookie back to reach the 1,000 mark. Another Patriots rookie, receiver Tony Simmons, led the team in catches today with five. The rookie Damon Denson started at left guard and was effective. Rookies and substitutes mixing with old hats. The Patriots won it that way, with pure resolve. ''Seeing people hanging together and stay with the coaches and believe in the game plan and put it to work and make it come through, I just can't say enough,'' said the elated Patriots head coach, Pete Carroll. ''It was a collective effort by so many people to get this thing done.''

Sept. 8, 1998-> 308-> Tourism Thrives, but Portfolio Jitters Could Quiet the Boom
The summer travel season ended yesterday with expectations that it had set another record and with forecasts of record tourism again this fall. The nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America had estimated that Americans would take 251 million trips this summer, 3 percent more than last year, and it has predicted a record 196 million travelers this fall, a 5 percent increase over last fall. But while the association's forecasts have generally been close, since they take travel intentions as their measure of the likelihood of travel, those intentions are unusually iffy now, given the unpredictability of the economy, the unreliability of the weather and the fickleness of would-be travelers. So projections for fall travel may be shaken by the same uncertainty that bedeviled this summer's travel plans. Who, for example, could have foreseen the Northwest Airlines strike, which has affected about 150,000 passengers a day, including many would-be tourists, since it began two weeks ago? Or who could have predicted the recent stock market slide? The Wall Street selloff could play a big role in fall travel. Tourism in the autumn depends heavily on retirees and other older people who prefer to travel then, when there are fewer crowds and lower prices than in the summer, but who also pay particularly close attention to swings in the market. While the Travel Industry Association has found a steady increase over four years in the number of people who say they intend to take children with them on vacation in the fall (40 percent this year), it has also found that travelers planning to take the longest trips this fall will be ages 65 or older (15 nights average) and retired (14 nights). While 41 percent of respondents to the poll said they expected to spend less than $500 each on fall pleasure trips, people on their longest trips of the season planned to spend an average of $871. But those averages appear likely to dwindle if travelers' stock portfolios continue to decline. Meantime, many cities and states had either a record or a robust summer season, the result of a strong economy, low gasoline prices and generally favorable weather. Cape Cod, for example, had a ''great summer,'' according to the Falmouth Chamber of Commerce, helped by an influx of European visitors. The $51 million in July room rental revenues in Ocean City, Md., topped last year's July revenues by almost 10 percent and exceeded the previous July record of $48 million, set in 1995. Unseasonably warm weather beginning in April is expected to lead Michigan to report a record number of summer visitors, while similar good weather helped fill Minnesota's hotels, resorts and campgrounds, and, tourism officials say, is likely to continue well into the fall. Visitors to Connecticut this summer helped that state take in $2.3 million more in hotel taxes than it collected last summer. The Carolinas also attracted plenty of tourists this summer, at least until Hurricane Bonnie forced the evacuation of visitors along with residents late last month. An estimated 120,000 of the 200,000 people ordered to leave the coastal areas of Horry and Georgetown counties in South Carolina were tourists, according to Governor David Beasley. North Carolina officials estimated that the hurricane inflicted more than $1 billion in damage along the coast and cost the state millions more in lost tourism revenue. Although Hurricane Earl pounded Florida's Gulf Coast last week, doing substantial damage, it departed before the crucial Labor Day weekend. Texas tourism, second in size only to that of California, had to cope with sweltering heat in the Dallas area last month as well as forest fires in Mexico earlier this summer that created smog conditions and led to a statewide health alert. Like the smoke from Mexico's fires, the effects of Asia's economic crisis were felt inside United States borders. Hardest hit was Hawaii, which managed to attract 26,670 more visitors from the United States mainland during June and July than it did in those months last year, but lost 51,540 visitors from Asia (mostly Japan) over the same months of comparison. August figures are not expected to show any improvement. California also felt the effects of the Asian downturn, as did even Las Vegas, Nev. -- although after it doubled its advertising budget for the summer, to $5 million, the number of visitors in May rose 1.3 percent over those last May, while June's visitor figures rose 1.1 percent over those of the previous June. Preliminary figures for July, which have not yet been compiled, indicate a further gain over 1997, which itself saw a record 30.5 million visitors. ''Those were pretty modest increases,'' acknowledged Rob Powers, public relations director for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, ''but they marked a turnaround from the first quarter of this year, when visitation was down a couple of percentage points.'' His tone made it clear that in a city with 106,000 hotel beds to fill each night, soon to rise to 126,000, even modest increases are welcome.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 309-> Would Repentance Help Clinton?; Mr. Starr's Conflicts
To the Editor: Anthony Lewis's Sept. 1 correction of an earlier column says Kenneth W. Starr, the Independent Counsel, is no longer earning ''millions'' from his private practice. But the more important issue is why he was able to do so for four years into his various investigations of President Clinton with only a few voices articulating this blatant conflict of interest. If anyone still doubts that Mr. Starr's investigation is not governed by partisan politics, consider the fact that he has defended the tobacco industry, a bloc hardly hospitable to Mr. Clinton's agenda, while looking into such issues as whether or not the President may have committed perjury. Yet when the tobacco executives raised their hands before Congress and made the outrageous statement under oath that nicotine was not addictive, Mr. Starr's silence was deafening.

Sept. 9, 1998-> 310-> THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: ON THE TRAIL; 3 Democrats in Race for Senate Strive to Rally Supporters
With Primary Day just a week away, the three candidates for the Democratic nomination for Senate returned to their strengths yesterday, trying to rally key constituencies to counter what has been a lackluster campaign. Representative Charles E. Schumer brought out James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was disabled during the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, to champion his record on gun control. Geraldine A. Ferraro held a news conference to draw attention to her record and her stands on women's issues. Even as she was doing so, the third candidate for the nomination, Mark Green -- who has also made a strong appeal for the women's vote -- was telling a group of female business owners that Ms. Ferraro does not deserve their support just because she is a woman. In a piece of comic political timing, Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Schumer each scheduled news conferences yesterday for City Hall Park, with hers just wrapping up as his was beginning. But as they have throughout the campaign, the two candidates ignored each other. In terms of pure visual drama, Mr. Schumer won the day, and sent news cameras into overdrive, when he entered the park pushing Mr. Brady's wheelchair. His speech still slurred by the bullet that entered his brain and nearly ended his life 17 years ago, Mr. Brady read an endorsement speech as Mr. Schumer stood behind him with head bowed. ''Now, I'm a Republican, have been all my life,'' Mr. Brady said. ''But in politics and in life, you have to help those who help you. And nobody has helped us and New York more than Chuck Schumer. I can honestly say that a lot of the reason that we have the Brady law and the assault-weapons ban is because of this man.'' Mr. Schumer was the sponsor of and driving force behind the 1993 Brady bill, which strengthened restrictions on handgun ownership. The bill is the hallmark of Mr. Schumer's legislative career, and one of the focal points of his candidacy. He was also instrumental in the passing of the Federal assault-weapons ban. Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, the chairwoman of Handgun Control, a nonprofit group that lobbies for gun control, also offered an impassioned endorsement. ''More than anybody,'' she said, ''I can speak to this man's tenacity, commitment, his hard work. He is the most amazing machine I've ever seen on Capitol Hill.'' Ms. Ferraro countered with Ellen R. Malcolm, the president of Emily's List, a national organization that supports female Democratic candidates in favor of abortion rights by bundling campaign contributions. The group has already raised a considerable amount of money for Ms. Ferraro, although the campaign declined to specify how much, and Ms. Malcolm pledged to do even more should Ms. Ferraro win the chance to take on Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in the general election. Ms. Ferraro became the first woman to run for Vice President on a major party ticket when the Democrats nominated her in 1984, and she is clearly hoping that women will make their enthusiasm for her felt at the polls. ''This is a race that could come down to women really exercising their right to vote,'' she said. To that end, Ms. Ferraro yesterday cited her record on a range of traditional women's issues: her creation of a special victims' bureau to handle domestic violence cases and sex crimes when she was a prosecutor in the Queens District Attorney's office; her defense of abortion rights, and her attempt to get a bill passed mandating equal pay for equal work when she was in the House of Representatives. ''No matter what kind of a female voice that Al D'Amato puts into his commercials, if you look behind the commercials and see what he has done with reference to women when he votes legislatively, you have to know he is not voting in our best interests,'' said Ms. Ferraro, who has also been endorsed by the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women. But in Mr. Green's speech to two dozen members of the National Association of Women Business Owners, which he delivered at the midtown Manhattan offices of Anchin, Block & Anchin, an accounting firm, he said he had the strongest record among the candidates in protecting women's rights. He cited his lobbying efforts to get RU-486, the abortion pill, imported to the United States, his work to expose price discrimination against women, and a bill now before the City Council that he co-wrote that would protect victims of domestic abuse from discrimination at work if they need special security accommodations. When he was Consumer Affairs Commissioner, he said, he wrote a report on discrimination against women by divorce lawyers that led the Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals, Judith S. Kaye, to impose strict new regulations on divorce lawyers. After outlining his record, Mr. Green, who is the New York City Public Advocate, took on Ms. Ferraro. ''Now at the beginning of this campaign, when Geraldine Ferraro announced her candidacy, I concluded what counts more than gender is agenda,'' he said. ''And I yield to no one my ardor and accomplishment in the area of women's human rights and economic rights.'' Mr. Green went on to say that if the three candidates stood behind a curtain and described their records with their voices modulated to disguise their sex, ''I would get the lion's share of support because of agenda, not gender.'' With all three candidates now doing extensive advertising on television, Ms. Ferraro perhaps best summed up the political mood. ''This is going to be an exciting race,'' she said. ''It is very tight now.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 312-> PLUS: BOXING; 2 Boxers Furious After Losing
Hasim Rahman and Angel Manfredy claimed to be victims of crimes in the ring in Miami on Saturday night. Both believe they were robbed. But they would have a better chance of getting assault charges filed against their opponents than theft charges against the referees. Rahman, pinned between the second and third ropes, was being pummeled by David Tua when the Referee Telis Assemenios stepped in to stop the heavyweight bout at 35 seconds of the 10th round. Manfredy, also pinned against the ropes, was being battered by Floyd Mayweather Jr. when the Referee Frank Santore stopped their bout at 2 minutes 47 seconds of the second round. Rahman (29-1) feels more victimized than Manfredy (24-3-1) does because Rahman was leading on all three judges' scorecards when the bout was stopped. And he had the presence of mind to react angrily when Assemenios called a halt to the fight, although Rahman staggered as he walked back to his corner. Manfredy seemed dazed as he headed back to his corner. Later he said politics and the desire to see Mayweather retain his World Boxing Council super featherweight title played heavily in the decision to stop the bout. It was not a strong argument, considering Mayweather (19-0) landed 56 of 120 punches he threw in the two rounds and landed 45 of 86 power punches, according to CompuBox statistics, while Manfredy landed just 19 of 86 punches thrown and connected with just three jabs. Florida Boxing Commission rules do not allow for standing 8-counts. According to Assemenios, during prefight instructions in the dressing rooms boxers were informed that if they were in trouble they should take a knee and would be given an 8-count. Both Rahman and Manfredy were between the ropes, which could have been considered a knockdown and would have made them eligible for an 8-count. But Assemenios and Santore believed both fighters were unable to defend themselves. Steve Nelson, Rahman's co-manager, said he planned to file a protest with the International Boxing Federation, which sanctioned the bout, on the grounds that the stoppage was premature and because Tua (33-1) had hit Rahman after the bell in the previous round. Had Rahman's corner vehemently protested the late blow, it could have got a five-minute rest for its fighter. If the protest succeeds, the I.B.F. can order a rematch. If it fails, Tua will become the No.1 contender for the I.B.F. title, awaiting the outcome of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis unification bout on March 13 at Madison Square Garden. TIMOTHY W.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 313-> TELEVISION REVIEW; Serving Beer but Making Waves
There are entirely too many colorfully crude blue-collar characters in ''Costello,'' and the show's star, Sue Costello, is one of them. The weird thing about this new Fox sitcom, which has its premiere tonight at 8:30, is that it purports to be in favor of getting away from all that tackiness. Sue Murphy (Ms. Costello, a stand-up comedian who looks like a cross between Ellen DeGeneres and Ann Heche but sounds like Rose Marie) has just broken up with her boyfriend, P. J., because she wants more than her narrow little life as a bartender in South Boston has to offer. P.J. has proposed because he finally has the security he needs: a job with the transit authority -- on the Red Line, no less. But when Sue says, oh boy, that's great, now I can stop tending bar and take some courses at UMass, P. J. looks at her blankly, and she realizes something crucial: ''I'm not the person I want to be yet.'' So she decides to dump P.J., open a dictionary and learn a new word every day. Even more shocking, she starts going to a psychotherapist. Which leads her to begin talking to herself -- well, doing her affirmations (''You're pretty, you're smart, and you're strong'') -- while gazing into the Coors mirror behind the bar. Her regular customers order by saying, ''Hey, Sue, could you actualize your potential and get me a beer?'' This premise has possibilities, sort of an Irish-American ''Educating Rita'' with attitude. But audiences aren't likely to believe for a minute that Sue Murphy has her eye on some better way of experiencing life. She's far too comfortable among the fighting, the four-letter words and the bathroom jokes; in fact she seems to relish it all. Sue's handsome, blond younger brother, Jimmy (Chuck Walczak), seems likelier to break out of the lower-middle-class milieu. Whatever happens with the series, it's sad to see Dan Lauria, who was so affecting and complicated as the 1960's father in ABC's ''Wonder Years,'' reduced to a stereotype as Sue's rough-edged dad. The first episode of ''Costello'' does have one bright spot, though. When P. J's two sisters -- one of whom looks like Anybody's, the boyish teen-age girl in ''West Side Story,'' and the other like a Nazi commandant -- walk into the bar, they do bring to mind, for a second, ''Newhart'' and the first time Darryl and Darryl walked into Dick Loudon's Vermont inn.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 314-> Sports of The Times; Many Joys of a Home Run Lovefest
THE home run record has been going down for weeks. The only things missing were the details, like: Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris with his 61st home run yesterday, while Sammy Sosa stayed at 58. What was not obvious, even a few weeks ago, was the way Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa would welcome everybody on board with their big hugs and their open smiles, the body language of two good human beings who have found each other. The signals are that this is for everybody, for Mr. and Mrs. America, for the people in the Caribbean, for the family of Roger Maris, for the memory of Babe Ruth, for the people who buy tickets and sweat in the stands, for anybody who admires grace under pressure. In Busch Stadium yesterday, fans in red shirts cheered a player in a blue-and-white uniform. It's almost as stupendous a development as ''I saw a man who danced with his wife in Chicago,'' as the lyrics go. In an era of baseball stars who have a policy of not speaking, and steroid-rage football and in-your-face hockey and crotch-grabbing for a basketball dunk worth 1/50th of his team's output for the night, baseball has come up with two guys who give each other high fives during a Frick-and-Frack news conference and hug each other at first base during the game. ''I told him congratulations,'' said Sosa, who is from the Dominican Republic and is charming the baseball empire in his second language, English. ''But I told him, 'Now you've got to wait for me.' '' Even a few days ago, it seemed like a good smart-aleck crack for the crusty, cigar-chomping Jack McKeon, manager of the Reds, who said he had been getting all these phone messages about not walking McGwire, and how he wanted to ''heal America.'' McGwire, when apprised of McKeon's quip, said, ''If only it was that easy.'' And he's right about that. These multimillionaires are not exactly solving the skewed ratio of wealth and opportunity in America. However, in the last couple of weeks, it has been impossible to miss that McGwire, a very large, white dentist's son from California, has been simpatico with Sosa, a compact, dark-skinned man from the Dominican Republic, and vice versa. Q: You both come from such different backgrounds as children. Did you ever envision yourself sitting in this setting? Sosa: Not really, but I have to say, 'Baseball been bery bery good to me.' (Laughter, as Sosa knowingly invoked the echoes of Chico Escuela on the ancient ''Saturday Night Live'' shows.) McGwire: God Bless America. Sosa: What a country. Q: Sammy said you would hit 70 by the end of the year. How many do you think he will hit? McGwire: Wouldn't it be great if we just ended up tied? I think it would be beautiful. Q: What number? McGwire: Seventy is a good one. (Laughter). Sosa: I will take it. This was the repartee yesterday when the two amigos held a joint news conference before the game. What the official transcript cannot possibly indicate is the comfort level between the men, the way they look each other in the eye and laugh. They understand each other the way Sally Ride understands John Glenn: they've both been there. These guys have also praised the memory and the skills of Roger Maris, who hit 61 homers in 1961 and never enjoyed it, to his death in 1985. On Sunday, his son Randy Maris said: ''I think if he would have had a stage like this to handle all the questions, instead of having him sit at his locker and answer questions, two hours before games and after games, just questions over and over, it would have been a lot easier for him. That was probably the toughest part.'' The era of Roger Maris seems 37 decades away rather than 37 years. Maris and his friend Mickey Mantle -- they shared an apartment -- were unsophisticated country boys who had grown up thinking that real men didn't share their feelings in public. Mantle ranged from hilarious to vicious, depending on his mood; Maris was far more consistent, in a testy but honest way. Sosa seems genuinely open, at ease with himself; McGwire says he became that way through therapy following a wrecked marriage. Both grew up watching Felipe Alou (and his baseball family), Steve Garvey, Kirby Puckett and Tony Gwynn set standards for eloquence and kindness in public. Sad to say, a lot of ballplayers today are Class A louts. (No names mentioned.) Fortunately, they do not have 61 and 58 homers, and maybe there is a moral to that. The era of good feeling has even extended to the fans. The Cardinals fans stood and applauded Sosa (and Gary Gaetti, a Cardinal until recently but now a Cub). McGwire still talks with awe about the standing ovation he received in Pittsburgh and the fact that even the fabulously abusive New York echo left him alone. Yesterday, another fan came up with a McGwire home run ball and immediately turned it over to McGwire for modest considerations. The word from the tax lawyers is that any poor soul who idealistically hands over a landmark baseball to McGwire is liable for many thousands of dollars of gift taxes, immediately. Up to edition time, Mike Davidson, age 28, from St. Louis, had not yet been manacled and dragged off to jail by the Internal Revenue Service. Maybe McGwire and Sosa really are healing America.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 315-> PRO FOOTBALL; A Game, And Not A Mission
Some of the marquee value of Monday night's Denver-Miami game is gone, courtesy of last week's stunner at the Meadowlands. Yet the game is not lacking for drama, at least with the Dolphins. With Denver's loss last week to the Giants, members of the 1972 Dolphins no longer have to put a hex on the Broncos to remain the only team in National Football League history to go through a season unbeaten. The current Miami team must win on Monday night to assure itself a wild-card playoff spot. The Jets clinched the American Football Conference East title on Saturday. Miami (9-5) has been dealing with the effects of its loss to those same Jets a week ago. ''That one has stuck with us a while,'' the Dolphins linebacker Robert Jones said. ''But we realize if we beat Denver, that's what everybody will be talking about.'' The Broncos (13-1) have clinched home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs, a fact that reduces Monday night's game for them to one of pride and momentum contrasted to Miami's urgency. Denver Coach Mike Shanahan has shown no inclination to ease off the throttle, though he most likely will not take any chance with the standout defensive end Neil Smith, who is healing from an abdominal pull. Some of the Broncos say they feel that the loss to the Giants lifted a weight off their shoulders, that the team can now focus more on repeating as Super Bowl champion than challenging the 1972 Dolphins' 17-0 season. ''The pressure was building each week,'' Smith said. ''I'm glad it's over.'' This will be the second regular-season meeting between the teams, and the first here. Miami won, 30-26, in 1985, when John Elway and Dan Marino were mere third-year pros. Now, of course, they are two of the most decorated quarterbacks in league history. Never before has there been an N.F.L. game between two quarterbacks who have compiled such glittering statistics. Marino (58,238) and Elway (50,986) are the only two 50,000-yard career passers. They have combined for 699 passing touchdowns, including Marino's 403, and have totaled nearly 9,000 completions. Despite all the fanfare about their matchup, Marino comes into this game dragging some not-so-subtle shackles. He is acutely mindful that he must temper his passing to accommodate Miami's sporadic running game. After Marino threw 57 passes in the Dolphins' loss to the Jets, Coach Jimmy Johnson bluntly said that forsaking the running game had been a mistake. Miami, which has used nearly a 50-50 split between running and passing this season, is 2-8 in games in which Marino has thrown at least 51 times. ''Early in the year, people talked about us winning ugly, but those games look pretty now,'' the offensive coordinator Kippy Brown said. ''We're going to get back to doing what we do.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 317-> PRO FOOTBALL; For Ellsworth, Sitting On Bench Is Purgatory
On the field today, Percy Ellsworth spent much of the day with his teammates celebrating around him, high-fiving and hugging after his pair of interceptions and nearly another one. And in the locker room afterward, he was the center of attention, too. But for every happy comment from the third-year safety, there seemed to be a bit of frustration seeping through. It took only until the third play of the game for Ellsworth to find his way onto the field, and even less time to find his way to the ball and the end zone. But still, sitting on the bench for even one play has made Ellsworth wonder about his future in New York. Another solid performance in the Giants' 28-7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs today only reinforced the thoughts that have plagued him, that he believes he must get his chance, whether it is here or somewhere else. ''I love the Giants and I'd love to do it here,'' Ellsworth said. ''But I refuse, if I can help it, to sit on the bench another year. I just feel like, once I start a year, maybe if I mess up, then I can accept, 'Percy, you're not a starter in the N.F.L.' '' Ellsworth may not be able to do a lot about it, since he will be only a restricted free agent at the end of the season, meaning the Giants will have the right to match any offer another team makes for his services. With the Giants, the 24-year-old Ellsworth finds himself wedged into the nickel packages, playing behind Tito Wooten at free safety and Sam Garnes at strong safety. Injuries have put Ellsworth on the field often this season, though, and he has responded with a career-best five interceptions. His two today came with Wooten spending much of the game on the sideline with a hamstring injury. In three seasons of part-time duty, Ellsworth has 12 interceptions, while Wooten, who has played erratically after signing a four-year, $2.9 million contract in the off season, has seven interceptions in his five seasons. Wooten's struggles on the field this year may represent Ellsworth's best opportunity to start. The Giants could release Wooten and leave Ellsworth and the rookie Shaun Williams competing for the free-safety job. ''I hope that next year I'm starting for somebody,'' Ellsworth said. ''Somebody's going to think I'm not just a part-time player. This year I think I've shown people that when I'm given the minutes, I just produce. I think I've done it for three years now. Hopefully, next year somebody will allow me to start.'' On the third play from scrimmage today, Ellsworth picked off an Elvis Grbac pass at the Chiefs' 43-yard line and raced untouched up the left sideline to put the Giants in front by 7-0 just 1 minute 14 seconds into the game. The ball tipped off the fingers of receiver Derrick Alexander before Ellsworth turned it into his second touchdown by interception this season. Ellsworth added a second interception in the third quarter, although replays showed that he was out of bounds when he came down with it. After initially claiming, ''I was in, I was in,'' Ellsworth said, ''I got a gift.'' He grabbed another Grbac pass in the fourth quarter, but was ruled out of bounds. As he argued his case on that one, he said, the official told him, ''Not this time.'' Ellsworth has shown a knack for finding his way to the ball in his career, something that even he is at a loss to explain. ''I'd like to give a great speech and say it's this or that,'' he said. ''But it's just something I've been blessed with my whole career. I've been doing it since high school, even in little league. I see what happens before it happens. I can just anticipate what's going to happen and I've been able to get interceptions.'' The defensive coordinator, John Fox, said: ''Every time we've called on Percy, he's done an excellent job. No question, there is an instinctive part to that position. Whether it's anticipation, film studies or just the ability to judge the ball, he does an exceptional job.'' And he believes he will do it in a starting role next season, somewhere. ''I've thought that from Day One, when I came in as a rookie free agent and told everybody I wanted to be a starter and they thought I was crazy,'' Ellsworth said. ''But my first game I got an interception off of Warren Moon. It got called back, but I make plays.''

Nov. 15, 1998-> 320-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; THE CHALLENGE OF TENNESSEE MOUNTAIN
Frank Litsky chooses 16 teams that might have what it takes to reach the women's Final Four at the San Jose Arena next March. (Last season's record in parentheses.) Last Team Standing TENNESSEE (39-0) Two years ago, the Vols lost 10 games and still won the national tournament. Last year, with the best freshman class ever, they went unbeaten and won the title again. This year, they are riding a 45-game winning streak and looking for another national title from 6-foot-2-inch Chamique Holdsclaw, the best female player in college and maybe anywhere, and the 6-2 forward Tamika Catchings and the 5-10 guard Semeka Randall, the best of last year's freshman class. Three That Could Find the Way To San Jose LOUISIANA TECH (31-4) Last season's National Collegiate Athletic Associatio finalist should be even better, with an up-tempo team eight or nine players deep. Four starters return, led by the 6-0 forward Amanda Wilson (18.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game, with a 62 percent shooting average). But as Coach Leon Barmore said, ''You could put all the rest of us together and not beat Tennessee.'' CONNECTICUT (34-3) The Huskies have lost their dominant backcourt of the all-America Nykesha Sales and Rita Williams, but they will get quick help from this year's best recruiting class. Svetlana Abrosimova, the 6-2 sophomore forward from Russia, is a superstar in the making, and the 6-0 forward-guard Shea Ralph is back after two rigth-knee reconstructions in five months. DUKE (24-8) The top 10 players return from a round-of-eight team tht gts better by the year. They include twin-tower centers in 6-6 Michele VanGorp and 6-4 Payton Black. Games against Connecticut, Tennessee and Notre Dame will test this team before its tough schedule in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Four That Could Knock on the Door U.S.CL.A. (20-9) The Bruins are still angry over their controversial loss to Alabama in last year's N.C.A.A. tournamenet. They should be the new power in the Pacific 10 qith a veteran team, especially if the 6-3 power forward Maylana Martin (18.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.4 assists) overcomes a bad back. PURDUE (23-10) Thirteen players return from a team that missed last season's Final Four by only 7 points. The backbone is the backcourt duo of Stephanie White-McCarty (20.6 points a game) and Ukari Figgs (15.5). ALABAMA (24-10) Only two starters return, but the freshman class should help. The key is Dominique Canty, a 5-10 guard-forward who averaged 21.5 points a game last year and may be the best collegiate player not at Tennessee. NORTH CAROLINA (27-7) The Tar Heels scared Tennessee in an N.C.A.A. regional final last season, and they remain deep despite the graduation of the all-American Tracy Reid. One concern: the 6-5 freshman LaShonda Allen is te only player taller than 6-2. Eight That Could Hang Around Late VIRGINIA (19-10) DeMya Walker, a 6-2 power forward (16.3 points, 8.4 rebounds) must take command. The 6-0 forward Monick Foote and the 5-8 guard Tiffany Bower return after missing last season with injuries. RUTGERS (22-10) This may be another breakthrough year for the Scarlet Knights, who return everyone from last season's round-of-16 team. The best part of this deep, quick team is the backcourt of 5-6 Tasha Pointer and 5-10 Tomora Young. TEXAS TECH (26-5) The all-American Alicia Thompson (23.3 points) is gone, but four senior starters return to the best team in the Big 12. Now the offensive burden falls on Angie Braziel, a 6-3 post player with new international experience. GEORGIA (17-11) Last season was not typical because the freshmen had to play, ready or not. The team is still young but better, especially with the 5-10 twins Kelly and Coco Miller at guard. Tawana McDonald, a 6-4 freshman center, should help. KANSAS (23-9) The Jayhawks, with nine straight 20-victory seasons, are solid again. The five starters return, led by 6-2 Lynn Pride, a shooting guard-small forward. Two newcomers, 6-6 Kristen Geoffrey and 6-5 Dalchon Brown, provide size. NORTH CAROLINA STATE (25-7) Last season the Wolfpack upset Old Dominion and Connecticut ad reached the Final Four. Five perimeter players retur, but the 6-6 center Summer Erb must replace Chasity Melvin as a commanding force inside. STANFORD (21-6) Those domnant inside players - Olympia Scott, Heather Owen, Kristen Folkl, Vanessa Nygaard and Naomi Mulitauaopele - are gone, and the 6-0 senior forward Regan Freuen and the 6-1 freshman guard Lindsey Yamasaki are injured. Still, Stanford will be dangerous. NOTRE DAME (22-10) Two years ago, it as a surprising Final Four trip. Last year, although rebuilding, the Irish made the round of 16. Four starters return from that team, led by the 5-10 guard Sheila McMillen, a 40-percent 3-point shooter.

To the Editor: Susan Allen Toth, in ''The Little Cars That Could'' (July 12), shares my reveries and compassion for rental cars, especially out of the United States. In France we were in a long line of cars waiting for a ferry. It began to rain. My husband and I looked desperately for the wiper switch. There was no manual. In desperation I got out and walked along the line of waiting cars until I saw one that was the same model. I knocked; startled, the driver looked at me in fear. I pointed to her wipers and yelled ''le bouton, le bouton.'' Her daughter allayed her mother's fear and she pointed to it, turned the wipers off and on and forced a weak smile. Her daughter waved as I said merci and returned to our car. BARBARA NICOLL New York, N.Y.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 323-> With a Mountain at Stake, Tiny Tribe and New Mexico Neighbors Do Battle
Rising 10,378 feet into the desert air, Sandia Mountain is more than a picturesque backdrop to Albuquerque, a city of more than 400,000 people. It is an escape valve for a booming Sunbelt city. According to the United States Forest Service, the mountain, 15 minutes from downtown Albuquerque, plays host annually to 1 million hikers and picnickers, 275,000 cable-car riders, 50,000 bird watchers, 10,000 rock climbers and 10,000 hang gliders. So it was with shock that Albuquerque residents learned in August that a Federal judge in Washington had ordered the Federal Government to transfer ownership of the mountain's western face, 9,400 acres of wilderness in the Cibola National Forest, to Sandia Pueblo, an Indian tribe with 481 enrolled members. The judge based his decision on 18th century land grant documents. Alex Lujan, the Governor of Sandia Pueblo, on the city's northern edge, quickly promised to keep open ''hiking trails and other recreational uses'' in the area. Mr. Lujan also said the tribe would allow access to three privately owned non-Indian neighborhoods, which would be surrounded by pueblo land. The Federal Government is considering an appeal and has until Sept. 15 to file it. In the meantime, residents are becoming gloomy about the outcome and fearful that the promises of access might not be kept. Bryan Pletta, owner of Stone Age Climbing Gym, an Albuquerque business, said he did not believe Mr. Lujan's promises to allow rock climbing. ''Even though the pueblo claims it will maintain public access to the mountain, just about all the rock climbing areas on pueblo lands in New Mexico have been shut,'' Mr. Pletta said. ''There are countless areas in the state that historically have been climbed that are now shut down. There is no place that I know of where I can climb on Indian land.'' The dispute is not an isolated one. Land-use conflicts between Indians and whites are becoming increasingly common in the West. In Texas, for example, the Tigua Tribe is seeking to win ownership of Hueco Tanks State Park, a favorite destination for hikers and climbers from El Paso. In Arizona, the Tohono O'odham Tribe is seeking, through a Congressional bill, to win ownership of the eastern half of Baboquivari Mountain, which is in a national wildlife refuge near Tucson. In Nevada, the Washoe Tribe is pressuring the Forest Service to ban climbing on Cave Rock, a sacred lava plug overlooking Lake Tahoe. In Wyoming, a Federal judge upheld this spring what the National Park Service called a ''voluntary ban'' on climbing Devils Tower in June, a month when Indians from 20 tribes gather there to perform religious ceremonies. ''Sandia is part of a trend,'' said William P. Pendley, president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a Denver law firm that lost the challenge to the ban on June climbing at Devils Tower. ''But what makes Sandia pop up on the radar screen is that you have all those city folks in Albuquerque screaming.'' Indeed, the ruling in the Sandia Mountain case, by Judge Harold H. Greene of Federal District Court, stepped on some of the biggest toes in the Southwest. Gov. Gary E. Johnson of New Mexico owns a house in one of the three enclaves, Sandia Heights North, a neighborhood of $1 million houses and three-car garages. ''My house is up against the edge of the National Forest,'' said the Governor, a Republican, who currently lives in an official residence in Santa Fe. ''If this decision is upheld, that land could be developed.'' Mr. Johnson, saying he had been a contributor to the Sandia Mountain Coalition, asserted, ''It was my understanding that the issue was killed and dead and buried.'' In 1976, when Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico was a freshman Senator, he sponsored legislation that protected as wilderness 94 percent of the mountain land that now is to be transferred to Sandia Pueblo. ''I don't believe the judge did this right,'' Senator Domenici, a Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said recently. Referring to the tribe, the Senator said, ''From the research I have done, I never thought it owned that whole mountain.'' But with the advent of casino gambling on the pueblo three years ago, the Indian-white political equation changed. Today, this tiny tribe shows no signs of being cowed. It is using its casino profits to advance its land case, hiring an anthropologist, a Washington lobbyist and three law firms -- one in Albuquerque and two in Washington. Since Judge Greene's decision became public, Governor Lujan has shuttled between here and Washington, meeting White House officials, Congressmen, and high-ranking Federal officials. ''We've been lobbying various agencies to try to avoid an appeal,'' Governor Lujan said. The dispute dates to 1748, when Spain's colonial Governor vaguely defined the pueblo's eastern, or mountain border. Today, 250 years later, documents interpreting the pueblo's boundaries have resulted in dueling reports from two former New Mexico State Historians. One, Stanley M. Hordes, said in a study for the Forest Service that Spanish colonial authorities granted Sandia Indians a standard four-square-league area. Dr. Hordes insisted that the grant extended one league -- 2.6 miles -- from the pueblo's church to the foothills of Sandia Mountain, covering an area of about 27 square miles. He added, ''There is nothing ambiguous about this.'' Dr. Hordes, a specialist in colonial Mexican history, further asserted that in the 1850's when the new American authorities were resurveying Spanish land grants, the pueblo was given more land than it was entitled to have. He said that an American Government translator, suspicious of what he called the ''evil disposed Mexicans,'' expanded pueblo land by nearly 40 percent. The other former State Historian, Myra Ellen Jenkins, who prepared a report for the pueblo, had a different interpretation of the original grant. Saying that the pueblo's land extended to the crest of Sandia Mountain, Ms. Jenkins wrote, ''The language was equally clear that the Sandia range itself was intended as the east boundary.'' Judge Greene's ruling, which added the west flank of Sandia Mountain to the pueblo land, followed Ms. Jenkins's interpretation. If the ruling stands, Dr. Hordes said, the small tribe would end up with nearly twice the area granted by Spain. It would control 53 square miles adjacent to the most densely populated part of New Mexico. Kim Hill, a University of New Mexico anthropology professor, conceded that ''there is a little ambiguity.'' But Professor Hill argued: ''When in doubt, we should be a little generous with native claims. Native peoples went through massacres.'' Indeed, soon after Spain colonized New Mexico in 1598, Spanish governors imposed taxes, forced labor and religious conversion on the Sandia Indians. After a pueblo revolt in 1680, Spanish commanders looted and burned the pueblo twice, forcing surviving Indians to flee west, taking refuge in Hopi villages. But at the end of the 20th century, Albuquerque homeowners and hang gliders show little interest in atoning for the sins of 17th-century Spanish soldiers. They say that after 150 years of American rule here, it is too late to start redrawing boundaries, whether for legal or religious reasons. ''Are we so self-deceived we presume the tribes 'know' what sacred is, and we do not?'' asked Tom Stribling, a resident of Evergreen Hills, one of the three white neighborhoods. Residents there make do with solar power, propane gas and cellular phones because they say the pueblo has refused to allow utilities to cross its land. ''Taking this public resource solely for their private religion diminishes and deprives us all of something sacred,'' Mr. Stribling said. Governor Lujan denies that the pueblo blocked the extension of utilities. And Mr. Montoya, the pueblo land official, retorted: ''We are not going to prevent ambulances from going in, we are not going to cut off utilities, we are not going to cut off roads.'' For 25 years, Mark Mocho has been running along the crest of Sandia Peak and then jumping off, sometimes soaring halfway to Texas on his hang glider. Now, he is afraid that his club, the Sandia Soaring Association, could lose access to what he calls one of the best flying sites in the world. ''We went through this once before,'' Mr. Mocho said, recounting a 1983 transfer of Forest Service land to the Cochiti Pueblo, about 35 miles north of here. Under the transfer, he said, existing-use permits were to be honored for 30 years. ''The weekend after the transfer went through, they built a fence across the access, and told us we couldn't fly there,'' said Mr. Mocho, a computer programmer. ''There was no way we could sue a sovereign entity. It has happened to us once before. We are afraid it could happen to us once again.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 328-> Crew Defends Teacher in Book Dispute
Speaking out for the first time on the ''Nappy Hair'' controversy, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said yesterday that it was unfortunate that a group of ill-informed residents had succeeded in driving a white teacher from her classroom for using the book. ''This is a case of parents rushing to a judgment of a teacher without knowing the facts or the context at all,'' Dr. Crew said in a telephone interview. ''It's a misguided deed that these people did.'' The teacher, Ruth A. Sherman, transferred to Public School 131 in Jamaica, Queens, about a week ago from P.S. 75 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, after some black parents publicly threatened her for using the book, which is a critically acclaimed story by a black scholar. The teacher's removal from her classroom generated widespread discussion about the book and its merits. Dr. Crew added that it would be unfortunate if other teachers shied away from multicultural material. ''I would hope that other teachers would use books that would give children positive images of themselves,'' he said. At the same time, Dr. Crew said he supported a District 32 principal's decision last week to remove another critically acclaimed book, ''War Comes to Willy Freeman,'' which uses the word ''nigger'' in a historical context in one passage. The book, by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier, was scheduled for classroom use by sixth graders at Intermediate School 296 in Bushwick. But the principal, Linda Faucetta, decided against it out of fear that it would generate the same kind of outcry as did ''Nappy Hair.'' She retained it in classroom libraries for optional reading. Dr. Crew's comments underscored his position on giving principals and superintendents wide latitude to run their own schools without interference or second-guessing from him. In the case of ''Nappy Hair,'' the superintendent and principal backed Ms. Sherman's use of the book after conducting a brief investigation of its merits but began requiring that extracurricular books be registered with the principal's office. ''Nappy Hair,'' by Carolivia Herron, tells a story about slavery though a call-and-response style derived from gospel music about the history of the kinky texture of some black people's hair. The incident began at a public meeting Nov. 23 at P.S. 75 when parents criticized Ms. Sherman for using ''Nappy Hair'' in class. They were angered by black-and-white photocopied pages of a book illustration left in mailboxes around the community. The fliers depicted a dark-skinned black child complaining about having nappy hair. Confronted by the group of 50 parents, Ms. Sherman was shouted down and threatened as she tried to explain that the book was positive and that the photocopies did not do justice to the colorful illustrations in the book. Taken out of context, the illustrations can appear jarring and the text insensitive. Ms. Sherman was removed from class for her safety, school officials said. In interviews, Ms. Herron said that she had written the book to turn something historically negative, nappy hair, into something positive by celebrating its attributes. Ms. Sherman refused to return to the school out of fear for her safety. Dr. Crew expressed concern that the incident would make white teachers think twice about diversifying reading material. ''There are lots of people who will unfortunately see this and recoil at the prospect of using material that may be even the slightest bit insulting because they won't know the particulars of a culture,'' Dr. Crew said. ''At the same time we are trying to give children strong images of themselves, we're also sending a message that you better not do it if you are a white teacher.'' One way to avoid such misunderstandings, Dr. Crew said, is to encourage stronger parental involvement in the schools. Last month, he proposed school leadership teams, which give strong new powers to teachers and parents in running the city's 1,100 schools. On the other hand, he supported Ms. Faucetta's decision not to distribute the book ''War Comes to Willy Freeman,'' a story about the Revolutionary War told from a slave's point of view, in class because it could have ramifications, he said. The book, however, will be placed in classroom libraries if students wish to read it.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 329-> Paul Gitlin, 83, Pioneering Literary Agent to Stars
Paul Gitlin, a lawyer and literary agent who brokered multimillion-dollar deals for authors in the early 1970's, died on Wednesday. He was 83. Mr. Gitlin came to prominence by negotiating innovative deals in the 1960's and early 1970's, when literary auctions were a relatively new phenomenon and authors' lawyers and agents were becoming stars in their own right. Gruff and charming, Mr. Gitlin was credited by one client, the novelist Irving Wallace, with winning the author a $2.3 million, four-book contract in 1972. But his role in reshaping the economics of the book industry began at least as early as 1960, when he designed the first combined hardcover-paperback deal by selling Pocket Books ''The Carpetbaggers,'' by Harold Robbins. In addition to Mr. Wallace and Mr. Robbins, Mr. Gitlin's clients included Bill Bradley, Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Cornelius Ryan and William Saroyan. He also represented the estates of such prominent American authors as Thomas Wolfe, Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, Ayn Rand and Raymond Chandler. Born June 17, 1915, in Brooklyn, Mr. Gitlin was a specialist in copyright law. In 1938, in his last year at Harvard Law School, he was the first winner of the ASCAP Nathan Burkan Memorial award for his essay on how copyright law should apply to radio broadcasts. He was a past president of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and a partner in the publishing law firm of Ernst, Cane, Berner & Gitlin, which represented, among other clients, the novelist Mario Puzo. He also helped found the Walter Derenberg Copyright Library at the New York University Law School. He is survived by his son, Jonathan, of Manhattan, and a sister, Claire Gnessin, of Syosset, N.Y.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 332-> TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: MOSCOW MEMO; Communists Still Seeking True Identity
Today might be one of those rare heady days for Russia's post-Soviet Communists, if only someone could say what a post-Soviet Communist is. The Communist Party in Russia's Parliament, the legislature's biggest, used to crumple under President Boris N. Yeltsin's glare. Today it contemptuously threw back his choice of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister for the second time, demanding the restoration of part of its old power and threatening to block a new government -- and risk bringing Russia to its knees if need be. But beyond that, it is not clear even to Communists what is to be done. Some unreconstructed radicals yearn to oust Mr. Yeltsin's administration and restore the monopolistic control of Soviet days. Some want state control of major industries and banks, but would leave part of the private sector untouched. Some are so house-trained that Mr. Yeltsin long ago invited them to join his Cabinet. Even the party leader in the lower house of parliament, Gennadi Zyuganov, spoke approvingly in a radio interview last month of the anti-crisis program once mounted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ''They're struggling between two major ambitions,'' said Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow research organization. ''One is to become a legitimate part of this political regime and play by the Constitutional rules. And the second ambition is to undo this regime and restore the Soviet Communists. ''This is not only a division between factions or fragments of the party,'' he said, ''but inside the soul of each of the members.'' As a practical matter, they do not seem right now to have much of a choice. The Communist Party holds more than 30 percent of the seats in the Duma, twice that of its closest rival, but virtually nobody believes that it could win a majority in a Presidential election or restore Soviet rule by force. Seventy-four years of misrule left the party with a besmirched name among average citizens that not even the current disastrous situation has erased. Its base is middle-aged or elderly, party members of habit rather than ideology, who are dying off in greater numbers with each passing day. The party casts itself as the voice of the disenfranchised -- Russia's boom market, for sure -- but even there, strongmen like Aleksandr Lebed, the former Army general and Siberian governor, and the Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, have siphoned away loyalists. That leaves playing by the Constitution, and for the moment, the party is holding a strong hand. Besides a choice of several Cabinet ministers and a voice in economic policy, the Communists' principal demand in the present standoff with Mr. Yeltsin is a rewrite of the Russian Constitution, shifting the nation away from an all-powerful president and toward parliamentary democracy. In a parliamentary democracy, the largest political party has the greatest sway over policy. And for all their faults, the Communists have the largest and deepest political organization in all Russia, with branches in the smallest towns, unions and factories. That backdoor approach to regaining authority could give the Communists real authority in setting Russian policy. On the other hand, this week's brinksmanship could also prove disastrous for the party, if Mr. Yeltsin dissolves the Parliament and forces elections that reduce the Communists' plurality -- something experts say is entirely possible. Even if the Communists gain new influence, the question that not even they seem able to answer is what they would do with it. The party's official program, published on a World Wide Web that Leonid Brezhnev would never have tolerated, states in unambiguously Soviet terms that ''the principal struggle between capitalism and socialism under whose mark the 20th century progressed is not resolved.'' But then Aleksandr Kuvayev, a Communist Duma deputy from Moscow, sounded today more like a Chamber of Commerce initiate: ''They say we'll nationalize all private property. That's not true. We'll only nationalize that which was illegally privatized. We won't touch apartments, garden plots, small business. Small business must develop.'' Viktor Ilyukhin, a radical Communist who heads the Duma's security committee, opposes any accommodation with the Yeltsin Government. Yet Svetlana Goryacheva, the Communist vice-chairperson of the Duma, said on Sunday that Communists must ''brush away ambitions'' and strike a deal to keep the Government and the country from toppling into the abyss. Mr. Zyuganov first seemed to sign off on Mr. Chernomyrdin's appointment, then denounced it, then seemed open to compromise and, today, said Mr. Chernomyrdin ''spits at all the Soviet history'' and accused him of seeking his own interests instead of the state's. Russian experts say his back-and-forth only mirrors the party's own confusion. Far from the look-alike visages of the Khruschev and Brezhnev eras, the Russian Communists in Parliament today count among their ranks a millionaire banker, three cosmonauts, a leading film actor and an instigator of treason charges against the former Communist leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Zyuganov, who is generally seen as pragmatic, spends much of his time trying to juggle their interests. In particular, he has to tend to the needs of the party's hard core of Soviet holdovers while working closely enough with the Government to maintain at least some influence. It is not an easy balancing act. Communists in other countries like Poland have shifted rightward, leaving their radicals to form less important parties, and some have regained power by democratic means. Some Communists say they are being true to the faith. ''The backbone of the ideology has remained the Communist one, and all attempts to impose a social democratic ideology are not acceptable,'' said Yuri I. Chunkov, a Communist deputy from the depressed coal-mining region of Kemerov in south-central Russia. For Russian Communists, however, being one of the elite carries its own political perils. Only three weeks ago, the leader of Russia's independent trade unions said his workers would not unite with Mr. Zyuganov in calling for a national day of protest on Oct. 7. ''Deputies failed to adopt a single socially significant law in the interests of workers,'' the head of the unions, Andrei Isayev, told the Interfax news service, suggesting an odd dissonance between workers and the Communists.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 335-> Crane Sues to Block Goodrich's $1.5 Billion Offer for Coltec
The Crane Company sought to block B. F. Goodrich's $1.5 billion takeover of Coltec Industries late yesterday, contending in a surprise lawsuit that Coltec had spurned a more generous offer from Crane. In a suit filed in United States District Court in New York, Crane contended that Coltec, by accepting a $1.49 billion purchase offer from Goodrich, broke a 1995 promise to notify Crane of any offers to purchase the company. The suit seeks to allow Crane to present its offer, which had never been publicly disclosed, to Coltec's board. The offer was worth an estimated $1.6 billion as of yesterday. A Coltec spokesman declined to comment, saying that the company had not seen a copy of the lawsuit. Goodrich officials could not be reached for comment late yesterday. Last month, Goodrich agreed to acquire Coltec, a maker of aerospace components based in Charlotte, N.C., offering Coltec stockholders 0.56 Goodrich share for each Coltec share. Goodrich, which left the tire manufacturing business in the 1980's, makes aircraft landing gear systems and other aerospace components. According to letters sent by Crane's chief executive, Robert S. Evans, to John W. Guffey Jr., Coltec's chief executive, Crane had made an informal offer in September to purchase Coltec, offering its shareholders 0.80 Crane share for each outstanding share of Coltec. The September offer was followed up by a formal offer in a registered letter dated Nov. 20. It was received by Coltec on Nov. 24, one day after the deal with Goodrich was announced. ''He told me it was inadequate in September,'' Mr. Evans said yesterday. ''Then he accepted an offer that was less than adequate.'' As of Nov. 23, the day the Coltec-Goodrich deal was announced, the Goodrich offer valued each Coltec share at $21.98. The Crane offer would have valued Coltec stock at $25.35 a share, or $1.8 billion. Coltec's stock closed yesterday at $16.6875, down 62.5 cents. Crane's stock closed at $28, up 31.25 cents, making the value of the Coltec stock under the Crane offer $22.40 a share. Goodrich's stock closed at $33, down 62.5 cents, placing the value of Coltec stock under that offer at $18.48 a share. ''We made a formal agreement,'' Mr. Evans said. ''We gave up rights saying we would not make a hostile offer; we wouldn't go to their shareholders, and we wouldn't do anything they didn't agree with.'' Mr. Evans said he initially approached Mr. Guffey in October 1995, offering to purchase Coltec for stock at about a 40 percent premium over Coltec's share price then. According to the court documents, the companies signed an agreement on Oct. 31, 1995, prohibiting each from purchasing assets, securities or options of the other, as well as engaging in any proxy solicitation of shareholders. The agreement also said neither company would enter into ''any discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements or understandings with any third party'' and that either would notify the other promptly if another company expressed interest in a transaction. The agreement was signed by Mr. Evans and R. J. Tubbs, Coltec's general counsel and secretary. Crane's financial adviser, Warburg Dillon Read & Company, and Coltec's adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, were also bound by the October agreement and were prohibited from giving financial advice to other companies regarding a purchase. Officials at Morgan Stanley, now Goodrich's financial adviser, declined to comment. In a letter sent yesterday to Goodrich's board, Crane asked the company to ''disavow'' certain anti-takeover provisions of its deal with Coltec, in order to ''level the playing field'' and allow Crane to present its competing offer to Coltec. A similar letter was sent to Coltec's board.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 336-> Try Stronger Laws On Child Support
To the Editor: A Sept. 3 front-page article describes the problem of welfare dependency as ''almost entirely one of absent, nonsupporting fathers'' and points out that many of these fathers are incarcerated. Using government statistics, we calculate that nationally, approximately 38,000 custodial parents are owed approximately $122 million in child support by people in prison. Some states excuse payment because the parent in prison is determined to have had a material change in circumstances. Other states, however, find that the change in circumstances has been brought on by the parent's own illegal conduct; therefore those states find it contrary to public policy to forgive support obligations. No Federal case law addresses the issue. The welfare system needs a Federal law that requires an incarcerated father with the ability to pay -- either from savings, salary, pension or other assets -- to support his children. DANIEL POLLACK KAREN CAVANAUGH New York, Sept. 3, 1998 The writers are, respectively, an associate professor of social work at Yeshiva University and a lawyer.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 339-> Rolling Up Their Sleeves To Take On a Killer; Volunteers Begin Test of AIDS Vaccine
As Troy Masters sat in a hospital exam room the other day -- poked, pricked and interrogated by doctors on the most intimate details of his life -- his eyes reddened and his voice broke as researchers asked if he was sure of what he was doing. Mr. Masters is an affable 37-year-old with a sly sense of humor and a soft Tennessee drawl. He is also gay, H.I.V.-negative and sexually active, a profile that makes him a fitting candidate for the world's first full-scale test of a vaccine to prevent AIDS. Last week, Mr. Masters became one of the first volunteers in New York City to qualify for the experiment, which is to be conducted by a California company in as many as 50 clinics across the nation, including three in Manhattan. The vaccine trial will involve 5,000 volunteers in the United States and 2,500 in Thailand. Mr. Masters's first shot is scheduled for 10 tomorrow morning. ''It's anxiety-producing and exciting at the same time, but I'm going to have to live with this crisis one way or the other,'' he told doctors from the New York University School of Medicine, which runs one clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center. ''I don't feel scared away from the study, if that's what you mean. I want to do this.'' Mr. Masters has agreed to be inoculated seven times over the next three years with a genetically engineered vaccine, known as Aidsvax, to find out whether it works. Researchers say he cannot contract H.I.V. from the vaccine because it contains a fragment that is not capable of reproducing. But he may appear to be H.I.V.-positive on a standard blood test because of the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies. In return, Mr. Masters gets only a $3 Metrocard and $10 for each visit to the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit at Bellevue. He may also get a sore arm, headaches, a rash, a fever and other side effects that are not yet known. And if he is discriminated against because of a false-positive test result, and wants to seek legal redress, he will have to pay for a lawyer himself. Mr. Masters, publisher of a biweekly newspaper called Lesbian & Gay New York, took all this in on a recent morning. Then, with a flourish, he signed the consent forms to be screened for the study and to be tested again for the human immunodeficiency virus, the final hurdle. ''The virus needs a vaccine,'' he said. ''If there is a front of activism that needs to be developed, that's it. To that end, I'm giving my behavior over to science. This is like signing for permission to end the AIDS crisis.'' Whether the vaccine to be injected into Mr. Masters has any promise is a matter of heated debate. Some scientists and advocates for people with AIDS are skeptical, and fear that the experiment will drain the pool of people willing to participate in future trials of AIDS vaccines. They also worry that volunteers will get a false sense of security about the vaccine, which could expose them to infection. But the vaccine, produced by Vaxgen Inc. of South San Francisco, has drawn attention to an area of AIDS research that until recently has been overshadowed by the success of another treatment, drug cocktails that include protease inhibitors. In the last few years, H.I.V. vaccines have emerged as a major priority of AIDS research efforts. The Federal Government spends $200 million annually in search of a vaccine, and devotes more money to vaccine research every year. ''It is now the favored direction of endeavor,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A handful of vaccine candidates, including a federally supported one involving a weakened canary pox virus, are at various stages of development. But none are as far along as the Vaxgen vaccine. In June, the Food and Drug Administration authorized full-scale testing, which is financed by Vaxgen. ''Up until this vaccine was moved forward, no vaccine was tested for efficacy anywhere else in the world,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit group based in Manhattan. ''We're now moving into trials, which is what we have to do. It's the only way to learn.'' The major question the new tests aim to answer is how effective the experimental vaccine will be among people who are exposed to H.I.V. because of high-risk sexual practices in the United States and intravenous-drug use in Thailand. In New York City, Vaxgen hopes to recruit 600 healthy, uninfected volunteers. In addition to the clinic at Bellevue, the recruits are to be inoculated at clinics run by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the New York Blood Center. Nationwide, the 5,000 participants will include gay men as well as women who engage in risky heterosexual behavior. A randomly selected two-thirds will receive the vaccine and the rest will receive a placebo. At the Bellevue clinic, the goal is to recruit at least 150 volunteers by June, enrolling between 20 and 30 people a month. Three weeks ago, the clinic began placing advertisements in gay publications. Doctors were asked to tell patients about the study and to put fliers in their waiting rooms. Next month, the clinic may sponsor a couple of parties, with gift giveaways, in gay clubs where counselors can recruit volunteers in person. Counselors are also speaking with gay groups that cater to Latino and black men. The initial recruitment focuses on gay men, but the plan is to branch out and aggressively recruit women. Counselors have contacted half a dozen community groups concerned with women's health, and are setting up meetings with their directors. However, the study's administrative coordinator at the Bellevue clinic, Robert Hagerty, acknowledges that recruitment is difficult. ''We haven't had huge numbers of people calling,'' he said. One of the main obstacles will be to convince people that the vaccine is safe. ''Every person who comes in raises that fear,'' Mr. Hagerty said. ''We answer their questions directly and honestly. You can't get H.I.V. from this vaccine.'' Previous studies of the vaccine, on animals and humans, have demonstrated its safety, researchers say. So far, the Bellevue clinic has seen 11 men who were determined to be eligible for the study. Two have received vaccinations. Arriving at the clinic for his first visit last week, Mr. Masters wore black jeans with a white T-shirt. His short dark hair was slicked back to hide the gray. He said he had put himself forward after losing nearly all of his friends in the last two decades. For hours, Mr. Masters answered a blizzard of questions. Would his participation in the study cause him subconsciously to have unprotected sex? Mr. Masters shook his head. What situations might tempt him to do so? How many sexual partners has he had in the last six months? Did he know that he might not be able to take part in future H.I.V. vaccine trials? Did he know that he might not be able to serve in the military? ''Oh, as if I could,'' he said. Mr. Masters sees himself as a crusader. ''People are terrified of vaccines,'' he said. ''The word that keeps coming up is, 'You're going to let yourself be a guinea pig.' ''I know we can create a culture where going to vaccine trials is something that people want to do. It's O.K. for people to do and it's safe. It's the right thing we should be doing if we are H.I.V.-negative.'' An experimental AIDS vaccine may be a particularly tough sell to some of the hardest-hit populations, including young gay men and blacks. Health officials have long contended with the belief, popular among some blacks, that H.I.V. is a man-made virus and that acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a genocidal plot. In an exam room at Bellevue the other day, Mr. Masters stared at a needle as it was pressed slowly into a vein to draw blood for an H.I.V. test. Also in the room was Michael Marmor, one of the principal investigators for the N.Y.U. trial. Mr. Marmor, an epidemiologist, recalled that he was squeamish about needles when he was 8 years old. He was a participant in the polio vaccine trials of 1954, which involved hundreds of thousands of children across the country. Mr. Marmor said the Vaxgen trial is similar to Jonas Salk's polio vaccine trials. He pointed out that the Salk vaccine was not 100 percent effective, but it still saved many people before a better vaccine came along. ''It's exactly at the same stage of testing, the last stage, when they do efficacy and evaluate what percentage of infections are prevented,'' said Mr. Marmor, who also conducted some of the earliest epidemiological work on Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer, in 1981. The Vaxgen vaccine is an updated version of one that an advisory panel of experts rejected four years ago for Federally financed large-scale testing in the United States. The experts had expressed doubts about its effectiveness, questioning its benefit to a significant proportion of recipients. The original vaccine was developed from only one strain of H.I.V., the one most commonly found in the United States. The new version will provide broader coverage to patients because it is derived from two strains of H.I.V. that are prevalent in the nation, according to Dr. Donald P. Francis, a virologist who is leading the international vaccine research effort and is president of Vaxgen. But some scientists doubt the vaccine's efficacy, saying earlier tests show that it improved only one part of the immune system involving antibodies, and consequently is unlikely to protect large numbers of recipients. Antibodies are proteins formed to destroy invading germs in the blood. Many scientists believe that an effective H.I.V. vaccine will need to boost another element of the immune system, killer T-cells that destroy virus-infected cells. ''I don't think we will learn anything that we don't already know,'' said John Moore, a staff investigator at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan. ''I think it's a great shame they are testing in New York. It's a travesty they are doing it anywhere.'' More than half of the clinics that will participate have been selected. But not every clinic that has been approached is rushing to take part. In Houston, one community research organization turned Vaxgen down a few months ago. An ethics board at the Houston Clinical Research Network decided that participating in the study would prevent its patients from enrolling in more promising vaccine studies. Mr. Masters shrugs off the naysayers. Sitting in the exam room the other day, he said the Vaxgen experiment is a beginning and a big deal. He also senses a circle closing for him. He is memorializing the pain that the epidemic has caused him, the dozens of friends who have died of AIDS. ''It is a way of trying to shut the door on this whole thing,'' he said. ''It is empowering.''

Sept. 9, 1998-> 340-> THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE ADVERTISING; Lieutenant Governor Starting TV Spots in Governor's Race
After a long delay, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross is to release her first major television advertisement today in a last-minute attempt to persuade Democratic primary voters that she is a formidable candidate despite the problems that have plagued her gubernatorial campaign. The advertisements come a week after she announced that her husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a wealthy investment banker, withdrew $2.25 million that he had donated to her campaign, forcing her to scale it back sharply. Ms. McCaughey Ross said the 30-second spot, along with another that is to premiere on Thursday, would be broadcast daily through the Sept. 15 primary in New York City and other major markets around the state. Both advertisements take advantage of the fact that Ms. McCaughey Ross is the only woman in the race for governor. In the first, Ms. McCaughey Ross is shown talking with a group of women while a female voice proclaims that ''the stereotype is dead wrong'' -- referring to her opponents' characterization of her as erratic. And in the second, Ms. McCaughey Ross says, ''I've taken a lot of hits lately,'' adding, ''some below the belt.'' In an interview yesterday, Ms. McCaughey Ross said she felt that it was important for her advertisements to acknowledge the difficulties she has faced, from her recent financial woes to her opponents calling her ''bizarre.'' ''You've heard the words,'' she said. ''There has been a lot of focus on personality, rather than on what I'm about. I want the people of New York State to judge me based on what I've done with my life instead of the irrelevant, trivial descriptions that are often offered.'' Ms. McCaughey Ross was Gov. George E. Pataki's Republican running mate in 1994, but she battled with him from the outset. After a split with Mr. Pataki, she switched parties last year. She has weathered frequent attacks from both parties. Early on, the Lieutenant Governor was thought to be the strongest Democratic candidate, because her husband had promised so much money and because she was the only woman in the race. But recent independent polls suggest that she has been overtaken by Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker. The other candidates in the Democratic primary are Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and James L. Larocca, a former State Transportation Commissioner. Ms. McCaughey Ross said she spent more than $500,000 on her two advertisements, but she would not disclose the exact amount. She was able to purchase the advertising because Mr. Ross returned $500,000 to the campaign late last week. If Mr. Ross had not made the last-minute donation, his wife's campaign would have been left with $45,000, according to campaign financial records. The advertisement that is to premiere today is clearly an appeal to women and blue-collar voters, whom Ms. McCaughey Ross says are her strongest supporters. It shows a picture of her father and points out that he was a factory worker. It also shows a picture of Ms. McCaughey Ross surrounded by her three daughters. At several points, the words ''Elect Women Now'' flash on the screen. In the second spot, Ms. McCaughey Ross talks about improving education and making schools safer. First, though, she stares into the camera and says that the ''hits'' she has taken are ''nothing compared to the challenges facing most families.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 342-> TECHNOLOGY; F.C.C. Mulls Wider Commercial Use of Radical Radio Technology
The Federal Communications Commission is considering changing its regulations to permit the use of a radical and controversial communications technology that has the potential to make vastly more efficient use of the increasingly precious radio spectrum. Known variously as ultrawide band radio and digital pulse wireless, the new technology has a broad range of possible applications, from wireless voice and high-speed data communications to land mine detection and advanced radar systems that could permit law officers to see through walls or could aid cars in avoiding collisions. Despite its potential, however, the technology is not in widespread commercial use today because it would run afoul of F.C.C. restrictions that prohibit radio transmissions in certain frequencies set aside for civilian aviation and military agencies. That could change if the agency agrees to proposals made earlier this month by three small companies that are pursuing the technology for a variety of commercial products. Unlike communications technologies that send information in analog form, ultrawide band uses a digital transmission consisting of small on-off bursts of energy at extremely low power but over almost the entire radio spectrum. By precisely timing the pulses within accuracies up to a trillionth of a second, the designers of ultrawide band radio systems are able to create low-power communications systems that are almost impossible to jam, tend to penetrate physical obstacles easily and are almost invulnerable to eavesdropping. The Time Domain Corporation, based in Huntsville, Ala., has petitioned the F.C.C. for a waiver so that by the middle of next year, it can begin selling a system that will permit police officers and special weapons and tactics teams to see through walls and doors to detect the location of people. The company is also planning a covert communications system that will both carry voice communications and display locations of a counter-terrorism or S.W.A.T. team's members. ''We are focusing on the safety systems because it has a great public benefit and it's a good way to introduce the technology where it can make a difference,'' said Ralph Petroff, the company's chairman and chief executive. However, Time Domain executives as well as many experts familiar with ultra-wide band believe that the technology's real commercial potential lies in extremely low-cost communications applications. That would entail a fundamental shift in F.C.C. regulations, a process that could take years. ''When you take its attributes and compare it to the competition, you have very interesting technology that could lead to awesome possibilities,'' said Paul A. Turner, executive director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers Global Technology Center in Menlo Park, Calif. The most promising application for ultra-wide band radio might eventually be an alternative to today's wireless office network technologies that are generally able to transmit data at rates between one and three million bits a second. Because of its design, ultrawide band advocates say, the technology has the potential to deliver vastly higher amounts of data because a large number of transmitters could broadcast simultaneously in close proximity without interfering with one another. ''The most promising applications are not so much as an alternative to cellular telephone,'' said Lawrence E. Larson, an electrical engineer at the University of California at San Diego. ''It may rather provide a much better way of doing short-range data communications because it's very energy efficient.'' The computer and communications industries have already settled on a standard known as Bluetooth for wireless connectivity in an unlicensed frequency band at 2.4 gigahertz. Bluetooth, which can send a million bits a second about 30 feet using 100 milliwatts (about a tenth of a watt), is intended to interconnect devices like palm computers, laptops and cellular phones. In contrast, Time Domain's devices can currently transmit 1.25 million bits a second up to 230 feet using just 0.5 milliwatts, or one-thousandth the power used by Bluetooth. These transmission are being achieved with the first working prototype chips the company has received from I.B.M., which fabricated them using the advanced silicon germanium semiconductor material developed for communications applications. Standard wireless transmissions encode data in a continuous sine wave by varying the amplitude (the size of the wave) or the frequency (the number of times the wave cycles each second), sometimes both. In contrast, Time Domain's technology is similar to a Morse code system that at this point in its development, switches on and off 40 million times a second. And unlike traditional radio signals, which are confined to a very narrow frequency, each pulse of ultra-wide band is transmitted across a wide portion of the radio spectrum, so that only a tiny amount of energy is radiated at any single frequency. The company said it believed that the bandwidth, or data-carrying capacity, of its technology can be expanded to many times its current limit -- perhaps as high as billions of bits a second. Moreover, while standard narrowband wireless technologies have a limited bandwidth, the digital pulse approach has the potential to handle a large number of simultaneous users in close proximity, Time Domain officials said. Ultrawide band has the added advantage of being significantly more resistant to ''multipath interference,'' a problem that plagues indoor radio systems because signals tend to bounce off many surfaces. Industry officials said they did not expect an early resolution to the F.C.C.'s inquiry, which was begun in August. One particular obstacle is that a key official at the Federal Aviation Administration has filed an objection with the F.C.C., warning about a potential problem caused by the clustering of large numbers of transmitters, even at very low power levels. industry officials note, however, that current F.C.C. rules permit ''incidental'' emitters -- generally, consumer devices like personal computers, hair dryers, electric razors, automobiles and arc welders -- and that no hazard has been demonstrated from the hundreds of millions of these products in everyday use. Last month, a group of scientists and engineers met at the Interval Research Corporation, a computer industry research center financed by Paul Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, to coordinate industry input into the F.C.C. decision-making process. More recently, an Interval physicist, Roberto Aiello, filed an independent comment with the agency, reporting that a simulation by his research group indicated that even if millions of ultrawide band transmitters were allowed to operate, they would have a negligible impact on aviation and other communications systems. ''The F.A.A. is worried about this, and I think it's a good position for them to take,'' Mr. Aiello said. ''But I think there's concrete evidence that there will not be interference from ultrawide band.'' In addition to Time Domain, companies asking the F.C.C. for exemptions from spectrum rules include Radar Inc., which is developing a system for finding buried objects and looking behind walls, and the Zircon Corporation, a maker of devices for such tasks as finding joists in walls.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 344-> Youth, 16, Held in Stabbing of 5
A 16-year-old boy who was being kicked and punched during a fight over name-calling pulled out a pocketknife and stabbed and slashed five of his teen-age assailants Thursday night, the police said today. Two of the youths were seriously wounded, each requiring at least 100 stitches on their necks and faces, said Detective John Doherty. A police medical helicopter took them to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. The 16-year-old, with his mother, turned himself in to the police three hours after the stabbings. He was charged with five counts of aggravated assault and two counts of weapons violation and taken to the Middlesex County Juvenile Detention Center, said Capt. Robert Bonfante of the Old Bridge Police Department. The police said the Middlesex County prosecutor's office will consider, among other issues, whether the 16-year-old had acted in self-defense. Captain Bonfante said the fight began after a group of nine to 12 teen-agers stopped three other teen-agers as they walked through the park about 5:30 P.M. Thursday. Five days earlier, one of the three had called one of the youths in the larger group an obscene name, Captain Bonfante said. None of the youths were identified because of their ages, which were 14 to 16. Within moments Thursday night, the captain said, the first youth was beaten by at least two teens in the larger group. He suffered a broken nose and facial cuts. At least four others began hitting the 16-year-old, knocking him to the ground at one point. After he came to his feet, he pulled a knife with a four-inch blade from his pocket and started slashing those who had been hitting him, the captain said.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 345-> Region's Democrats Vow to Punish G.O.P. for Impeachment
Even before Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican from Suffolk County, had a chance to announce last week that he would vote for impeachment, the first threats against his political future were thundering out of state Democratic headquarters. ''There is no escaping accountability on the impeachment issue,'' Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that singled out Mr. Lazio. ''Any Representative who casts a vote in support of impeaching the President will be forced to defend their decision in 2000 and beyond.'' The near party-line vote to impeach President Clinton on Saturday may have left a cloud over the President, but it has also, in the minds of many Democrats, handed their party a powerful political cudgel that could win them back the majority in Congress two years from now. Buoyed by public opinion polls indicating that the President, or at least his policies, remains in favor, particularly in the Northeast, and that the Republican Party is increasingly unpopular, Democrats are already planning ways to use impeachment against Republicans. ''We believe that this is such an important issue that people will remember in two years,'' said Robert Ives, executive director of the Connecticut State Democratic Committee. He said the party was already laying plans to hammer Representative Nancy Johnson, a moderate Republican from New Britain, Conn., for voting to impeach the President. ''She followed the Newt Gingrich line of, 'Let's get the President,' '' Mr. Ives said. ''She has proven once again that her vote is not her own.'' Like many Republicans who supported impeachment, Mrs. Johnson predicted that her constituents would not punish her at the polls for casting a vote that was based on her moral convictions and legal concerns. ''I don't think people are thinking about this as Republican and Democrat,'' she said. ''They are thinking about it as citizens of this country.'' In 1996, Mr. Clinton won handily in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and Democratic leaders are convinced that the majority of the electorate in those states is bitterly opposed to his impeachment. The Democrats also contend that anti-impeachment fervor helped bring down two Republican incumbents from the region last month: Representative Michael Pappas of Rocky Hill, N.J., who had lavishly praised Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who had spearheaded the Senate Republicans' Whitewater investigation. After his defeat, Mr. D'Amato declared that impeachment would be damaging to the Republican Party, a message echoed by two other prominent New York Republicans, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. But the central question for Democrats is whether voters really care deeply enough about the issue to let it color their decisions in the election two years from now. Republican leaders and consultants contend that Mr. Clinton's popularity is wide but thin, and could dissipate quickly if the economy turns downward or he is implicated in new scandals. ''Impeachment is almost certain to be overtaken by events in the next 22 months,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a political adviser to both Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Pataki. Mr. Mahoney acknowledged that impeachment could be a serious political problem for Republicans, but more likely in a primary election, where conservative voters tend to dominate and a candidate's vote against impeachment might prompt a challenge from the right. Polls show that a large number of Republicans support impeachment. It is not clear whether the Republicans from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who voted for impeachment heeded the advice of consultants like Mr. Mahoney, or bent to pressure from their conservative leadership, as Democrats asserted, or simply followed their consciences, as all said they would. In the end, only 3 of the 21 House Republicans from the region voted against impeachment: Christopher Shays of Stamford, Conn., Peter T. King of Nassau County and Amo Houghton of Corning, N.Y. All three said Mr. Clinton's behavior had not met their definitions of an impeachable offense. None of the three seem to be in imminent political danger because of their votes. Mr. King has a strongly conservative voting record and would remain difficult to beat in a primary. Mr. Houghton is a respected figure in his district, where his family runs Corning Industries. And Mr. Shays comes from a proudly centrist Republican district where he generally wins going away every two years. Still, Mr. Shays rejected the idea that voters would forget about impeachment quickly, saying it could be a powerful and unpredictable force in 2000. ''Voters will remember,'' he said. ''That's unavoidable. And frankly, it's called the democratic system. Controversy is generally thought of as the enemy of the incumbent, and there was lots of controversy.'' Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a Republican from Glens Falls, N.Y., who voted for impeachment, disagreed. ''I think most all of the members win by substantial margins,'' he said. ''That means they have considerable trust placed in them by their voters, and the voters are going to take their word for what they do, even if they don't agree.'' Indeed, a number of Republicans who voted for impeachment come from districts that are safely enough Republican to make an electoral backlash in 2000 seem unlikely. They included Sherwood L. Boehlert from Utica, Vito J. Fossella from Staten Island, Marge Roukema from Ridgewood, N.J., and Rodney P. Frelinghuysen from Morristown. But a few come from evenly mixed, politically volatile districts. New York's First Congressional district on the East End of Long Island, for instance, had a Democratic Representative for many years before Michael P. Forbes won in an upset during the Republican tide of 1994. Mr. Forbes has never been comfortable with the conservative Republicans who run Congress and has had a friendly relationship with Mr. Clinton. But he still voted for impeachment, and Democrats say they will make him pay for it. ''At our our holiday party, people were already talking to me about finding a strong candidate to run in the First Congressional District,'' said Ms. Hope, the state Democratic chairwoman. Voting for impeachment may cause bigger problems for Republicans who want to run for statewide office. Mr. Lazio, for instance, is interested in filling Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat when he retires in 2000. His vote for impeachment might help him in a Republican primary, particularly against someone like Mr. Giuliani, who opposed impeachment. But Mr. Lazio's vote is also likely to turn at least some Democrats against him in a general election in New York, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3 to 2. Mr. Lazio has repeatedly said that he never included political calculations in his consideration of impeachment. But at least one of his potential Democratic rivals warned that his vote might have put his political life in peril. ''The assumption in putting politics over the will of the people is that the people will forget in two years,'' said Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who is also thinking of running for the Senate in 2000. ''I think that is a very bad assumption.''

Dec. 21, 1998-> 351-> Standards Are a Calling For Bold SUNY Trustee
When Candace de Russy taught a course called ''America and Historical Decline'' a few years ago at the New School for Social Research, her favorite author was the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset. She was taken with his lament over the decline of European civilization, the decline of standards and the lack of leadership by the passive elite. She, too, is preoccupied with the decline of standards, but she is anything but passive. She was an architect of the core curriculum that the State University of New York adopted last week. And as a SUNY trustee, she has become one of the most outspoken and powerful voices nationally in reshaping higher education. ''She is willing to walk through fire and take hectoring and ridicule that most people don't have the stomach for,'' said Thomas W. Carroll, president of Change New York, a conservative advocacy group. ''I really can't think of any comparable person around the country, and I've looked.'' To the dismay of critics, who accuse Dr. de Russy (her name is pronounced duh-RUE-see) of micromanaging SUNY and trampling on academic freedom, there is little on SUNY's 64 campuses that escapes her attention. When she found out that a women's studies conference at SUNY New Paltz last year included sessions on sadomasochism and sex toys, for example, she drew national attention to the meeting, calling it ''academically beyond the pale and an irresponsible use of public funds.'' And she has been pressing for a variety of changes at SUNY -- from the adoption of a core curriculum to stronger accountability for college presidents. Not content just to shape SUNY, Dr. de Russy, 55, has reached beyond New York by writing a stream of newspaper articles and delivering speeches at national conferences. ''I do not, to say the least, perceive myself to be the font of all wisdom,'' she said. ''But I was appointed and explicitly exhorted by the Governor to exercise my best judgment in those fiscal and academic matters entrusted to me. I believe that broad, essentially discipline-based general education serves the best interest of students and society.'' ''I believe this to be right,'' she added. ''And I am obliged in my heart and mind to do what is right.'' Such activism is unusual for a college trustee, said Jerry L. Martin, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a conservative interest group of which Dr. de Russy is a member. ''The typical higher education maxim is, 'Don't rock the boat,' '' he said. ''But she's making waves.'' Not everyone is cheering. Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, a Democrat of Manhattan who is chairman of the Assembly's higher education committee, said such heavy oversight may hurt SUNY. ''You cannot run a modern university with political appointees harassing the professors as to what and how they teach,'' he said, alluding to her actions against SUNY New Paltz. ''Good professors and administrators will not come if that is allowed.'' Arnold B. Gardner, another SUNY trustee, said Dr. de Russy has provoked discussion, ''but she's done some injury to the reputation of the university by suggesting they never heard of standards before.'' With some 370,000 students on 64 campuses, SUNY is one of the largest public university systems in the country, but none of its campuses has ever had the cachet of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor or the University of California at Berkeley. And under Gov. George E. Pataki, it was ripe for change. Many of Dr. de Russy's fellow board members, also appointed by the Governor, share her views on education, and together they control the 15-member board. While she offers passion and an agenda, Thomas F. Egan, the board chairman, and other trustees provide the political skills to turn ideas into policy. Unlike most of the other trustees whose jobs limit their time, Dr. de Russy has virtually made SUNY a full-time career. She is a Westchester County resident married to Cortes de Russy, a banking executive, and although she said she had considered running for office, she concluded that her family life was more important and said that she was ''more interested in issues than politics.'' She devotes hours to writing articles, book reviews and memos. She is frequently in touch with others focused on education, including reporters, not hesitating to call again and again to make sure she explains her positions thoroughly. ''Others might work 60 to 80 hours a week at a job -- she has this,'' said Mr. Carroll of Change New York. ''This is her passion, and she also has the luxury of time.'' Dr. de Russy is an elegant woman, with a deep, melodious voice, carefully trimmed blond hair and a love for silk scarves and other rich fabrics (she wore a red velvet smoking jacket to last week's board meeting). But she is willing to act tough. When SUNY's provost, Peter D. Salins, failed to complete a survey on core courses last month, she lashed out at him during a meeting. It did not matter that he was usually her ally, or that she supported him for the job. She was impatient to move ahead. ''Peeeterrrr,'' she said, drawing out his name slowly and reprovingly, ''you said you would report to us.'' Dr. de Russy's vision grew out of her own upbringing in Baton Rouge, La. Her father, a city judge, passed on to her his love for the classics. Dr. de Russy recalled listening to the Socratic dialogues on the phonograph. And at St. Mary's Dominican College in New Orleans, her studies were filled with the classics, religion and philosophy. ''I will be forever grateful for the strong liberal arts foundation I was given,'' she said, ''and I want to bring that great advantage to students today.'' After studying Jean Genet at the Sorbonne and earning a doctorate in French literature at Tulane University, she headed north with her husband and began teaching European languages and literature at small Catholic colleges. But she always has been interested in public affairs and causes, from efforts on behalf of Vietnamese boat people and Cuban prisoners to the Westchester branch of Change New York, an anti-tax group. She was an early supporter of Mr. Pataki for governor. As her two children entered school, Dr. de Russy also began writing and speaking on education. She was distressed by what she saw as a lack of educational standards. And she believed that a critical solution was to require rigorous courses that would give students basic knowledge about subjects like history and literature and skills like writing. Five years ago, she was named to the board of Westchester Community College, and in 1995, Governor Pataki promoted her to SUNY's board, where she quickly offered her own agenda. Last week, she delightedly declared victory when the core curriculum was approved by her fellow trustees, and said she hoped that governing boards across the country would take similar action. She also expressed excitement on Friday about the state's new provisions that would allow SUNY to issue charters for autonomous public schools, which she said ''will present SUNY with an exciting opportunity to contribute at the cutting edge to the improvement of K-through-12 education in the state.'' And she was already turning her attention to the issues she said she wanted to press next: grading policies, teacher education, admissions standards and measures of what students have learned.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 352-> Syria Says It Regrets Embassy Vandalism
Syria expressed regret today for damage caused to the United States and British Embassies in Damascus on Saturday by protesters angry at the air attacks on Iraq. Witnesses said today that the United States and British diplomatic missions and Ambassadors' residences were under tight security, guarded by armed Syrian policemen. The British Embassy in Damascus said today that Ambassador Basil Eastwood had protested officially to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara over damage to the British cultural mission. In Washington, the State Department said the United States Ambassador to Syria, Ryan Crocker, had also protested to the Syrian authorities over the attacks on the Embassy and Ambassador's residence. The protesters threw stones, tore up books and burned flags and a car. No serious injuries or arrests were reported.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 356-> Sports of The Times; A Career Game Ball for Jets' Leon Hess
IT'S known as the game ball, the actual pebble-grained leather football representing a team's triumph. As the Jets' owner, Leon Hess had been awarded a few game balls by his team through the years, but none as treasured as the ball from the 17-10 triumph at Buffalo that assured the Jets of finishing in first place for the first time in 29 years. ''Mr. Hess,'' Bill Parcells said after Saturday's victory, ''is one of the strong patriarchs of the National Football League.'' Hess doesn't have his game ball yet. It's at the Jets practice complex, being painted with the score and other vital statistics that will forever separate it from being simply another football. But for the 84-year-old owner of the Jets, it's more of a career ball. Nobody deserves it more. When the Jets didn't win in other years, Hess suffered. In silence. Unlike some other owners of New York sports teams, he preferred not to go public, not to spout sentences that would scream in headlines. But some frustrated Jets followers mistook his quietly tough dignity for indifference. ''Hess doesn't care,'' they often complained. What those frustrated followers didn't know, or didn't want to know, was that Leon Hess was more frustrated and more embarrassed than they were, that he cared more than they did. The Jets were his team, exactly like Amerada Hess was his oil business. And anything that is his, he cares about. Deeply. This is a man who started out in the oil business in Perth Amboy, N.J., in 1933 during the Depression by driving his father's fuel delivery truck, a man who was Gen. George S. Patton's oil-supply officer for World War II troops, a man who now, according to Forbes magazine, is worth $700 million. If Hess hadn't cared about the Jets, he would have sold the franchise long ago. Maybe the Jets' struggles made Hess care even more. In 1995, when the Jets were 2-9 en route to 4-28 with Rich Kotite as coach, he was asked if he was thinking about selling. He never hesitated. ''Not at all,'' he said. ''This is one of the few pleasures I get out of life, win or lose.'' More often than not, it was lose. When Hess hired Kotite, he made a rare appearance at a news conference and in a rare burst of impatience, he blurted, ''I'm 80 years old; I want results now.'' He didn't get results with Kotite, but Parcells has quickly produced results. ''Winning the division,'' Hess was saying yesterday, ''is one of the greatest thrills of my life, but we're not through.'' Hess had watched Saturday's game at his Park Avenue apartment with Steve Gutman, the Jets president, and a few friends. That evening he got a call from Frank Ramos, the Jets' director of public relations, about the game ball and yesterday morning he talked to Parcells. ''I'm just thankful,'' Hess continued, ''that Bill was able to rally everyone together. He's a great man, a great coach. He took us further faster than I ever thought.'' Hess has been the Jets' sole owner since 1984, its principal owner since 1976, a part owner since 1963 when he was part of the group formed by the late David (Sonny) Werblin that purchased the American Football League franchise known as the Titans and changed the nickname to the Jets. When the 1968 Jets stunned the pro football realm by winning Super Bowl III, Hess was there. ''I couldn't believe what I was watching,'' he recalled. ''It was like David and Goliath.'' But by 1976, when Hess took command as owner following the death of Phil Iselin, the Jets were in disarray. Hess approved the hiring of Walt Michaels, Joe Walton, Bruce Coslet and Pete Carroll as coaches, then hired Kotite himself. ''A couple of those coaches were in over their head; I probably kept them two or three years longer than I should have,'' he said, reflecting. ''I had the idea the team could be run by committee, but it's like business. You need a strong man.'' When Parcells split with the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, after the 1996 season, that ''strong man'' was available. Gutman's hiring of Parcells as a consultant for a year evolved into the Patriots' accepting draft choices in exchange for permitting Parcells to become the Jets' coach. ''Bill wanted to come back to New York,'' Hess said, alluding to Parcells's two Super Bowl rings as the Giants coach and his northern New Jersey background. ''He never promised me anything, he just worked hard; we have something in common.'' And whatever Parcells has wanted to help turn the Jets around, Hess has provided -- a bubble for indoor practice, new grass and artificial turf practice fields, new weight-lifting rooms and medical rooms, a computer link to the N.F.L. offices. And now Parcells has provided Hess with a first-place team and a Super Bowl XXXIII contender. ''If we don't win another game,'' Hess was saying yesterday, ''Bill doesn't owe us anything.'' But if the Jets win a bigger game than last Saturday's, Leon Hess will get another game ball.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 357-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK -- ST. JOHN'S; Storm Grades Well on Boards
Coach Mike Jarvis does not conduct rebounding drills in practice, and his players do not seem to need them. The 15th-ranked Red Storm (8-2, 2-0 Big East) is outrebounding opponents by an average of 10 a game. Jarvis said he became more aware of his players' assertiveness under the basket when they snared 21 offensive rebounds in a 70-69 loss to Purdue on Nov. 27. In Saturday's 95-68 victory over Virginia, St. John's outrebounded the Cavaliers, 60-27, with a 31-11 edge at the offensive end. Forward Tyrone Grant leads the team with an average of 10.2 rebounds a game. I'm not surprised, but I am sometimes amazed with the numbers, Jarvis said. They really go after the ball. The Red Storm concludes its local nonconference schedule by playing host to Fordham on Saturday and Fairleigh Dickinson next Tuesday. MARIST The Red Foxes (8-0, 2-0 Metro Atlantic Athletic) are off to their best start in Coach Dave Magarity's 13 years. Marist's most impressive victory was by 93-87 over one of the M.A.A.C. favorites, Siena, to give the Red Foxes a 5-0 mark at home. Then Marist reeled off three victories on the road over Manhattan, American and Cornell. Bobby Joe Hatton, usually the shooting guard, has averaged 15.4 points and 6.2 assists while point guard Bo Larragan comes back slowly from a shoulder injury. The most important element going is that we have a great blend of kids, Magarity said yesterday at the coaches' luncheon at Madison Square Garden. Marist plays next at Arizona State next Tuesday. HOFSTRA Coach Jay Wright keeps hearing the same question: what is wrong with Craig Claxton? His scoring average is down to 11.1 points a game from the 16.3 he averaged in earning the America East Conference's player of the year award last season. He doesn't have to do as much this year because our team is better, Wright said. He can play like a point guard now. Claxton, a junior, is averaging 5.9 assists. Hofstra (4-4, 1-0) plays next at Youngstown State next Tuesday. MANHATTAN The Jaspers (1-4, 0-2 M.A.A.C.) lost two assistant coaches -- Sean Cleary for family reasons and Marc Turner for health reasons -- and replaced them yesterday with Matt Kilcullen, a scout for the National Basketball Association service of Marty Blake. Kilcullen was formerly the head coach at Western Kentucky and Jacksonville. Coach John Leonard said he was getting enough productivity out of Durelle Brown (16.8 points), Mars Mellish (12.5) and Ken Kavanagh (11.6) but is hoping that Noah Coughlin (2.8 points in 16 minutes) will join the mix of double-figure contributors. He has the mentality to be a scorer, Leonard said. GEORGIA TECH Georgia Tech (5-1) has another precocious point guard in the freshman Tony Akins (18.3 points). So how does he rate against former Yellow Jacket stars like Stephon Marbury and Kenny Anderson? He's not in their category yet, said Coach Bobby Cremins, who brings his team to the ECAC Holiday Festival on Dec. 26 and 27 at Madison Square Garden. He's between Anderson and Travis Best. He doesn't have the knowledge of basketball like Kenny Anderson. In his time, he should have a great future. Georgia Tech will play Hofstra, and Iona will meet Pennsylvania in the tournament's opening round. REBOUNDS Asked how he was coping with his 1-5 team averaging 26 turnovers a game, Wagner Coach TIM CAPSTRAW said: I'm dealing. People think I'm kind of nuts anyway. WHITNEY BRUCE PYLES, a forward for Division III Brooklyn College (4-4), is a 31-year-old father of two who works as a personal trainer at Asphalt Green. Pyles plays 12 to 15 minutes a game and usually grabs four to six rebounds, Coach STEVE PODIAS said. New York University (4-2) has four players averaging double figures in scoring and another averaging 9.5 points. Niagara's ALVIN YOUNG, who did not play basketball while attending Brooklyn's Bishop Loughlin High School, leads the M.A.A.C. in scoring at 21.7 points a game Fordham center ALEJANDRO OLIVARES of Argentina had trouble adjusting last season because of the language barrier and his late arrival, but he is comfortable now, averaging 13.2 points and 6.8 rebounds a game. Coach NICK MACARCHUK was still glowing from the Rams' 73-71 victory over Iona on Saturday. RAY MINLEND of St. Francis of Brooklyn is averaging 25 points a game, fourth in Division I. Fairleigh Dickinson, which travels to St. John's on Tuesday, has seven foreign players. Coach TOM GREEN said, I brought along a copy of the Geneva Convention for Red Storm Coach MIKE JARVIS.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 358-> Prosecutors Detail Columbia Law Student's Secret Life as a Criminal
If Zolton Williams had been typical of last spring's graduates at Columbia University Law School, he would now be applying for admission to the bar. But Mr. Williams is not typical. He is behind bars, his once promising legal career in ashes. He waits in a Federal jail in Brooklyn to be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison for smuggling tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cocaine from Jamaica to the United States while he was a student at one of the nation's leading law schools. Federal prosecutors say that Mr. Williams, a 29-year-old Brooklyn man who emigrated from Jamaica as a child, began contriving his smuggling schemes almost as soon as he entered Columbia three years ago. His arrest in July, two months after his graduation, and conviction two weeks ago have dismayed and bewildered those who knew him at Columbia, including classmates and professors who recalled him as a bright, energetic and intellectually curious student who participated vigorously in class discussions and did well with legal intricacies. ''People were shocked, stunned, distressed,'' said Prof. Richard Briffault, who gave Mr. Williams an A-minus in a course on state and local government law. ''He asked good questions and wrote a very good final exam,'' Mr. Briffault recalled recently. ''It's a terrible thing, like hearing a relative died.'' Debra Cohn, an adjunct member of the law faculty who gave Mr. Williams a B-plus in her seminar on health-care fraud control, recalled that his forceful participation and ''sometimes strong opinions'' made him a ''valuable contributor to class discussion.'' Mr. Williams, who is to be sentenced Feb. 12 by Judge Raymond J. Dearie in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, declined to be interviewed or to comment about the case, said his wife, Kele Williams, who is a lawyer. She, too, declined to talk about the case or about her husband, and there was a similar refusal from Mr. Williams's mother, a housekeeper who lives in Brooklyn and who also emigrated from Jamaica. Mr. Williams's father, a firefighter, remained in Jamaica and lives in Kingston. Mr. Williams's trial lawyer and several friends and classmates who were reached would not talk about him, except for one friend and classmate who, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said only: ''I think he was a great student. Obviously, I think most people were shocked by what occurred. You'll get that general sentiment from anyone who knew him.'' But the case has exposed the double life of the budding lawyer, a life that court records indicate went beyond smuggling drugs. An admitted confederate of Mr. Williams in the drug case has also told investigators that he and Mr. Williams had engaged in credit card fraud during Mr. Williams's law school years. And the authorities say that Mr. Williams, also while in law school, filed false criminal charges that led to the arrest of a man with whom he was involved in a dispute. No charges have been filed against Mr. Williams regarding these accusations. These followed earlier run-ins with the law, according to state and local court records that cited a half-dozen arrests when Mr. Williams was a teen-ager and in his early 20's. Most involved cases in which charges like possession of stolen property or a weapon were dismissed or, in one instance, ended in a conviction for a noncriminal violation. But in one case, in 1988, Mr. Williams participated with a gun-wielding companion in a street robbery. Mr. Williams, who at the time of the robbery was 18 and at the end of his freshman year at Brooklyn College -- he graduated magna cum laude from the State University at Stony Brook in 1994 -- was given five years' probation and youthful offender status, a break that meant the records in the matter were sealed, and he was officially deemed to have no criminal record as a result of the case. The records of that case and those dismissed were ordered unsealed after his arrest in the Federal drug case. The law enforcement authorities say that in moonlighting as a cocaine trafficker while in law school, Mr. Williams used his legal skills in an effort to avoid detection, by showing another conspirator how to do research in a computerized legal data base to determine the ''profiles'' customs agents use to stop and search airline passengers suspected of carrying drugs. And prosecutors also say he nearly succeeded in escaping conviction by inducing a friend to commit perjury to provide him with an alibi. The first of Mr. Williams's two trials in the drug case ended in October with a hung jury; the panel deadlocked 11 to 1 for acquittal. But the alibi testimony was exposed as a fabrication by one of the prosecutors in the retrial, Andrew Weissmann, after which the second jury convicted Mr. Williams after deliberating barely an hour. Mr. Weissmann, who himself graduated from Columbia Law School in 1984, assessed his fellow alumnus shortly after the retrial. ''He's smart, but he's a criminal,'' said Mr. Weissmann, deputy chief of the criminal division in the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn. ''As a lawyer and a graduate of the law school, I was offended. It was an improper use of his education to commit crimes.'' A similar assessment came from Federal Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak during an early hearing in the case. ''For somebody who is as obviously intelligent and bright as you are, to get into Columbia Law School, your past record is really abominable,'' she said. The drug smuggling enterprise was exposed when Mr. Williams's associate in the plot, who carried the two pounds of cocaine into the United States in 1997 in about 100 swallowed condoms, became ill after some of the cocaine leaked into his stomach and the condoms had to be surgically removed at a hospital. The associate, Anthony Fleurancois, pleaded guilty to drug charges in a deal that involved cooperating with the prosecution, and he also told of other unsuccessful attempts by him and Mr. Williams to smuggle cocaine from Jamaica that began about two months after Mr. Williams started at Columbia Law in 1995. Mr. Williams's trial lawyer, Martin Klotz, has asked Judge Dearie for permission to leave the case because of the defense witness's perjured testimony. Another prosecutor, Nikki Kowalski, told the judge, ''We believe that Mr. Klotz was unaware that the testimony was concocted by his client.'' The silence of Mr. Williams and his relatives and friends leaves many questions about his dual life unanswered. The court file only hints at possibilities. A Federal agent quoted Mr. Fleurancois as saying that during their college years, Mr. Williams ''drove fancy cars, such as a Mercedes-Benz.'' But a defense witness testified that Mr. Williams's life style did not seem extravagant. Ms. Kowalski, in arguing to the jury for the prosecution, said it was not a matter of extravagance, but rather that Mr. Williams had been ''living a comfortable middle-class life style'' beyond the means of someone claiming to have no more than a ''a couple of thousand dollars'' a year in income and no savings or other assets. She suggested that Mr. Williams, who did not marry until after his arrest in July, had sustained a middle-class existence through drug dealing. As an example, she said that in 1996 Mr. Williams paid $27,000, without borrowing, to buy a cooperative apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. His mother testified that she had provided most of the money from an insurance settlement, but Ms. Kowalski said that no documents had been offered to support that claim. After graduating from James Madison High School in Brooklyn in 1987, Mr. Williams attended three colleges over the next seven years, putting in his last two years at the State University at Stony Brook, from which he graduated in 1994. He was nominated for Phi Beta Kappa, but appears not to have joined the honor society, said a school official who declined to be identified. Scholarship grants and loans financed most of Mr. Williams's law school education, and he owes about $60,000 on those loans, the court file shows. He is not likely to repay them soon.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 359-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MEN'S ROUNDUP; Freshmen Keep Arizona Unbeaten After 5 Games
ARIZONA 93, CAL-IRVINE 70 Jason Terry had 21 points, 9 assists and 5 steals and the freshman Michael Wright had 15 points and 13 rebounds as eighth-ranked Arizona remained unbeaten with a 93-70 rout of visiting Cal-Irvine. Another freshman, Richard Jefferson, added 13 points, including three of four 3-pointers, for the Wildcats (5-0), off to their best start in three seasons. A.J. Bramlett added 11 points and Gene Edgerson 10 for Arizona. The bigger Wildcats dominated the boards, 47-23. Arizona had struggled against its first four opponents this season, but had little trouble with the outmatched Anteaters (2-4), who trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half and 25 in the second. Despite their unbeaten record, the Wildcats had not overwhelmed anyone as Coach Lute Olson experimented with various lineups involving his five freshmen. TEMPLE 75, FLORIDA ST. 66 Mark Karcher had 25 points as host Temple avoided its first five-game losing streak in 16 years. The Owls (5-4), who dropped out of the top 25 with four straight losses, have not lost five in a row since the 1982-83 season, Coach John Chaney's first year. The Seminoles (3-3) hit 11 3-pointers and twice pulled within 4 points in the final minute despite committing 21 turnovers. Adrian Crawford, who had a career-high 25 points, hit a 3-pointer and was fouled by Pepe Sanchez, converting a 4-point play that cut it to 69-65 with 61 seconds to play. Delvon Arrington's 3-pointer from the top of the circle cut it to 69-65 with 41.6 seconds left. Crawford hit 7 of 10 3-point attempts, but missed an open 3 with about 30 seconds remaining that could have cut it to 71-68. Temple hit 6 of 8 free throws down the stretch to seal the victory. CINCINNATI 82 NICHOLLS STATE 48 No. 4 Cincinnati (7-0) heard boos during a sloppy first half, but Kenyon Martin turned up the host Bearcats' intensity and helped them wear down Nicholls State. Martin scored 11 of his 22 points during a 20-5 spurt that opened the second half and put Cincinnati in control. He also had 13 rebounds.

Sept. 8, 1998-> 360-> TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE ECONOMY; Central Banker's Resignation Deepens Financial Chasm
Working for Russia's central bank has never been easy. In the last five years, a bomb has exploded at one office, an auditor has had his hand broken and his dacha set on fire after investigating a bank, and Sergei K. Dubinin, the chairman, has had shots fired at his home on two occasions. Mr. Dubinin, speaking on state television last year, said the shots were a ''warning from powerful structures,'' which he declined to identify. But it was Russia's gyrating financial markets and economic collapse, and Mr. Dubinin's erratic handling of those events, that were ultimately responsible for his undoing. Mr. Dubinin, a former university chairman and commercial banker and an alumnus of the vast energy conglomerate Gazprom, resigned today, criticizing Parliament's failure to act more quickly to help resuscitate the prostrate economy. His resignation leaves a large gap at the top of Russia's economic hierarchy at a time when it can least afford it. The economy is collapsing, and the quality of life continues to fray. The beleaguered ruble offers little hope of a revival. Trading in the ruble was halted today on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange barely an hour after opening because no traders were willing to sell dollars. One exchange official said that during that hour, the ruble's value plunged to 2 cents, far below the rate of 5 to 6 cents it has been fetching on the street and an ominous sign that more dire economic times may lie ahead. Indeed, only weeks ago the ruble was trading at about 16 cents. That was before the Government announced a devaluation that it then hoped would let the ruble fall no lower than 10 cents. But the ruble crashed. In its wake the economy and the political leadership have fallen into disarray, and there are renewed fears that the Government will default on about $133 billion owed to foreign creditors. Private companies are said to owe $70 billion, but that figure is not considered entirely reliable. ''It looks very likely that the Government will default unless something changes dramatically,'' said Peter Boone, an analyst with Brunswick Warburg. ''The appointment of the next central banker is going to be incredibly important. If they trade off a weak central banker the Duma likes to get Chernomyrdin in as Prime Minister, then there's going to be no coordination of economic policy.'' The Duma, the lower house of Parliament, rejected Vikor S. Chernomyrdin again today as President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice to be Prime Minister. Mr. Dubinin and the central bank declined to comment on the resignation, but speculation is already afoot about possible replacements. Attention focused on two candidates, Viktor Gerashchenko, a central banker from the Soviet era who is a favorite of the Communists, and Aleksandr N. Shokhin, a moderate who leads Mr. Chernomyrdin's faction in Parliament. Sergei Aleksashenko, Mr. Dubinin's former deputy, is now acting chairman of the central bank. Mr. Dubinin is well regarded by those who value his efforts to rein in the money supply over in recent years, a policy that had kept the ruble stable before the recent debacle. ''Under my leadership, the central bank did not print worthless money,'' the heavy-set, bearded Mr. Dubinin wrote in a letter quoted by a state news agency. ''Monetary policies cannot forever compensate for weaknesses in tax collection and the management of national debt, both internal and external.'' Russian politicians are typically quick to allocate blame for the country's ills, and lately it has been Mr. Dubinin's turn to play sacrificial lamb. Weeks ago Mr. Chernomyrdin accused Mr. Dubinin of being responsible for devaluing the ruble, even though a much broader and more powerful cast of politicians, advisers, bankers and international lending agencies seem to have had roles in the decision -- and not with one voice. And Mr. Yeltsin, who hardly has been a model of alacrity during this economic crisis, received the news of Mr. Dubinin's resignation coolly: ''The President said this decision should have been taken earlier,'' said the Kremlin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky. Nonetheless, there have been other, better-founded criticisms of Mr. Dubinin's decisions in recent weeks. He was faulted for easing reserve requirements for banks as their loans went sour, a move many considered to be a signal that he was willing to bail out banks rather than let them fail. He has also been chastised for not defending the ruble early and consistently, and then for wasting precious reserves and international financial assistance when he belatedly decided to support the currency. The central bank also failed to rigorously supervise the often profligate bankers, who operated their companies more like high-flying, speculative ventures than as institutions that could have helped lay the groundwork for a modern economy. Instead, the banks ran up huge piles of bad loans to industrial concerns in which they held interests and found themselves holding piles of worthless securities. And because of bankers' political influence, funds that could have been used to strengthen the central bank's reserves were used to give life support to failing banks. It is still uncertain whether any Russian central bankers can effectively guide the economy when they are beholden to a Government that has been unable to collect taxes and relies on the central bank to help pay off its debt. ''Right now, central bank policy is completely confused,'' said Margot Jacobs, a banking analyst here with United Financial Group. ''Dubinin didn't do a bad job of monetary policy for the past couple of years, but he did a lousy job of preparing banks for what they're going through now.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 361-> DANCE REVIEW; Movement After Polio, In a Program of Subtext
Sefa Jorques has clearly thought about the subtexts of the program she presented on Saturday night at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center. ''In stillness we can perceive how subtle movement can be,'' Ms. Jorques writes in a program note. The notes also include biographical material about Ms. Jorques's battle in infancy with polio, from which she has recovered. And she addressed near-stillness and deformity in her hourlong program of solos. But Ms. Jorques's powers as a modern-dance choreographer and performer lag well behind her thought processes. Her biographical notes say almost nothing about her dance training or career. She appears to be too young and inexperienced a performer, however, to be able to claim the stage with any depth of presence or dramatic power. What she presented were four dance sketches, often in profile and in silhouette, of a twisting body, stretched arms and splayed fingers that assumed the shapes of birds in shadow play, performed for the most part to easy-listening music. The shapes seldom suggested anything but themselves, though in ''Lady O,'' set to music by Uakti, there was a hint of a sweetness and lyricism that another choreographer might make interesting use of. ''A Secret Weaving Through My Arms,'' danced to music by Keith Jarrett behind a wooden cutout created by Pedro Jorques, offered repeated views of a drawn face and contorted arms at nearly unendurable length. Eventually the proceedings began to feel perverse. Ms. Jorques emerged from a traumatic experience with a healthy-looking dancer's body. It may be time for her to let go of nightmares. The program also included Camilo Rojas's ''Organicus,'' a handsome video that wove together split-screen views of land and sea creatures, Ms. Jorques and the elements, to music by Eric Somers, without much apparent purpose.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 362-> CLINTON IN THE MIDEAST: THE ARTICLES; Some of the Old Language That Is Now Null and Void
When the Palestine National Council affirmed today that articles in the 1964 P.L.O charter calling for the destruction of Israel were null and void, it put a symbolic seal on a vote by the council on April 24, 1996, which supported ''canceling the articles that are contrary to the letters'' of mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization before the 1993 Oslo accord. The 1996 vote was accepted as satisfactory by the Israeli Government led by Prime Minister Shimon Peres and by the Clinton Administration. But the harder-line Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the vote inadequate because it failed to specify which articles had been revoked or to adopt a revised charter. Today the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, asked council delegates whether they supported the peace effort and his letter to President Clinton that declared most of the 1964 charter's 33 articles void or amended. These are among the articles, from the official English version of the 1964 charter, as provided by The Associated Press: ARTICLE 15: The liberation of Palestine, from an Arab viewpoint, is a national duty and it attempts to repel the Zionist and imperialist aggression against the Arab homeland, and aims at the elimination of Zionism in Palestine. Absolute responsibility for this falls upon the Arab nation -- peoples and governments -- with the Arab people of Palestine in the vanguard. Accordingly, the Arab nation must mobilize all its military, human, moral and spiritual capabilities to participate actively with the Palestinian people in the liberation of Palestine. It must, particularly in the phase of the armed Palestinian revolution, offer and furnish the Palestinian people with all possible help, and material and human support, and make available to them the means and opportunities that will enable them to continue to carry out their leading role in the armed revolution, until they liberate their homeland. ARTICLE 19: The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment of the State of Israel are entirely illegal, regardless of the passage of time, because they were contrary to the will of the Palestinian people and to their natural right in their homeland, and inconsistent with the principles embodied in the charter of the United Nations, particularly the right to self-determination. ARTICLE 21: The Arab Palestinian people, expressing themselves by the armed Palestinian revolution, reject all solutions which are substitutes for the total liberation of Palestine and reject all proposals aiming at the liquidation of the Palestinian problem, or its internationalization.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 363-> CLINTON IN THE MIDEAST: THE OVERVIEW; Clinton Watches as Palestinians Drop Call for Israel's Destruction
With President Clinton as their witness, hundreds of former Palestinian guerrilla fighters voted here today to rid their organization's charter of any clauses calling for the destruction of Israel, knocking down a critical roadblock on the rutted path to peace. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he accepted the vote, a show of hands before a worldwide television audience, as ''a real change, a very positive change.'' But he added that he would not agree to meet the Friday deadline to return more land to the Palestinians until they complied with more Israeli demands for change. In the interest of breaking stalemates on such other sensitive issues as the Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners, a three-way meeting between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was scheduled for Tuesday morning at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and Gaza. With a flurry of fingers, some barely held aloft, some thrust into the air with exhilaration, the vote here today signaled a watershed moment for the Palestinians -- partly because it represented a new political pragmatism and partly because it was overseen by Mr. Clinton. Playing preacher and healer, the American President presided over what amounted to a large reunion of the Palestine Liberation Organization at the moment of its public transformation from outlaw group to a nearly sovereign entity and a diplomatic partner of the United States. ''I am profoundly honored to be the first American President to address the Palestinian people in a city governed by Palestinians,'' Mr. Clinton said, bringing hundreds to their feet, as he congratulated them on the vote. ''By turning this page on the past, you are taking the lead in writing a new story for the future,'' he said. ''And you have issued a challenge to the Government and the leaders of Israel to walk down that path with you.'' In the isolated, hardscrabble Gaza Strip, the Palestinians pulled out all the stops today to make Mr. Clinton's visit a celebration of imminent statehood and endorsement by the United States. ''We have a dream same as you,'' read posters pinned to trees, lampposts and donkeys' saddlebags. American and Palestinian flags fluttered side by side on every available pole -- from the huge hand-sewn flags that draped the control towers at the new Palestinian airport, where Mr. Clinton landed in his Marine One helicopter, to the paper flags in the hands of schoolchildren along the route of the motorcade. Mr. Arafat reveled in the moment, which both he and the Americans called historic many times. The flowery language flowed. ''This ancient city that receives you today has not seen many happy days during its history,'' Mr. Arafat said. ''But your presence here made us relive the golden days of Palestine.'' At a ceremony to inaugurate the passenger terminal at the new airport, he prolonged the ribbon-cutting so that mementos could be produced. In a somewhat comic interplay that lasted several minutes, before viewing stands packed with dignitaries, Mr. Arafat held the red ribbon steady while Mr. Clinton cut off strip after strip for posterity. Not everyone was impressed by the pomp, though. One of those was Mamoun Tamimi, who traveled from Jordan to vote against the change in the covenant. ''We should not give a freebie to Israel,'' he said. ''We should link it with a deal that Israel should recognize our state and we will recognize theirs.'' Still, the events of the day in Gaza were preprogrammed, and there was no surprise when the Palestine National Council, together with other Palestinian leaders, raised their hands in support of Mr. Arafat's decision to amend the charter. It was nonetheless a delicate day of diplomacy for the Americans, since Mr. Netanyahu's acceptance could not be guaranteed. Mr. Clinton risked a failed trip, which would have been an untimely defeat for him. But, given the unrest in the West Bank for the last few weeks, the larger cost of such a failure would have been a collapse of the peace effort itself. Nahum Barnea, an Israeli newspaper columnist, said the looming challenge for the Americans was ''how to conclude their visit without leaving the country in flames.'' Pronouncing the visit to Gaza a success, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright made it clear that the Americans believe that the Palestinians, in voting, met a crucial demand of the Israelis, and that the Israelis would be called upon to comply with their own promises, too. ''The important thing is the Israelis wanted this P.N.C. action to take place,'' she said. Mr. Netanyahu said he did feel vindicated by today's vote. ''They told us it was impossible, and if you insist on it, you're jamming the process,'' he said. But, he said, that proved that he could hold firm on the other demands, ''and in the same way try to achieve the other changes.'' Six days before he faces potential doom in a no-confidence vote by the Parliament, Mr. Netanyahu is considered loath to make sudden moves forward on the peace agreement that cost him his right-wing support. The Palestine National Council was the Palestine Liberation Organization's leadership in exile. This marked only its third meeting on its home ground in the last 25 years. The first took place in Jerusalem in 1964, before Israel annexed the eastern part of the city. The second occurred in Gaza just two years ago, and it was convened to do just what the leaders did today: annul the offending clauses in the P.L.O. charter. Although the Americans and the previous Israeli administration accepted those results, the Israelis pointed to the continued inclusion of the clauses in copies of the charter. They also said the vote should be loud and public to send a message to the Palestinian people. For the Palestinians, today's vote, attended by about 500 of an estimated 650 members of the Palestine National Council, did not represent a newly felt renunciation of hostile feelings. It was a pragmatic move, most said, to appease Mr. Clinton by satisfying Mr. Netanyahu. ''Three years ago, I voted in favor, but today it's time to put an end to Mr. Netanyahu's excuses,'' said Hani al-Hassan, a member of Mr. Arafat's Fatah party. ''We have to call his bluff. So I voted for.'' A student from the Islamic University, Mohammed Salah, 22, said the vote itself, even if it produces a breakthrough in the stalemated peace efforts, was not terribly significant. ''The charter is not a substantial issue for us,'' Mr. Salah said. ''Most people knew nothing about this charter until the Israelis brought it to our attention. What was substantial was President Clinton's visit because it sends many signs. It is a recognition. Clearly, we are not considered anymore a people whom nobody wants to recognize.'' With his special blend of empathy and stern counsel, Mr. Clinton endorsed the Palestinian struggle, saying he felt the pain of their ''dispossession'' from their land. But he advised the Palestinians to feel empathy for the Israelis' point of view as well, and suggested that Palestinian children not be taught to glorify suicide bombers. ''Our great American prophet, Martin Luther King, once said, 'The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.' '' he said. It was one remark that went unapplauded by the Palestinians gathered in Gaza.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 364-> CLINTON IN THE MIDEAST: IN GAZA; Clinton Stirs Palestinians With a Nod To Statehood
It certainly seemed like a state visit. Yes, some members of the honor guard that greeted President Clinton at the Gaza International Airport this morning did not always march precisely in step. And no, the band did not attempt ''The Star Spangled Banner'' on its drums, bagpipes and saxophones, contenting itself instead with a peppy rendition of ''The Happy Wanderer.'' But from the immense American and Palestinian flags draped from the airport's control tower to the joint appearance by two leaders at which reporters shouted questions about impeachment, the day had all the feel of a typical visit by President Clinton to a foreign state. Yet one thing was, of course, missing: the state. The Clinton Administration said it had no intention of signaling recognition of Palestinian sovereignty with the President's eight-and-a-half-hour visit, in careful deference to the President's Middle East policy and to Israeli sensibilities. But Mr. Clinton came mighty close, and his aides acknowledged that he had given the notion of statehood a shove. ''I am profoundly honored to be the first American President to address the Palestinian people in a city governed by Palestinians,'' he told a meeting of the Palestine National Council and other leaders this evening. He said that ''this moment would have been inconceivable a decade ago.'' In a further sign of how times have changed, a senior Administration official said tonight that he did not know if the audience -- a lustily cheering throng of about 700, mostly men in suits -- included any suspects wanted by the United States. And he did not seem much interested. Acceding to a formal request from the Israelis, Mr. Clinton did not fly Air Force One into the newly opened airport here. But the six helicopters and the cloud of tan dust that he and his delegation rode in on nevertheless made for an impressive sight. He was greeted by the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, for a day of ceremony, meetings, eating and speechifying. Palestinians skipped work and were released from elementary school and college classes to line the dusty roads here in hopes of catching a glimpse of the President, who mostly traveled over their heads in his green-and-white Blackhawk helicopter. American and Palestinian flags fluttered everywhere in the cool southerly breeze, and Mr. Clinton, with one thumb upthrust and Mr. Arafat at his side, smiled out from ubiquitous posters. Mr. Clinton accepted a gift of a Koran from Mr. Arafat and joked with associates about overindulging in a lunch of rice, lamb and three kinds of fish. Some Palestinians seized on the visit as evidence that they were approaching statehood, if they had not already arrived. As he fingered his prayer beads while waiting at the airport for Mr. Clinton, Nadshe Mustafa, the Mayor of Hebron, said: ''This is a very important day in Palestinian history, that the President of the United States comes to Palestine. We consider it a recognition of the Palestinian state.'' Abu Jabal, 50, said he had decided not to go to his job in Israel today. ''This is an important historic event, a crucial historic moment that I decided I needed to see with my own eyes,'' he said. ''I may lose a day's pay, but it's worth it.'' From the dirt roads to the crumbling office buildings by the Mediterranean Sea, signs abound here that prosperity, like statehood, may be a ways off. In remarks this evening, Mr. Arafat laid the blame at the feet of the Israelis, who he said had ''left behind a devastated infrastructure.'' But he proclaimed ''the resurrection of Palestine'' under way. Mr. Arafat's speech preceded a vote by show of hands of the Palestinian leadership to renounce clauses in their charter that were obnoxious to Israel. Mr. Clinton then addressed the group. Like the Palestinians, the President's equally delighted aides repeatedly resorted to the word historic to describe his visit. ''In many ways, at many levels, the President got done what we came here to do,'' said Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, referring to the three-day trip to the region that ends after a visit to Bethlehem and Masada on Tuesday. Mr. Berger denied that today's visit amounted to recognition of a Palestinian state, an issue that the Israelis and Palestinians are supposed to negotiate. But he added: ''Does the President coming here by agreement between Israel and the Palestinians give some legitimacy to the Palestinian people? I think it does.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 366-> CLINTON IN THE MIDEAST: THE FIRST LADY; Hillary Clinton Tiptoes Through Praise in Gaza
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been hailed here as a champion of Palestinian statehood, walked a careful diplomatic line in public appearances today, praising Palestinian national aspirations while avoiding comments that could be considered a call for sovereignty. But it was clear as she traveled through Gaza today that her seemingly offhand endorsement seven months ago of eventual Palestinian independence has made her something of a heroine, even though her comments were immediately disavowed by the White House and were never publicly repeated. She was greeted with thunderous applause as she walked through the door of the Palestinian National Council gathering here this afternoon. The ovation was repeated with equal enthusiasm as she was introduced from the podium by Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Earlier in the day, as she visited a center for disabled children and a refugee settlement with her daughter, Chelsea, and Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, Mrs. Clinton was acclaimed by local civic leaders as if she were one of their own. ''We are very proud of you and your support for the Palestinian people and their own state,'' said Hanan Matar, a Gaza City lawyer, as she welcomed Mrs. Clinton to a workshop on family law and women's rights. Mrs. Clinton smiled and asked for a clarification on the jurisdiction of local religious courts in disputes over a wife's right to work or to seek further education. In her public remarks here, Mrs. Clinton praised ''the leadership of Chairman Arafat'' in the peace efforts and the ''hope for the future'' embodied in building new institutions, both civic and physical, like the Gaza International Airport that her husband and Mr. Arafat formally inaugurated today. But she appeared to prefer stressing more generic themes, such as the social benefits of spending on higher education for women. The capstone of her Gaza tour was a session seemingly calculated to scare off all but the wonkish: ''Women's Empowerment Through Micro-Lending.'' While President Clinton pushed publicly for further progress in the peace talks, Mrs. Clinton went to the gritty heart of one major unresolved problem: the Arab refugees from the Middle Eastern wars of a half-century ago, and their direct descendants, who remain virtual wards of United Nations refugee camps. Of the 1.1 million refugees in 59 United Nations settlements in four countries, about 760,000 live in the Gaza Strip, and they constitute three-quarters of Gaza's population. Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Arafat visited the most densely packed of Gaza's eight refugee settlements. Known as simply ''the Beach,'' the Gaza City seafront camp has 65,000 people crammed into 70 sandy acres of low-rise cinder block, many of them living three or more to a room. ''I know that for many here in Gaza, life has been too hard for too long,'' Mrs. Clinton said during her visit today, announcing a modest increase in the annual United States contribution to the United Nations refugee program for the Arab refugees to $73 million from $70 million. Mrs. Clinton's visit and the international attention that comes with it ''is like a blessing,'' said Ron Wilkenson, the spokesman for the United Nations' Gaza refugee program. ''These people are so desperate for a little bit of recognition. People don't realize how little they have, and how little they are asking for.'' As she did in Israel on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton avoided reporters' questions about independence and statehood, and her aides again strove to avoid photographs of the First Lady framed by the Palestinian flag. Still, her itinerary in Israel on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, by her side and her tour through Gaza today with Mrs. Arafat was seen in both places as a display of conscious symmetry. Mrs. Arafat, usually not the most public of figures here, was clearly pleased by Mrs. Clinton's companionship. ''Thank you for witnessing with us the construction of our country,'' she said, introducing Mrs. Clinton at the micro-lending forum, ''and I hope you will be able to be with us to witness our Palestinian state.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 367-> CLINTON IN THE MIDEAST; Clinton's Words in Gaza: Citing 'the Waste of War'
Following are excerpts from President's Clinton speech before the Palestinian National Council yesterday, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service: I know that the Palestinian people stand at a crossroads, behind you a history of dispossession and dispersal, before you the opportunity to shape a new Palestinian future on your own land. I know the way is often difficult and frustrating, but you have come to this point through a commitment to peace and negotiations. You reaffirmed that commitment today. I believe it is the only way to fulfill the aspirations of your people. And I am profoundly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Chairman Arafat for the cause of peace, to come here as a friend of peace and a friend of your future, and to witness you raising your hands, standing up tall, standing up not only against what you believe is wrong, but for what you believe is right in the future. I was sitting here thinking that this moment would have been inconceivable a decade ago. No Palestinian Authority; no elections in Gaza and the West Bank; no relations between the United States and the Palestinians; no Israeli troop redeployments from the West Bank and Gaza; no Palestinians in charge of Gaza, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Hebron, Bukara, Janna, Nablus, Jericho and so many other places. There was no Gaza International Airport. Today, I had the privilege of cutting the ribbon on the international airport. . . . I want the people of Israel to know that for many Palestinians, five years after Oslo, the benefits of this process remain remote. That for too many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce, prospects are uncertain, and personal grief is great. I know that tremendous pain remains as a result of losses suffered from violence, the separation of families, the restrictions on the movement of people and goods. I understand your concerns about settlement activity, land confiscation and home demolitions. I understand your concern and theirs about unilateral statements that could prejudge the outcome of final status negotiations. I understand, in short, that there's still a good deal of misunderstanding five years after the beginning of this remarkable process. It takes time to change things and still time for the change to benefit everyone. It takes determination and courage to make these, and sometimes even to persevere for peace. But slowly but surely the peace agreements are turning into concrete progress. . . . Two weeks ago in Washington we joined with other nations to pledge hundreds of millions of dollars toward your development, including health care and clean water, education for your children, rule-of-law projects to nurture democracy. Today I am pleased to announce we will also fund the training of Palestinian health-care providers and airport administrators, increase our support to Palestinian refugees. And next year I will ask the Congress for another several hundred million dollars to support the development of the Palestinian people. But make no mistake about it, all this was made possible because of what you did. Because five years ago you made a choice for peace and because through all the tough times since, when in your own mind you had 100 good reasons to walk away, you didn't. Because you still harbor the wisdom that led to the Oslo accords, that led to the signing in Washington in September of '93. You still can raise your hand and stand and lift your voice for peace. Mr. Chairman, you said some profound words today in embracing the idea that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace as neighbors. Again, I say, you have led the way, and we would not be here without you. . . . Legitimate rights for Palestinians, real security for Israel. But it must begin with something even basic, mutual recognition, seeing people who are different, with whom there have been profound differences, as people. I've had two profoundly emotional experiences in the last less than 24 hours. I was with Chairman Arafat, and four little children came to see me whose fathers are in Israeli prisons. Last night I met some little children whose fathers had been killed in conflict with Palestinians at the dinner that Prime Minister Netanyahu had for me. Those children brought tears to my eyes. We have to find a way for both sets of children to get their lives back and to go forward. Palestinians must recognize the right of Israel and its people to live safe and secure lives today, tomorrow and forever. Israel must recognize the right of Palestinians to aspire to live free today, tomorrow and forever. . . . I thank you for your rejection, fully, finally and forever, of the passages in the Palestinian charter calling for the destruction of Israel. For they were the ideological underpinnings of a struggle renounced at Oslo. . . . The time has come to sanctify your holy ground with genuine forgiveness and reconciliation. Every influential Palestinian, from teacher to journalist, from politician to community leader, must make this a mission to banish from the minds of children glorifying suicide bombers, to end the practice of speaking peace in one place and preaching hatred in another, to teach schoolchildren the value of peace and the waste of war. . . .

Sept. 8, 1998-> 370-> The Writers' Wish List
On June 3, 1997, a group of literary aficionados gathered in the Reading Room of the British Library in London to welcome the arrival of Enoch Soames, a fictional poet in a short story by the English humorist Max Beerbohm. Perhaps not unexpectedly, he didn't appear. What prompted the gathering was this: In Beerbohm's story, set in 1897, Soames, who has sold only three copies of his book of poems, ''Fungoids,'' makes a pact with the Devil. In exchange for his ambitious soul, he asks to visit the Reading Room a hundred years hence, to see how posterity had judged him. Unfortunately for Soames, posterity has not judged him at all; posterity has merely ignored him. In the story, he finds no record of his work in the library's voluminous catalog, and in a literary history the only mention of his name was a note describing him as an imaginary character in a Beerbohm story. It can only be assumed that, for those of us who awaited his appearance in the British Library, even his ghost was invisible. So much for the fruits of ambition. In the past, writers sometimes kept a grinning skull on their desks to remind them that the only certain reward for their labors was the grave. In our time, at least until last May, a writer's memento mori has not been a skull but newspaper and magazine best-seller lists, which allow writers to see that they, too, share poor Soames's fate, their names assiduously absent from these roll calls of the elect. But not any longer. Driven by a sense of charity if not humor, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of the on-line bookstore Amazon.com, decided a few months ago to come to the rescue of all those woefully neglected writers. Now, in a gesture that can only be described as truly democratic, the best-seller lists on the Amazon Web site are no longer limited to a puny top 20 names, but enshrine instead more than a million titles. And the list is updated hourly for the top 10,000 titles, daily for the next 100,000 and monthly for the rest. Thanks to the new technology, the writer's memento mori has become a vanity chart. Say you have published a book and reasonably suppose it is among the three million titles offered by Amazon.com. You can type out its title and, presto! You are given the exact ranking of your book among its peers. Think of the satisfied sneer with which best-selling author number 1,087,202 can now look down on the poor author who falls one below, to 1,087,203d place. Laws stranger than those of chance determine which authors become famous and which do not. Ever since 1895, when the first best-seller list appeared in the pages of the English magazine The Bookman, books make the grade for reasons that not even the Devil himself can fathom. Of course, if all you want is your name in lights, there are methods to procure this modest satisfaction. For example, ask each of your friends to buy a copy of your book from Amazon on the same afternoon and you are likely to shimmer, for one exquisite hour, on the site's rankings. But for those unwilling to take such steps, it may be salutary to skim through the names enshrined in the best-seller lists of just a couple of years ago. With few exceptions, who are these people, who were counted among the blessed by the compilers of best-seller lists, whose books presumably sold in the hundreds of thousands, and are now utterly forgotten? Perhaps it is unfair to ask what all this counting means. Lists are delightful things in themselves, the very essence of poetry (as W. H. Auden once remarked), and it would be mean-spirited to deny the author of ''Fungoids'' the pleasure of introducing himself at a dinner party with: ''Hello, I'm best-selling author number 1,087,202. My book sold seven copies!'' But it may be that a little vanity is a requisite quality in literary endeavors. ''Seven copies have been sold,'' reflects the protagonist of ''Nightmare Abbey,'' Thomas Love Peacock's early 19th-century novel. ''Seven is a mystical number, and the omen is good. Let me find the seven purchasers of my seven copies, and they shall be the seven golden candlesticks with which I will illuminate the world.'' In these days when greed is considered a virtue, who would dare quarrel with such modest ambition?

Dec. 21, 1998-> 372-> TELEVISION REVIEW; Wondering About Victory In the War on Terrorism
If you have lost track, amid the unfamiliar names and murky allegations of who is supposed to have done what in the year's terrorist bombings in East Africa, tonight's ''Investigative Reports'' provides a sketchy guide. Drawn mainly from American sources, ''Death to America: The Terrorism Trail'' lays out the evidence and suspicions of what has become the case of the United States of America vs. Osama bin Laden. In the months since the August explosions, Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire who fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan before turning to preaching the murder of Americans, has been described by one investigator as ''a financial godfather'' of international terrorism. This hourlong program, which begins with pictures of stunned and bloodied survivors, mostly Africans, moves like an exotic-locale paperback mystery, from a seemingly suspicious patient in a Nairobi hospital to a Jordanian in Karachi, Pakistan, to a Lebanese-American in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it can connect these plotters with Mr. bin Laden, whom it also credits with playing a part in driving American troops out of Somalia in 1992 and in the bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 1993. He has been indicted in New York, with a reward of $5 million for anybody out there who can bring him in. The charges have yet to be tested in court, but there has already been controversy over a retaliatory strike by the United States on what was advertised as a factory in the Sudan that produced nerve gas. The Sudanese deny it, and tonight's reporter says there are signs that the demolished factory was what they say it was, a pharmaceutical plant. However that dispute turns out, no one claims that America's response is likely to do much to discourage terrorism. An investigator, who might have been commenting on last week's headlines, says, ''You can't fight terrorism with a cruise missile.'' This brisk hour leaves open the question of whether even the capture of Mr. bin Laden would make life safer for Americans. The publicity spotlight has given the man the aura of a mastermind of terrorism, but the program leaves the caution that such is the nature of terror and fear that the war against them may be unwinnable.

Dec. 21, 1998-> 373-> Tale of a Cranky Londoner Is an All-American Charmer
Quite dapper in a Victorian frock coat, period chalk-stripe trousers and a black top hat, Gerald Charles Dickens, great-great-grandson of the great, great novelist, pointed his walking stick at the audience gathered here at the local library. ''Bah, humbug,'' he said. Mr. Dickens, an English actor, is 35, a little young yet, and far too pleasant looking, for the initial grave misanthropy of Ebenezer Scrooge, the famous character (created by his famous ancestor) that he was busily recreating on a makeshift stage. Still, that didn't faze the audience, 100 or so children and their mothers, all of them either being introduced to or revisiting ''A Christmas Carol,'' the sentimental story of a bitter man redeemed by stern but benevolent ghosts on Christmas Eve. It hasn't escaped Mr. Dickens's notice that, English provenance notwithstanding, the Carol, as scholars often refer to it, has become perhaps America's most significant -- secularly speaking -- holiday legend. He has spent the last three Christmas seasons in this country, doing one-man performances of the Carol and other Dickensiana in hotels, theaters and libraries, many in towns in the South and Midwest where live theater performances of any kind are far from daily fare. Here in Lone Jack, a rural community about an hour southeast of Kansas City, his listeners gathered afterward for autographs and a brush with literary history. ''Dickens has total celebrity status over here,'' Mr. Dickens said in an interview. ''In England, we are blase about him. It's more like 'We've got Chaucer, we've got Shakespeare, all those other blokes.' Here they show me their copies of the Carol and hold them out reverently, as though it were an altar cloth. The first year I did this, I was in total shock.'' Shocked? He probably shouldn't even have been surprised, for the Carol is such a favorite, such a guaranteed revenue producer, that according to the Theater Communications Group, an umbrella organization for nonprofit theaters, there are 33 member theaters producing it this season; in other words, about 10 percent of the nonprofit professional theaters in the United States are staging the Carol right now. And that, of course, doesn't include the countless amateur productions, or the enterprise of the merchants in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, who five years ago created an annual Dickens festival on December weekends, with actors performing scenes from the Carol on street corners. Indeed, Gerald Dickens is a mere extra in the cast of thousands who have played Scrooge for American audiences over the years, including well-known names from Lionel Barrymore, who performed the Carol on radio almost every year between 1934 and 1955; to George C. Scott and Henry Winkler, who appeared in television films of the Carol; to Albert Finney and Bill Murray, who starred in American-made feature films (the 1951 British version, starring Alastair Sim, nonetheless remains incomparable), to Mr. Magoo, Fred Flintstone and Donald Duck. Roger Daltrey, the former lead singer of the Who, is the latest Scrooge to take the stage in Madison Square Garden's annual production, which has in the past featured Tony Randall, Hal Linden, Terrence Mann and Roddy McDowall in the role. But in some ways -- and for many people -- it doesn't matter who is in it. ''I love the play,'' said Kathy Adamec, an investment counselor from Hinsdale, Ill., who has seen the annual production at the Goodman Theater in Chicago a dozen times. ''It still thrills me with the spirit of sharing.'' It used to be that Mrs. Adamec and her husband, Bruce, the general auditor for Ameritech, would gather friends and make an evening of it. Then their nieces came of age, and the Carol became a family tradition. ''It ushers in the Christmas season for us,'' she said. ''For the kids, there are scary scenes in the play that thrill them, and it's our way of talking to them about values, like charity, that we want our girls to know about.'' Written in the fall of 1843, in a break from the serial composition of ''Martin Chuzzlewit,'' whose popularity was flagging, the Carol was meant by the author, somewhat paradoxically, both to draw attention to the plight of the London poor and to earn money from what he recognized as a holiday market for tale telling. Published in mid-December, the story was an immediate sensation, and instantly recognized as adaptable for dramatization. After all, it had its archetypal hardhearted villain; its frightening specters (Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, plus representatives of Christmases past, present and future: is there anyone who doesn't know this?); its poor but forgiving victims (the Cratchit family, with the lame Tiny Tim, to tug mercilessly on the heart), and Scrooge's unmitigatedly joyous reformation. That it makes only incidental reference to the religious occasion of the holiday added to its universal appeal. By mid-February there were at least five productions, including a musical, on London stages. America's first Carol was in New York the following Christmas. Since then, the Carol has been set to Broadway music, symphonic music, operatic music. The first movie, silent of course, appeared in 1901. Adaptations have presented Scrooge as, among other things, a gay man, a black man, a woman, a television executive and a Muppet. Each year of its existence, the 11-year-old Pollard Theater in Guthrie, Okla., has performed ''A Territorial Christmas Carol,'' an adaptation that takes place in Guthrie in 1889, during the Oklahoma land rush, with Scrooge as an evil land baron. The troupe's founding director, Charles C. Suggs 2d, said ticket sales for the Carol sustained the theater through its first season, and the Pollard has sold about 5,000 tickets to the Carol during its six-week run every year, twice the total of any of the theater's other offerings, in a city with a population of 10,000. In Minneapolis, at the Guthrie Theater, 60,000 people attend performances of the Carol every year, most not subscription holders. At A Contemporary Theater in Seattle, the company is doing so many weekly performances -- up to 13 -- that it uses two Scrooges, who perform on alternating days. This year in Chicago, the Goodman Theater is putting on two: its annual, full-scale version, and in its studio theater a one-man show, written and performed by Tom Mula, that purports to tell the story from the perspective of Marley, Scrooge's deceased and penitent partner. ''It is, I would say, largely an American phenomenon, and it's something that stuns me,'' said Joe Dowling, an Irishman who is now in his third season as artistic director of the Guthrie. ''It means this country is more liberal than it sometimes represents itself,'' he said. ''After all, in the early part of the play, the market rules. People are responsible for their own actions, and those who haven't got are at fault. ''By the end, Scrooge has come round to believing we must have, if not socialism, then a great deal of social democracy. It's fascinating that audiences embrace a notion from a 19th-century British writer. If a 20th-century American writer said the same things, he'd be viewed as left-wing fringe.'' Carey Perloff, artistic director of the Actors Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, called the Carol ''the most successful piece of propaganda ever written,'' noting particularly that for many in her audience in a city where homelessness and affluence exist so visibly side by side, the play can't help feeling political. ''Maybe it's because there's so much wealth here that there's so much guilt here,'' Ms. Perloff said. ''But you know, Americans basically do have a social conscience, and they really do believe they can redeem themselves. They're hopeful that there still is a body politic.'' But beyond the political, the Carol, with the transformation of Scrooge at its center, also seems to provide personal solace for the American soul. In a society as diverse as this, said Jerry Patch, the dramaturge at the South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa, Calif., for which he adapted the Carol, it is an apt spiritual vehicle. ''It brings out, as much as any play does, the religious nature of the theater,'' he said. ''It is an ecumenical experience at a religious time of year, and the theater becomes more like church than theater usually is.'' And in a society as emotionally self-conscious as today's, the Carol may also provide a cautionary tale: Scrooge as mirror. ''You know who I think it really gets? Men,'' said Kurt Beattie, who is one of the two Scrooges this year at A Contemporary Theater. ''Particularly the ones I see dragged to the theater by their wives. But those are the guys who fall over like tenpins. One of the things that's powerful is the identification of Scrooge's grief with childhood, which always has tremendous resonance with the audience. And particularly with men, because I think the story, to a large degree, is about a man having walled himself off from society.'' Ms. Perloff, whose 9-year-old daughter is performing in the play, was one of many Scrooge aficionados who said that the Carol served as a commentary on the commercial nature of modern Christmas. ''So many parents are overwhelmed by their children's need to own things they've been told are worth owning,'' she said. ''So in a way they feel like they hate Christmas. It's so dispiriting that it comes down to 'Did you get the first Cabbage Patch on your block?' So when Scrooge humbugs around about how horrible Christmas is, there are many people who relate to it. And even though the end is so sentimental, it's rejuvenating for people to have that awfulness stripped away.'' One peculiarity of the Carol's lingering appeal is that though the spirit of the tale is in Scrooge's emerging humanity, it is his meanness that people remember. Often fondly. ''We all love a villain more than a regenerate soul,'' said Fred Kaplan, a Dickens biographer. ''A regenerate soul is wonderful, but he's a bore. I mean, who wants to hear Clinton apologize?'' In popular usage, after all, a scrooge is, in the words of Gordon Edlestein, artistic director of A Contemporary Theater, ''a miser and a misanthrope, two Moliere characters.'' ''I tried to encourage our Scrooges to try and find their own misanthropy, depression, rage, separation from the world,'' said Mr. Edelstein, who has just directed the Carol for the first time. Still, he added, that is what supplies the power of the tale. ''It's not my tradition,'' said Mr. Edelstein, who is Jewish. ''But you know what? I found it moving. And in some ways transformative. It's a story about someone who is the worst version of ourselves who becomes the very best version of who we might be. We all wish to be better people.''

Nov. 15, 1998-> 374-> 1998 COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; Duke's Big Man Is Also an Agile One
Elton Brand laughs a lot. He smiles even more. Not on the basketball court, of course. There, he grimaces and crumbles his face into a scowl, or stretches it into encouraging barks at his Duke Blue Devil teammates. Not 18 months out of Peekskill High School, the 6-foot-9-inch, 270-pounder has offered one surprise after another in a start-and-stop college career that most believe will end after this, his sophomore season. He showed up here on Tobacco Road with the kind of hulking frame that looked destined to do hard, inside labor around the blocks in the Atlantic Coast Conference. But Brand also demonstrated a flair with the ball and feathery body control that make him a threat anywhere on the floor. When he broke his left foot late last December, his coach, Mike Krzyzewski; his mother, Daisy, and some teammates circled his hospital bed before surgery. They were devastated. Brand wasn't. ''It wasn't a career-ending injury or anything,'' he told them. ''There are so many more important things than a foot injury. I'll work on my schoolbooks.'' The announcement came that he was probably out for the season. Nearly 2 months, 15 games and a bionic-style rehabilitation later, Brand scored 14 points and grabbed 7 rebounds against U.C.L.A. He was averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds and shooting 64.2 percent before the injury. He finished the season at 13.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 60 percent. It is no surprise that Brand is a front-runner for player of the year honors and that Duke is the popular choice to win the national title. But no matter what happens, Brand is sitting on another stunner after the national title nets are cut down at St. Petersburg's Tropicana Field next March. Will Brand be the first Blue Devil under Krzyzewski to leave early for the National Basketball Association draft? Or will he keep the coach's streak intact? He has heard the question all summer, but can still beam ear to ear when asked. ''It seems so far-fetched to me sitting here right now to go to the pros,'' he said. ''I missed so many games last year. I've got a lot to prove. Heck, I'm unproven to myself.'' Most believe Brand showed how ready he was for the N.B.A. over the summer, when he led the United States to a surprising gold medal at the Goodwill Games. He averaged 17 points and 7.6 rebounds against older players, most of them professionals in the European leagues. ''It gave me a taste of how physical it is at that level,'' Brand said. ''Every possession is a war, and if they think they found a weakness they keep going at it.'' Whatever Brand decides, Krzyzewski said his mere presence has already transformed perhaps the most consistent basketball program in the nation. Krzyzewski said he and Elton and Daisy Brand will sit down and discuss the future after the season. Krzyzewski has thought, however, about what he will demand from Brand, or any other Blue Devil who leaves early. He will marshal Duke's academic support staff and come up with a plan for the player to finish his education. ''I want a commitment that they get a degree -- a Duke degree,'' Krzyzewski said. ''I'll make it clear if they don't that it will affect my relationship with that player. ''If Elton is the first one, then who better? He is mature. He has respect for authority, great people skills and humility. I'd be comfortable.'' Until then, the challenge will be quickly honing Brand and his talented sophomore classmates -- guard William Avery, forward Shane Battier and center Chris Burgess -- into a battle-tested Duke team. Fortunately, the fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon remains to speed up the process. Both the coach and his team captain acknowledge the program is in transition. ''Just like there is becoming a younger N.B.A., we're getting younger,'' Krzyzewski said. ''You need to do more coaching earlier.'' Langdon concedes that the days of Duke underclassmen following every command of the seniors are over. ''It's a different vibe now,'' he said. ''When Cherokee Parks told me to do something, I did it without question. I'm still the leader, but the younger guys will tell me their opinion. It's not better or worse, just different.'' Brand is respectful of Duke's senior tradition, but counts himself among the team's leaders. Last year, as a freshman, he alternately encouraged and challenged the senior Roshown McLeod, and it was part of what pushed McLeod to become a first-round draft pick. ''I'm a vocal guy; I can't help it,'' said Brand, unable to suppress another laugh. ''But I also know that no one player can carry a team. That isn't Duke basketball.'' For the next five months at least, that's all that matters to him.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 380-> Big Contributor to Democrats Receives 5 Years of Probation
Johnny Chung, a prolific donor to Democrats and a frequent visitor to the Clinton White House, was sentenced today to probation and community service for his involvement in illegal campaign contributions in the 1996 election. At the sentencing, Judge Manuel L. Real of Federal District Court expressed doubt over Democratic Party officials' assertions that they did not know about fund-raising abuses, and said he was surprised that Attorney General Janet Reno did not appoint a special prosecutor to look into them, ''as much as that term has become something of a pariah.'' The judge, appointed to the bench in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, said he had reviewed transcripts of Mr. Chung's testimony before a grand jury investigating those accusations. Ms. Reno has said that she based her decision on the facts and the law and had not found sufficient grounds for appointing an independent counsel. Referring to Donald L. Fowler, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Richard Sullivan, the committee's former finance director, the judge added: ''If Mr. Fowler and Mr. Sullivan didn't know what was going on, I think they are the dumbest politicians I've ever seen.'' Rick Hess, a spokesman for the committee, declined to respond to Judge Real's comments. Mr. Chung, 43, who faced up to 18 months in prison, was granted leniency after a recommendation by prosecutors and pleas from his lawyer on the basis of his cooperation with an investigation into fund-raising abuses in the 1996 campaign. Mr. Chung was sentenced to five years of probation and 3,000 hours of community service. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy charges, and admitted circumventing individual limits on donations.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 381-> By Design; Diamond Days Are Here Again
Maybe it's the time of year. Maybe it's the time of the century. Whatever the reason, stores report that diamond jewelry is selling, from a few tiny stones on a chain to elaborate necklaces. So the entry of Robert Lee Morris into the fine jewelry field seems to be well timed. Mr. Morris, who is known for hand-wrought, sculptural jewelry of silver or gold-toned metal, recently introduced a collection of 18-karat-gold and platinum pieces with diamonds and pearls. He has used many of his signature motifs of crosses, links and toggle closings in an extensive collection of earrings, necklaces and cuffs. Prices range from $700 for a tiny diamond cross on a chain to $250,000 for a reversible bib with 17.5 carats of diamonds on one side and 35 Biwa pearls on the other. Saks Fifth Avenue has some pieces. The entire collection is at the Robert Lee Morris store, 400 West Broadway, near Spring Street.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 383-> Case Study in Tobacco Law: How a Fee Jumped in Days
A few months ago, Patrick J. Coughlin, a San Diego lawyer involved in a lawsuit against R. J. Reynolds, was thinking of asking for a $50 million fee for his firm, a sum that might strike some people as high for a case that the cigarette maker had settled for $10 million. Then Mr. Coughlin heard that the five lawyers who represented Texas in its $17.3 billion settlement with tobacco companies this year planned to shoot for the moon before the arbitrators who were to determine both their fees and his. Alarm bells went off and within weeks, Mr. Coughlin's fee request had shot up like a fever -- to $650 million. The Texas group, after all, was seeking up to $25 billion, and the pot of money for lawyers was limited. ''Rightly or wrongly,'' Mr. Coughlin said, ''I decided to ask for hundreds of millions of dollars so that I won't be crushed by the amounts other people were asking for.'' The extraordinary requests for payment by the Texas lawyers and Mr. Coughlin's firm are likely to become commonplace as plaintiffs' lawyers across the country grab for fees from smoking-related settlements between the tobacco industry and the states. Under the settlements, all lawyers will eventually receive the full amount of whatever fees they are awarded. But because the industry's payments of legal fees are limited to $500 million a year -- in itself, enough to pay 100 lawyers $5 million apiece -- those who win the biggest fees first will be paid long before lawyers with smaller, later awards. In the end, what may distinguish Mr. Coughlin is not how much he requested, but his openness about the gamesmanship behind the stratospheric numbers as the lawyers fight for their share of what could total $20 billion or more in legal fees. The lawsuit against the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, known as the Mangini suit because it was originally filed by a San Francisco lawyer, Janet Mangini, attacked the company's Joe Camel marketing campaign for aiming at teen-agers. In settling the action for $10 million, R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco division of RJR Nabisco, acknowledged that the suit played a significant role in its decision to drop the campaign. Industry documents that Mr. Coughlin and his colleagues helped uncover had shown that cigarette makers viewed teen-agers as young as 14 as ''replacement'' smokers. In an effort to get a big slice of the fee pie, Mr. Coughlin's firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, trumpeted those accomplishments. They gave arbitrators studies that claimed their work in helping to get rid of Joe Camel was worth $650 million. The reason: without the cartoon pitchman, the studies claimed, a million fewer teen-agers would take up smoking over the next 25 years, saving society $60 billion in health care and other costs. The law firm also developed a slick news magazine-style video, ''Breaking the Camel's Back,'' that extolled its work in exposing Big Tobacco's ''biggest secrets'' and ''deadliest lies.'' It also offered the arbitration panel testimonials about the case's impact from anti-smoking advocates like Dr. David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Depending on the game's success, the final bill paid by tobacco companies and smokers could grow by billions. The Texas lawyers, for example, were awarded $3.3 billion by arbitrators last week, some $1 billion more than they would have received under their original contract with the state. Some plaintiffs' lawyers who sued tobacco companies on behalf of states said they were outraged by the fees sought by their colleagues in the first round of arbitrations and were stunned by the actual awards announced last week. Lawyers who represented Texas, Florida and Mississippi, the first three states to settle suits brought against the tobacco industry to recover health-care costs related to smoking, were awarded $8.2 billion in fees. ''The awards are far in excess of these lawyers' contribution to any of the state results,'' said Michael Ciresi, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Minneapolis who represented Minnesota and a health insurer in a $6.5 billion settlement with tobacco companies, which are paying his firm and others fees equal to 7.1 percent of that amount. Mr. Ciresi and others say the case involving Mr. Coughlin's firm played a significant role in litigation against cigarette makers. ''They did do valuable work,'' Mr. Ciresi said. ''But in my judgment they didn't do $650 million of value. The rule of reason has to apply.'' Dr. Kessler, who is now dean of the Yale University Medical School, said he had been glad to share his opinion when approached by lawyers from Mr. Coughlin's firm because he believed that the lawsuit had helped expose the industry's targeting of youth. But Dr. Kessler said that he had never asked about the size of the lawyers' fee request. Nor had the lawyers volunteered that information. ''I think they did a real service, but I think the fee is outrageous,'' he said in a telephone interview last week before the arbitrators' decision became public. ''All the legal fees are out of control.'' The Texas lawyers, like Mr. Coughlin's firm, recalculated the value of their state's settlement for arbitrators. While Texas's $17.3 billion settlement with cigarette makers was projected over 25 years, the lawyers submitted a study by a Yale University professor predicting that over the next 50 years, Texas would receive $100 billion from tobacco companies under the deal. As a result, the lawyers claimed they were due $25 billion. They got $3.3 billion. But Mr. Coughlin was awakened Friday at 5 A.M. and greeted with the disappointing news that his team would get only $8 million. In some ways, Mr. Coughlin's case was unique. Though not a state action, it had been made part of the fee arbitration process for state settlements under an agreement between R.J. Reynolds and his firm, but while the tobacco companies had agreed not to argue against fee requests from Texas, Florida and Mississippi lawyers, they opposed Mr. Coughlin. Dozens of plaintiffs' lawyers hired by the 46 states and five territories involved in the recent $206 billion settlement plan will face similar battles as they seek to become multimillionaires or even billionaires. Many of their fees will be determined by the same arbitration process that resulted in Friday's awards. Mr. Coughlin appears inclined to agree that the fee requests are outsized, but he says that's the nature of the game as lawyers try to secure the largest possible slice of the annual $500 million in fees, slices that will grow thinner each year as arbitrators make more awards. At a fee hearing at a Manhattan hotel 10 days ago, Mr. Coughlin said he realized that his award would be ''crushed'' in the annual payout by the billions sought by the state lawyers from Texas and elsewhere unless it was between $150 million and $300 million. That didn't happen. The $8 million his firm did receive is one-tenth of 1 percent of the fees awarded last week, and so it will collect less than $1 million this year from the industry's annual pool, and much less each year thereafter as arbitrators award much more in fees. But the firm will soon get another chance at the ring. Some plaintiffs' lawyers hired by states have chosen to resolve their fees claims through direct negotiation with the tobacco industry. But after seeing the $8.2 billion in fees given out Friday, Mr. Coughlin says there is no question about what he will do with his California claim, despite his recent setback. ''I'm going back to arbitration -- wouldn't you?'' he said. ''I'd have to be crazy not to do it.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 384-> BASEBALL; Texas Makes a Play for Williams and Clemens
The Texas Rangers worked to acquire the Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams today, but this was a sidelight to the Rangers' pursuit of pitcher Roger Clemens at the winter meetings here. The Rangers appear to be the front-runners to acquire Clemens from Toronto, though the Blue Jays and Clemens's agents say that many teams are interested -- perhaps to solicit greater interest from the Yankees. The Rangers are expected to have the rights to Williams at the conclusion of a series of maneuvers that commenced with the Rule 5 draft today. Williams, a running back at the University of Texas awarded the Heisman Trophy two days ago, played the outfield for the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A affiliate last summer. Because Williams has split his time between baseball and football, his skills are unrefined. The Phillies did not protect him on their 40-man roster, and so the Montreal Expos picked Williams; once Texas clears a spot on its 40-man roster, a baseball official indicated the Rangers were willing to pay Montreal $100,000 for the rights to Williams, though the Cincinnati Reds have offered to trade a player to the Expos. The connection between Williams and the Rangers is deep: The Rangers' owner, Tom Hicks, is a regent for the University of Texas. Clemens is a Texas native who attended the University of Texas, and he would also be a natural for the Rangers, who had extensive meetings Sunday and today with Toronto officials, as well as Clemens's agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks. The Blue Jays had hoped for a vigorous market for Clemens, but the pitcher's requirements in salary and location appear to have hampered their trade leverage. The Houston Astros angrily pulled out of the Clemens trade talks Sunday, indicating that the Hendricks brothers had asked for a one-year, $27.4 million extension, beyond the two years and $16.1 million that remain on Clemens's current deal. The $14.5 million average annual salary of that proposal would have been slightly less than the record $15 million per year Kevin Brown will receive from the Los Angeles Dodgers. But officials with other teams say that Clemens's agents are asking for more than $15 million per year now; because Clemens is from Houston, officials quote the Hendrickses as saying the Astros would have received a ''hometown discount.'' The price of trading players to Toronto and then meeting Clemens's demands has caused Anaheim to drop out, and high-ranking officials from the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles said today they would not want Clemens at such a high cost. Colorado is out, Manager Jim Leyland said today, because Clemens doesn't want to play for the Rockies. Cleveland General Manager John Hart said the chances of his team making a deal for Clemens ''are remote.'' Other teams interested in Clemens are being told the Yankees are seriously involved in talks, and Toronto officials have constantly called Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman to solicit offers. The presence of the Yankees in the bidding would naturally allow Toronto to ask for more players and Clemens to ask for more money, but Cashman's lukewarm interest apparently reflects that of the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner. He met with the Hendrickses today. ''If this is a seven-team race,'' Cashman said, ''we're running seventh.'' Texas and Toronto have traded proposals, with the Blue Jays asking for outfielder Rusty Greer, the top prospect Ruben Mateo and two others, and the Rangers countering with pitcher Rick Helling and two prospects. The Rangers are attempting to acquire Milwaukee second baseman Fernando Vina to include him in the package for Clemens. Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said tonight that he did not expect any resolution to the Clemens negotiations until late this week. It figures that in the interim, the Hendrickses will try to draw Steinbrenner into the talks. That the Clemens negotiations are dominating conversation here is evidence of just how few moves the teams have made since the Dodgers signed Brown on Saturday. Only five trades have been completed here, and only two that involved major leaguers. Cashman is seeking offers for third baseman Mike Lowell, second baseman Homer Bush and outfielder Shane Spencer, but does not seem close to making a trade. The Oakland Athletics offered pitcher Blake Stein and a minor leaguer for Spencer, according to baseball officials, but the Yankees rejected that proposal. The Padres offered minor leaguers for Lowell -- as the Florida Marlins did last week -- but without success; now San Diego hopes to acquire pitcher Kelvim Escobar from Toronto and redirect him to the Yankees for Lowell. The Detroit Tigers signed catcher Bill Haselman to a two-year contract, and the Kansas City Royals signed Chad Kreuter to a one-year deal. The Minnesota Twins swapped outfielder Alex Ochoa, formerly of the Mets, to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player to be named, and the Pittsburgh Pirates traded pitcher Jon Lieber to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Brant Brown. The Florida Marlins made Alberto Blanco the first player selected in the Rule 5 draft, taking him away from the Houston Astros. Teams must keep players selected in the major-league portion of the Rule 5 draft on their big-league rosters all year, or offer them to their former teams for $25,000, or work out a separate trade to return them to the minors. The Rangers are expected to arrange a deal that would allow them to send Williams to the minors, where he can develop. The Mets lost pitcher Scott Sauerbeck in the major league portion of the Rule 5 draft, and shortstop Ryan Jaroncyk in the minor league portion. Jaroncyk, the Mets' No. 1 selection in the 1995 amateur draft, quit in May 1997, saying he didn't like baseball. The Dodgers would have to convince Jaroncyk to return to baseball, but there are those in the Mets' organization who believe the Dodgers already have done so, which would constitute tampering. Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, said Los Angeles has had no conversations with Jaroncyk.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 385-> BASEBALL; Mets Find A Place For Huskey In Seattle
Last spring in Florida, the co-owner Fred Wilpon echoed the thoughts of just about everyone in the Mets' front office when he said he wanted to see what right fielder Butch Huskey could do with 500 times at bat. Huskey, who was plagued by tight hamstrings and sore knees, fell short of that mark, batting 369 times. And now, if he ever makes it, either to 500 at-bats or to stardom, it will be with another team. The Mets traded the 27-year-old Huskey today to the Seattle Mariners for a 20-year-old pitching prospect named Lesli Brea. Huskey's trade came one day after the Mets' announced they had agreed to terms with the veteran left fielder Rickey Henderson on a deal that will guarantee the soon-to-be 40-year-old Henderson $2.3 million. Henderson's signing completes an outfield that includes Brian McRae in center and the Bobby Bonilla in right. Huskey, meanwhile, figures to earn around $1.5 million next season because he is eligible for salary arbitration for the first time. And apparently, Mets General Manager Steve Phillips figured that was too much for a fourth outfielder. ''The way our team was configured now, there wasn't the opportunity for Butch to get at-bats,'' Phillips said of Huskey, who hit a disappointing .252 with 13 homers and 59 runs batted in last season. ''Plus, we have a need for defensive, speed players. And since Butch is first-time arbitration eligible, and considering the amount of playing time he would get with where he will go in the arbitration process, it wasn't an ideal fit. And Butch wants to play.'' Seattle General Manager Woody Woodward said that Huskey, who is coming off minor arthroscopic surgery on both knees, would be given the opportunity to play in right field next season. The Mariners are hoping he can regain the form he showed in 1997 -- when he hit .287 with 24 homers and 81 r.b.i. -- and build on it. They would love to install Huskey in right because they plan to move Jay Buhner to first and David Segui to left. Huskey began his career with the Mets as a third baseman, and not a very good one at that. The Mets moved him to the outfield, where he did not dazzle anyone, either. For that reason, the American League has always been seen as a logical destination for Huskey, because any team would have the option of using him as a designated hitter. Of course, the Mariners have Edgar Martinez to d.h., so the right-handed-hitting Huskey will have to play the field, at least for now. If he struggles, he will most likely platoon with the left-handed-hitting Shane Monahan. As for Brea, he struck out 86 in 58 2/3 innings in his first professional season at low Class A. ''He helps replenish our system,'' Phillips said. He added that Brea, a 5-foot-11-inch, 170-pound right-handed reliever, has been clocked between 94 and 97 miles an hour. ''He has a power arm,'' Phillips said. ''And we don't have a power arm like this in our system.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 386-> BASEBALL; Jays' Manager Is Hounded by War Tales
One by one in the last two days, the major league managers who were present at the first winter meetings in six years had taken half an hour out of their day to meet with reporters and discuss their teams. This morning was Toronto Manager Tim Johnson's turn. The first set of questions, about Roger Clemens's future with the Blue Jays, was predictable. The second set, about Johnson's military record, was unusual, to say the least. But the 49-year-old Johnson had brought the questions on himself. In late November, he admitted in a series of interviews with Toronto-area reporters that he had lied on his resume and in stories he had told his players about having been in combat in Vietnam. Johnson actually served in the Marine Corps reserves during the Vietnam War, teaching mortar technology at Camp Pendleton in California while he came up through the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization. Toronto newspapers reported last season that Johnson had told one of his pitchers, Pat Hentgen, stories about his unpleasant combat experiences in Vietnam in an effort to get Hentgen to accept a decision about the pitching rotation that he did not like. A Boston Globe article last month said that Johnson had told similar stories when he was a coach with the Red Sox in 1995 and 1996. Furthermore, since the late 1970's, Johnson's biography listed him as a high school all-American in basketball, one who had turned down a scholarship to attend U.C.L.A. But that was untrue, too. And so, after managing the Blue Jays to an 88-74 record as a rookie manager -- Toronto's first winning season since 1993 -- his credibility has become an issue. ''Credibility, to me, is going out there and watching the game, watching the players play for you,'' said Johnson, who sounded apologetic, defensive and defiant. ''That's going to show if you have credibility or not. Nothing's going to change my way of going after the players and talking to them and when you need to get on them. Nothing's going to change.'' Except, perhaps, the way Johnson is perceived in his second season as a major league manager. Why, he was asked today, did he lie about Vietnam? ''You know, I've talked to many people, counselors,'' Johnson said. ''And in the Marine Corps, there's a lot of veterans that I knew at the time. This goes back 30 years ago. It was probably guilt, more than anything else, that all my great friends were going that way and I was going to spring training -- after serving all this time with these people and then hearing and watching them being killed and things like that. ''And it's something that I have to deal with every day. It's like any other fault of anybody. You've got to deal with it and go on. You have to try to do the right things from now on.'' The issue has been cited as a source of friction between Johnson and his pitching coach, Mel Queen. After some public squabbling, they have agreed to work together. Johnson also said that he had spoken to most of his players since publicly admitting he had not told the truth and that they had been supportive. But it remains to be seen how they will respond in testing times. One Toronto newspaper article said that one reason Clemens wants out of Toronto is Johnson. ''That's absolutely wrong,'' Johnson said. ''That has nothing to do with anything. I speak to Roger, and believe me, Roger's very close to me.'' Yet the truth has become an issue in Toronto. ''When you have a guilt for 30 years, it's pretty tough,'' Johnson said. ''But the toughest part is over. Now, it's going on with my life and putting together a good ball club for the '99 season. That's the whole goal now. You know, you go out and you spill your guts and it hurts and you've got to get up and go again. We all have a life and we have to go on.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 387-> Charter Plan For Schools Makes Gains
Gov. George E. Pataki's longstanding campaign to establish charter schools -- taxpayer-financed schools run by parents, teachers or community groups -- appeared to gain momentum yesterday, as the Republican Governor narrowed his differences with the leader of the opposition in the Democratic-led State Assembly. The Governor had his first face-to-face meeting in weeks with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the powerful Manhattan Democrat, and they appeared to agree on the framework of a plan but remained separated by several important issues. State and city officials said those issues included whether the Governor would have sole control over the regulation of charter schools or would share it with the State Board of Regents, whether financing would come at the expense of existing public schools or in addition to it, and whether schools could have the option of getting out of their contracts with teachers unions. Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, confirmed that the two men met yesterday, but declined to describe the negotiations, saying details were changing by the hour. ''Speaker Silver has said for the past three years that he is open to the concept of charter schools, as long as there is accountability and oversight,'' Ms. Lynch said. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki said, ''They talked today, they are still looking at the issues.'' For three years, Governor Pataki has been pressing for charter schools, which he champions as a way to force failing public schools to meet the needs of their students better. His bill has been blocked in the Assembly, although he has been supported by a wide range of groups, including conservatives who also support taxpayer-financed vouchers for parochial schools, business leaders concerned about public schools' failure to prepare high school graduates to enter the work force, and black and Hispanic legislators and parents who see charter schools as a way for minority children to escape failing schools in the inner city. Now the clock is ticking, as passage of a charter school bill may determine whether the Governor signs a 38 percent pay raise for legislators passed by both chambers on Dec. 2. Whether the Assembly agrees to a deal on charter schools may measure the force of its desire for a raise. Approval would pit the members against the New York City teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, one of the most potent lobbying groups and largest contributors to candidates in Albany. The union has insisted that any charter school accept its contract terms. The raise, effective Jan. 1, would be the first for the Legislature in a decade. Governor Pataki has threatened to veto it unless the Legislature approves some of his agenda, and charter schools have been one of his top priorities. Some charter school advocates and state officials have said the Governor has linked the raise and school bills. The Governor has until Monday to sign or veto the pay raise bill. If he withholds his approval and neither signs nor vetoes the bill, it will automatically become law. Steven Sanders, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, said yesterday that the Assembly would not pass a charter school bill just to preserve its raises, which would bring the base salary in the Assembly to $79,500, from $57,500. ''If all the Assembly cared about was the pay raise, we would have passed the Governor's or the Senate's charter bill 10 days ago, and we declined to do that,'' Mr. Sanders said. More than 30 states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have passed legislation permitting charter schools, though the schools' number and structure vary from state to state. Some are independent of local districts, others are part of them. Typically, a charter is granted to parents, teachers, community groups and even profit-making corporations to operate a school. These groups can define the mission of a school, take control of budget and hiring, and make decisions without interference from a bureaucracy outside the school. The proposal being negotiated would initially permit 100 charter schools across the state. A variety of agencies would likely be allowed to grant charters, state and city officials said, including the State University of New York, the Board of Regents and local school boards, including the New York City Board of Education in collaboration with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. The Governor's proposal would have allowed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to grant charters, but that provision appears to have been stricken, city and state officials said, in exchange for eliminating the City University of New York as one of the chartering agencies. The Mayor has criticized the CUNY system for lax standards. The Assembly leadership has balked at Governor Pataki's plan to create a commission to regulate charter schools outside the existing education system, which includes local school boards and the State Education Department. The Assembly leadership contends that the proposal for a nine-member commission, with a majority appointed by the Governor, would give far too much authority to the Governor to regulate charter schools and determine which ones survive and which have charters revoked. Assembly Democrats want the State Board of Regents, which now regulates public and private schools, to regulate charter schools as well. An alternative proposal, state and city officials said, would set up a special commission but allow the regents to appoint some members. The Governor has advocated complete freedom from unions, while Mr. Silver has sought to retain the union. One compromise proposal would require public schools that convert to charter status to remain unionized, unless a majority of teachers vote the union out. Under that proposal, new charter schools could choose either course. Teachers' union officials declined comment yesterday. Business leaders said they supported maximum flexibility. ''A charter school must have the freedom to innovate,'' said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. ''This includes the flexibility to make its own choices with respect to collective bargaining.'' Assembly Democrats have also raised concerns that charter schools would siphon badly needed resources from the public system. They have questioned whether it is fair to ask local school boards, which may have played no role in chartering a school, to allot the same state aid and taxpayer levy to charter schools that they assign to their own schools. In addition, they have raised questions about whether charter schools will be obligated to take children with disabilities, and if not, how financing will be adjusted. ''I think people are afraid,'' said Seymour C. Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation, which has helped set up small public schools and advocates charters. ''It's not going to destroy public education. It is public education.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 388-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES; A Mad Bomber? Don't Be Silly, Dahling
BREAKFAST ON PLUTO By Patrick McCabe 202 pages. Harper Flamingo. $22. Patrick McCabe's new novel, ''Breakfast on Pluto,'' short-listed this year for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, reads like a hasty amalgam of his best-selling 1993 novel, ''The Butcher Boy,'' and the 1992 movie ''The Crying Game'' -- a movie directed by Neil Jordan, the same artist, it so happens, who adapted ''The Butcher Boy'' for the screen. As in ''The Crying Game,'' we're treated to the rather unusual premise of a beautiful transvestite looking for love against the backdrop of I.R.A. terrorism. As in ''The Butcher Boy,'' we're given a sympathetic portrait of a perpetual outsider -- a lost, lonely small-town boy who in this case feels as though he is looking at the rest of the world from millions of miles away, from such a distance that he might as well be having ''breakfast on Pluto.'' In fact, if you put Patrick (Pussy) Braden's penchant for cross-dressing aside, he might easily be mistaken for a more innocent, hopeful version of the Butcher Boy Francie Brady. Both have lost their parents: Pussy, the illegitimate son of a priest and a young woman, was left in a Rinso soap box by his mother; Francie's mother threw herself in a lake and his father died of despair and drink. Both are desperate to reclaim a sense of family. Both feel estranged from the small-town folks around them. And both lose themselves in fantasies constructed out of odd pop culture shards: Pussy vamps to Dusty Springfield and old Supremes tunes while Francie lives in a dream world defined by comic books and television shows. Although both young men are portrayed with enormous sympathy, Pussy's story isn't nearly as gripping, as startling or as persuasive as Francie's. This isn't simply because ''Pluto'' lacks the bloody shock revelations of ''The Butcher Boy''; it's because this novel often feels as though the talented Mr. McCabe were simply going through the motions. Whereas Francie spoke to us in a mesmerizing voice -- at once cheeky, nervous and poetic -- Pussy's reminiscences sound strangely stilted: full of flat-footed and repetitious observations, garnished with lots of backward-running sentences and a few campy ''dahlings'' and ''fabs'' thrown in for atmospherics. As for the plot of ''Pluto,'' it's both predictable and contrived. The pages we are reading, we quickly learn, are Pussy's memoirs, written down at the behest of his beloved psychiatrist. Pussy tells us about growing up during the 60's in the small Irish town of Tyreelin. He tells us about dressing up in his step-mother's clothes, hanging out with his friends Charlie and Irwin, and becoming the lover of a local politician. After that politician is murdered -- some say by the I.R.A., some say by the protestant Ulster Defense Association -- Pussy takes off for London. There he starts working as a prostitute near Piccadilly Circus, and shopping at Biba's for glam-rock frocks. He takes a series of lovers, some violent and frightening like Silky, who tries to strangle him; others, doting and possessive like Bertie, who simply wants to live ''in perfect harmony.'' He even carries on a relationship with his landlady, who treats him as her long lost son. In the meantime he continues to obsess about his missing parents, searching the streets of London for his birth mother and muttering dark thoughts about the priest who got her pregnant. Pussy is too busy thinking about his lost family and things like his ''lovely ice-cream pink mohair sweater and gorgeous black pleated miniskirt'' to concern himself with politics, but the Irish Troubles keep intruding upon his life. His childhood friend Irwin, who has become an I.R.A. operative, is arrested, and later murdered by his comrades for informing. His friend Charlie nearly goes mad with grief over Irwin's death. And Pussy himself is arrested as a suspect in a London bombing. As the pressures mount on Pussy, his fantasy life accelerates. He imagines a happy family life with his father and mother. He concocts obscene seduction scenarios starring his parents. He contemplates wearing a bias-cut pink satin crepe evening gown to carry out a bombing. And he fantasizes about becoming ''The Lurex Avenger,'' revisiting his hometown to settle scores. There is nothing terribly compelling or believable about these fantasies. Unlike Francie the Butcher Boy's daydreams, which conveyed his desperate need to escape and remake the world around him, Pussy's imaginings feel like the synthetic extrapolations of a novelist trying in vain to give his hero a palpable inner life. Mr. McCabe's attempts to open out Pussy's story into a parable about the Irish Troubles (and the inevitable intrusion of public events into private lives) also feel forced, recalling his lugubrious efforts in his last novel, ''The Dead School'' (1995), to use the lives of two schoolteachers as a mirror of myriad historical and cultural tensions in Ireland. This time, the confluence of Pussy's dysfunctional personal life and the dysfunctional life of his country produces neither genuine tragedy nor genuine black humor; it simply adds a pretentious gloss to what is ultimately a disappointing novel.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 389-> British Utility Makes Offer For New England Electric
Britain's utility industry made its second big American takeover foray in a week yesterday with a $3.2 billion cash offer for the New England Electric System, a major electricity supplier in Massachusetts. The purchase proposal by the National Grid Group P.L.C., which operates Britain's electric transmission system, reflects the increased opportunities seen by foreign utilities in the United States, where many states are deregulating their utilities and opening them to competition, much in the way the telephone industry was deregulated years ago. British utilities are well positioned to exploit the opportunity because they already have undergone deregulation at home and know the business better than many others. Just a week earlier, Scottish Power agreed to buy Pacificorp, which operates in the Pacific Northwest and is one of this country's biggest power companies, for $7.9 billion. That deal, if completed, would be the first foreign acquisition of a major United States utility. National Grid said that by acquiring one of the seven utilities that serve Massachusetts it was getting ''an excellent regional platform for growth.'' New England states in particular are moving quickly to give customers a choice in choosing their supplier of electricity. Under a deregulation plan adopted by Massachusetts, utilities in the state have moved to spin off their generating plants. These utilities now just transmit and distribute power but do not produce it. Under terms of the agreement, New England Electric shareholders would receive $53.75 in cash for each share they hold. National Grid would also assume $1.4 billion of the company's debt. Shares of New England Electric jumped $5.25, or 12.2 percent, to close at $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. National Grid shares fell 10.75 pence to close at 488 pence, or about $8.25, on the London Stock Exchange. Under deregulation, New England's utility market has already undergone substantial changes. Last week BEC Energy, the parent company of Boston Edison, the utility that serves Boston, said it was merging with Commonwealth Energy System, a neighboring utility. Another foreign-owned company, Sithe Energies Inc., a subsidiary of the giant French utility Vivendi S.A., last May bought 12 power plants from Boston Edison for $657 million. Rick Sergel, the president and chief executive of New England Electric, will retain those titles. He said customers would still get the same service under British ownership. ''The only difference is that we will have the resources of an international leader behind us,'' he said. New England Electric will become a subsidiary of National Grid and its headquarters will remain in Massachusetts. It has four subsidiaries: the Massachusetts Electric Company, the Narragansett Electric Company, the Granite State Electric Company and the the Nantucket Electric Company.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 392-> BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK -- FLORIDA; Renteria Is Traded To Cardinals
The Florida Marlins last night sent shortstop Edgar Renteria to St. Louis for three minor leaguers, leaving them with just four players from their 25-man roster that won the '97 World Series. Renteria ended the '97 Series with a two-out single off Cleveland's Charles Nagy in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7, giving Florida a 3-2 victory. Renteria, 23, hit .282 with 3 home runs and 31 runs batted in, and also stole 41 bases. He fills the hole created July 31 when the Cardinals sent Royce Clayton to Texas. (AP) ATLANTA Second baseman Keith Lockhart, acquired by Atlanta in 1997 from Kansas City, agreed to a $2 million, two-year contract with the Braves. Lockhart, who made $700,000 last season, gets $1 million in each of the next two years and the chance to make $350,000 per season in performance bonuses. Lockhart, 34, hit .261 last season with 8 home runs and 34 runs batted in, playing just 101 games because of a rotator cuff tear and a strained right hamstring. He is expected to be a backup next season to Bret Boone. (AP) PHILADELPHIA The Phillies and pitcher Yorkis Perez agreed on a one-year contract worth at least $475,000, avoiding salary arbitration. Perez earned $260,000 last season, including $35,000 in bonuses. The 31-year-old left-hander was 0-2 with a 3.81 earned run average. He has a career record of 9-13 with 1 save and a 4.59 e.r.a. in 246 games with the Phillies, Mets, Florida and the Chicago Cubs over parts of six major league seasons.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 393-> BOXING; For Underdog in Blue, Boos Are Part of Job
The police officers at the 26th Precinct in Manhattan are giving Richard Frazier a hard time about his bout against Roy Jones Jr. on Jan. 9 in Pensacola, Fla. ''Some of them have hung pictures of Roy up on my locker with captions that say, 'I'm gonna kill 'im,' '' Frazier, a fellow officer, said yesterday. ''Some of them are asking me for my gun belt, saying I won't need it after the fight.'' Some boxing observers would say that Frazier will need his gun, handcuffs and all his fellow officers to wrest the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association light-heavyweight titles from Jones. Still, Frazier is undaunted. ''I'm a cop; it's one of the most hated professions in the world,'' he said. ''I get booed all the time. You could be arresting a triple murderer and people on the street will be booing you, saying: 'Let him go. He hasn't done anything wrong.' I like to be booed, having my back to the wall.'' Frazier and Jones appeared at a news conference yesterday at the HBO offices in Manhattan. The fight will be broadcast on HBO as part of its ''Championship Boxing Series.'' Frazier will earn $350,000, the biggest purse of his career. His ascension is due in large part to the considerable clout of his promoter, Don King. Frazier's path to the top has not been lined with spectacular opponents. The biggest name on his 18-3-1 record is William Guthrie, who stopped Frazier on a sixth-round technical knockout on Nov. 8, 1995, for the United States Boxing Association light-heavyweight title. When not boxing, Frazier walks a beat on 126th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam, not far from where he grew up in the Grant Projects. Being a police officer has not given him much cachet as a boxer. ''I'm a cop, so no one has ever taken me seriously as a boxer,'' Frazier said. ''It's as if you have to be a street bum to be a good boxer.'' On the day the fight was made, Frazier had arrested someone for driving with a suspended license. He had to do tons of paperwork on the arrest before he could sign the boxing contract. As has been the case with his most recent opponents, Jones likes Frazier. ''He's someone you can respect, that your kids can look up to,'' Jones said. ''I'd have no problem telling my kids that I lost to someone like that. But I don't plan to lose.'' Still One No-Show Short Shane Mosley, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, is fighting on the Roy Jones card. Mosley was not at the news conference yesterday, and neither was his scheduled opponent, Justin Rowsell. As it turns out, Rowsell will not make the fight, either. On Saturday night in Australia, Rowsell fought Lovemore Ndou and was knocked out in the sixth round. It seems Ndou was incensed over some racially derogatory remarks he claimed were made by Rowsell's trainer, Jeff Fenech, the former world featherweight champion. Fenech denied making the remarks. On Friday, Rowsell had told Cedric Kushner, his promoter, that he was not going to fight Ndou and jeopardize his world-title shot against Mosley. But pressure mounted in Rowsell's camp for him to go into the ring against Ndou and uphold Fenech's honor. Rowsell called Kushner from a limo on his way to the arena for the Ndou bout and told Kushner that he was going through with the fight. An hour later, Rowsell called back to say he had been knocked out. Golden Johnson has been mentioned as a possible replacement. Whitaker Return Set The welterweight bout between Felix Trinidad and Pernell Whitaker has been signed for Feb. 20. No site has been selected. The bout will be Whitaker's first since he was suspended for testing positive for cocaine at Foxwoods Resort in Connecticut in 1997.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 394-> Whitman Has Appendix Removed, and May Go Home Today
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman underwent surgery late today at Morristown Memorial Hospital for the removal of her appendix after experiencing abdominal pain for the last three days. Dr. John K. Edoga, one of two surgeons who performed the 90-minute procedure, said that the surgery went well and that Mrs. Whitman could expect to be discharged from the hospital on Saturday. She is planning to return to work Monday morning, said her chief spokesman, Pete McDonough. But he said she might scale back her schedule, which includes a Republican Governors Association meeting next week in New Orleans and an awards ceremony on Monday night that is expected to attract anti-abortion protesters. Mrs. Whitman, 52, was vacationing in Florida this week when she first began to experience stomach pains on Wednesday. She returned to New Jersey on Thursday and attended a memorial service for a family friend this morning before going to Morristown Memorial Hospital to meet with Dr. Edoga. Although Mrs. Whitman did have some pain on her right side, where the appendix is located, Dr. Edoga said the physical findings were not convincing, so he arranged for the Governor to have a CAT scan. ''If she were 13 years old and a boy it would have been much easier diagnosis,'' Dr. Edoga said. ''But with women, in particular, there are many more things that you have to consider, and that is why she had a CAT scan at the hospital.'' Mrs. Whitman was admitted to the hospital at noon for the tests. The surgery began at 4:30 P.M. and ended at 6 P.M. The procedure involved making three small incisions in her abdomen to remove the appendix, a sac-like appendage of the large intestine that doctors say has no function. Dr. Edoga said Mrs. Whitman's appendix was inflamed, but it appeared that it had not ruptured. There were no other signs of illness, he said. ''I told her that she could go home in the morning,'' said Dr. Edoga, who performed a similar procedure on the Governor's son, Taylor, two years ago. ''I believe that she will be on her feet shortly. She is very well motivated and the patient's motivation is all important.'' In the last three years, Mrs. Whitman has undergone two other surgical procedures at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. In February, 1996, she underwent an hourlong surgical procedure to repair her right shoulder's rotator cuff. In November 1995, she also underwent surgery to have a benign ovarian cyst removed.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 397-> U.S. Temporarily Suspends Deportations to 4 Countries
As four Central American countries struggle to recover from the catastrophe of Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton Administration plans to make it easier for people from those countries who are already in the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced today that it had suspended the deportation of aliens from El Salvador and Nicaragua ''as a humanitarian response to the catastrophic damage'' caused by the hurricane. On Thursday, the agency made a similar announcement about aliens from Guatemala and Honduras. The temporary suspension of deportations will be in effect until Nov. 23, the agency said, when the situation will be re-evaluated. The temporary change would allow people who are in the United States from those countries, both legally and illegally, to remain here and work without fear of deportation, at least for the time being. Similar privileges have been granted to people from nations torn by violence in Eastern Europe and Africa. Immigration officials were careful to discourage any notion that the hurricane-related change, the details of which are still being worked out, would mean an open invitation to people from those countries to stay in the United States permanently. The goal of the change is to avoid further suffering by forcing people to return to homelands where destruction, poverty and threat of disease await them, the agency said. The most likely vehicle for extending the stays of people who might otherwise face deportation is a provision of law known as ''temporary protected status,'' which allows the Attorney General to determine that foreign nationals can remain in this country because of dangers in their homelands due to conflict or environmental disaster.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 401-> OUTDOORS; Giving a New Generation a Chance to Go Fishing
Incoming swells from the open Atlantic Ocean, green and gin-clear, gently lifted the bow of the 68-foot charter boat Yankee III as it began its first drift of the day for fluke just inside Fire Island Inlet. As it rose and fell, dozens of youngsters, armed with stubby fishing rods and lining the boat's railings, giggled, laughed and screamed. ''I've never been on the ocean before,'' said 12-year-old Edwina Morales of the Bronx. ''This is as much fun as a roller-coaster ride.'' Corinne Concepcion agreed with a giggle and asked, ''Is fishing always such fun?'' If it wasn't for the growing efforts of the Send-A-Kid-Fishing program, the girls probably would never have seen more salt water than the timid waves beating on the sands at Orchard Beach Park on Long Island Sound. On board the Yankee III, along with Edwina and Corinne, were 48 boys and girls from Long Island, Queens and the Bronx, who ranged in age from 10 to 16. A few had fished before. But for all, this was their first experience with edge-of-the-ocean fishing. ''It's a bit bouncy here,'' said Capt. Fred Roberts, 39-year-old skipper of the Yankee III, ''but I wanted to make sure the kids caught fish. It's calmer inside the inlet, but the chances of catching a fluke are better here. The tide's just turned, and with the cleaner, incoming water come the fluke.'' When he isn't sailing out of the Captree State Park Boat Basin on Long Island's South Shore, Roberts works as a firefighter in Long Island City. ''I'm used to handling lots of kids,'' he said as he eased the boat's bow toward a large red buoy. ''I've lots of summer camps, both on the island, as well as upstate, that use the boat as part of their summer activities.'' The Send-A-Kid-Fishing program now has national ramifications, although it began on Long Island about a dozen years ago. A consortium of editors on a weekly fishing magazine, The Fisherman, realized that there was a paucity of young anglers on the beaches, in boats and even at numerous freshwater ponds and lakes that dot Long Island. They developed a readership profile that revealed a population of aging saltwater anglers with few kids entering the sport. Fifteen years ago, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation estimated that there were 1.2 million marine anglers in the state. Three years ago, it had fallen to half that number. One of the primary reasons angler numbers rise and fall, aside from natural human population changes, is the availability of fish. The classic example of this is with striped bass in California. After Hudson River fish were introduced to the San Francisco Bay in 1879, their numbers remained small, but a population explosion began in the 1950's. In 1981, California required a striped bass stamp to catch these fish and closely monitored their sales. Sales rose dramatically over a 10-year period and then declined, a result of illegal commercial harvesting and water redistribution on nursery rivers. Anglers perceived that the fish were no longer there and license sales plummeted. A similar scenario, but on a larger scale, took place in the 1980's in the Northeast. Overharvesting of all sport fishes occurred so that by 1988, the National Marine Fisheries Service declared that every fish species along the Atlantic Coast, and especially the Northeast, was fully exploited or overharvested. The fisheries began a steep decline, which was mirrored by a decline in participating anglers. In the last five years, however, conservation programs initiated by the National Marine Fisheries Service, in cooperation with coastal states, have begun to pay off, and several species are returning to catchable levels. The best example is the fluke fishery. A dozen years ago, it was almost nonexistent in New York State. Even though the fisheries have been rebuilding, however, the number of younger anglers have not. ''We asked ourselves why kids weren't getting into fishing,'' said Fred Golofaro, publisher of The Fisherman. ''We explored what we thought was the competition and found the 'jock' sports were also feeling a loss of new athletes even though they had highly organized programs to get kids into sports. ''Finally, we discovered that the culprit was in our homes. Our kids were becoming either couch potatoes glued to TV sets or they were hooked by PC's and computer games. We were losing a generation of anglers and decided to do something about it. We met with charter- and partyboat skippers, tackle manufacturers, bait and tackle shop owners, fishing station operators and fishing clubs and convinced them they all had a stake in the future and it was the kids. Since then, the program has spread coast-wide.'' The fishing trip on the Yankee III was organized by the magazine's staff and sponsored by the Metropolitan Outdoor Press Association, which donated $600 to send 50 youngsters fishing for one day. To send youngsters fishing on a party- or charter boat for a day costs $12 for each youngster. Participating captains sail from almost all ports in New York and New Jersey. There are similar programs for all three coasts and in fresh water. The $12 covers all costs, including rod, reel bait and tackle. Trips are usually from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 405-> When a Conviction Brings No Closure
She has listened to more than 70 witnesses describe the most minute details of her son's murder. She has stared at the man accused of the crime throughout his three-week trial. And she has heard some of the city's best prosecutors and defense lawyers lay out their explanations of why it happened. But Carol Levin is still haunted by the question of why her son had to die. ''It's totally puzzling to me how somebody could do this to someone who did represent a very unique figure in his life,'' she said, ''someone who cared.'' Two days after a jury found Corey Arthur, 20, guilty of second-degree murder in the slaying of a former teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, Mr. Levin's mother still wrestles with the question of why Mr. Arthur turned on Mr. Levin. In an interview Thursday in her one-bedroom Upper West Side apartment, Ms. Levin said she had hoped that the trial might produce some sense of justice, some knowledge of what her son endured in his final moments. She had also hoped for a token of contrition from Mr. Arthur. But she said she was disappointed on all three counts, and angrily criticized defense lawyers for suggesting that drugs played a role in her son's death. Ms. Levin said crime victims or their families should have the right to protect a victim's reputation during a trial, and defense lawyers should be allowed to pursue theories in court that are not based on fact. ''There is something the matter with the system when all you have to do is put thoughts out there to create problems,'' she said. ''I think defense lawyers can serve their clients without creating fantasies.'' Mr. Arthur's lawyers have defended their conduct, saying that because they had evidence that Mr. Levin had used drugs in the past, they had to raise the issue to provide their client with the high-quality defense that he deserved in a first-degree murder case. But they said they had few answers as to why Mr. Arthur committed the crime. Anthony Ricco, one of Mr. Arthur's lawyers, said Thursday that in the 18 months since the killing, Mr. Arthur had not given his lawyers a consistent account of what occurred that night. Furthermore, Mr. Ricco said, the defense team found no evidence during its 16-month investigation of the murder that the teacher had somehow wronged his former student before the attack. ''Mr. Levin showed an interest in him and I'm sure that Mr. Levin's interest was only to help this kid,'' Mr. Ricco said. ''Corey has never said the relationship turned bad.'' During the two-hour interview, Ms. Levin speculated on the motives, including drug addiction and greed, that could have led Mr. Arthur to kill her son on May 30, 1997, in his Upper West Side apartment. She rejected the suggestion of defense lawyers during the trial that one or two others were involved in the crime. ''I am totally convinced that Corey Arthur's evil was responsible for this,'' she said, ''from the conception of the plan through its execution, both literally and figuratively.'' Ms. Levin, a petite, soft-spoken woman with graying hair who warmly greeted friends, relatives and former students of Mr. Levin who attended the trial, shifted from joyous to angry to bereft while discussing her son's childhood, adult life and murder. She said she planned to follow in his footsteps and become a public school teacher, consummating a goal she nearly pursued 20 years ago, one that Mr. Levin encouraged before his death. She expressed disappointment with Tuesday's verdict in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Jurors acquitted Mr. Arthur of first-degree murder but found him guilty of second-degree murder and two counts of armed robbery. After the verdict, jurors said they had chosen the lesser murder charge because they were not convinced that Mr. Arthur had fired the fatal shot. Mr. Arthur could face 25 years to life in prison. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would have been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Ms. Levin said that while she was frustrated by the verdict, she was not angry with the jurors and respected their decision. Her regret, she said, is that no one person will be held accountable for firing the shot that killed her son. Montoun T. Hart, 26, Mr. Arthur's co-defendant, is scheduled to be tried in January on second-degree murder charges. Prosecutors have said Mr. Hart assisted in the robbery but did not fire the fatal shot. In his first public comments on the case since the verdict, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said yesterday that prosecutors were not aware that their lead witness, Carlethia Weeks, had had any psychiatric problems before she testified. He said prosecutors did not notice any problems before her testimony and did not want to turn Ms. Weeks against them by asking for access to her records. ''When you have a fragile witness, fragile in the sense that they could turn against you, you don't want to antagonize them,'' he said. Ms. Levin said she would concentrate on writing a 10-minute statement to read to Judge Marcy Kahn at Mr. Arthur's sentencing in December. She says summing up her son's life so neatly will be agonizing. The most painful legacy of the murder, she said, is the unanswered question: why. Her son did nothing to harm Mr. Arthur, she said. ''I kept looking at him trying to picture what he did and how he could do it,'' Ms. Levin said.

Pearl Lagoon, called Laguna de Perlas in the western, Spanish-speaking regions of Nicaragua, is on the Atlantic-Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, where most people are of African and indigenous ancestry and speak English. Montclair is in many ways dissimilar to Pearl Lagoon, where there are no paved streets, electric power is on four or five hours a day and fishing in the lagoon is the main means of survival. However, it is the empathy of sharing human ideals and the sharing of common family concerns that have sustained friendships and enriched the lives of people in both communities.

To the Editor: Re ''When a Stay in Intensive Care Unhinges the Mind'' (Dec. 8): I.C.U. psychosis, or delirium, is the most prevalent acute cognitive disorder experienced by older hospitalized patients. Although environmental factors are often implicated, organic factors are often responsible and should be investigated. Despite its widespread prevalence, this condition is often undetected and goes untreated. Recent research demonstrates that many patients who experience this condition show significant cognitive decline at one-year follow-up. It is important that clinicians be aware of the implications of confusion in patients and not assume that symptoms are due to aging. As the population ages, clinicians with geriatrics training will be positioned to prevent the morbid consequences of conditions like I.C.U. psychosis and other equally serious syndromes. DR.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 412-> THEATER REVIEW; On the Stampede of Ism's And Their Lasting Appeal
The spate of revivals of plays from the middle of the century over the last couple of seasons has confirmed the enduring merit of the innovative and imaginative work of playwrights like Camus, Sartre, Beckett and Ionesco. But it has also shown that civilization, as we optimistically call it, is just as absurd as the 20th century draws to a close as it was four or five decades ago. The latest example is a worthwhile staging of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' by the Jean Cocteau Repertory. Written in the 1950's with another generation's fanaticism still in the playwright's mind, ''Rhinoceros'' was first staged in 1960 and made a splash on Broadway a year later with Zero Mostel in the role of Jean, the hero Berenger's best friend, who metamorphoses from a human into a rhinoceros before the audience's eyes. But the play is still a caution against any stampede into a mindless conformity -- be it collectivism, nationalism or fundamentalism -- and modern audiences can choose their favorite -ism with which to draw comparisons. The play quite simply concerns the transformation of a quiet, peaceful town into anarchy when one after another of its citizens is transmuted into a lumbering, thick-skinned brute. Only Berenger, a character in several Ionesco plays and a stand-in for the playwright, holds out against the rush into rhinocerism. First, the townspeople notice a stray rhinoceros rumbling down the street. But no one takes a great deal of notice (''It made a lot of dust.'' ''Stupid quadruped not worth talking about.''), although it does trample one woman's cat. But before long the entire town is joining the herd, and the ethical debates over the rhino way of life versus the human way of life are muted into blind acceptance of the rhino ethic. ''Why not just leave them alone,'' a friend advises Berenger. ''You get used to it.'' Eve Adamson, the estimable director, mines the salient parts of the play with her usual aplomb. But if parts of the Cocteau staging seem to move slowly, the playwright must take his share of blame. Ionesco was a master of the extended one-act like ''The Chairs'' and ''The Lesson,'' but as he turned to full-length plays some of the dialogue began to sound forced and unnecessarily padded. A wonderfully comic little scene in which a logician sets about proving Socrates was a cat works well but goes on far too long, as does much of the debate over whether it is the one-horned rhino or the two-horned rhino that comes from Africa. Repetitions diminish some of the humor and have the effect of underlining the message. Two Cocteau veterans take on the key roles of Berenger and Jean. Harris Berlinsky delivers an understated yet credible reading of the one-man resistance movement, and Craig Smith is ferocious as Jean, his friend who changes into the rhino. Tracey Atkins, Christopher Black and Patrick Hall all offer good turns in supporting roles. Christopher Martin's sound design convincingly simulates a herd of rhinos in the Cocteau lobby. RHINOCEROS By Eugene Ionesco; translated by Derek Prouse; direction and lighting by Eve Adamson; set by Robert Joel Schwartz; costumes by Margaret A. McKowen; sound by Christopher Martin. Presented by the Jean Cocteau Repertory, Scott Shattuck, producing artistic director; Robert Hupp, artistic director. At the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, East Village.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 413-> OUT OF ORDER; Inns, Ambiance and a Cat in Bed
THE romance of travel is not what it used to be. The roads are crowded, the airlines are horrible and most hotels and motels are about as romantic as filing cabinets. But you can still enjoy an authentic 19th-century travel experience by checking into one of those picturesque country inns that dot the landscape from the Hamptons to Maine. The illustrated country inn guide books are irresistible. Every house looks unique, a veritable paradise for the discerning traveler. However, you can read all the books without ever grasping what it will really be like. So here, based on extensive personal research and many sleepless nights, are the essential elements of the country inn experience. If you don't get these, ask for your money back. First, the inn must be in an old and possibly dilapidated house, built somewhere between 1820 and 1920. If it looks like a place waiting to be fixed up by the Addams family, its authenticity is guaranteed. The antiquity of the inn is also certified by having creaky wood floors throughout, especially right above your head. The house has a long and tedious history, which is reproduced on wall signs and in a booklet in your room. Portraits of past owners grace the walls. It's all designed to make the guests feel that they are living in the past, as indeed they are. The history of the inn may be delivered live by your hospitable hosts, who are an essential part of this romantic experience. An inn, unlike a motel, does not allow you to check in and sneak furtively to your room, avoiding all further human contact. You have to join the family. Your hospitable hosts are named and lovingly described in the guide books -- usually ex-corporate lawyers, artists or musicians. Some of them live up to their advertising and take over your lives from the moment you step through their door. Others were obviously trained at the Motel Six school of innkeeping and try to ignore their guests altogether. An inn always has an ambiance. If you don't have ambiance at home, this can be alarming at first. The innkeepers may have a llama park, or 16 cats who will expect to share your bed. They almost always have an eccentric collection of teapots, stuffed animals, prints or clockwork toys, which you will be invited to admire, and bizarre craft objects, lovingly constructed from recycled materials by unemployed local artists, which you will be invited to buy. Be prepared for a theme. There are Scottish-themed inns with tartan wallpaper and haggis for breakfast, ecologically correct inns with botanical art and healthy food, and jolly fishermen's inns swathed in nets and lobster pots, with brass binnacles and a jolly host directly descended from Captain Hook. Your boutique room will have its own special name and theme: Shangri La, the Mozart Room, the Shaker Room and so on. If you hope to get any breakfast, don't forget to admire the designer sheets, the floral wallpapers and Colonial-style hand-stencilled decorations. Meals are the high point of your stay, especially breakfast with its compulsory home-baked breads and strange dishes like egg and artichoke casseroles that never appear on the menu at Holiday Inn. Meals are often a collective experience, with the guests seated around a large table and expected to make edifying conversation. If you are in the Federal Witness Protection Program, or simply shy, a country inn is not the ideal place to spend your vacation. At all times, guests must move slowly and carefully through the house, for fear of destroying some part of the ambiance. This is why young children and dogs are often barred from the premises. The furniture is nothing like the industrial strength, terrorist-proof stuff you find in motels. Everything is an antique, and every antique is one dab of Superglue away from total collapse. The safest thing is to stand very quietly in the middle of the room, waiting until it's time to go to bed. The bed is the piece de resistance. If you always boasted you could sleep anywhere, here's a test for you. The temperature is 90 degrees (no wimpish air-conditioning in your boutique room), the bed was slept in by George Washington and hasn't had a new mattress since, one of the innkeeper's cats is sitting on your face, and the bed lets out an agonized creak every time you move a muscle. When you hear an old brass bed being put through its paces, it's hard to imagine how our ancestors had the courage to reproduce at all. Apart from air-conditioning, sleep and anonymity, you may miss a few other modern conveniences in your country inn. Innkeepers do not believe that you should keep in touch with the world. They think that your visit should be an occasion for relaxation, reflection and escape from the stresses of modern life. This is why television is not not included in the inn experience, although a small library is provided. Room phones are rare, and modem outlets unknown. You can beat the innkeeper's arcane prejudices by bringing your own cell phone, portable TV, laptop computer and satellite Internet connection. But why vacation in the present when it's so much more romantic to vacation in the past?

Aug. 23, 1998-> 414-> Our Towns; Sure Things: Taxes, Nimby And Waving
A LATE-SUMMER breather to catch up on a few stories in Our Towns: There are Nimby movements and there are Nimby movements. When New Horizons in Autism Inc. of Cranbury, N.J., tried to buy a house in Englishtown as a group home for five autistic teen-agers, it encountered the Godzilla of Nimbys on a street called Hospitality Way. The group home will open in November, but not in their backyard, or even their town. Michele Goodman, the executive director of New Horizons, won't say where. This is to protect her clients, and the owner of the house her group is buying, from the hysteria that overcame Hospitality Way. What happened, as noted here in April and May, is that a group of neighbors on Hospitality Way decided that five developmentally disabled teen-agers, monitored 24 hours a day, would be a threat to their children and property values. They offered New Horizons $10,000 to look elsewhere, then challenged New Horizons' bid on the house because it was higher than the market value, a no-no for organizations receiving state funding. Then the neighbors pooled their money, formed a corporation and outbid New Horizons for the house. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is helping New Horizons by challenging both the assessor who decided that New Horizons' bid was above market value and -- on grounds of discrimination -- the people on Hospitality Way who blocked the sale. Still, Nimbys could prevail in their battle against group homes. A bill before the House Judiciary Committee sponsored by Brian Bilbray, a California Republican, would weaken the Fair Housing Act for the mentally disabled by allowing state and local governments to decide where group homes could be located. At least one local New Jersey legislator, Gerald Zecker, a Republican Assemblyman from Clifton, has been lobbying for the bill on behalf of his constituents who don't want group homes where they live. The news is not all bad for a couple who moved to the Catskills in Delaware County to build their dream house, only to find themselves caught between two towns -- both claiming that the house fell within their boundaries. For two years, Elinor Burkett and Dennis Gaboury were getting two property tax bills for their lovely house -- one from the town of Stamford and one from Roxbury. All evidence, including a tax map, placed the house in Stamford, and recently a local court told Roxbury officials to stop their pursuit of the property taxes. Delaware County then canceled the Roxbury portion of the couple's tax bills. Still, this tangle isn't over. Roxbury, which has already spent $50,000 pursuing the Burkett-Gaboury $4,000-a-year tax bill, is filing a lawsuit challenging the county tax map. This could set a precedent that would throw longstanding tax maps all over New York State into question. Meanwhile, Ms. Burkett and Mr. Gaboury, who have kept a sense of humor about this, are in the process of filing a $225 million Federal civil rights suit against Roxbury and Roxbury officials. There is better news for a former day laborer, Jose Martinez, and CLIP, the lawn-mowing co-op he has helped to operate out of the Workplace Project, a workers' rights group in Hempstead. After hearing about the struggling co-op, a kind soul donated nearly $3,000 so CLIP could buy one of the high-powered mowers that its competitors in the landscaping business use. CLIP is plowing ahead, gathering new clients and putting in long hours. Finally, no-news-is-good-news news: Joe Cerce is still waving in Totowa, N.J. In March, when Our Towns first visited Mr. Cerce, the 80-year-old retired factory worker was starting his warm-weather routine of sitting in front of his house, waving at cars. A spot check Saturday morning found him right there. He was under a blue and white beach umbrella, wearing a blue Passaic County Sheriff's Department T-shirt and a red baseball cap. ''Hi, hi, hi,'' he said as cars passed. Same as always. These days, when news is almost too much to bear, not even counting the Sunday-morning interview shows, Joe Cerce in his chair, waving, looks awfully reassuring. ''Oh, yeah, I'm still here,'' he said, watching a line of cars pass. ''Hi, hi, hi, hi.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 416-> Children and Violent Video Games: A Warning
It's almost Christmas. Do you know what your children are playing? Might they perhaps be ripping out the spines of their enemies, perpetrating massacres of marching bands and splatting their screens with sprays and spurts of pixelated blood? Such hair-raising queries have become as seasonal a ritual as gift-giving. Each year since 1995, as parents have bought more and more computer and video games for their children, a posse of two United States Senators and a media-watch group has issued a report card meant in part to warn of certain games' violent content. This year, the report card issuers focused on a small group of ultra-violent games they said would be better termed ''kill-for-fun murder simulations'' than games. They cited evidence that such thrill-killing was being marketed to children, who can gain access to the games in poorly policed stores or on the Internet, and warned of their ''antisocial'' and ''perverse'' bent. They did not list the ultra-violent games, but one of the Senators, Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, particularly complained about advertisements for the games Point Blank, Die by the Sword and Cardinal Syn. For the last four years, ''whack-and-hack'' players have responded pretty much like Sylvainson Gelin, an 11-year-old aficionado of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil, when caught between plays at an arcade in Somerville, Mass., this week. Politicians who condemn violent games, he said, ''should try it out themselves.'' ''If they try it out, they'll see why we like it so much,'' Sylvainson said. ''It's fun.'' Game makers, for their part, have often reacted to the report card much like Jamey Harvey, the chief executive officer of Digital Addiction, a game company: ''We tend to ignore all that hype,'' he said. Mr. Harvey compared the political hubbub around video games to the outcry from some Senators in the 1950's ''screaming about how rock-and-roll was going to destroy the country.'' But one difference is that the technology of video games is exploding, and every year brings new questions and issues, even as the game market expands wildly. It is expected to amount to about $6 billion in retail sales this year, almost rivaling movie box-office receipts, and has been growing at a rate of more than 30 percent annually, according to the Interactive Digital Software Association, the industry's trade group. Games obtained on line often do not get parental scrutiny, so this year, the watchdogs set their sights on the Internet. The report card issuers -- who, in addition to Mr. Lieberman, include Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, and the National Institute on Media and the Family, based in Minneapolis -- acknowledge that the rating system established for video games in 1994, run by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, is working very well. Virtually all games sold in stores carry ratings that range from EC for early childhood to M for mature (over 17) and AO for adults only; and parents in doubt about a game can call the ratings board's toll-free number -- (800) 771-3772 -- or go to its Web site, at www.esrb.org. But increasingly, young players can download demos and sometimes entire games on line, often without a credit card, and the vast majority of those cyberversions are not rated. The rise in on-line games, said David Walsh, a psychologist and president of the National Institute on Media and the Family, prompted the report card writers to call parents' attention to the need to monitor their children's Internet play. ''The knowledge gap between parents and kids in this whole realm of media is an enormous knowledge gap,'' Dr. Walsh said. The report card cited its own survey of more than 500 parents, which found that fewer than 5 percent of them had ever heard of Duke Nukem, a violent game rated M, while 80 percent of junior high students said they were familiar with it. Video game supporters say that parents should indeed pay better attention. But the Interactive Digital Software Association says that surveys show that 9 of 10 buyers of games are adults, and that adults are the main players of M-rated games as well. Over all, 7 of 10 players of computer games and 6 of 10 players of video games on special consoles are over 18, the association says. Ultimately, said Douglas Lowenstein, the association's president, rather than ''spanking the industry'' each year, the issuers of the report card would do better to ''use their bully pulpit to deliver a message to parents, saying, do not buy games without looking into these ratings.'' The report card also warned of what seemed to be a growing tendency by some makers of violent games to market to youngsters, from Duke Nukem action figures in toy stores to the rebellious advertisements in video game magazines popular among young boys. Indeed, some of the advertisements do get graphic: ''As easy as killing babies with axes,'' was one slogan quoted by the report card, along with ''More fun than shooting your neighbor's cat'' and ''Happiness is a warm cranium,'' accompanied by a picture of a severed head. If adults out buying games recently at the Best Buy store in Cambridge, Mass., were any indication, some do worry about the games' content, and stick to sports or scholastic games for their children. ''Most of the games that you see, like this right here, this is outrageous,'' said Harvey Lemay of Malden, Mass., gesturing toward a shelf of violent games. ''This is teaching kids to go out and fight in school, and get a bad attitude.'' But others are not worried. John Sedleski, 44, a computer technician, said he let his 13-year-old son, James, start playing video games as soon as he could handle a control pad, and introduced him to Mortal Kombat when he was 7. ''I ignored what it said on it -- PC 13 or whatever it said on it,'' he said. ''I laid the rules down to him a long time before that: that this is pretend -- it's not real life. He buys that. ''My son doesn't get himself into trouble at school,'' Mr. Sedleski said. ''He doesn't get in any trouble with the law; and he's a real nice, polite kid, no matter who talks to him. It all depends on how you bring your children up. It has nothing to do with how violent the game is.'' That point is the subject of jousting as lively as in any fantasy fight, because, as both sides acknowledge, no research has shown conclusively that playing violent on-screen games produces violent real-life kids. The National Institute on Media and the Family and others argue that extrapolating from studies of violent television, and positing that interactive play provides an even more intense experience, points to a real danger. The Interactive Digital Software Association and others counter that children distinguish clearly between reality and fantasy, and that studies have shown that it is real-life clashes and problems at home that induce youth violence. A sampling of preteens interviewed at the arcade in Somerville showed that most fell into the latter camp. Jean Syllien, 11, of Cambridge, said: ''It's just watching TV and playing. It's not real life.'' And 8-year-old Richard McCoy of Malden, Mass., accompanied by his encouraging mother as he shot miscreants with a blue plastic handgun, allowed as how he thought the games might actually be good for him. ''I want to be a cop,'' he said. ''I like to play gun games -- especially when I shoot all the bad guys. I think it's good practice.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 417-> China to Try 2 Dissidents on Thursday but Denies Them Lawyers
The subversion trial of one of the most prominent dissidents trying to promote a new political party in China has suddenly been scheduled for Thursday, family members said today. The trial of the dissident, Qin Yongmin, will take place in Wuhan, in central China, on the same day as the trial of another prominent leader of the suppressed China Democratic Party, Wang Youcai, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Relatives of both men say they have been unable to find legal counsel because security agents have intimidated or detained potential lawyers. ''It's worse than it was a few years ago when Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan were tried,'' said Lu Siqing, director of the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in Hong Kong. Those two famous dissidents were sentenced to long prison terms, then later sent to exile in the United States. ''At least they were able to have their own lawyers,'' Mr. Lu said. In the last two months authorities have cracked down on dozens of democracy advocates who have tried to start the new party and promote discussion of political alternatives. In doing so, the activists cited China's signing of a global convention on civil and political rights, and they were emboldened by China's new friendship with the United States. But the Communist Party maintains an iron grip on political activity in China. Through arrests and other actions, the authorities have made clear that the leadership's constant talk of ''political reform'' and ''rule of law'' does not mean that competing political groups will be allowed. Mr. Qin, 44, and Mr. Wang, 32, are among a small number of leaders who have apparently been singled out for serious criminal charges. Both are charged with ''inciting subversion of the state.'' Mr. Wang is also charged with colluding with foreign enemies of the state -- dissidents abroad -- which makes the case more serious. Depending on the court's determination of the gravity of the offenses, the men could be sentenced to five years or more in prison. A third longtime dissident who has promoted the new party, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, is also being held for trial but has not yet been formally charged. In Hangzhou still another democracy advocate, who lives in Spain but was arrested in China, was charged on Sunday with financially aiding activities that endanger state security and with illegal entry into the country, reported the Hong Kong-based information center, which maintains contact with dissidents throughout China. The democracy advocate, Wang Ce, 50, who began study in the United States in 1984 and holds a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Hawaii, is chairman of the Alliance for a Democratic China - Chinese Liberal Democratic Party, an association of dissidents living abroad. He recently lived in Spain but retains Chinese citizenship. Repeatedly denied entry to China, Wang Ce sneaked in from Macao. He was arrested on Nov. 2 while meeting with Wang Youcai in Hangzhou and now will be brought to trial. His alleged offer of money to help Wang Youcai buy a computer is part of the legal case against both men. Many other people who have been associated with the new party or have spoken out in defense of the arrested leaders have been detained for hours or days in recent weeks.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 418-> Angolan Rebels Still Break Diamond Embargo, Rights Group Says
The sale of diamonds is still underwriting the war by Angolan rebels, and a United Nations embargo aimed at cutting off that income is not working, a report said today. The report, by a human rights organization in London, Global Witness, says the blame for the continued rebel traffic in Angolan diamonds is widespread. It says De Beers, the South African company, and its Central Selling Organization in London, the cartel that controls the world prices of uncut diamonds, lack the controls to make sure that the company is not buying diamonds from rebel-held territories. Furthermore, the United Nations has not made sure that its members are rigorously honoring the Security Council embargo imposed in July. Uncut Angolan diamonds make their way to Belgium, Britain, Israel, South Africa, the United States and other countries, the report said. The rebels, known as Unita, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, have earned $3.7 billion from diamonds since 1992, experts estimate. For much of that time they controlled virtually all diamond-producing areas in Angola, where some of the world's finest gems are dug from river banks. The report found that the failure of the embargo has let Unita ''restock munitions and supplies,'' which has ''fatally undermined the peace process.'' More than 500,000 Angolans have died in the civil war, which began in 1975. ''There is an urgent need for the diamond business to fundamentally change the way in which it works, because it is clearly unacceptable for diamonds to be used as a major source of revenue in conflict,'' said a director of Global Witness, Charmain Gooch. ''How many people, when buying a diamond for their loved one, have any idea of the horrific price that Angolans have had to pay?'' De Beers representatives said today that they did honor the embargo. Any diamonds offered to their buyers in Belgium or Africa ''that are obviously of Angolan origin and don't have a certificate from the Angolan Government'' are refused, a spokesman said, even if they have certificates that say they are from countries like Zambia or Congo. Determining the origins of diamonds is difficult. A skilled buyer shown many uncut stones from one area can make an educated guess about the area of origin by the mixture of shape, color and quality. With a single stone or a mixed bunch that is impossible. Chemical analysis is theoretically possible. But it is expensive and would require drilling holes in each stone. Even if De Beers refuses stones, Unita will easily find other buyers, a spokesman said. The Government and the rebels signed a peace treaty in 1994. But disarming the soldiers and creating a coalition Government has gone slowly, and fighting has resumed in many regions. The fighting has been particularly fierce early this month, as the Government attacked two Unita strongholds and met unexpectedly tough resistance. One diplomat here said that the rebels had launched counterattacks in the area and that today they shot down a Government plane that was delivering food and ammunition. Government officials acknowledged the latest round of fighting for the first time this weekend.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 420-> ARTS ABROAD; A Novelist Sees Dishonor in an Honor From the State
Turkey's most prominent young novelist, Orhan Pamuk, has turned down the coveted title of ''state artist'' awarded to him this month. He said that if he accepted it, he could not ''look in the face of people I care about.'' Mr. Pamuk is one of 85 writers, actors, singers and other cultural figures who were chosen for the honor by President Suleyman Demirel. Several declined, saying they disapproved of the selection process or did not want to be associated with some others on the list. But Mr. Pamuk was the only one who said he was doing so for political reasons. ''For years I have been criticizing this society for its approach to the Kurdish problem, for its failure to move toward real democracy, for its violations of human rights and banning of books,'' Mr. Pamuk said in an interview. ''Intellectuals, pro-Kurdish writers and even fundamentalists are in jail for writing books or articles. I thought this was a good time to separate myself from this happy public, which lacks a sense of self-criticism and immerses itself in crazy nationalism.'' Mr. Pamuk, 46, spoke on the eve of publication of his latest book, which is expected to be a best seller here. The first printing of 50,000 copies, the largest ever for a Turkish novel, is being shipped to bookstores. He said he did not expect his refusal of the prize to hurt his standing here. ''I say no, and they respect that, even in the popular newspapers,'' he said. ''In a sense, they even like it. The only thing that upsets them is that I talk to foreign journalists who, in their words, 'distort our reality.' '' ''There is a moral issue here,'' he said. ''This state does not have clean hands. If you accepted a prize from the White House during the Vietnam War, that would of course have political implications. This is a similar situation.'' The title of state artist has been awarded sparingly in the past. Only 64 people have received it over the last quarter-century. The sudden announcement of such a large group of recipients this year may have been tied to President Demirel's desire to broaden his popularity as elections approach. In recent days, many newspapers and television stations have presented interviews with Mr. Pamuk. They concentrated on his new book, but he is regularly asked about his decision to reject President Demirel's award. His frank comments, often including the names of Turks he believes are unjustly imprisoned, have brought the issues of free speech and democratic rights to a broad audience. Many of the artists Mr. Demirel chose to honor are pop singers and others whose mass appeal exceeds their intellectual contributions. But several serious artists, including some who are strongly critical of Turkish society, were also included and have decided to accept. Their decisions reflect the conflicts that artists in many countries face when deciding how to deal with governments of which they do not fully approve. ''I have always been at odds with the Turkish state,'' said one of the winners, Ali Poyrazoglu, an actor and director known for his unconventional life style and political views. ''I've been banned, I've been beaten up and I've suffered at the hands of this state. Now, for the first time, the state extends a friendly hand to me. I'm certainly going to shake that hand.'' ''Those who refuse the prize are not showing any real or radical rebellion,'' said Mr. Poyrazoglu, who recently appeared in the New York production of the play ''Pera Palas.'' ''States are the same all over the world. They are oppressive by their nature, and artists are always opposed to this. So why do people who jump to take prizes from a country like Germany say no to the Turkish one?'' Although the state artist title carries considerable prestige, it has no monetary value except to artists who are already employed by the state. They normally receive salary increases upon winning. Mr. Pamuk, 46, is one of two Turkish novelists whose works have been widely translated and have won worldwide acclaim. The other, Yasar Kemal, an outspoken advocate of the Kurdish cause whose works depict the exploitation of peasants at the hands of brutal landowners, was named a state artist several years ago and also refused the honor. Turkey's military has been struggling for 14 years to crush a separatist rebellion by Kurds in the southeastern region of the country. In an interview in his book-lined study overlooking the Bosporus, Mr. Pamuk said he hoped the controversy over his refusal of the prize would not overshadow the appearance of his new book, ''Call Me Crimson.'' It tells the story of a 16th-century widow who searches for a new husband among the miniaturists and illuminators of the Ottoman court. An English translation is to be published by Knopf next year. ''The book is going to very much talked about,'' Mr. Pamuk said. ''And I don't want that discussion to be damaged or limited in any way by this really tasteless debate.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 422-> U.S. Puts Trade Curbs on India and Pakistan
The United States imposed trade restrictions on more than 300 Indian and Pakistani Government agencies and private companies today as a result of the two countries' nuclear tests last May, Commerce Department officials said. The sanctions affect Indian and Pakistani companies believed to be involved in nuclear, missile and military programs. They will, in most cases, bar American companies from trading with them. Commerce Department licenses will be required for any American company wishing to export goods to the companies, and most of those licenses will be denied, officials said. The White House announced last week that President Clinton would lift most of the sanctions that were imposed after the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. This would allow American loans, investments and some joint military training to resume. It would also revive American support for an International Monetary Fund bailout for Pakistan.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 424-> Change in Laws Sets Off Big Wave of Deportations
In the two years since Congress passed tough laws to stem the flow of illegal immigration to the United States, Federal authorities have deported almost 300,000 immigrants to countries all over the world, more than twice the number who were sent back in the two years before. The unprecedented number of deportations has been possible because for the first time the Immigration and Naturalization Service has both the Congressional mandate and the money to investigate and prosecute violators of immigration law, arrest immigrants with criminal convictions and would-be immigrants at the border and swiftly deport them from the United States -- sometimes in less than 12 hours. Many of the immigrants who are deported are barred from returning to the country for five years or more. Some are barred for life. ''The rules have changed,'' said Kerry Bretz, a Manhattan immigration lawyer and former I.N.S. prosecutor. ''The agency has become completely enforcement-minded.'' Flush with almost a billion dollars earmarked for the detention and deportation of immigrants, the I.N.S. is now the largest Federal law enforcement agency, the Justice Department says. The immigration service has more than 15,000 officers authorized to carry weapons and make arrests, more than the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Prisons, the Customs Service or the Drug Enforcement Administration. ''It is as if, suddenly, war had been declared on immigrants,'' said Maria Jimenez, director of the Immigration Law Enforcement Monitoring Project of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit organization in Houston that documents abuses on the United States-Mexico border. ''Stopping immigrants from entering the country has become more important than the war against drugs.'' Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee and one of the architects of the law, said the number of deportations demonstrated that the law was working, though not yet to his satisfaction. The I.N.S., he said, is deporting only a small percentage of those who should be deported. ''The goal is to make sure as many illegal aliens as possible return home,'' he said. Before the law was changed, most of those deported had been convicted of crimes. Now, the majority do not have criminal records but are caught at the southwest border trying to enter the country with no documents or with fake documents. But about 78,000 illegal immigrants who were already living in the country were also deported in the last two years. They were arrested during job raids, at routine traffic stops, at airports while returning from abroad and even at immigration offices, where immigrants often go to seek services and sometimes end up under arrest. Many had lived here for years, working, paying taxes, studying and establishing families. Their deportation often causes a great deal of emotional pain and financial distress to the families left behind. The family of Fernando Giraldo, one of the people deported last year, is still trying to get him back to New York City, where he lived and worked for almost a decade. Mr. Giraldo, a 36-year-old amateur poet from Colombia, sneaked into the United States through the southwest border a decade ago. The authorities detained him at the airport in El Paso, Tex., as he was about to board a plane. An immigration judge ordered him to leave the country in 30 days and released him on bond. But Mr. Giraldo ignored the judge's decision and flew to New York to join his family in Brooklyn. For nine years, he went undetected by the authorities. He worked as a maintenance supervisor in a Manhattan hotel and led what he calls ''a normal, happy life.'' His luck ran out one morning in the summer of 1997. Mr. Giraldo had gone to the downtown Manhattan immigration office for a scheduled interview with an immigration officer, one of the steps in his quest for permanent residency. He said he was sure the meeting would conclude with a handshake and a stamp on his Colombian passport, making him a legal resident of the United States. Instead, Mr. Giraldo was arrested, handcuffed and sent to a detention center in Jamaica, Queens. Less than 48 hours later, he was on a plane to Bogota. He is now barred from trying to enter the United States for 10 years and, even then, his return is not guaranteed. ''I never even finished breakfast,'' Mr. Giraldo said from his home in Pereira, Colombia. ''I had told my mother that we would have coffee when I returned from the interview and I just never did.'' With Mr. Giraldo's deportation, his mother, Maria Judith Valencia, 63, and his sister, Maritza Giraldo, 22, both permanent residents of the United States, were left to fend for themselves. Ms. Valencia, who suffers from muscle spasms in her eyelids and cannot keep her eyes open without medication, started making pastries at home and selling them. Ms. Giraldo, a senior studying marketing at Baruch College, had to leave school to find a job. Goal for Deportations Is Set, and Exceeded Last year, the year Mr. Giraldo was deported, the immigration agency set a deportation goal for the first time -- and surpassed it: 114,285 people were deported in the Federal fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1997; the goal was 93,000. In fiscal 1998, when $748 million, a record, was budgeted solely for the detention and deportation of undesirable immigrants, 169,072 people were deported. The goal was 127,300. The money has allowed the agency to triple the number of beds available in detention centers and local jails around the country and increase personnel by 80 percent. The added beds and staff are crucial because the agency must detain immigrants before deporting them. The increase in funds has also allowed immigration officials to conduct more investigations than it had in the past. Now, the agency can routinely conduct job raids and check on anonymous tips from, say, people who notice a sudden influx of immigrants in their neighborhood. They also have the resources to identify a particular problem in a specific state and try to combat it through deportation. Just two months ago, I.N.S. agents rounded up more than 500 legal immigrants in Texas who had at least three drunken-driving convictions. Their detention is the first step in a process that could culminate in their deportation. Immigration officials in Washington said no other state had followed Texas' lead, but, by law, they could. ''We apprehend and take into custody more people than any other agency in the world,'' said Russell A. Bergeron Jr., an I.N.S. spokesman in Washington. The law got tougher for immigrants who had not yet become citizens in 1996, when Congress passed the Illegal Immigration and Reform Responsibility Act. Proponents of the measure argued that illegal immigration was overtaxing public services and potentially taking jobs away from citizens. The act granted the agency wide powers previously afforded only to the courts. Through a process called expedited removal, for example, the law now allows immigration officials to quickly deport illegal immigrants who show up at airports and at the border. Immigration officials, not judges, determine which of them can be deported and, therefore, barred from the United States for at least five years. The decision can be made in a matter of hours and without a lawyer representing the immigrant. Before the law changed, immigration officials at the border used to simply send illegal immigrants back without formally deporting them. Undaunted, immigrants tried again and many eventually succeeded at entering the country undetected. Now, any immigrant caught trying to enter the country after having been formally deported can be prosecuted and sentenced to prison. Making More Crimes Grounds to Deport The law also expanded the definition of a deportable crime and directed the immigration agency to deport immigrants convicted of crimes even if they were legal residents of the United States. While the agency has always been required to deport murderers and rapists, now people who have forged checks or committed minor sex offenses, like touching a woman inappropriately, are also being deported. In addition, the law took away the power of judges to consider mitigating factors. In the past, many immigrants who had committed crimes were freed after completing their sentences because there was no place to detain them pending deportation. Now, the law requires -- and the increase in detention beds allows -- such immigrants to remain behind bars while awaiting deportation. More than 106,000 immigrants with criminal convictions were deported in 1998, a 52 percent increase over the previous two years. Immigration officials say it is too early to know if the high number of deportations is having the intended effect: to send a clear message to would-be immigrants that coming to the country illegally is punishable. ''After so many years of the laws being ineffectual, it is going to take a long time to restore the credibility of the immigration laws,'' Mr. Bergeron said. ''You are not going to have an overnight shift on the way people think.'' Lawyers and advocates for immigrants, though, say the laws have begun to affect the lives of their clients. Detention and deportation of people already living in the United States legally or illegally has become so pervasive that many of these immigrants -- who, unlike those caught at airports or at the border, have the right to hearings and appeals -- are giving up on the legal process and leaving the country on their own. By doing that -- in essence, deporting themselves -- they may avoid both a formal Federal deportation order and a long stay at a detention center while their cases wind through the courts. Those who are not criminals can also avoid being barred from re-entering the country. ''The law, in practical terms, deprives them of due process,'' said Nancy Morawetz, a professor at New York University School of Law. ''Congress passed these laws without paying really close attention to them. And the results are just awful.'' A Law So Broad, Even The I.N.S. Has Doubts Even immigration officials say the law is too broad. To detain all the convicted criminals who should, under the law, be behind bars, the I.N.S. will have to receive even more funds from Congress, Mr. Bergeron said. Immigration officials have calculated that the agency would need up to 21,000 additional beds and as many as 1,500 additional employees. To cover those costs, the current budget of about $700 million will have to increase by $652 million. ''We've always said the law went too far,'' Mr. Bergeron said. Already, some detention centers are dangerously overcrowded, lawyers for immigrants say. Last month, about 80 detainees at the center on Varick Street in Manhattan protested because they were sleeping on mattresses on the floor in a dormitory meant to house only 42. To avoid such disturbances, Mr. Bergeron said, the agency will have to continue choosing whom to detain and whom to let go. But just how those choices are made is not always obvious to immigrants' relatives. Pam Gaul, whose adopted son, John Gaul, awaits deportation at a jail in north Florida, said she could not understand why the authorities considered him a dangerous criminal worthy of deportation. Mr. Gaul, 25, was convicted of check fraud and of stealing a car four years ago. Because he was born in Thailand and never became a United States citizen, he is what the law calls a ''criminal alien,'' and, thus, deportable. Ms. Gaul, 52, and her former husband adopted John when he was 4 and always thought that, because they were citizens, he would be protected by United States law. He is not, the authorities said. ''He made a mistake, but do we punish him for life?'' asked Ms. Gaul, a respiratory therapist at a Tampa hospital. ''Essentially, for me, they are trying to take away his life and they are ripping our family apart.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 429-> BALLET REVIEW; Socialist Realism in a Land of Dreams
It is one of the paradoxes of ballet history that when the Soviet Union led an isolated cultural existence, it produced landmark productions of the classics that later proved influential in the West. Two of these are Vasily Vainonen's 1934 version of ''The Nutcracker'' and Vladimir Bourmeister's equally celebrated 1953 staging of ''Swan Lake.'' Now, thanks to the United States debut of the Stanislavsky Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet, long the second major ballet troupe in Moscow, both productions are part of the holiday season at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here. Like another landmark, Leonid Lavrovsky's 1944 ''Giselle'' for the Bolshoi Ballet, these are dramatic re-readings of the original versions. To say they had to meet the requirements of the Soviet Government's policy of Socialist Realism would not be amiss. But this pattern should not be imposed too strongly on works that clearly rely on the original 19th-century choreography or new classical choreography. The Bourmeister ''Swan Lake'' is to open tonight and will end with Sunday's matinee. (There is a mixed bill on Friday night and Saturday at 2 P.M.) Two separate casts with striking ballerinas closed the brief ''Nutcracker'' run yesterday. In the afternoon, the young Natalya Krapivina, fresh and exquisite in her form-perfect classical style, portrayed both the child heroine, here called Masha, in Act I and her idealized ballerina image at the end of this scene and in Act II. In the evening, 30-year-old Natalya Ledovskaya, using her glittering ballerina style to strike the right climaxes, danced only the mature Masha. The little girl was portrayed earlier by another adult dancer, Yekaterina Garayeva. In short, the Sugar Plum Fairy was jettisoned in Vainonen's version for the Kirov Ballet in 1934. She was replaced by a child who visualizes herself in that role and grows up in a clearly presented dream. While very different from George Balanchine's version and its ancestor, the 1892 original by Lev Ivanov in Russia (where a child performer was welcomed into a candy kingdom and entertained by dancing foodstuffs), the Vainonen version is not totally unfamiliar. Russian emigre dancers have already showed us Vainonen's main concept. Mikhail Baryshnikov at American Ballet Theater and Rudolf Nureyev at the Royal Ballet incorporated Vainonen's stunning geometric choreography and circular motifs in the Snowflakes Dance. And both used his main idea; namely, a dose of psychological realism to connect two supposedly disparate acts. In Russia itself, critics had long seen a discrepancy between the first and second half. In Act I, the Nutcracker doll and the child heroine defeated the Mouse King, but in Act II the plot line withered away to yield to pure dance divertissements. Somehow, nobody paid attention to the fact that Tchaikovsky's wonderful score was conceived in the style of a French ballet-feerie, a spectacular entertainment. Vainonen aimed for dramatic unity by making Masha the main dancing character and giving her the Sugar Plum pas de deux. Only he substituted a stunning passage in which the ballerina was tossed up by four cavaliers and her prince. The Stanislavsky ballet has omitted the sequence and substituted a more conventional if effective pas de deux, derived from a Bolshoi production, possibly choreographed by Assaf Messerer. But most of Vainonen's choreography has been preserved, including his waltz of the flowers for an ensemble of wigged courtiers who imitate Baroque minuets and then advance in lines with the women hoisted up and down between the men. To say this 1995 staging by Mikhail Krapivin, a company balletmaster, resonates with the grand manner of the Kirov would be untrue. But it works as a production with roots in 1930's psychological realism, not out of place in a company that has its own roots in dramatic ballet. Originally called the Moscow Art Ballet, the core company was founded in 1919 by the ballerina Viktorina Krieger and became part of the Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater in 1933. This dramatic company in turn merged in 1941 with the Stanislavsky Opera Theater. The Ballet Company of the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Dancheko Moscow Music Theater is the troupe's full name. It has been directed since 1985 by the choreographer Dmitri Bryantsev. The ''Nutcracker'' performances here made clear why the company is beloved by Moscow audiences as a cozy foil to the more spectacular Bolshoi. Its dancers, including the character dancers, communicate on a direct human level. Ms. Krapivina, Mr. Krapivin's daughter, had charm as the child Masha, and when she donned her tutu as the ballerina ideal, her forceful technique, beautiful placement and classical style were more than winning. She is a talent to watch. Dmitri Zababurin, as her prince, typified the less-than-taut classical line of company's men. But he had neat finishes in his solo and turns in the air. In the evening, Ms. Ledovskaya showed a loose-hipped fluency and musicality that gave her pas de deux in the snow scene and the Second Act grandeur if not perfect shape. Viktor Dik lost some stamina in his solo and coda as the Prince but his strong presence was felt in the partnering. The passages that are not by Vainonen are somewhat free form, especially in the battle of the mice. And Drosselmeyer is turned into a hired entertainer who looks like Harpo Marx in his top hat and wig, although Anton Domashev is first-class as a performer in this role. We obviously need him to lighten up a deliberately somber production with Hanseatic motifs in the sets by Anna and Anatoly Nezhny, who do better by harking back to the 1892 original with their fir tree decor. Now as then, the children disappear into a Christmas tree. The real bright spots are in the performances. Here one should mention Anna Volkova in three roles: Masha's brother, the Nutcracker doll in battle and the boy in the charming pas de trois, usually danced by children, to the ''Mirlitons'' music.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 430-> Rehearsing Met's 'Figaro'
To the Editor: ''An Imbroglio for 'Figaro,' Its Director and Bartoli'' (Critic's Notebook, Nov. 9) has left an impression concerning the behavior of the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli as capricious and irresponsible during the period of preparations for the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro.'' It also portrayed the Met's management as subservient to her unreasonable demands. On the contrary, not only did Ms. Bartoli arrive on time for rehearsals, but she also proved herself a model of professionalism and dedication throughout the rehearsal period. Moreover, the decision to include rarely heard arias at some performances was made jointly by the Met's artistic director, James Levine, and me in discussion with Ms. Bartoli. We felt that this was an appropriate opportunity for our audiences to hear these arias, which Mozart composed for a revival of ''Figaro'' in 1789.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 431-> Waiting for the N.B.A. With the Body of a Man; Lockout Leaves Pacers' Rookie in Limbo
When Al Harrington drove to Bloomington, Ind., four months ago, he did not know that he was about to be rebuilt. Harrington, the Indiana Pacers' first-round selection in last summer's National Basketball Association draft, thought he was just going to lift some weights, run some sprints and shoot some jumpers. But Joe Abunassar, Harrington's newly hired personal trainer, had other plans. Having worked with many N.B.A. players, Abunassar knew that his client's soft, undeveloped, 18-year-old body would have to be reshaped if he was to stand any chance of surviving the pounding that an N.B.A. forward takes. Now, after months of six-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week workouts that included everything from punching a heavy bag to changing his eating habits, Harrington looks like a bona fide first-round draft pick. The shoulders and arms on his 6-foot-8-inch, 238-pound frame are toned and muscular, his once big and meaty thighs have been trimmed and defined and the baby fat that used to hang around his midsection has been replaced by ripples. ''Al looks like a totally different person from the time I saw him in July,'' Abunassar said. ''Proportionally he looks more like an N.B.A. perimeter guy rather than a high school big man.'' Pro body and all, though, this question remains: Did Harrington make the right decision when he elected to enter the N.B.A. draft directly out of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J.? When the Pacers made Harrington the relatively low 25th pick of the draft -- and not a lottery pick like his successful prep-to-pros predecessors Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant -- it suggested that his mother, Mona Lawton, and high school coach, Kevin Boyle, were correct in advising him to go to college. And seven days later when the lockout was imposed, forbidding Harrington to have contact with the Pacers' coaching staff, many onlookers saw it as even more evidence that he had made a mistake. ''Being a high school kid puts one strike against you already,'' said Keith Van Horn, the Nets' second-year forward who worked extensively with Coach John Calipari and his staff during the summer before his rookie season. ''You're going to struggle enough just because you're coming out of high school. And then not being able to work out with anybody in the league before you start your first game, that's real tough.'' While Harrington was widely regarded as the nation's best high school player a year ago, scouts are hesitant to put him in the same class as Garnett and Bryant, both of whom became N.B.A. All-Stars in their second seasons. Each of those players has abilities or backgrounds that set him apart: Garnett is 7 feet with the skills of a perimeter player, and Bryant, as the son of the former N.B.A. and European league player Joe Bryant, grew up traveling the world and playing against older competition. By all accounts, Harrington is not as physically gifted as Garnett and Bryant. Garnett was a victim on an N.B.A. lockout in the summer of 1995, but he did not miss a training camp. Harrington will be more a project than a prodigy. He jumps well but is not a skywalker. He has great balance and coordination but is not exceptionally quick. His jump shot and ball-handling skills are solid, but as a power forward-center in high school, he has never been a full-time perimeter player. Since he is projected as a small forward for Indiana, the task ahead of him is even more daunting. ''There's a big transition from being a high school guy that steps out and makes two 3-pointers and a pull-up jump shot in a game and people say, 'Hey, the big kid can shoot,' to being a small forward in the N.B.A.,'' said Boyle, whose St. Patrick's team, led by Harrington, won a state title last season. ''Al is a good athlete, but at that level, he's not a great athlete, and he needs to be extremely strong, extremely smart and extremely well conditioned to compete.'' Learning how to run off screens is only one of the many intricacies that experts say Harrington is missing by being locked out from Indiana Coach Larry Bird and his staff. In the summer leagues, minicamps and private workouts that a draft pick normally goes through, he receives the opportunity to adjust to the N.B.A.'s defensive rules, play with the 24-second shot clock, learn plays, play consistently with bigger, stronger, faster players, and get to know the coaching staff as well as adapt to a particular terminology. Because he is getting none of that, Harrington will be behind whenever training camp begins. And since camp will be shortened because of the urgency to start the regular season, coaches will have to put game plans in quickly. If a rookie is slow in picking things up, he will not have an exhibition season to settle in. Harrington is trying to make the best of his situation by playing against as much N.B.A. competition as possible. He has played a week's worth of one-on-one games with Joe Smith, the No. 1 pick in the 1995 draft. He has faced off against Garnett and Shareef Abdur-Rahim in pickup games in Atlanta. He has joined his Pacers teammates Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Antonio Davis and Austin Croshere in informal workouts in Indianapolis. He also scored 14 points in an N.B.A. charity game at Madison Square Garden in September. While Harrington admits he needs to learn more, he is also convinced that he made the right decision. ''N.B.A. players are real smart,'' he said. ''They're sneaky and stuff. They have little tactics for rebounding and defense. It's hard for me to get through screens, but they just slip through screens like it's nothing. But I've definitely been holding my own. Nobody ever kills me. I've got a great opportunity to play. If I come in and everything is clicking, I can see myself getting 30 minutes a game.'' But Hubie Brown, the former N.B.A. coach and veteran analyst, says summer games do not provide an accurate barometer of what a player can or can't do. ''The veteran player is cruising in the summer,'' Brown said. ''So when coaches look at guys in the summertime scoring a lot of points, they never get excited. They just look at it and say, 'Yeah, the kid has potential.' But it tells them nothing else. Because you are not watching him adjust to 20 different offensive sets, the changing defenses, playing unselfishly within a five-man group.'' Harrington said he understood that he was missing out by missing camp, so he had tried to compensate by watching videotapes of Pacers games almost every night and discussing them the next day with Davis, who has allowed Harrington to live with him during the lockout. ''At 18, that's very impressive,'' Davis said. ''You would think that he would just want to go and play and wouldn't care about being a student of the game. But he really wants to know what's going on. He wants to fit in with this team and understand what his role can be.'' Most commentators have considered it a blessing for Harrington that he was drafted by a veteran team that is one of the league's best. They say that the Pacers will teach him about being a professional and that he will get the chance to sit back and learn without being thrust into an important role on the team. But Garnett benefited from going to Minnesota, a weak team at the time, and being able to play nearly 30 minutes a night as a rookie. And Jermaine O'Neal, another high school player in the 1996 draft, was hurt by going to a talented, albeit unprofessional, Portland team. The word throughout the league is that O'Neal can play but, unable to beat out the gifted veterans Brian Grant and Rasheed Wallace, he has become lost. ''Can a high school kid who's used to being stroked adjust to no minutes, no shots, no time, no notoriety?'' Brown said. ''If the person is mature and he's not carrying baggage of an entourage, fine. He'll understand his time is coming. But if you've got an entourage, baggage and you're immature, you go right into the tank.'' Mona Lawton says her son will not have an entourage, and she will make sure of it by moving to Indianapolis to live with him once the season begins. And Harrington said he could handle being a role player with the Pacers, even one who gets little playing time. After all, at Roselle High School, he was the sixth man on the freshman team. It was not until his junior year, after he had transferred to St. Patrick's, when he began to blossom. ''Al's worked hard because he came from the bottom,'' Boyle said. ''He knows what it was like to be a role guy as a sophomore, while a lot of other guys have been the stars since sixth grade.'' Regardless of how well he does as a rookie, Harrington will have the security of knowing that he has time to develop. Under the previous collective bargaining agreement, he would have received a three-year guaranteed contract worth about $2 million. He is very likely to sign a similar deal at the end of the lockout. The two other high school stars who opted this year for the N.B.A. are not so fortunate. As second-round picks, Rashard Lewis, drafted 32d by Seattle, and Korleone Young, drafted 40th by Detroit, will not have guaranteed contracts. ''Unless a high school kid has a guaranteed deal, it's nothing more than a crap shoot,'' Brown said. ''And the odds are against you, just like in a crap shoot.'' For Harrington, at least the gamble is not that big.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 435-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE LAWSUIT; CLINTON TO PAY $850,000 TO SETTLE JONES CLAIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
President Clinton agreed today to pay Paula Corbin Jones $850,000 to drop her legal claim that he crudely propositioned her seven years ago. The payment settles a lawsuit that Mr. Clinton's advisers once mocked but that, by forcing his intimate life into public view, ultimately threatened his hold on the Presidency. To reach the agreement, Ms. Jones abandoned what she had once called her most important demand: that Mr. Clinton apologize and admit wrongdoing. She had wanted him to acknowledge that in 1991, when he was Governor of Arkansas and she a clerk employed by the state, he had her summoned to a Little Rock hotel room and made a lewd advance. Through Robert S. Bennett, his lawyer, the President continued today to call Ms. Jones's accusation baseless. But by settling, he was able to eliminate the risk that an appeals court would prolong the case, which was dismissed in April by a Federal district judge in Little Rock. Mr. Clinton's advisers had feared that Ms. Jones would win her appeal, and that her lawyers would be able to depose the President once again. White House officials also believe that the settlement will help protect the President from impeachment by eliminating a source of possible legal reversals and further embarrassing disclosures about his private life. [Text of the agreement, page A10.] It was in a deposition in the Jones case on Jan. 17 that Mr. Clinton denied a sexual relationship with a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky. Out of the President's efforts to conceal that affair from Ms. Jones's lawyers, Kenneth W. Starr, the independent prosecutor, built a case for possible impeachment on perjury, witness-tampering and obstruction-of-justice charges that the House Judiciary Committee is now considering. ''The President has decided he is not prepared to spend one more hour on this matter,'' Mr. Bennett said in a statement announcing the settlement. But Mr. Clinton's busy schedule aside, even his allies had long viewed the expense to him of not settling the case sooner -- in prestige, political capital and perhaps his place in history -- as incalculable. Even after the settlement was announced today, some Clinton loyalists lamented the for-want-of-a-nail element. One adviser just groaned when asked if he wished the President had settled earlier. Another Clinton associate said that if the case had been settled, ''no one would know who Monica Lewinsky was.'' Ms. Jones cried on receiving the news of the agreement, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a Jones adviser, told reporters gathered outside a Manhattan hotel where her friend was doing a television interview today. ''It's over and I'm glad,'' she quoted Ms. Jones as saying. John Whitehead, one of Ms. Jones's lawyers, said, ''The settlement brings to a conclusion four long years of seeking justice for Paula.'' ''The suit has raised a lot of important issues that the American people and their leaders will have to deal with for years to come,'' Mr. Whitehead added, ''such as the importance of protecting powerless women from workplace harassment and the role of the rule of law in our highest offices.'' The terse eight-point agreement, filed today with Susan Webber Wright, the judge who dismissed the suit in April, calls for Mr. Clinton to pay Ms. Jones within 60 days. The agreement requires Judge Wright's approval, but that seems certain, since she long urged a settlement. As part of today's agreement, Ms. Jones also dropped her claim against Mr. Clinton's co-defendant, Danny Ferguson, an Arkansas state trooper who Ms. Jones said escorted her to the Governor's hotel room. In a separate agreement, which was not made part of the filing, Ms. Jones's lawyers said she renounced any intention to accept money from Abe Hirschfeld, a New York City real estate magnate who had said he would pay her $1 million to settle. White House advisers said they hoped that the $850,000 would be covered by Mr. Clinton's personal insurance policies. But if the two companies that have insured the President decline to pay, the advisers said, the money will come from the President's legal defense fund, which now has a balance of more than $2 million. Ms. Jones has her own financial trouble to resolve. She has had as many as six sets of lawyers, whose bills total nearly $3 million. Yet she is hoping to net $300,000 to $500,000 from the agreement. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is said by associates to be particularly concerned about her family's mounting legal bills, had been worried that a settlement might make too big a dent in the defense fund. But the Clintons' fund-raisers assured her that they could easily replenish any money used toward a Jones settlement. Mrs. Clinton had also been opposed to any settlement that included an apology, aides said, since it would have carried an acknowledgment of conduct that the President denied. The agreement filed today states, ''Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to be an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party.'' But plainly, the settlement can only bolster public sentiment, as demonstrated in opinion polls, that Ms. Jones told the truth. From the moment Ms. Jones first made her accusation against the President, in a televised news conference on Feb. 11, 1994, his advisers dismissed her as a gold digger in league with his conservative enemies. At the same time, but more quietly, his lawyers were trying to settle the lawsuit. Their efforts initially foundered on Ms. Jones's demand for an apology; Mr. Clinton said he had nothing to apologize for. Over time, Ms. Jones expanded her legal claims, arguing that Mr. Clinton had harassed her, caused her emotional distress and damaged her career. But in April, Judge Wright found that the plaintiff had offered no ''tangible'' evidence of damage and dismissed the case, saying it presented ''no genuine issues.'' The ground shifted dramatically when Mr. Clinton admitted on Aug. 17, in grand jury testimony and in a brief televised address to the nation, that he had had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Jones's advisers said she no longer required an apology, since, they said, most people would now believe her. Further, Mr. Clinton's advisers now had more reason to settle. They worried that the President's admission about Ms. Lewinsky might strengthen Ms. Jones's appeal. And with impeachment proceedings pending, they believed that taking the Jones lawsuit off the table would help reassure Congressional Democrats that there would be no further nasty disclosures or legal reversals for the President. That would increase the Democrats' confidence in defending him. Several weeks ago, Mr. Bennett reopened settlement talks, offering $700,000. The Jones lawyers countered with a request for $1 million, and the two sides started haggling, slowly. They seemed tantalizingly close when the offer last month from Mr. Hirschfeld, who said he believed that a settlement was in the interests of the country, threw the negotiations into chaos. The White House was concerned over any appearance that Mr. Hirschfeld, who is under indictment on tax fraud charges, was bailing out the President. To seal the agreement, William McMillan, Ms. Carpenter-McMillan's husband and Ms. Jones's lead negotiator, wrote in a letter to Mr. Bennett this week, ''I further represent to you that the money from Mr. Abe Hirschfeld is no longer on the table, and that there will be no payment from Mr. Hirschfeld as a part of the settlement with Mr. Clinton.''

BYERS-David. 77. A nationallyknown architectural and decorative arts consultant and a muchadmired contributor to the social and cultural life of Atlanta-and wherever he landed in his travelsdied of heart failure August 19 at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital. A gentleman of wry, good humor, when asked what he did, Mr. Byers would answer, ''I help people with their problems. That is, their interior design needs''. His knowledge of the decorative arts was encyclopedic, spanning several centuries in England, the Continent and America. His energy was indefatigable as he journeyed around the country for his clients. His rooms were so admired that he assisted several generations of the same family in bringing elegance, beauty, comfort and magic to their homes. Based in Atlanta, Mr. Byers worked in decorative arts for more than 40 years, first at the W.E. Browne Decorating Company and then in private practice. During those years, he was a consultant to hundreds of private residences across the country and for numerous landmarks. They include The White House, Washington, D.C., (1970s); Diplomatic Reception Rooms, State Department, Washington, D.C. (1970s); Georgia Governor's Mansion, Atlanta; Mississippi Governor's Mansion, Jackson; The Boston Atheneum; Wright Stanley House, New Bern, N.C.; Edgewater, Barrytown, N.Y.; Roper House, Charleston, S.C.; Villa Albicini, Macon, Ga.; and the Baltimore Block Headquarters of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. Mr. Byers assisted the Metropolitan Museum of Art with a 19th century furniture exhibition in 1968. He also designed the installation of the Philip Shutze Collection in the Edward H. Inman House at the Atlanta History Center. His rooms have been featured in Classic Atlanta and on the cover of The Most Beautiful Rooms in America. In spite of his work on these noteworthy assignments, Mr. Byers was always modest about his projects. Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Mr. Byers was the younger son of Dr. and Mrs. Horace Byers. He studied architecture at the University of Virginia. He became a resident of Atlanta in 1945 when he joined the W.E. Browne Decorating Company. Mr. Byers retired as a shareholder and vice president when the noted Peachtree Street decorating company began to close in the late 1980s. Throughout his life, he was an ardent supporter of the Decorative Arts Trust and served on its board. Mr. Byers is survived by his sister, Shirley Byers of Baltimore, Maryland, and his cousins, friends and clients throughout the South and the nation. Memorial donations can be made to the David R. Byers Fund, Decorative Arts Trust, 106 Bainbridge Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 440-> THINK TANK; A Sales Pitch for the Liberal Arts: Is It Liberal? Is It Artistic?
To counter a decline in its enrollment, the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University hired an advertising agency to promote itself among this year's incoming freshmen. Slogans included ''Major in Arts and Sciences, Think for a Living'' and ''Do What You Want When You Graduate or Wait 20 Years for Your Midlife Crisis.'' In the November issue of Lingua Franca, various experts assessed the campaign. Here are excerpts from their responses: DEBRA GOLDMAN, columnist for Adweek. In their effort to give a little brand personality, I.U.'s agency locked onto the time-honored youth-targeted strategy of making it cool. Ignoring the product to focus on the consumer, the campaign positions majoring in the arts and sciences somewhere between an act of nonconformity and an insurance policy against midlife crisis. The trouble is this one-rebellion-fits-all strategy is a tad too generic. Are undergrads actually supposed to relate to that half-century-old mom and dad iconography, a parental image they only know from ''Nick at Nite''? The screaming irony of selling the liberal arts like a pair of jeans is that the hard work of a humanities education violates the ethos of modern marketing. The agency might have better luck with another standard from the arsenal of post-modern pitchdom, the self-subverting ad. Something like ''Major in the arts and sciences: After four years of communing with civilization's great minds, you could be immune to stupid ads like this one.'' GERALD GRAFF, Pullman Professor of English and Education at the University of Chicago and author of ''Beyond the Culture Wars.'' The ads have it both ways. On the one hand, the slogan ''Think for a Living'' means ''Commit to the thinking life rather than to business success.'' On the other hand, it also means ''Commit to the thinking life and you'll succeed in business.'' It's easy to mock these ads for papering over such a contradiction. My own view, however, is that the very ambiguity of these images expresses a truth about the divided potential of liberal arts training, which does turn some students into social critics, does give other students entry into corporate jobs and does both for some students at the same time. ROGER KIMBALL, managing editor of The New Criterion. Looking at these appalling advertisements for Indiana University's liberal arts program reminded me of P. T. Barnum's wicked habit of placing a large sign announcing ''This Way to the Egress!'' in his circuses. What a perfect way to gull the credulous multitudes who came for the sword-swallower, the fat lady and the dancing elephants. I doubt that these graphic monstrosities will be anywhere near as effective as Barnum's placards. But they have a similar intent, namely to sell the maximum number of people a bill of goods by misrepresenting a product. It is a nice question who will be more disappointed -- or more thoroughly cheated -- the circusgoers who find themselves suddenly outside the circus, or the unwary students who find themselves within it. PHILIP GOSSETT, Dean of Humanities, the University of Chicago. The ads, while slick and funny, are also offensive. They put the burden of choosing a liberal arts major exclusively on the students, who are already caught between many different forces: parental worries for the future, a system of rewards at the university that puts salaries and facilities in the arts and sciences at the low end of the spectrum, and a society in which financial success is valued above all else. Furthermore, the ads won't fool anyone. After all, are people who think for a living necessarily going to be happier than their parents? As for midlife crises, look around at your university colleagues! JOHN GUILLORY, professor of English at Harvard. The ads betray all too obviously the reason for the drop in arts and sciences enrollment, which has less to do with the appeal of the subjects themselves than with anxiety about the job market. Would that one could actually ''think for a living''! The question in the minds of those contemplating arts and sciences is: What do future employers want from college graduates? Perhaps students are mistaken about this, and should be encouraged to major in subjects that interest them. Or perhaps -- and this seems more likely -- arts and sciences need to be sold to employers as much as to students.

Aug. 23, 1998-> 441-> The Outlook's Bleak
The new young-adult novels seem to be voyeuristic rehashings of the kinds of disasters most of us can see on TV news shows, written in impoverished language and devoid of style and wit (Culture Zone: ''The Outlook's Bleak,'' by Sara Mosle, Aug. 2). If, indeed, ''the imagination should be the realm of freedom,'' as one young-adult editor tells Mosle, where, indeed, is the imagination or freedom in these humorless, hopeless potboilers? Murder, mayhem, substance abuse and various kinds of sex were not invented in the 1990's. Parents who don't communicate with their kids aren't new; teen-agers forced to grow up before their time, ''facing life's darkest corners,'' are not a new story either. Writers have dealt with adolescents facing horrors of all kinds. Dickens, Bronte, Remarque and Crane are among the classic names that come to mind; Maya Angelou, Frank McCourt and Elie Wiesel are among authors from the second half of the 20th century who wrote about adolescents facing bleak moments of all kinds, and forced to make adult decisions early in life.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 442-> Student Protest in Indonesia Explodes in Violence, and 8 Are Killed
Students, thugs and soldiers fought pitched battles in the streets of Jakarta on Friday night, as Parliament adopted decrees intended to nudge this suffering nation toward a more democratic future. It was the worst violence since President Suharto resigned last May. At least eight people were killed and scores were injured as well-ordered soldiers and riot police fired volley after volley above and directly into throngs of demonstrators and into the grounds of a university. For hours Friday night, as the Parliament voted to hold general elections next spring and to begin reforms, the streets were filled with shouts and screams, gunfire and the sting of tear gas. Angry students and local residents massed again this morning in protest of the night's violence. Like the students whose protests helped bring down Mr. Suharto, the people throwing rocks and gasoline bombs were pressing, with the passion of the young, for immediate if vaguely defined changes. These appear to include a faster pace toward democracy, the withdrawal of the military from its dominant role in politics and a Government investigation of Mr. Suharto's wealth. But unlike those earlier protesters, their demand that Mr. Suharto's successor, President B. J. Habibie, step down immediately was less representative of the national mood. Apart from the violence of the streets and the country's painfully shrinking economy, Indonesia seems in the past six months to have settled on a tentative course toward reforms on which both the Government and its opposition generally agree. But the fury over political change and economic upheaval on both sides of the battle Friday night showed the depth of anger Mr. Suharto left behind him in the country he built but also ruined in his 32 years in power. The volleys of gunfire Friday night set off rattling echoes on the glass walls of tall office buildings that, along with the violence itself, are among Mr. Suharto's legacies. Throughout the night, small white ambulances with flashing red lights drove in and out of the university grounds as the fighting surged around them. Many of the casualties had gunshot wounds, but it was unclear if these were inflicted by live ammunition or by rubber bullets, which can be fatal at close range. ''I am sorry for my country,'' said Eky, a student journalist who like many Indonesians uses one name. ''This is brutal, too brutal. I don't understand why the military is doing this.'' There was no clear explanation for the harsh tactics of the security forces. Jakarta was full of rumors of a possible coup by the military and opposition politicians who might use the protests as pretext. For their part, the students, joined by young men from nearby slums, seemed driven by an unslaked anger over the abuses of the Suharto years and an impatience with the deliberate pace of Parliament. The young thugs had their reasons, too. ''Everybody hates the police,'' said Andri, 17, who had just thrown a plastic bottle of water toward the police lines. ''I see the police as a cruel person and I hate him.'' A Western diplomat watching the demonstrators Friday night said: ''They are sick of being poor. They are sick of being at the bottom.'' But it is notable, he said, that the students are essentially leaderless and that even the newly assertive democratic opposition no longer shares their urgency for change. The electoral outline presented to Parliament by Mr. Habibie suits both those in power today and those who hope to gain it in the future. The students, with their vague demands for immediate change, have been left to shout and throw stones in the streets alone. The pressure of their passions and potential violence may have helped push the Parliament toward reforms, but the decrees enacted Friday night were modest. A vote is to be held next year for an electoral assembly that will name a new President at the end of 1999. The military's powerful role in politics is to be phased out, but only gradually. And past corruption, including that of Mr. Suharto, is to be investigated. In a sign that democracy is dawning, the parliamentary decrees were issued Friday night with the first contested votes in more than three decades. At one point, one of the parties staged a brief walkout. But still, as in the Suharto years, the work of the Parliament was carried out in something of a political vacuum, insulated from the turmoil of the streets outside. Clearly under orders to keep the demonstrators far away, the military stood in mass formations along the roads leading to the Parliament building. When the session ended near midnight, scores of delegates were stranded in the area, unable to cross the battle lines to go home. Though the demands voiced by various student groups vary, Friday night's parliamentary decrees failed to satisfy many of them, and the possibility of further violence hung over the nation. Whatever the motives of the students and the tactics of the military, the latest violence moved far beyond the realm of policy or politics and became a visceral struggle between enraged demonstrators and enraged soldiers. ''The students are crazy now,'' a plainclothes security officer muttered to a reporter. ''Maybe because since the afternoon they have nothing to eat. And the police are the same. They have gone crazy, too.'' Amid the gunfire, foreign diplomats paced the streets with cellular phones to their ears, reporting the action to their embassies. They said they were angered and shocked by what they were seeing. ''What's the game?'' said one of them. ''What's the objective of this military operation? To wound the students? The kids are inside the campus now. The shooting should stop.'' At one point, six truckloads of riot police officers drove along the white iron fence that surrounds Atmajaya Catholic University, standing and firing their weapons from the back. The officers jumped from their trucks and began running and shooting among the bushes by the side of the university. One turned and shot an Indonesian journalist in the back. His colleagues carried him to an ambulance. Later, the police, in their heavy, padded helmets, formed a tight line only 30 yards from the university's fence and began firing point-blank into its grounds from behind their tall plastic shields. Some broke ranks to hurl back rocks that the students had thrown at them. An officer stood behind them with a megaphone, directing their fire. From inside the campus grounds came a constant and extraordinary roar of animal rage: shouts, yelps, snarls and inarticulate cries, along with the sound of smashing glass and a relentless banging of sticks and stones against iron railings. In the main foyer, dozens of casualties were laid out on the floor and medical workers performed surgery without anesthetic. ''It hurts, it's hot!'' moaned a young student named Imelda, who had a gunshot wound to her inner thigh. ''Jesus Christ, help me, I don't want to die!'' Other students shouted and wept in shock and anger and fear. They washed their faces with wet rags to clear away the tear gas. They ran to the iron fence and shouted at the soldiers: ''You are killers! You are dogs!'' Outside, on a street lined with the banks and office towers that symbolize the prosperity brought by Mr. Suharto, as many as 10,000 demonstrators surged and taunted the military. They leaped up and down in the light of burning gasoline bombs, running forward occasionally to hurl stones and then retreat. They chanted, ''Killers! Killers!'' Soldiers chased some of them into an alley and an officer shouted after them: ''Whoever doesn't live here, please go home. Go home! But if you want to take us on, please, come ahead.'' Then in the midst of this, at just about the hour the parliamentary session ended, a police officer walked into the no-man's land outside the university's gate. He stood amid the rubble of stones and bits of brick, and offered a truce over a megaphone. A student ran from the gate and embraced him. Hundreds more poured out, shouting, leaping, uncertain whether to fight or cheer. They, too, embraced the startled riot police, some trying to kiss them through their heavy visors. ''Thank you! Thank you!'' one young man shouted over and over again. Negotiations began over whether the students would be allowed to march to the now-empty Parliament building. A light rain began to fall. In a widening circle, students and police lowered themselves to the ground in the thin yellow light of the street lamps. They sat together and after a while they began to sing the national anthem. -------------------- Albright's Visit Is Still on Track WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (By The New York Times) -- The State Department said today it ''deeply regrets that peaceful demonstrations focused on the People's Consultative Assembly turned violent'' and urged calm.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 446-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: CRITICS; Marines Scold Officer Who Called Clinton an 'Adulterous Liar' in a Column
The Marine Corps decided today not to punish an officer who wrote a newspaper column rebuking President Clinton as an ''adulterous liar,'' in a case that focused attention on the military's prohibitions on public criticisms of the Commander in Chief. The officer, Maj. Shane Sellers, a 41-year-old intelligence analyst, received the military equivalent of a stern talking-to from his commanding officer but otherwise was not punished for the column, which appeared on Oct. 12 in The Navy Times, an independent weekly newspaper. Major Sellers's column was one in a small but vocal chorus of officers and enlisted personnel grousing about Mr. Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. Although hardly a groundswell, the comments raised enough concern within the Pentagon that the Marine Corps and the Air Force each took the unusual step of reminding officers that Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice explicitly prohibits them from speaking ''contemptuous words'' about the President or other civilian leaders of the military. Major Sellers, who is assigned to work at the Defense Intelligence Agency, lamented in his column that Mr. Clinton was not being held to the same standards as uniformed officers, who could face punishment and even court martial for having an adulterous relationship with someone who worked for them. ''It's not about sex,'' Major Sellers wrote. ''It's tawdry and titillating, to be sure. But for all its soap-opera quality, what Clinton and Monica did as consenting adults boils down to adultery. And one should call an adulterous liar exactly what he is -- a criminal.'' The Marine Corps declined to discuss the findings of an investigation into the matter except to announce that Brig. Gen. Frances C. Wilson, the commander of the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va., met today with Major Sellers and now considers the case closed, with no formal punitive action having been taken. Under Article 88, he could have faced dismissal or received a lesser punishment like a letter of reprimand. ''It is a private issue between a superior and a subordinate,'' Capt. Sean Clements, a spokesman at Quantico, said of what was discussed at the meeting. ''She considers the issue closed.'' Major Sellers, in a telephone interview, said he considered the outcome ''in all honesty appropriate.'' Although he wrote bluntly about Mr. Clinton's affair, he said he did not intend the remarks to be ''contemptuous'' and believed that Article 88 set necessary guidelines for officers to respect civilian control of the military. Mr. Sellers said he would continue to write regularly for The Navy Times, though probably on other topics. ''I have no intention of writing any more about the President,'' he said. ''He gets enough attention.'' Although prosecutions under Article 88 are rare, new cases keep arising. The Marine Corps has opened another inquiry into a Marine Corps reservist, Maj. Daniel J. Rabil, who wrote an article in The Washington Times on Monday. In it, he called Mr. Clinton ''integrity impaired'' and ''perhaps the most selfish man ever to disgrace our Presidency.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 447-> Two Accused Officers in Louima Case Implicate a Third
Two of the four police officers facing Federal civil rights charges in the attack on a Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn last year have incriminated one of the other officers in the most brutal part of the assault, according to documents unsealed yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Prosecutors say the immigrant, Abner Louima, was beaten by the four officers in a police car after his arrest in a street brawl on Aug. 9, 1997. The officers who are quoted in the court papers, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, are charged with taking part in the beating in the police car. The officer they incriminated, Justin A. Volpe, is accused of ramming a stick into Mr. Louima's rectum and then his mouth in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, causing severe internal injuries. Officer Wiese is quoted in the court papers as saying that he went into the bathroom after Officer Volpe had entered with Mr. Louima, and saw Mr. Louima lying face down on the floor, ''his pants and underpants down at his ankles, and Volpe holding the stick full of feces.'' Officer Wiese is also quoted as saying that Officer Volpe told him that night that Mr. Louima had ''defecated on himself.'' Officer Wiese's statement came in a memorandum written by two of Mr. Louima's lawyers, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Peter J. Neufeld. It was originally written for their own files in November 1997, three months after Mr. Louima was brutalized and just after the two lawyers met with Officer Wiese's lawyers, Joseph Tacopina and Russell M. Gioiella. According to papers filed by the officer's lawyers, they met with Mr. Louima's lawyers in the hopes of persuading them to ''treat Mr. Wiese as a witness'' for Mr. Louima in a civil suit that Mr. Louima has filed against all four accused officers, the city and other parties. Officer Wiese's lawyers also said that if there were a ''reconciliation between'' the accounts of Officer Wiese and Mr. Louima, this would ''greatly increase the potential of Mr. Wiese avoiding an indictment.'' Officer Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, denounced Officer Wiese's statements in the memorandum as unreliable. First, he said, it was double hearsay because the statements were contained in an account written by Mr. Louima's lawyers based on conversations they had had with Officer Wiese's lawyers, and were not based on conversations with the officer himself. Second, Mr. Kornberg said, Officer Wiese's account ''is the same story that Wiese tried to sell'' to investigators shortly after Mr. Louima's encounter with the police. ''It didn't fly'' then, he said, ''and it won't fly now.'' He was referring to the fact that when Officer Wiese's account conflicted with that of an officer not charged in the case, the investigators chose to believe the other officer, saying Officer Wiese had failed a lie detector test. Officer Wiese's lawyers maintain that the test was defective and say he passed a subsequent test. Officer Wiese was indicted in February, along with the other accused officers, by a Federal grand jury that charged them with violating Mr. Louima's civil rights. Officer Bruder was quoted in a November 1997 Federal Bureau of Investigation report -- also part of the material unsealed yesterday -- as telling agents that he had seen Officer Volpe take Mr. Louima into the station house bathroom. Officer Bruder is also quoted as telling the agents that Officer Volpe later said he struck Mr. Louima with a mop handle. Mr. Kornberg said Officer Bruder's statement could not be believed. He noted that among the charges the grand jury brought against Officer Bruder was that in the same F.B.I. interview, he lied to the agents about a detail of Mr. Louima's arrest. The fourth officer charged with violating Mr. Louima's civil rights, Charles Schwarz, is accused of holding him down while he was being attacked with the stick. All four officers deny all the charges. The memorandum from Mr. Louima's lawyers and the F.B.I. report were part of a batch of documents in the case that the presiding judge, Eugene H. Nickerson, ordered unsealed, saying, ''I don't like sealed papers.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 449-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT; Tripp Friend Takes the Blame for Secret Taping
The New York literary agent Lucianne Goldberg is blaming herself for encouraging her friend Linda R. Tripp to record phone conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky, recordings that may have violated the law. A grand jury here in Howard County is considering whether Mrs. Tripp, a county resident, broke the Maryland wiretapping law by taping about 20 hours of conversations with Ms. Lewinsky without her knowledge. Mrs. Goldberg, after testifying before the grand jury on Thursday, said she had incorrectly told Mrs. Tripp it would be legal to make the tapes. ''I take all the blame,'' she told reporters. The maximum penalty for breaking Maryland's wiretapping law is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Mrs. Goldberg said Mrs. Tripp asked her in September 1997 whether recording her calls with Ms. Lewinsky would be appropriate. Mrs. Goldberg said she had asked an associate to research the matter on the Internet and had then told Mrs. Tripp -- wrongly -- that it would be legal. A state prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, is seeking evidence on whether Mrs. Tripp knew the secret taping was illegal before she began in September 1997.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 453-> Sister Cities: United States and Cuba
To the Editor: Diane Nottle's fine feature did not point out the original mission of sister cities as introduced by President Eisenhower in his ''Bridges for Peace'' speech. At the very beginning of the Cold War, he urged citizens on both sides to do whatever possible to get to know one another, to ''leap governments and, if necessary, to evade governments'' -- anything to foster greater understanding and friendship. The Cold War has fortunately ended, though it still hovers over relationships between the United States and Cuba. That's why people-to-people exchanges between the United States and Cuba are so needed. That's why the organization Hermanas (sisters) in central New Jersey is working to link local schools with similar schools in Cuba. That's also why close to a dozen United States-Cuba sister city projects have been initiated, Pittsburgh-Matanzas and Philadelphia-Santiago among them. JOHN DOWLIN Philadelphia

Dec. 15, 1998-> 455-> After Tobacco Deal, Lawyers Seek Payoff
A few months ago, Patrick J. Coughlin, a San Diego lawyer involved in a lawsuit against R. J. Reynolds, was thinking of asking for a $50 million fee for his firm, in a case that the cigarette maker had settled for $10 million. Then Mr. Coughlin heard that the five lawyers who represented Texas in its $17.3 billion settlement with tobacco companies planned to seek up to $25 billion from arbitrators who were to determine both their fees and his. The pot of money was limited. So, within weeks, Mr. Coughlin's request had shot up to $650 million. The extraordinary requests for payment by the Texas lawyers and Mr. Coughlin's firm are likely to become common as plaintiffs' lawyers across the country grab for fees from smoking-related settlements between the tobacco industry and the states.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 459-> Tex Johnston, 84; Pilot Ushered In Airline Era
Tex Johnston, a storied test pilot who ushered in the age of jet travel with such a heart-stopping flourish that some people in Seattle and the world of aviation are still shaking their heads, died on Oct. 29 at a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Wash. He was 84 and was recalled as the man who blithely barrel-rolled the nation's first jetliner into aviation history. His family said the cause was Alzheimer's disease. With a quarter-million spectators gathered on Lake Washington for the Gold Cup hydroplane races and air show at the 1955 Seattle Seafair, no one was expecting anything special from the Boeing Airplane Company's chief test pilot that August afternoon, least of all the Boeing executives clustered on a barge surrounded by the heads of virtually every major airline in the world to watch a routine flyover by a prototype of the company's new aircraft. For one thing, Mr. Johnston, or Alvin Melvin Johnston, as the drawling test pilot was known to virtually no one, had already had his brush with aviation glory. Eight years earlier as chief test pilot for Bell Aviation, the lanky pilot in his signature custom-made cowboy boots had tested the company's famous X-1 rocket plane, becoming first to fly the B-29-launched craft using all four rockets and taking it, he later recalled, to Mach .99, a whisper shy of the sound barrier. He held off because the Air Force, which owned the plane, had insisted that a military pilot have the honor of being the first to fly at supersonic speed, as indeed Capt. Chuck Yeager did in 1947. If he had been disappointed at missing out on that bit of aviation history, Mr. Johnston didn't let on. After all, what had kept him in the air almost constantly since he soloed at the age of 15 in an open cockpit Waco monoplane was not the chance for glory but the sheer, exuberant joy he had first tasted at 11 one summer afternoon in 1925. On that day a barnstorming pilot landed a World War I Jenny in a cow pasture next to the Johnston family farm in Admire, Kans., outside Emporia, and took the youngster on a short hop that left him hooked on flying forever. As he recalled in his 1991 book, ''Tex Johnston: Jet-Age Test Pilot,'' he had been so smitten that he grabbed the pilot's hand and blurted out: ''I love you. I'm going to be just like you.'' It took some doing, but by the time he joined Boeing in 1949, Mr. Johnston had long since won his aviation spurs, performing aerial stunts for a flying circus at 19, training pilots and ferrying airplanes from factories to military airfields in World War II, and even earning a few footnotes to aviation history. He became the first pilot to fly the famous Bell XP-59A, the first American jet, above 40,000 feet, and set a world closed course speed record of 376.4 miles an hour in winning the 1946 Thompson Trophy race in Cleveland in a modified P-39. As Boeing's chief of test flights he had reached the pinnacle of his profession, supervising a staff of 600, including 15 other pilots, while continuing his personal achievements, among them flying the first B-47 and the first B-52 on their maiden flights. On Aug. 7, 1955, the day Mr. Johnston was asked to fly over Lake Washington in a a giant four-engine Boeing jet prototype designated 367-80 and known as the Dash 80, Boeing was host of the annual meetings of the International Air Transport Association and the American Society of Aeronautical Engineers, and virtually every potential customer for its planes was represented. Boeing executives understandably wanted them to get a good look at the plane on which the company had staked its future, investing a quarter of its corporate net worth without a single advance order. Well, they did. Mr. Johnston pulled on his cowboy boots, climbed into the Dash 80 and roared in low across the lake. At 400 feet above the water and at a speed of more than 400 miles an hour, the Dash 80 suddenly started climbing and began rotating on its axis. Its long, swept-back wings described a giant spiral around the body of the speeding plane, which flew briefly upside down in its slow, languid roll. Then, just in case no one had noticed, he did it again. On the barge, aviation executives gasped. The Boeing president, William Allen, asked a friend with a heart ailment for his pills. His distress was understandable. Barrel rolls performed by small fighter planes and the like were common enough, but no one had ever seen one executed by a 128-foot-long, 160,000-pound plane with four heavy jet engines and a 130-foot wing span. But then, no one had ever seen a Boeing 707, as the Dash 80's offspring would soon be known. a plane whose pilot had participated in every facet of its design and construction and knew, as those gasping below could not, that it could well withstand the surprisingly minimal stresses caused by the demonstration. Or, as an aviation friend reassuringly told Mr. Allen, ''Tex has just sold your plane for you.'' Indeed, by the time Mr. Johnston set a transcontinental speed record in 1957 of 612 miles an hour flying the Dash 80 from Seattle to Baltimore in 3 hours, 48 minutes, the orders were pouring in, as they continued to do over the next two decades. Mr. Johnston was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1993. He is survived by a son, Gary, of Edmonds, Wash.; two daughters, Judy Alexander of Bellevue, Wash., and Barbara Fowler of Lompoc, Calif.; nine grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 461-> RACING: NOTEBOOK; OTB Simulcast Signal Will Resume Today
The long dispute over fees that blacked out the simulcast television signal of races to off-track betting customers i the city ended last night when the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation agreed on a four-year contract. The simulcasting of races from Aqueduct will resume today for OTB parlors, theaters and homes in New York City, the racing association pulled the plug on its feed for in-home bettors on July 22, and followed by cutting its signal to OTB offices, teletheaters, bars and restaurants in the five boroughs on Oct. 17. But the dispute has been waged since Nov. 12 of last year, when the former contract ended. Over the course of a long, and frequently bitter, dispute, the N.Y.R.A. twice cut its simulcasting television signal to homes, but both times was ordered to restore it by the State Racing ad Wagering Board. But it appealed in court and won, and then terminated its signal to homes in July and to betting parlors three months later. Under the new agreement, the city Off-Tracking Betting Corporation willl pay $36 million in fees for the signals over the next four years, or $9 million a year. Under the former contract, the N.Y.R.A. received $4.2 million a year. But under the new contract, the racing association will apply half the money it receives to raising purses. ''This agreement provides stability,'' said WILLIAM P. CARNEVALE, president of the city OTB. ''There is a mediation clause that would be triggered if a dispute arises, and an arbitration clause if subsequent agreement cannot be reached. And we plan to look at marketing racing in new York City jointly.'' KENNY NOE, chairman of the N.Y.R.A. trustees, said the agreement should prove a boon to horsemen at New York's tracks. Three Top Horses Are Set to Retire In the fallout from the Breeders' Cup of one week ago, some of the stars in the cast were headed for new careers as stallions yesterday: Favorite Trick, the Horse of the year at 2 years old, has been retired at 3. Awesome Again, undefeated in six starts this year and winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic, will also race no more. And Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old prodigy who ran fifth in the Classic, will run once more and then end his career. All will retire in good health and with large bankrolls and prospects for more. Favorite Trick will stand at Walmac International in Lexington, Ky., for a fee of $30,000. Awesome Again will be retired to Adena Springs Farm in nearby Midway and will command a stud fee of $50,000. And Coronado's Quest will retire after one farewell performance in the $3000,000 Cigar Mile on Nov. 28 at Aqueduct, where he is 4 for 4. Favorite Trick became the first 2-year-old to be voted Horse of the Year since Secretariat did it in 1972. Favorite Trick won all eight of his starts last year. He came back this year with a new trainer, BILL MOTT, and won the Swale, the Jim dandy and the Long Branch Stakes on the dirt, and the Keeneland Breeders' Cup Mile on the grass. He retires with a career record of 12 victories in 16 races and earnings of $1.7 million. But he did have trouble handling distances greater than a mile and an eighth. ''There is no disgrace just because he wasn't able to compete with the top of his class at amile and a quarter,'' Mott said. ''He had one great year and one decent year. It was time to go.'' Favorite Trick had been expected to retire after the Breeders' Cup Mile, in which he ran eighth, but Awesome Again's future was not decided until three days later. His owner, FRANK STRONACH, and his trainer, PATRICK BYRNE, believed that their 4-year-old star had established himself as a threat to Skip Away for Horse of the Year honors, and reasoned that interest in the horse for breeding purposes was at a high point. ''He's going to be missed,'' Byrne said, ''but it just seemed right to retire him on an upbeat note.'' LONG ISLAND HANICAP Dickinson Filly In Turf Stakes MICHAEL DICKINSON, the effervescent English trainer who worked a racing miracle when Da Hoss won the Breeders' Cup Mile with one prep race after a two-year layoff, will be represented at Aqueduct today by the filly Miss North Beach in the Long Island Handicap. The race is the final graded stakes on the turf for fillies and mares in New York this year, and it had to be split into two divisions of 12 horses apiece when 24 were entered on Thursday.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 462-> Roman Cycowski, 97, Vocal Sextet Member
Roman Cycowski, the last surviving member of the Comedian Harmonists, a legendary German vocal sextet that was forced to break up by the Nazis because three of its members were Jewish, died on Wednesday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 97. Mr. Cycowski had been cantor at the Temple Isaiah in Palm Springs for several decades and at the time of his death was still singing there regularly. The Comedian Harmonists were formed in 1927 by Harry Frommerman and aspired to be the German answer to a popular American singing group called the Revelers. For eight years, the group enjoyed enormous popularity, until the Nazis forced them to disperse. The group sang everything from German folk songs to ''Tea for Two'' to Duke Ellington to the work of classical composers like Brahms and Rossini. One of their special skills was the ability to imitate musical instruments so accurately that when they sang from behind a curtain, audiences could easily mistake them for an actual chamber orchestra. Mr. Cycowski, who was born in Lodz, Poland, was trained as a cantor and moved to Germany in 1921 to become an opera singer. When he joined the Comedian Harmonists six years later, he viewed it as a temporary sidetrack to his operatic career. One of the group's three lead singers, he was the only one who was operatically trained. His specialties included ''The Blue Danube,'' a comic number from ''The Barber of Seville'' and a number of folk songs. In 1935, when the group was forced to break up, he and its two other Jewish members formed the Comedy Harmonists in Vienna. The group toured all over the world. He eventually settled in San Francisco, where he served for 15 years as cantor at Beth Israel Temple before moving to Palm Springs. The Comedian Harmonists are the subject of an acclaimed three-hour documentary by Eberhard Fechner, filmed in the mid-1970's and first shown in the United States in 1991, that weaves together first-person accounts of the group's then-surviving members and their wives. More recently, their story has been made into a feature film, ''The Harmonists,'' to be released by Miramax early next year. Barry Manilow has also written a musical, ''Harmony,'' based on the group's story. A musical play, ''Band in Berlin,'' by Susan Feldman, based on extensive interviews with Mr. Cykowski, is also expected to open on Broadway early next year. Mr. Cycowski is survived by his wife, Mary, to whom he was married for more than 60 years.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 463-> Williams Buys the Rest of Volunteer Energy
The Williams Companies, the largest United States transporter of natural gas, said today that it had bought the remaining 50 percent of the closely held Volunteer Energy Corporation that it did not already own to expand its retail energy operations. Financial terms were not disclosed. Volunteer Energy, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, sells natural gas to about 6,000 customers in 15 states. Volunteer also sells meters that allow commercial and industrial customers to monitor their electricity use. Williams said it had bought the stake from five private investors. Williams started as a natural gas pipeline company and now explores for oil and gas, refines oil into fuel and owns a fiber optic telecommunications network. Earlier this year, it completed a new trading room floor at its headquarters in Tulsa, where it buys and sells electricity and natural gas. Williams shares rose 6.25 cents, to $25.9375.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 465-> Putting Frosting On Success; Scouts Make Millions on Cookies, They Need Advice?
Down a drab corridor in the basement of the Empire State Building, in an austere, glaringly lighted employee dining room, six security guards chatted at a table on Wednesday morning. In front of them sat a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints. On the far side of a flimsy partition, Robert G. Stockard, a cheery, upbeat sales pro, was in the midst of a training session. He had come here on this rainy morning to try to impart a professional's touch to a group of Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 11, who were about to head off into the cruel, man-eat-cookie world -- the lobby -- to sell some Samoas, Thin Mints and Trefoils. ''Selling is a lot of acting,'' Mr. Stockard told them. ''Now my partner, Maria, is going to play a tough cookie.'' Up stepped Maria Massaro, who turned out to be not such a tough cookie after all. Mr. Stockard, the designated cookie-seller, made his pitch, and she smilingly demurred, saying, ''I don't eat chocolate.'' (Mr. Stockard, in a stage whisper: ''She really loves chocolate.'') But Ms. Massaro quickly became a pushover, buying box after box of whatever he offered. ''Notice,'' Mr. Stockard said, ''that I didn't ask, 'Would you like to buy?' but 'How many would you like to buy?' '' Try as he might, he couldn't keep the odd bit of sales jargon from bubbling to the surface: ''When I ask, 'Do you have any friends who want cookies?' that's what we call the final close.'' The girls joined the role-playing, and they too proved to be soft touches, eagerly buying even when the whole pitch was a faint ''Would you like to buy some cookies?'' They were having fun now. It had not taken long to break through their shyness. Mr. Stockard, president of Sales Staffers International of Andover, Mass., had started off with a hearty ''Ready to have some fun?'' Eliciting a chorus of muffled affirmatives, he then asked what the girls wanted to raise money for. One girl said, ''Disney World,'' and then Stephanie Rivera, a tiny, black-haired 7-year-old from the Bronx, murmured something indecipherable. ''You want to do bikes with lobsters?'' Mr. Stockard asked incredulously. He leaned close to Stephanie; she whispered something, and Mr. Stockard stood up and clarified matters. ''Oh, you want to do your nails, buy dresses and go to the Red Lobster,'' he said. Stephanie gave a faint nod. The Girl Scouts would seem to be in scant need of sales advice; nationwide, they sold 183 million boxes last year. (Local councils set prices and keep profits, so no dollar figures were available. But do the math: this is a half-billion-dollar business.) Mr. Stockard, unawed by such numbers, plunged ahead with his ''cookie wheel,'' a nine-step sales process. Step 1 was ''Smile,'' and Mr. Stockard asked the girls why that was important. Kandis Bennet, a self-assured 11-year-old from Queens, responded quickly, ''To make a good impression.'' Very good, Kandis. Smiling all the way, Mr. Stockard, 40, led them along the wheel, through Step 4, ''We now have cookies for people on special diets''; Step 7, ''Are you sure you ordered enough boxes?'' to the final, indispensable Step 9, ''Thank you very much.'' The seven girls -- resplendent in brown or green uniforms -- took this all in with varying degrees of attentiveness, the younger ones clearly with less weighty thoughts on their roving minds. It was time to head upstairs to the lobby, amid murmurs of ''They got more than us'' as the samples were gathered. What did Stephanie, say, glean from her half-hour or so of training? ''Be polite,'' she said with a shrug, then, more gleefully, ''Get some money.'' How many would she sell today? ''A whole bunch,'' she said spiritedly. The moment of truth was at hand. In the lobby, 100 cartons of cookies were stacked against one wall, and the girls lined boxes up meticulously on a table. Corrine Rivera, Stephanie's twin, had removed one of her shiny black shoes and nearly tumbled as she danced playfully on the polished floor. A tiny figure in the spacious lobby, she seemed more badge-covered uniform than girl. A workman on a ladder putting up a banner for the event, dubbed ''Turning Cookies Into Dough,'' called over, ''Do you take credit cards?'' Jade Randall, a sharp 10-year-old who had just made the day's first sale, eyeing the $10 bill closely through thick glasses, shot back, ''No, just cash.'' ''You should have come on payday, then,'' the workman countered jovially. The table ready, some girls started making their pitch, the nine-step script usually crumbling to ''Want to buy some cookies?'' They soon discovered that the Empire State Building crowd was not a pushover like Ms. Massaro. Some passers-by gave puzzled looks, others walked with the stony obliviousness that New Yorkers have polished to a high art. ''We're just looking for the observatory elevator,'' one flustered woman said by way of a no. Caitlin Faraday, 8, at the suggestion that potential customers were getting by unpitched, said with a firm sense of territory, ''We're getting them from this aisle.'' Mr. Stockard, born salesman, could not for the life of him stay out of the fray. ''Make any sales yet, ladies?'' he asked. Or, ''Good try, girls!'' Often he made a pitch himself. ''I can't help it,'' he said, grinning. Once he reported excitedly, ''That girl upsold a customer.'' Upsold? Uh-oh. Jargon alert. ''Got her to buy more than she'd planned,'' he hurriedly translated. And when a woman asked, ''Do you have any low-fat?'' he was in trainer's heaven. ''I love it when they follow the script,'' he exulted. Gradually customers materialized. ''Can we just buy some?'' one woman asked sheepishly amid the banners and cameras. ''I have a list,'' another said as she scooped up 8 or 10 boxes. And another: ''I heard you were down here and I came running.'' Did the professionally honed sales pitch help? ''It was the smiles,'' one man said. ''Always effective.'' But another said gruffly, ''It's the product, not the sales pitch,'' as he snared his Thin Mints -- the top seller nationwide. ''They're $3 a box?'' one customer said in mock horror, then added, ''Oh, Girl Scouts -- wonderful organization!'' Yes, $3 is a lot for an 8- or 10-ounce box (which costs the organization 82 cents), but the good cause reels them in. Near noon, Jade asked for the time -- not because she was tired, but so she would know whether to say ''Good morning'' or ''Good afternoon.'' As the day wore on, the girls did grow weary, and by lunch time, with the lobby hopping, it was mostly the troop leaders doing the selling. Half the 100 cartons had vanished. By day's end, nearly all had been sold. So, what is Mr. Stockard's angle? Is his donated training just a publicity stunt for Sales Staffers, a private company that provides training, marketing services and sales representatives to large corporations? He dispelled that idea convincingly. ''I was a scout as a kid,'' he said. ''I saw how much parents helped. Now we want to do anything we can to help these girls' confidence levels. It's nice to see their eyes light up.'' Why seek publicity, then? ''We want to make our employees proud, and to have clients see what we're doing -- we'd like them to give something back to society.'' The children, he said, ''are our future.'' Beverly Cheuvront, public relations director for the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, added: ''The real value is to learn how to set goals, do budgeting, meet goals. These skills are transferable to all aspects of their lives.'' She had offered the girls a real-world use: ''You can use these sales skills to convince your teacher you deserve an A.'' Ms. Massaro, president of Sales Consultants of Boston and co-founder of Mr. Stockard's company, echoed the upbeat tone but refined the goal, saying: ''I hope a few girls are inspired today to go into sales. You don't grow up wanting to be a sales rep, after all.'' Kandis, at the suggestion that she might go into sales, crinkled her nose in a distinct negative. Then enthusiastically got back to her selling.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 467-> Retail Sales Set Brisk Pace And Producer Prices Edge Up
Retail sales rose in October at the fastest pace in five months and producer prices crept higher, leading some economists to predict that the Federal Reserve's policy makers may refrain from cutting interest rates next week. ''The economy's stronger than we thought,'' said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. ''The Fed's going to think the urgency for a rate cut isn't there.'' Retail sales rose 1 percent in October, the Commerce Department said today. That was twice the pace expected by forecasters. The gain was led by purchases of high-cost durable goods, including autos, appliances and furniture. It followed an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in September. Producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in October, after rising three-tenths a month earlier, Labor Department figures showed. Prices rose during October in part because oil prices were up for a time early in the month. The core rate of the Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose one-tenth of 1 percent, down from the four-tenths of 1 percent increase in September. Survey figures today showed that consumers are more upbeat about their economic prospects so far in November than they were a month ago. The University of Michigan's sentiment index for November rose to 102.4 from 97.4 in October. Before today's reports, many analysts had been betting that the Fed would cut the overnight bank lending rate for the third time since the end of September at Tuesday's policy meeting. Forecasters cited Fed concerns about lingering nervousness in financial markets and problems overseas that could bring an end to the United States expansion, which is almost eight years old. With consumer demand staying strong, some analysts said the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, might refrain from pushing his colleagues for immediate action. ''It doesn't look like a recession, so they can afford to wait,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 472-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE INVESTIGATION; Judiciary Committee Gets Starr's Evidence on Willey
The independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr today sent evidence concerning the former White House volunteer Kathleen E. Willey to the House Judiciary Committee, but he did not say the material constituted grounds for impeaching President Clinton. The evidence, which was not made public, relates to Ms. Willey's accusation that the President groped her just outside the Oval Office in 1993 when she went to him seeking a full-time job. Mr. Clinton has denied the assertion under oath. Unlike Mr. Starr's report to Congress in September, in which he said the President may have committed 11 impeachable offenses to hide his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the two boxes of witness testimony and other information sent today did not contain a formal accusation of wrongdoing against Mr. Clinton, said people who have reviewed the material. A White House spokesman, James E. Kennedy, said: ''Once again, the independent counsel has seen fit to send secret grand jury material to the House. We have not been allowed to see this material and therefore cannot comment on its contents.'' House Democrats seized on today's developments as evidence that Mr. Starr was trying to reinvigorate an inquiry that is losing momentum before his testimony next Thursday before the Judiciary Committee. ''This guy's on a vendetta against the President,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat on the committee. ''He's just sending this up to light a fire under impeachment.'' Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''I have to conclude that Ken Starr does not believe the Willey information represents substantial and credible evidence of impeachment offenses.'' The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, declined to comment on the material, citing House rules barring disclosure before the committee votes to release the evidence from executive session. Mr. Starr withheld the evidence concerning Ms. Willey from his September referral, leading House investigators to conclude that he was preparing a second referral or criminal indictments. A spokesman for Mr. Starr did not return six telephone calls tonight. It was unclear tonight how the additional information would influence the direction of the House inquiry. Democratic and Republican aides were poring over the material late today. ''Until the materials are reviewed thoroughly by the members, it is impossible to know whether there will be any effect on the committee's schedule,'' said Nicole Nason, a committee spokeswoman. Ms. Willey's accusation is well known, but it has been contradicted by various witnesses. Ms. Willey and several of her friends testified before Mr. Starr's grand jury. In essence, House aides said, Mr. Starr is turning over his files on Ms. Willey and letting House investigators decide who is telling the truth. A senior Republican committee aide said last week that if Mr. Starr were to send over information about Ms. Willey's accusations, it could be readily ''plugged in'' to the investigation centering on Mr. Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Members of the committee's staff have boiled down Mr. Starr's original 11 accusations to three categories: lying under oath, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr. Hyde and Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's ranking Democrat, wrote to Mr. Starr on Oct. 2, asking if he intended to submit any additional ''investigative materials.'' Today's submission responds to that request and may signal that Mr. Starr has sent Congress all the material he has that is related to the impeachment inquiry, House aides said. But in a letter faxed to the committee's Republican and Democratic investigative counsels, one of Mr. Starr's deputies, Robert J. Bittman, said, ''Limited availability of these materials will not in our judgment jeopardize any ongoing investigation.'' This suggests Mr. Starr might still seek indictments in the Willey matter. Ms. Willey has been a focus of Mr. Starr's inquiry because he is investigating whether she received a White House job and other favored assignments from the Administration in return for keeping silent about the supposed sexual encounter. She came to Mr. Starr's attention after being deposed in Paula Jones's sexual misconduct case against the President. Ms. Willey went public with her story in an interview on ''60 Minutes'' in March. But inconsistencies in Ms. Willey's account quickly emerged. One friend, Linda R. Tripp, testified to the grand jury that Ms. Willey was trying to promote ''an ongoing flirtation'' with Mr. Clinton. Another confidante, Julie Hiatt Steele, initially confirmed aspects of Ms. Willey's story, but then disavowed it and said in an affidavit that Ms. Willey had asked her to lie. A third friend, Harolyn Cardozo, a former White House volunteer who is the daughter of the Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow, has said Ms. Willey called her several hours after meeting with the President, sounding ''excited and pleased.'' Ms. Willey has said she discussed her encounter with Mr. Landow, but has never publicly characterized those discussions. Mr. Landow has denied that he tried to influence Ms. Willey's testimony in the Jones case.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 473-> Pressure Builds for Accord At Talks on Climate Change
Negotiators in the Buenos Aires talks on global warming were locked in a last-minute struggle last night to resolve key questions. The matters seemed merely procedural but in reality went to the heart of the politically charged issue of how fast the world can and should move to deal with the prospect of climatic change. At issue were the shape and pace of the work schedule for putting flesh on the bones of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement reached a year ago in Japan. Under it, industrialized countries committed themselves to make legally binding reductions in emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide. Mainstream scientists say that if the emissions are not reduced, the world's climate could be seriously disrupted in coming decades. As the Buenos Aires discussions opened on Nov. 2, virtually all major participants said the measure of their success would be the adoption of a work schedule. But as the 12 days of talks went well past their scheduled end of midnight Friday, no accord had been achieved. The work schedule is crucial because it would govern how soon operating rules are established. Not until then, assuming that the Kyoto Protocol is ratified by the required countries, including the United States, can the protocol take effect. Late in the day, the conference chairwoman, Maria Julia Alsogary of Argentina, circulated a draft proposal establishing a two-year deadline for fashioning the rules. As midnight approached, there was cautious optimism. ''I think it's likely we're going to reach closure, but the clock is ticking,'' said Dirk Forrister, a member of the American delegation. It was clear, he said, that the deadline would be extended: ''We're going to be going into the wee hours'' of this morning. At Kyoto the industrialized countries agreed to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by an average of about 5 percent below 1990 levels in the next 10 to 14 years. The gases are produced mainly by the burning of coal, oil, wood and natural gas. The United States' reduction would be 7 percent. Developing countries so far have no specific targets but are required in general to control their emissions. One of the two operational mechanisms established at Kyoto is called emissions trading. It would allow a country or private company to achieve its cuts partly by buying reductions from a country or company that has reduced its emissions more than required. In theory, the method's proponents say, that would bring about faster reductions at lower cost. They say this has been proved by an emissions trading system for reducing industrial sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. The other arrangement, called the clean development mechanism, is intended to enable rich countries to invest in emissions reduction projects in poor countries. One example is high-efficiency power plants that emit less carbon. That way, in theory, the poor countries would reap environmental and economic benefits. The investor and the recipient would share credit for the emissions reductions achieved. One sticking point in Buenos Aires involved which of the two mechanisms should be given priority. Many developing countries, seeing the prospect of reaping new investment in their economies, wanted the rules for the clean development mechanism to be worked out first, on an accelerated schedule, with those for emissions trading completed later. The United States and other rich countries feared that if the clean development mechanism received first priority, developing countries would refuse to approve rules for emissions trading. Developing countries have been suspicious of emissions trading, fearing that it might be used an excuse for not reducing emissions. The United States therefore insisted that the two mechanisms move ahead on parallel tracks. As the Buenos Aires session moved into its final hours, the parallel-track idea appeared to be ascendant. Ms. Alsogaray's proposal would require that ''substantial progress'' on rules for the operating mechanisms be demonstrated a year from now, with a firm decision in two years.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 479-> U.N. Chief in Last-Ditch Plea to Iraq on Arms
Secretary General Kofi Annan made a last-ditch appeal to Iraq tonight to make a ''wise decision'' and end its defiance of international arms inspections. His plea followed a five-hour meeting with the Security Council that failed to agree on any other diplomatic steps that could or should be taken to budge President Saddam Hussein from the entrenched position that has put Iraq under the threat of American attack. There was an atmosphere of futility around the meeting, since both the Council and Mr. Annan have been delivering the same message to the Iraqis for nearly two weeks, and there is a sense that military action is probably inevitable. ''All stressed the desirability of a peaceful and diplomatic solution, but events on the ground may be running away from us,'' Mr. Annan said after the meeting. The Council and the Secretary General agreed that he would write a letter to the Iraqi leadership, restating his demand that Baghdad rescind orders stopping cooperation with arms inspectors and reminding the Iraqis that they would get a comprehensive review of their relations with the United Nations in return. A visibly exhausted Secretary General emerged from the Council session to make his public appeal to Baghdad, before meeting Iraq's representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, who told reporters later that he hoped the United States would ''give diplomacy a real chance.'' ''I would use this opportunity once again to urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take a wise decision of resuming cooperation with Unscom and the atomic agency,'' he said, referring to the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency. ''I hope that this appeal will be listened to by the Iraqis authorities.'' To encourage the Iraqis, Mr. Annan held out again the promise that a comprehensive review could lead to a lifting of sanctions if Iraq extended full cooperation to Unscom inspectors. Mr. Annan made no mention of a trip to Baghdad, as the Iraqis are urging. The Secretary General spoke with President Clinton by telephone this morning, his aides said, and was apparently told then that the United States was not in favor of a trip to Iraq by the Secretary General, at least not at this point. United Nations officials said that Mr. Annan could not go to Baghdad a second time this year, with the Iraqis having broken the first agreement, unless he had absolute assurance in advance that Mr. Hussein would reverse decisions made on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 that shut down arms inspections in Iraq. Mr. Annan met this morning with the representatives of China, France and Russia, who are pressing the Secretary General to take some kind of diplomatic initiative, though diplomats said the Russians did not suggest that there was anything to negotiate with the Iraqis. In Baghdad today, Russia's Ambassador delivered two letters to President Hussein, one from President Boris N. Yeltsin and another from Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov. Both were critical of Iraq for raising the present crisis to a dangerous level by stopping all cooperation with arms inspectors, officials in Moscow said. Mr. Hussein was reported to have responded ''positively,'' but British and American officials dismissed the gesture, saying he had merely repeated demands for a lifting of sanctions. United Nations officials, looking beyond bombing raids, are concerned that a range of programs in Iraq could be curtailed or ended by the Iraqis in the wake of American attacks. If the Iraqis decide to flout sanctions, the ''oil for food'' plan under which Iraq is permitted to sell limited amounts of oil to pay for civilian goods and services could be the first victim. President Hussein has apparently never liked the program, which was beginning to feed Iraqis and provide them with medicines, hospital equipment and school materials, among other imports otherwise denied them by an embargo. If Iraq circumventsthe sanctions, there would in theory be no need for outside help, since oil money would be freely available to the Iraqis -- unless the United States was willing to blockade Iraq. The continuation of imports under the oil-sale program is already in doubt. Today the British contractor in charge of stationing inspectors at Iraqi border points and ports to monitor shipments of food and other goods suddenly withdrew its staff in anticipation of American attacks on Iraq. Benon Sevan, the director of the Iraq program for the United Nations, said in a statement that the contractor, Lloyd's Register, had pulled out 54 people without warning. The result, Mr. Sevan said, is that shipments into Iraq cannot be checked and shippers will not be paid, since certification by border inspectors is required by the oil-sale plan. Mr. Sevan said his office was ''examining various options with a view to restoring inspection services with the least possible delay in order to maintain the flow of food, medicine and other essential humanitarian supplies into Iraq.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 481-> Redrawing The Free Market; Amid a Global Financial Crisis, Calls for Regulation Spread
In Western capitals there is a rush to rethink the world. At issue is the end of the so-called Washington consensus, which has held more or less unchallenged since the end of the cold war: that more open markets, freer trade and larger international capital flows are necessarily good. The catalyst has been disaster that no rally on Wall Street can quickly undo. The global financial crisis has thrown 20 million Asians back into poverty over the last year, made 40 percent of the Russian population poorer than ever, and produced growing unemployment in Brazil, a country already racked by some of the greatest disparities between rich and poor in the world. ''International volatility has been such that free-market capitalism is on the defensive,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. In place of the old certainties lies disquiet. At the heart of the disquiet is the growing sense that however fecund the global exchange of trade, information and money has been in recent years, this unbridled flow can also be capriciously destructive. Forms of intervention to control or direct the flow are therefore being heatedly discussed. ''A very important debate has begun, sparked by the general realization that you cannot leave people unprotected before the global market,'' said Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of Economics. ''There is a will to recognize the need for some new governance of the world economy.'' The question of just what that new governance should be is creating a world of unusual intellectual flux, one comparable to the post-1945 era in its quest for some overarching design for equitable development. Just as the development of the New Deal and the European welfare state rescued industrial capitalism from its interwar collapse, so a similar and equally critical quest has now begun at a global level for cushions to the harsher effects of electronic capitalism. Prominent economists have suggested a global taxation on currency speculation, the establishment of a second United Nations Security Council for economic affairs that would act to avert disaster in the economic field, limits on international flows of capital, and setting target zones for exchange rates. But such steps, which have fairly wide support in Europe, tend to provoke deep suspicion in the United States, although the danger that further volatility could lead to spreading protectionism and possible political upheavals is widely recognized in Washington. At the center of the disagreement between Americans and Europeans lies the nature of today's instantaneous world. Has this new global society amounted to an electronic energizer, as the Clinton Administration has tended to argue, a revolutionary generator of new wealth, new job possibilities and greater freedom? Or has the brave new world, as many European intellectuals have insisted, been no more than a slick reincarnation of the unfettered capitalism of the 19th century, using new technology to atomize societies, isolate the poor and advance a new ideology of exploitation upheld by an ever-wealthier, on-line global oligarchy? ''We live in an increasingly unequal world,'' said Elmar Altwater, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, ''and what we have now understood is that this will continue as long as there is no political correction. Incomes based on labor simply have not grown in real terms, even as income based on the global application of capital has soared. What is needed is more political intervention.'' Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist and adviser to the French Prime Minister, said: ''If there are systematic losers from today's global economy, we could be overwhelmed. A way must be found to bring the Frankenstein of deregulated global financial markets under control.'' Such references to ''Frankenstein'' in the same breath as ''markets'' makes many American economists grimace. After all, the United States under Bill Clinton has seen the creation of millions of new jobs, a vigorous economy that derived 30 percent of its growth from international expansion and, until recent volatility, consistently soaring share prices. In Europe, by contrast, high unemployment and increasingly strained social security systems have bolstered a far darker vision, popularized by a best seller called ''The Economic Horror'' by the French writer Viviane Forrestier. It has sold more than 310,000 copies and been translated into 17 languages. ''Shame should be quoted on the stock exchange for it is an important element of profit,'' Ms. Forrestier writes in one of the milder phrases of her uniformly bleak catalogue of contemporary devastation. Pierre Bourdieu, a French intellectual with a large and passionate following, a man who is perhaps the nearest figure the country now has to a Jean-Paul Sartre, has made his name with relentless and more sophisticated attacks against what Europeans and Latin Americans generally call ultraliberalism, that is, unfettered free-market orthodoxy. A dapper, soft-spoken man, Mr. Bourdieu argues that the central aim of ''the pure logic of the market'' has been to weaken every collective group -- the nation itself, the state, labor unions, cooperatives, associations -- to install what he calls a worldwide ''reign of absolute flexibility'' in which international capital and multinational corporations dictate terms of employment and wages. ''Ours is a Darwinian world of insecurity and stress, where the permanent threat of unemployment creates a permanent state of precariousness,'' he has written. The quest for more equitable development has been strengthened in Europe by the arrival of governments whose intellectual inspiration comes from the left: Tony Blair in London, Lionel Jospin in Paris, Massimo D'Alema in Rome and Gerhard Schroder in Bonn. It has also been reinforced by the ravages that the rapid, often herdlike daily movement of money across frontiers has recently inflicted on such societies as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil. The abrupt unmasking of Russia's sham capitalism -- with its ''stock market,'' its ''financiers'' and its privatized companies beside zero regulation, almost zero tax collection, rampant asset-stripping and a general absence of the rule of law -- has also brought home the danger of exporting a modern capitalist market economy to a society unready for it. Reviewing this and other fiascos, James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said last month, ''We have to learn to have a debate where mathematics will not dominate humanity.'' Mr. Clinton, too, has noted recently that a quarter of the world's population now lives in countries in a recession. He has begun to talk about the need to ''lift the lives of ordinary people.'' Still, what form of regulation the market needs and in what degree remain matters of sharp dispute. Mr. Blair talks about the ''rebirth of progressive politics,'' by which he seems to mean that the state has an active role to play after the Thatcher years but one that is highly disciplined and ultimately aimed at giving everyone a stake in the national economy. Mr. Clinton has proposed a ''third way,'' between capitalism and socialism. The term third way is not new, however, and has been applied during this century to everything from German social democracy through Yugoslav economic experiments to attempted reforms in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era. What both Mr. Blair's and Mr. Clinton's formulations have in common, though, is the notion that highly disciplined public entities can bring the necessary balance to market forces. So far, Western governments have instructed the World Bank to direct extra funds to ''the most vulnerable groups in society'' and provided an extra $90 billion to the International Monetary Fund to be used to try to pre-empt crises. But these are essentially short-term Band-Aids. More sweeping measures are certain to meet resistance. ''The last thing the world needs is an economic Security Council at the United Nations,'' said Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs. ''If you really want to undermine confidence, that would do it.'' He added that limits on flows of capital through controls or regulations should be approached warily. Paul Krugman of M.I.T. has argued in The New Republic, however, that pressure to constrain or limit international capital flows seems certain to grow if the response to crises continues to be governed by the need to ''mollify market sentiment.'' Mr. Krugman says that cutting interest rates is what is really needed to revive these economies and give poor people in countries like Brazil a better chance to make their way. Such limits on capital flows would be a body blow to the spirit of American capitalism, which has been so buoyant and dominant since the cold war's end. This capitalism has been revolutionary, introducing millions of people to stock-holding both directly and through mutual funds. But capitalism elsewhere has also had a much crueler face as rising poverty rates in Asia, Latin America and Russia show.''Capitalism survived after World War II,'' said Mr. Fitoussi, the French economist, ''because we invented a system where there were no consistent losers, everyone gained a little.'' The problem, he said, is that that is no longer the case.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 482-> TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE FRIEND; Starr Indicts Hubbell a 3d Time
With his sex and lies case against President Clinton losing momentum on Capitol Hill, Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, today returned to the Whitewater investigation, his original mandate, and announced the indictment of Mr. Clinton's longtime friend Webster L. Hubbell in connection with the real estate scandal. Among other accusations against Mr. Hubbell, the indictment charged that he sought to conceal from Federal regulators the role he and Hillary Rodham Clinton played in a complicated land transaction in Arkansas that helped lead to the collapse of a savings and loan institution. It was not clear from the indictment whether Mr. Starr was suggesting that Mrs. Clinton, who was not named but was referred to as ''the billing partner'' in the Rose Law Firm, had done anything improper or illegal. Mr. Hubbell, a former chief justice of the State of Arkansas and once the No. 3 official in the Clinton Justice Department, was charged with 15 counts of fraud, making false statements and trying to impede two Federal regulatory agencies and with perjury before a Congressional committee. Today's indictment was the third brought by Mr. Starr's grand jury against Mr. Hubbell in the independent counsel's five-year investigation of the President and his wife. Mr. Hubbell pleaded guilty and spent two years in prison for bilking his law partners, but a later indictment, for tax fraud, was dismissed by a Federal judge earlier this year. As Mr. Hubbell was being indicted, Mr. Starr sent new material to Congress today about his investigation into whether Mr. Clinton lied under oath about whether he made an unwanted sexual advance in 1993 to Kathleen E. Willey, a White House volunteer. [Page A10.] Speaking to reporters outside his house in Washington, Mr. Hubbell denied today's charges and said they were part of what he described as a continuing effort by Mr. Starr to force him to provide evidence against the President and Mrs. Clinton. He said that when he left prison two years ago after the earlier conviction by Mr. Starr, he hoped to begin life anew. ''I'm now of the belief that I may never be able to do so. I just do not know what it's going to take to make this matter end,'' Mr. Hubbell said. ''What I do know is that I don't know of any wrongdoing on behalf of the First Lady or the President, and nothing the independent counsel can do to me is going to make me lie about that.'' Today's indictment demonstrated that the independent counsel is continuing with his investigation despite the increasingly cool response both from the nation and from Congress to his investigations of the President and his conclusions that Mr. Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses in trying to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. Both the Hubbell indictment and the apparent disposal of the Willey matter came only days before Mr. Starr is expected to face a withering partisan cross-fire when he appears as the principal witness before the House Judiciary Committee. The committee, which is considering whether to vote impeachment charges against the President, is scheduled to question Mr. Starr on Thursday in what is anticipated as a moment of high drama. Mr. Hubbell spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to bilking his partners in the Rose law firm of Little Rock, where he had once worked with Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Starr was unable to obtain what it seemed he was really after from Mr. Hubbell in the plea agreement -- incriminating evidence against the Clintons. Mr. Starr then brought a wide-ranging indictment for tax fraud, which Mr. Hubbell again protested was an effort to get him to testify against the President and Mrs. Clinton. But a Federal judge dismissed the tax fraud case and added a stinging rebuke of Mr. Starr, saying the prosecutor had overstepped his authority. Judge James Robertson said the independent counsel's pursuit of Mr. Hubbell was a ''quintessential fishing expedition,'' after earlier calling some of Mr. Starr's constitutional views ''scary.'' Judge Robertson said the tax case was too far removed from Mr. Starr's original mandate of 1994 to investigate the Clintons' business dealings in Arkansas more than a decade ago. The indictment dismissed last July had accused Mr. Hubbell, his wife, Suzanna, and two advisers of scheming in the last four years to avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000. Prosecutors had contended that much of the owed taxes stemmed from money Mr. Hubbell had embezzled and from hundreds of thousands of dollars in income from jobs referred to him by friends and supporters of the President. The indictment said Mr. Hubbell did little work for those jobs and suggested that they might have been arranged to discourage him from cooperating with investigators. Today's indictment seemed designed to be insulated from Judge Robertson's charge. Most importantly, the charges are tied directly to the original topic Mr. Starr was supposed to investigate, the Clintons' connection to a complicated and sprawling web of real estate transactions in Arkansas before the President and First Lady occupied the White House. The indictment concerns a real estate development known as Castle Grande that was funded by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which was owned at the time by James B. and Susan H. McDougal. Madison Guaranty eventually failed, and Federal regulators have attributed part of the failure to its involvement in the Castle Grande development. The indictment does not mention Mrs. Clinton by name but refers more than 20 times to the ''1985-86 billing partner'' on the Madison Guaranty account, a description of Mrs. Clinton's role in the transaction. According to the indictment, Mr. Hubbell's alleged concealment of the role he and Mrs. Clinton played in the Castle Grande development defrauded the Federal government in two ways. Had the Rose law firm disclosed its activities in connection with Castle Grande to Federal regulators, the law firm would probably have been prohibited from lucrative legal contracts with the same Federal agencies. Under the employment contract, the firm was obliged to disclose what appeared to be a conflict of interest. In addition, Mr. Starr charged, the concealment interfered with the ability of the regulators to understand just how troubled an institution Madison Guaranty was, delaying its shutdown at an increased cost to taxpayers. The indictment does not say that Mrs. Clinton played any role in concealing the work that she and Mr. Hubbell did on the Castle Grande deal. Federal regulators had described the transaction as a sham, and Mrs. Clinton had for a time denied any involvement with the matter. But when long-missing billing records from the law firm were discovered in the White House book room in January 1996, two years after they were subpoenaed by Mr. Starr, Mrs. Clinton said she remembered having done legal work on the account but knew it by a different name. The indictment charges that Mr. Hubbell ''schemed to falsify, conceal and cover up the true nature'' of the role he and Mrs. Clinton played in the Castle Grande transaction in order to defraud the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency set up to coordinate the savings and loan bailout. ''Legal work performed on'' Castle Grande ''was performed by defendant Webster L. Hubbell'' and other lawyers, including ''the 1985-1986 Rose billing attorney,'' the indictment said. The indictment noted that regulators from the two Federal agencies concluded that Castle Grande involved ''insider dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'' Regulators estimate the failed development cost taxpayers nearly $4 million. The indictment said Mr. Hubbell took steps to assist his father-in-law, Seth Ward, in keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans that he obtained from Madison Guaranty. Mr. Ward, regulators said, was a ''straw'' buyer of parts of the Castle Grande tract.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 485-> Andrew Lloyd Webber's Latest Audience: A Jury in Federal District Court
Andrew Lloyd Webber sat at a piano in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday and played part of a song that another composer swears he wrote first. The impromptu recital for a nine-member jury, several lawyers and a few reporters is likely to be the finale of an eight-year-old copyright infringement lawsuit brought against Lord Lloyd Webber by Ray Repp, a composer. The suit alleges that Lord Lloyd Webber stole a short passage from a song by Mr. Repp, ''Till You'' (1978), and recast it as the central theme of the musical ''Phantom of the Opera.'' Lord Lloyd Webber has strenuously denied the charges, and took to the stand -- and the piano -- to prove his case. ''I have just always loved these chords,'' he said, playing several snippets from ''Phantom's'' main theme. ''And so it started like that.'' Mr. Repp's lawyers, however, insisted that Lord Lloyd Webber had lifted the melody of their client's song and reworked the tune into his musical, which has been playing in New York since 1988 and has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. The suit seeks part of the musical's royalties, a figure that could quickly run into the millions of dollars. ''The proof is in the music itself,'' said William R. Coulson, a lawyer for Mr. Repp. ''Just listen.'' And so the jury did, listening to recorded passages of music from several of Lord Lloyd Webber's musicals, while the composer, in the stand, looked slightly embarrassed. During cross-examination, the jury also received something of a primer in Lord Lloyd Webber's career and accomplishments. ''I've been very lucky,'' he said as he told about his many Tony Awards. ''And as much as I hate to say it, I have been knighted by the Queen.'' Mr. Repp has been less fortunate. A composer of religious folk music, he says he created ''Till You'' in 1976 while strumming his guitar. He later added lyrics inspired by the Gospel of St. Luke, and recorded and copyrighted the song in 1978. Its gross sales, through 1996, were $75.87. Mr. Repp claims that in 1989, he received a compact disk of ''Phantom of the Opera'' and was struck by the similarity between several bars in the musical's main theme and the melody of ''Till You.'' ''As soon as I heard it, I said 'Holy cow! He stole my song,' '' said Mr. Repp, 56, who lives in Bel Air, Md. ''I want my song back.'' To that end, Mr. Repp's music company, K & R Music, filed suit. But in 1991, Lord Lloyd Webber's lawyers struck back with a countersuit alleging that Mr. Repp had in fact stolen the melody for ''Till You'' from a song from their client's 1969 musical ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Lord Lloyd Webber lost that suit, and Mr. Repp's suit was dismissed by Judge Shirley W. Kram, who is also presiding over the current trial. But in January, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Mr. Repp's suit and ordered that it be tried before a jury. The case is just one of several high-profile copyright cases involving musicals. In September, the family of the late composer Jonathan Larson, who wrote the musical ''Rent,'' reached an out-of-court settlement with Lynn M. Thompson, who claimed she had written some of the show's lyrics and dialogue. Yesterday, Lord Lloyd Webber testified that the impetus for his song came in 1983 when he was trying to create a song for his wife at the time, Sarah Brightman, who starred in the original New York production of ''Phantom.'' ''I wanted to play around with what we could do with Sarah's voice,'' Lord Lloyd Webber said. ''And I just came up with this.'' Ms. Brightman, testifying earlier in the day, gave the same version of events. But Mr. Repp's lawyers offered the testimony of two professors of music, James Mack and H. Wiley Hitchcock, both of whom said there were similarities between the two compositions. Mr. Coulson also peppered Lord Lloyd Webber with questions about musical tastes and background, sometimes drawing unintended laughs from the small crowd. ''I firmly believe there are two types of music,'' Lord Lloyd Webber said. ''Good and bad.'' The jury is expected to begin deliberations today. No further performances are scheduled.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 487-> Red Holzman, Ex-Maestro Of the Knicks, Is Dead at 78
Red Holzman, the Hall of Fame coach who led the New York Knicks to their only two National Basketball Association championships, died last night at Long Island Jewish Hospital. He was 78. Holzman, whose wife, Selma, died in July, died of complications from leukemia, according to their daughter, Gail. When he retired from coaching in 1982, Holzman was the second-winningest coach in N.B.A. history, with a .535 winning percentage. His 696 victories in regular-season play were second then only to Red Auerbach's 938, and the number of his triumphs as a Knick coach -- 613, by far the most in club history -- was retired on a Knick jersey and raised to the Madison Square Garden rafters in 1990. Holzman was the molder, conductor and architect of one of the most unusual, most thrilling and, for the involved basketball fan, most gratifying teams ever assembled. The 1970 and 1973 championship Knick teams -- the team lost in the finals in 1972 -- featured, in one or both seasons, Willis Reed at center; Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Cazzie Russell and Jerry Lucas at the forwards, and Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe and Dick Barnett at the guards. The teams brought an excitement to the Garden that the so-called Mecca of Basketball had rarely seen from hometown professional play. The Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers of Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in a grueling seven-game series for their first title, and Holzman was named coach of the year. They beat the Lakers again in 1973, this time in five games. Holzman was voted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., in 1991, on the strength of his ability to successfully instill the basic precepts of the game into his team, and that was teamwork. ''I don't think there is such a thing as a coaching genius,'' Holzman said, ''just hard workers.'' Holzman's hard work revolved around the fundamentals of the game. ''I stressed defense -- pressure defense,'' he once said. ''And team basketball. And, on offense, moving the ball to hit the open man.'' In huddles he would sometimes let his players devise plays to create baskets. As for defense, however, he was the sole voice. Holzman, a City College of New York all-American, a pioneer player in the N.B.A. with the Rochester Royals and a former coach with the Milwaukee and St. Louis Hawks, had been a scout for the Knicks when, in December 1967, the team owner, Ned Irish, decided to replace the coach, Dick McGuire. The team was in last place, and Irish decided to reach out to the nearest candidate, which he presumed to be Holzman. Holzman was not interested. ''I like scouting,'' he said. But Irish persisted. ''And I realized that if I didn't take the coaching job,'' Holzman said, ''I might not have any job.'' Holzman began his Knick reign by fining several players for coming late to his first practice. The fines were for $10 each, but they set a tone. To some, Holzman could be quite tough. ''During Red's early years, he was by design a superauthoritarian,'' Bradley said, ''and I was one of his targets for abuse. I would go for days without speaking to him. But his manner changed after we won the championship in 1970, and he became downright paternal and kind. Playing basketball became more fun than I had ever imagined.'' But on the sideline, the tail of Holzman's suit jacket flapping in the imaginary wind, he could be vociferous, particularly to referees. But he always seemed to keep his poise and sense of humor. On the surface, Holzman seemed an uncomplicated man, but he had many layers. He liked to tell reporters that he was boring, and that they should look elsewhere for the good stories. One writer wrote a column in which he imagined Holzman disappearing in his office in a cloud of humility. But indeed he understood his value, and had a wide range of interests: he read history books and detective novels, and he was a lover of films, particularly the old ones, and of good food and drink. He and his wife bought a house in Cedarhurst, N.Y., in the affluent Five Towns area of Long Island in the 1950's, and stayed there all their lives, raising Gail, their only child. But the house was as understated as Red Holzman's life seemed -- away from the basketball court, that is. For a long time, the television in their den was not color. ''What's wrong with black and white?'' he asked. He had nine suits, he said, all the same color. ''Who's looking?'' he wanted to know. He ordered his clothes by mail. ''They know my size,'' he said. And he was a street philosopher of sorts, with such homemade axioms as ''Never let a bald barber cut your hair, he has no respect for it. After the Knicks made the playoffs in the season in which Holzman took over the club, he agreed to stay on as coach. In December of the next season, the team traded for DeBusschere, giving the Knicks a tremendous force around the basket, as a defensive forward and long-range shooter. It was the piece that made the difference. Later, Holzman helped to engineer a trade that brought Monroe to the Knicks. Many thought the Knicks would need two basketballs, with Frazier and Monroe both needing to handle the ball in the backcourt. But under Holzman's guidance and team orientation, the players fit in perfectly. William Holzman was born on Aug. 10, 1920, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and moved with his family to a tenement in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn when he was 4 years old. His parents were Jewish immigrants, his mother from Romania, his father from Russia. His mother, Sophie, was, he said, ''a terrific cook and made every meal taste as if you were eating it for the first time in your life.'' His father, Abraham, was a tailor, and, like many Jewish parents, discouraged his son from playing sports. But young ''Roita,'' as he called him, which was Yiddish for Red -- Yiddish was the language Holzman grew up with -- became a standout athlete at Franklin K. Lane High School (which in 1977 named its new sports facility the William Red Holzman Gymnasium). Red was the tallest person in his family, at 5 feet 10 inches. He received a basketball scholarship to the University of Baltimore. ''But I missed the soul food that my mother made, and I was always hungry,'' he recalled. ''I missed my folks. I missed Selma. And after six months I transferred to City College of New York.'' He became an all-America guard for two seasons there for the legendary taskmaster-coach Nat Holman, whose basketball philosophies of aggressive defense, movement without the ball, and hitting the open man Red would bring to perfection in his time as a coach. In 1942 he enlisted in the Navy and was placed in the morale unit at the Norfolk Naval Base. His job was to play basketball against other service and college teams, and he became friendly with a baseball player on the base, Phil Rizzuto. On one weekend pass, he returned to Brooklyn and married Selma. Holzman went on to play nine seasons for the Royals, playing alongside such stars as Bobby Davies and Bobby Wanzer. He was an integral part of the N.B.A. championship team that beat the Knicks in a seven-game finals series in 1951 -- and was dribbling the ball, killing the clock, protecting the 4-point lead at game's end. He played briefly for the Milwaukee Hawks -- he finished his career with a 7.4-point scoring average and then took over as coach when the franchise moved to St. Louis in 1955 -- until midway through the 1956-57 season when, despite having taken the team to the playoffs the season before, he was replaced. In 1959 Holzman was hired as chief scout for the Knicks, a move engineered by his pal Fuzzy Levane, then the coach of the Knicks. In an age before mass communications allowed for few secrets of prospects, Holzman beat the bushes, traveling all over the country in search of possible players. His recommendations included players like Reed and Frazier. Holzman became general manager and coach of the Knicks and repaid a favor by hiring Levane as scout. But when the great Knick teams began to dissolve because of age and injuries, Holzman was fired in 1977 after the team missed the playoffs for the second straight year, and was replaced by Reed. Two years later he was brought back as coach and remained until after the 1981-82 season. With a new set of players, Holzman, then 62 and the oldest coach in the league, was unable to duplicate his earlier triumphs. He remained a consultant to the Knicks, and a valued elder statesman. He is survived by his daughter and one grandchild. Through the good days and bad, Holzman retained his sophisticated yet homespun composure. In winter he played mixed tennis doubles (''the women usually beat me, but I give them a workout'') and in summer he regularly went to an oceanside club near his home. ''I like to go to the beach,'' he said, lighting up a cigar. ''It's a good life.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 489-> Request to Alter Space Station Orbit Is Dropped
NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced today. While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. ''We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' Mr. Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ''It added technical complexity and risks to the mission that were not justified.'' The decision, which followed ''frank and candid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by the United States, he said. ''The conclusions were mutual,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''Both sides concluded that it did not make sense.'' The Russians, struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move. However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives, wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have agreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project. ''The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding,'' Mr. Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it does not interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part, an American-built connecting passageway that attaches to the first module.

Dec. 15, 1998-> 490-> After 6 Weeks, Vacco Concedes Attorney General Race to Spitzer
After battling the inevitable for six weeks, Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco returned to his hometown today to concede to Eliot L. Spitzer, his Democratic opponent, declining to say why he had stubbornly fought the results of last month's election but pledging to cooperate fully in the transition. Mr. Spitzer accepted Mr. Vacco's belated concession with a smile. ''He was gracious today, and that's all I am going to say,'' the Attorney General-elect said. ''As of today, it is no longer a matter of looking backward.'' The Vacco concession came after a protracted, controversial series of legal challenges by Mr. Vacco's campaign, which asserted that his re-election was thwarted by widespread voter fraud and election irregularities in New York City. Mr. Vacco and his lawyers were unable to substantiate their allegations, and their legal fight came to an end today when a State Supreme Court justice dismissed all of the complaints brought by the Vacco campaign. The judge, Thomas Keegan, said Mr. Vacco, who sought to be named Attorney General by the court or to have a new election ordered, failed to demonstrate his contention that thousands upon thousands of votes were cast illegally in New York City. ''The time has come to bring finality to this election,'' the judge said. The court's decision paved the way for the State Board of Elections to certify Mr. Spitzer as the next Attorney General on Tuesday, with a lead of slightly more than 26,000 votes over Mr. Vacco, out of more than 4 million votes that were cast. In speaking to reporters and a large crowd of family members, colleagues and supporters, Mr. Vacco did not directly address how or why he had decided to abandon his legal maneuvers to remain in office. ''I've got a lot to say about that,'' Mr. Vacco said, speaking in a ballroom in the office building that also houses the Attorney General's office in Buffalo. ''But now is not the time and place.'' Invoking his two young sons' names, Mr. Vacco added: ''This decision was based on what's in the best interest of Alex and Connor. This was the right decision for them.'' At times smiling and at others tight-lipped and fighting tears, he said little about the six-week legal wrangling that ensnared the courts and threatened a crisis over whether either candidate would be certified as the state's 63d Attorney General. Since the election, Mr. Vacco has been vilified by Democratic leaders in the state for his efforts to keep Mr. Spitzer from taking office. In particular, Mr. Vacco was criticized for his unsuccessful attempt to invoke a rarely used state law that would have required police officers to conduct door-to-door visits to verify the eligibility of more than 100,000 New York City voters. He was also accused of trying to intimidate the black and Hispanic neighborhoods where Mr. Spitzer won handily. But that plan fell through when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani refused to instruct the police to cooperate without a judge's order, which was not forthcoming. While Mr. Vacco's legal strategy was championed by William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman, the Attorney General made it clear in his remarks today that he was every bit as committed to the legal activity after the election as the party leader. ''You know that I would not have pursued something frivolously,'' Mr. Vacco said. But the Republican incumbent made it apparent that he intended to cooperate fully with his successor in the weeks before Mr. Spitzer takes office. ''The transition will be like a hot knife through butter,'' Mr. Vacco said. ''It will occur in an orderly process.'' He said he had named the state's Solicitor General, Barbara Billet, to head the transition. ''And I told Eliot,'' Mr. Vacco said, ''that if there are any issues they cannot resolve, he should call me, and he and I will work it out.'' Mr. Vacco had called Mr. Spitzer this morning to congratulate him and to pledge his support in assuring a smooth transition. In the Spitzer camp, the concession drew expressions of relief. ''He waged a fight that he believed he had to fight,'' Mr. Spitzer said at an afternoon news conference at his law office in midtown Manhattan. Mr. Spitzer also announced his official transition committee, a list that includes dozens of political, business and civil heavyweights, like Robert Abrams, a former state attorney general; former Mayors David N. Dinkins and Edward I. Koch; C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough President; Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly Speaker, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Last month, Mr. Spitzer appointed Lloyd E. Constantine, his law partner and the former head of the antitrust unit of the Attorney General's office, to head his transition team. Mr. Spitzer said he had already started interviewing lawyers, but he said he intended to keep ''most'' of the 450 lawyers now on the Attorney General's staff. In a statement, Gov. George E. Pataki praised the work of Mr. Vacco, a fellow Republican, and congratulated Mr. Spitzer on his victory. After a tumultuous race for attorney general, the unusual scrutiny from the Board of Elections that followed it, and wild twists and turns that included the involvement of the Giuliani administration and even the New York City Police Department, the end was starkly anticlimactic. Mr. Vacco's concession in Buffalo was a quiet one, punctuated only by bursts of applause from workers in his office here. Earlier in the day in an interview, Mr. Vacco was a bit more open about what he characterized as the difficulty that the uncertainty of the election's outcome caused for him and his family. ''I have tried to be the rock for my family and for the people in the office, for my friends and supporters who have tried to be optimistic,'' he said on a plane this morning headed here from Albany. ''But the last six weeks have been tough. It's difficult to express in words. The fact is, I would rather have had the election turn out differently.'' Mr. Vacco's concession today marked his first public appearance since the Nov. 3 election, except for a trip to Washington to announce a settlement between several states and the tobacco industry. ''You didn't hear from me,'' he said today, ''because I wasn't about to try my case in the press.'' He said he had not begun to consider what he will do next. ''I'm 18 months shy of having spent 20 years in public or government service,'' he said. ''I can honestly say that I haven't considered another job up until this point. Now, I guess, I'll have to go out and find a job.''

Nov. 14, 1998-> 491-> Salomon to Delay Bonuses For Review by New Managers
In a sign that the turmoil at Citigroup Inc. may be far from over, the financial giant's investment banking unit, Salomon Smith Barney, told employees yesterday that they will have to wait a month longer than usual to collect their annual bonus. The company will pay bonuses on Jan. 28, 1999, a month later than scheduled. Bonuses usually make up the bulk of an investment banker's annual compensation and are the subject of intense competition and scrutiny. The decision was detailed in an internal memorandum that stated that the company needed ''adequate time to effectively manage the compensation process.'' The memo said that Michael A. Carpenter and Victor J. Menezes, the two executives in charge of managing the combined entity's corporate banking group, needed additional time to figure out bonuses. Earlier this month, Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the co-chairmen of Citigroup, promoted Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Menezes to their new roles after dismissing James Dimon, the Citigroup president and heir apparent. The delay immediately raised concerns among bankers at Salomon, many of whom are already shaken by the rapid-fire changes at Citigroup. The concerns include worries that the new Citigroup will pay smaller bonuses than Salomon employees expect. Combining commercial and investment banking operations frequently brings about compensation conflicts, because many Wall Street investment banks pay their employees more than traditional banks do. Employees said they were also concerned that Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Menezes would disregard the compensation process that was already in full motion when Mr. Dimon and his chief lieutenant, Steven D. Black, left the company. ''There's a sense that the new guys want to do this their way -- and no one thinks that is good news for us,'' said one Salomon Smith Barney banker, who insisted on anonymity. Many on Wall Street expect that Salomon bankers unhappy about their prospects since the departure of the popular Mr. Dimon will leave, but not until they collect their bonuses. The delay in paying bonuses gives a bit more time for the dust to settle before anyone defects. It also allows the new leadership to reallocate the bonus pool in favor of people it considers vital -- and to the disadvantage of those it does not value as highly. Other employees said they did not find anything especially disturbing about the announcement. One said that turbulent financial markets combined with the management shake-up made this an especially tricky year for deciding pay levels. ''I give them the benefit of the doubt; they just need another month to get this done,'' one said. A Citigroup spokesman said the company did not comment on compensation issues.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 493-> Two Poets Quit Board Of Academy in Protest
Two prominent American poets, both of them women, have resigned as chancellors of the Academy of American Poets, a venerable body at the symbolic center of the American poetry establishment, to protest the absence of blacks and other minority groups on the academy's board of chancellors. The chancellors, Carolyn Kizer and Maxine Kumin, both of whom have lobbied to admit minorities to the board, submitted their resignations to Jonathan Galassi, the academy's president, this week. ''There's never been a black woman chancellor,'' Ms. Kizer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1985, said in a telephone interview. Ms. Kizer said she was also upset by a larger problem, which she defined as ''the insularity among the chancellors, and the lack of women.'' Ms. Kumin, who won a Pulitzer in 1974, said in an interview: ''I don't like the way the collection of chancellors sets itself apart from the mainstream. I don't want to see it identified with elitism. It's very much an East Coast group.'' The academy, which was founded in 1934 by Marie Bullock and is based in SoHo, promotes poetry nationally. Its 12-member board of chancellors exists mainly to administer the Tanning Prize, at $100,000 the country's largest literary award, and a smaller prize, the Academy Fellowship, of $20,000. The board includes some of the country's best known and most influential poets, John Ashbery, Richard Howard, John Hollander, Jorie Graham, Donald Justice, J. D. McClatchy, Mark Strand, Mona Van Duyn, David Wagoner and W. S. Merwin. This year it awarded the Tanning Prize to A. R. Ammons. ''They always go to the same person again and again,'' said Ms. Kizer, meaning, she said, that the prize is frequently awarded to white male poets. When the first Tanning Prize was awarded in 1994, Ms. Kizer said she had lobbied for it to go to Gwendolyn Brooks, a black poet. The chancellors awarded the prize instead to Mr. Merwin, and were criticized because he was himself a chancellor. In 1996, Adrienne Rich won the prize. Other winners have been James Tate and Anthony Hecht. Since 1946, when the academy began awarding its annual fellowship, that prize has been given to just two African-American poets, Jay Wright and Robert Hayden. Of the 64 Fellowships that have been awarded, 14 have gone to women. Since the academy was founded there have been 57 chancellors. Twelve women have been elected, but there has never been a black chancellor. Ms. Kumin said that as vacancies have occurred, she has lobbied for the poet Lucille Clifton, who is black, to be elected. ''We've just been outvoted,'' she said. Mr. Galassi, president of the academy and editor in chief of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, said of the resignations of Ms. Kumin and Ms. Kizer: ''I was very sorry that they are doing this at a time when we are in the process of putting our governing structure through review.'' He said that he would not accept the resignations and that he would try to persuade both poets to remain as chancellors to help him make changes at the academy. Mr. Galassi said the academy was in the process of assembling an ad hoc committee that ''will look at the constitution of the chancellors.'' ''The academy has been in the process of broadening for four or five years, and before that,'' he said. ''We started the National Poetry Month. We are starting a Poetry Book Club, an on-line poetry classroom. They're all outreach programs. They are very inclusive.'' He added, ''We want to be an organization for everyone.'' William Wadsworth, the academy's executive director, added that the lack of women and minority group members on the board of chancellors ''has always been a controversial aspect of the academy.'' This year, the German writer Fred Viebahn, who is married to Rita Dove, a black poet and former Poet Laureate of the United States, attacked the academy in International Quarterly for what he said was ''unapologetic racial 'purity' and gross gender imbalance.'' Mr. Viebahn pointed out that the academy had received $250,000 from the Lila Acheson Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund in 1997, and criticized the National Endowment for the Arts for awarding the academy $95,000 this year despite what he called a ''tradition of race 'purity' in its highest ranks.'' Mr. Galassi called the charge ''totally unfair.'' ''If you look at what the academy is doing, and who is working there, I just don't think you can say it's exclusionary,'' he said. ''But even the appearance of being exclusionary is unfortunate and needs to be addressed. And that's what we're in the process of doing.'' The academy's board of directors as opposed to the board of chancellors controls the day-to-day running of the institution; the chancellors are mainly responsible for the two prizes. The board of directors has 26 members and only one of them, Jamaica Kincaid, is black. Seven are women. Until 1987, there were no blacks or Jews on the board of directors. That year, when Lyn Chase, an heiress to the Folger coffee fortune, became president, she began recruiting Jews and blacks. Mr. Wadsworth pointed out that the academy's full-time staff of 10 has several people from minority groups and the academy proper administers 160 college prizes and awards, worth about $92,000, a number of which go to women and minorities. Among the prizes the academy itself gives are the Walt Whitman Award, which is $5,000 along with book distribution worth $35,000. It administers two other book publication awards, the James Laughlin Award and the Lenore Marshall Prize. ''The chancellors sound like they are the universally recognized spokespersons for the world of poetry,'' said Ms. Dove, who has served as a judge for the academy's Walt Whitman award and has taken part in many academy functions. ''To have an academy where minorities and women are underrepresented or not represented does send a subliminal message to the world that there may not be minorities who are poets or many women who are poets.'' Ms. Dove said she had no interest in being a chancellor herself. ''The message the makeup of the board is sending is the message that we are the ones who hold the power,'' said Ms. Dove, ''and it's a closed club.''

Dec. 15, 1998-> 495-> Biologists Close In on the 'Tick-Tock' Genes
In a widely reported and strange-sounding experiment last spring, scientists at Cornell University reported that they had been able to reset human biological clocks by shining intense light on the backs of people's knees. Weird as it sounded, however, this was only one in a burst of stunning experiments that are disclosing new insights into the ways that biological organisms keep and tell time. Scientists have found that plants, insects and animals have basically the same genes for regulating their biological clocks -- built-in timers that tell an organism when each day begins and ends. Human clocks control changes in body temperature, blood pressure, mental alertness and many other rhythms. Plant clocks reveal when it is dawn or dusk and time to grow or rest. Insect clocks guide feeding behavior and a host of other functions that help bugs survive. Perhaps even more astonishingly, these genes and the proteins they make are active in nearly every cell of every organism studied. That is, they are ticking away in every petal, leaf and stalk; in every wing, thorax and antenna; in every brain, muscle and skin cell of the human body. ''Clocks are everywhere,'' said Dr. Aziz Sancar, a biochemist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, who has carried out several of the groundbreaking experiments. It seems that nature preserves what works, Dr. Sancar said. Papers describing these discoveries have appeared in several prestigious scientific journals. Eighteen months ago very little was known about the genetics of biological clocks. ''Now we have at least six genes and more on the horizon,'' said Dr. Joseph Takahashi, head of the Center for Biological Timing at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Scientists have long theorized that human body rhythms, such as the feeling of being sleepy or awake, are governed by a master internal clock that sits deep in the brain. Its activity causes hormones to be released throughout the body, affecting all cyclical functions. The new experiments -- which involve finding potential clock genes from huge banks of DNA sequence information and knocking those genes out of plants, flies and mice to see what happens -- are aimed at shedding light on the details of how these clocks tell time and maintain rhythms throughout the rest of the body. To begin with, biologists theorize, a pigment has to sense light and transmit that signal to a clock, which in turn oscillates in a 24-hour cycle, and which in turn controls other genes that establish rhythms throughout the organism. The first puzzle is finding how light is detected and how it gets collected, Dr. Sancar said. For that, one needs photoreceptors -- molecules on the surface of a cell that are activated by light -- and what better place to look, at least in animals, than the eye. The back of the retina has a rich layer of photoreceptors called opsins, he said. They detect light and colors and send those signals to visual areas in the brain. For decades, researchers felt that the same or similar receptors were responsible for collecting light and sending signals to the master clock, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The trouble is, no one could ever find those receptors, Dr. Sancar said. Mice whose visual photoreceptors are destroyed by disease still have circadian rhythms. Many blind people with no conscious perception of light have normal biological clocks. Everyone was stumped, Dr. Sancar said. Then, in 1993, a clue to the puzzle emerged from an unlikely source. Dr. Anthony Cashmore of the University of Pennsylvania isolated a plant gene, called cryptochrome, that responded to blue light -- the kind most abundant early in the morning or at dusk. At the time, Dr. Sancar was studying an enzyme, found in many organisms, that repairs DNA and that is activated by blue light. In combing through genome sequences, Dr. Sancar found a snippet of human DNA that was very similar to his blue light-activated enzyme. But humans did not seem to have this repair mechanism, he said, so he and his colleagues wanted to find out what this gene did. They isolated the gene, grew it in a common bacterium and extracted the protein made by the gene. ''Indeed, it was not a repair enzyme,'' Dr. Sancar said. ''It was very close to the cryptochrome found in plants. I thought, what else do humans do with light? We use it for seeing and for synchronizing our circadian clocks. And so in 1996, I suggested these proteins are involved in the human circadian clock.'' This idea was widely rejected, Dr. Takahashi said, until the recent experiments manipulating crypto chrome genes in plants, flies and mice proved Dr. Sancar to be correct. For example, a mouse that is missing the cryptochrome 2 gene will run on a wheel at odd hours, showing its clock mechanism has been damaged. Mutated fruit flies show similar dysfunctions. Further tests showed that cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes are actively expressed throughout the mammalian body, in muscle, skin, brain and eye. The retina has 10 layers, Dr. Sancar said, with opsins in the back-most region. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 are expressed near the front of the retina and may be spared in many forms of human blindness. They seem to play a major role in setting biological clocks, he said, by detecting blue light. When activated, they send impulses to the master clock, which sets biological rhythms. The second part of the puzzle -- how does the master clock keep time -- has been solved by Dr. Takahashi and others. In flies and mice, the scientists had identified four genes (and their four respective proteins) that regulate each other in a loop lasting 24 hours. Two of the genes turn on the activity of the other two. The way it works is that the activated genes produce proteins, which turn off the activating genes. Once the genes are activated, these proteins slowly accumulate over a 12-hour period and are then reabsorbed into the nucleus, where they turn off the first two activating genes. Once these proteins are depleted, the cycle begins anew. ''It's a surprisingly simple clock,'' Dr. Takahashi said. ''Two genes are activators and two are inhibitors'' working in concert. The third part of the puzzle is better understood, at least in humans. Signals travel from the master clock to the pineal gland and other centers that release hormones throughout the body. These hormones regulate cycles at the tissue level. The whereabouts of a central clock in plants and insects is unknown. But a bigger mystery remains for humans: What are all these time-keeping genes and proteins doing in skin and muscle cells? ''We are ticking all over our bodies,'' Dr. Takahashi said. ''In my view, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is still the master pacemaker. All these peripheral clocks may work in a hierarchy similar to the heart. ''Each heart cell can beat intrinsically but the heart functions as a synchronous whole with a single pacemaker to drive the system. The same may be true for the circadian system. Besides, there is no good evidence of feedback from the periphery to the master clock.'' Nevertheless, scientists at Cornell University had their shining success last spring when they showed that human biological clocks could be reset at the back of the knee. If this experiment can be replicated by other scientists, researchers will need to explain how the light signal is carried from skin cells to brain cells. The pigments in blood are among the candidates. In the meantime, the new findings may have practical value. ''If we know the genes that make up the clock, there should be drugs that target the clock alone and not the rest of the body,'' Dr. Takahashi said. ''This may be useful in treating insomnia caused by defects in the clock system.'' Dr. Sancar has another suggestion. Opsins use vitamin A as a cofactor, which is why people are told to eat carrots for good vision. But cryptochromes use vitamin B2 as a cofactor in absorbing light, he said. Thus vitamin B2 might be helpful to some people in treating jet lag, depression and other problems linked to biological clocks that are out of whack.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 496-> S.E.C. Warns Banks Against Overgenerous Reserve Levels
When Federal regulators become concerned about how banks account for loans, most often they worry that the institutions have not set enough money aside to cover expected losses. But yesterday, securities regulators said that Suntrust Bank Inc. had done just the reverse. The bank had set aside too much money in its reserves, they said. In essence, the bank had said in its financial statements that it would not collect on some outstanding loans even though they would most likely be paid. After talking with regulators, Suntrust agreed to decrease its loan reserves by $100 million -- an adjustment that will force the bank to restate earnings for 1994, 1995 and 1996. After the corrections, earnings in those years will spring up by a total of $61 million after taxes. Regulators are concerned that companies of all types, enjoying booming profits in recent years, have been improperly increasing their reserves as a way of insulating themselves from shareholder anger when business turns bad. By setting aside excessive reserves, a company that later has a bad quarter can reach into those reserves for some dollars to tack on to actual earnings so that the stock market is not disappointed. The result: the company's financial statements do not accurately tell investors what happened. James C. Armstrong, a spokesman at Suntrust, said the bank's executives had no intention of using the loan reserves to enhance future earnings. Instead, the bank has always been conservative in accounting for loans, he said. Mr. Armstrong said the bank and the regulators had simply used different assumptions in estimating future losses. ''Two rational people can take the same information,'' he added, ''and come to very different conclusions.'' Regulators had been reviewing the financial statements of Suntrust, a large Southeastern bank based in Atlanta, because of its proposed merger with the Crestar Financial Corporation. Suntrust agreed in July to acquire Crestar for $9.5 billion in stock, creating the nation's 10th-largest banking company. In the last year, securities regulators have become worried about what they say is a growing number of companies playing games with their numbers. In September, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, condemned the ''accounting hocus-pocus,'' saying that regulators planned to crack down on more companies that were bending or breaking the nation's accounting rules. One of the problems, he said, was companies creating illusions on their books by using unrealistic assumptions to estimate liabilities for loan losses, sales returns and warranty costs. ''They stash accruals in cookie jars during the good times,'' he said, ''and reach into them when needed in the bad times.'' It is not only at small companies that the questionable practices are found, Mr. Levitt added. ''It's also happening in companies whose products we know and admire,'' he said.

Nov. 14, 1998-> 497-> Saudi Was Target In Raid, U.S. Says
Clinton Administration officials now acknowledge that one of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid in Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been charged by Federal prosecutors with leading a global war against American interests and who has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two American embassies in East Africa. In the months before the raid, the officials say, White House lawyers conducted a review and concluded that such operations are legal under American and international law. Although a 1976 executive order bars anyone working for the United States Government from plotting or carrying out assassinations, the lawyers said the President has authority to target the ''infrastructure'' of terrorist groups attacking Americans. A senior official said this week that the infrastructure of Mr. bin Laden's group was mostly ''human.'' Article, page A3.
