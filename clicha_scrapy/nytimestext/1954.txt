108-> The Screen in Review; 'Personal Affair' Billed at Palace Theatre
WHAT happens in an English community when a teen-age schoolgirl disappears under circumstances that cause dark suspicions that she and her married schoolmaster have been doing more than parsing verbs is talked about with some emotion in the British film, "Personal Affair," yesterday's screen arrival on the Palace's vaudeville bill. And that is the principal trouble—it is talked about at such length that what drama there is in the crisis is pretty well talked into the ground.Lesley Storm has contrived a situation in the script, adapted from her own play, which possesses possibilities, for all the familiarity of the theme. What are the dismal consequences of such a blow to the innocent man? What sort of anguish does the gossip cause his uneasy wife? What are the thoughts of the girl's parents? How about the cruel reaction in the town? And what are the effects upon the youngster when she eventually returns?Under Anthony Pelissier's close direction, a pretty good cast, which includes Leo Genn as the schoolmaster, Glynis Johns as the girl and Walter Fitzgerald as the father, as well as Gene Tierney as the schoolmaster's wife, goes at this delicate subject in a taut and solemn way, developing several touching details in their predominant sessions of talk. And occasionally the conversations reach minor peaks of eloquence which do indicate some human suffering and tap the emotional chords.But, for the most part, the going is too steady, the situation is kept too well in hand, everyone tries to be too chin-up and the scandal is too refined. It is an earnest and plausible study. It notes how dangerous suspicions can be. But it doesn't develop much excitement. It is a decent, eventually tedious film. PERSONAL AFFAIR, screen play by Lesley Storm from her play; directed by Anthony Pelissier; produced by Anthony Darnborough. A. J. Arthur Rank Organization Presentation released by United Artists.

320-> At the Stanley
FIVE seasons ago Hollywood turned out a nice transcription of Gogol's classical stage comedy, "The Inspector General," measured and tailored accordingly for Danny Kaye. Some spectators may have wondered how such sophisticated abandon would match a homeland version by a group like the Moscow Art Players. On Saturday at the Stanley Theatre, this renowned body had its say-so, in a tasteful, slightly rigid and generally imposing rendition of the real McCoy.Western audiences, used to low-keyed histrionics and camera agility, can expect two things at the outset of this Mosfilm Studio production and Artkino release. With all due respect to the cast's seasoned elasticity and the satirical content, the performances are unrelievedly raucous. These close-quarter vibrations, and the plentiful talk, result from a photographed play, as this import unquestionably is.However, the text, after all these years, seems as wonderful as ever. Here it emerges as a labor of love and by no means a pedestrian, reverential reprise. Photographed in Sovcolor, the background interiors and some scattered landscapes provide a handsome, authentic-looking village canvas. Vladimir Petrõv's direction of the faithful scenario (credited to himself), misses none of the original's ironic perception and rollicking absurdity. I. Gorbachev plays the hero, the visiting dandy mistaken for a St. Petersburg inspector, who blandly fleeces the graft-ridden pillars of the community, leaving them to their own shattered resources.Mr. Gorbachev's trumpeting and excessive languor may be exactly what the playwright had in mind. Even so, we find it hard to believe that his victims, such master craftsmen of embezzlement, could be so collectively hoodwinked.The others, particularly Y. Tolobeyev as the Mayor, are perfectly cast. The English titles are excellent. As for that pivotal title role, we only wish Moscow had recruited Mr. Kaye's suave drollery, including his hilarious, musical "Soliloquy for Three Heads." But the climax, when the Soviet performers freeze to form a breathtakingly pictorial tableau, is a fitting fade-out in an impressively earnest undertaking that does very well without him.

616-> The Screen; Rails Into Laramie' Shown at Holiday
AS has happened time and time again, in "Rails Into Laramie," which arrived yesterday at the Holiday, one man singlehandedly brings law and order to a corrupt frontier town, in Technicolor. Customers willing to settle for strictly formula-type Westerns, with carefully tipped scales and no surprises, may derive some satisfaction from this medium-budget Universal entry.Others may find amusement in the effortless efficiency of such seasoned trail hands as John Payne, Dan Duryea and Barton MacLane. Indeed, the methodical off-handedness extends to the film as a whole, as produced by Ted Richmond and directed by Jesse Hibbs from a script credited to D. D. Beauchamp and Joseph Hoffman.Mr. Payne plays the man among men, an Army sergeant assigned as trouble-shooter for a railroad construction job. The old K. T. & C. is having a tough time of it. Mr. Duryea, as the ruthless vice boss of Laramie, sets the whole town against the hero, but not, of course, for long. Abetted by a smitten saloon lady, Mari Blanchard (a good performer), and a weakkneed marshal, James Griffith (likewise), Mr. Payne surmounts a wholesale campaign of sabotage and murder.At the final fade-out, he and Miss Blanchard are soundly locked in each other's arms. The rails presumably fall into place near by. And Mr. Duryea is put in his. RAILS INTO LARAMIE, screen play by D. D.

632-> Always a Bride' Bows at Three Theatres
SOME fifteen years ago, David O. Selznick corralled an endearing family of swindlers including Roland Young, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Janet Gaynor and Billie Burke, in an exceedingly charming item titled "The Young In Heart."Yesterday, another family— a father and daughter—and an assorted covey of "con" men, turned up to illustrate that the English film makers can carry-on in the tradition of amiable larceny in "Always a Bride," which was unveiled at the Art, Gramercy and Beekman Theatres. Although these clannish operators are not related, they prove once again that crime can be cheerful and diverting.Ralph Smart, who directed as well as collaborated on the script with Peter Jones, obviously did not have a masterpiece in mind when he undertook his dual chores. But he did have the good sense to avoid cluttering this comic caper with cliches and to people it with performers who enter into the spirit of things with the proper abandon. As the result, "Always a Bride" is as gay as the sunny Riviera, where it apparently was filmed, and as light as a breeze.However, our connivers do not work with an old bag of tricks. Peggy Cummins and Ronald Squire, the daughter and father of this adventure, are fleecing the suckers in a novel manner. He supposedly is an old roué on a honeymoon with a young dewey-eyed bride whom he not only treats boorisly but also leaves stranded in a swank hotel. At this point, sympathetic—and rich—guests kick in with financial aid for our "deserted" lovely. When this dodge isn't being used, our schemers are ready to "sell" the hotel in which they're living—and almost do—until their patsy gives them "the double, double cross."So, it is back again to the former "con" game, but this time a malicious Cupid takes a hand and our heroine turns honest with her father's blessing and that peripatetic gent takes a "vacation" in Monte Carlo's "bastille."The producers, as we were saying, were fortunate in casting this farce. Ronald Squire is the suave, genteel gentleman crook to the life, a polished citizen who seriously declares that he has "devoted his whole life to avoiding work." Terence Morgan, the British Treasury investigator, and Peggy Cummins (the doll-like, blond daughter of Mr. Squire) with whom he falls in love, give the airy goings-on a touch of honest romance. And James Hayter, as the Cockney "sucker" who trips them up; Geoffrey Sumner, as a pick-pocket member of the gang, and Charles Goldner, who contributes some piquant pantomime as a solicitous hotel manager, help keep the proceedings merry. ALWAYS A BRIDE, screen play by Ralph Smart and Peter Jones; directed by Mr. Smart; produced by Robert Garret; a J. Arthur Rank Organization presentation released by Universal-International.

FOR about a quarter of the way, "Adventure in Odessa," the Stanley's new Soviet import, remains a beguiling and rather original little picture. As it opens, a group of youngsters finds the ghostly hulk of a World War II guerrilla boat, which they secretly set about salvaging. The children, aided by a particularly understanding professor, make up a spunky, appealing lot. And their excited, natural aggressiveness is depicted with contagious objectivity and restraint. So far, so good.However, interested governmental authorities take over the project and, unfortunately, the bulk of the film, for a beaming, uneventful and pedantic tribute to the seafaring branch of Russia's youth-building organization, the Young Pioneers. And the initial salvagers, jubilantly installed with the teacher as crew of the refurbished "intrepid," ply her original North Sea route in a semi-scientific expedition.As directed by Lev Atamanov from a script by Georgi Grebner, this carefully happy Artkino release couldn't be cleaner or more unstartling. Or prettier. Photographed in Sovcolor, the open, briny panorama of gleaming sails, fishing ports and sun-baked smiles provides an ideal, cooling complement to the sticky months ahead.For all the utopian tone of the text, some spectators may contend that boys will be boys over here or over there. Whether or not most yearlings call regimentation the answer to their green years, the ones here seem to be having the time of their lives.Mikhail Kuznetsov and E. Samoilov, as the chief elders, are amiable and engaging, but no match for the energy of the adolescents, led by Misha Mokrinsky, Anatoli Shimanyuk and Volodya Luschik. At any rate, the Odessa "adventurers" waste no time becoming perfect little Russian gentlemen.

978-> Up-dated Translation of Bizet Work Bows
"CARMEN JONES," the opera "Carmen" of Bizet in an American Negro translation, which made quite a hit when it was tumbled onto a Broadway stage in 1943, is again a big musical shenanigan and theatrical tour-de-force in the giant-sized motion picture version that Otto Preminger delivered last night to the Rivoli.Crowded with more Negro talent than you could catch on a Saturday night at the Harlem Apollo, turned out in colors that nearly blind you and splashed across the CinemaScope screen, this lot of bamboozling by way of Bizet and Oscar Hammerstein 2d is a sex melodrama with longhair music and a mad conglomeration of bizarre show.Do not go to it expecting to hear a fully integrated opera sung or see a particularly sensitive or intelligent Negro drama performed. Mr. Hammerstein's job of transferring the Bizet music and the story of Prosper Mérimée into an American locale and idiom was a sheer stunt of carpentry, and the product betrays from every angle its jerry-built incongruities.The tale of the cigarette-maker Carmen and the Spanish cavalry soldier Don José is now a modern-day story of a parachute factory worker in the South and a stalwart G. I.—named Joe, naturally—who is about to go to flying school. And the Spanish toreador, Escamillo, is now Husky Miller, a prize-ring champ, who captures the favor of the Southern Carmen after she has seduced Joe and caused him to go A. W. O. L.In essence, it is a poignant story. It was in the opera of Bizet, and it is in the rich nostalgic folklore of the American Negro in the South. But here it is not so much poignant as it is lurid and lightly farcical, with the Negro characters presented by Mr. Preminger as serio-comic devotees of sex.Carmen, performed by Dorothy Dandridge, is the most notable devotee—a slinky, hip-swinging, main-drag beauty with a slangy, come-hither way with men. And, far from the desperate, tragic hunger for possession that Bizet's Carmen has, this cool, calculating little siren seems interested mainly in a good time.Likewise the Joe of Harry Belafonte is an oddly static symbol of masculine lust, lost in a vortex of confusion rather than a nightmare of shame. He is the hero, but he is oddly unheroic in this noisily ridiculed role. Olga James as his, ever-loving sweetheart is a wistful little comic figure, too, and Joe Adams as the arrogant Husky Miller is virtually a caricature of a bully-boy. Pearl Bailey's performance as Frankie, a roadhouse gal, is unrestrainedly broad, and around the fringes there are numerous and assorted Amos 'n' Andy characters.The incongruity is pointed when these people break into song to the wholly surprising and unnatural aria airs from Bizet's opera. The tempos are alien to their spirits, the melodies are foreign to their moods, but they have at those classical numbers as though they were cutting rugs. And whatever illusions and exaltations the musical eloquence might remotely inspire are doused by the realistic settings in which Mr. Preminger has played his film.As it happens, the music is sung well by dubbed-in voices for the three principals—Marilynn Horn's for Miss Dandridge, Le Vern Hutcherson for Mr. Belafonte and Marvin Hayes for Mr. Adams. And the choruses have the color and vibrance that are standard with good Negro choirs. There is nothing wrong with the music—except that it does not fit the people or the words.But that did not seem to make much difference to Mr. Hammerstein or Mr. Preminger. They were carried away by their precocity. The present consequence is a crazy mixed-up film.

1122-> The Screen; Human Desire' Bows on New Palace Bill
AMONG the assorted troubles with Columbia's "Human Desire," which was deposited with eight acts of vaudeville at the Palace yesterday, is that there isn't a single character in it for whom it builds up the slightest sympathy—and there isn't a great deal else in it for which you're likely to have the least regard.Gloria Grahame as a no-good married woman who spreads her favors as indifferently as she spreads her bed is as wholly devoid of fascination as a lush on a stool in a saloon. Broderick Crawford as her wildly jealous husband who kills a man because of her is dreary, too. And Glenn Ford as a locomotive driver who briefly cottons to the dame is just plain dull.When the story presented in this picture was done some years ago in a French film directed by Jean Renoir, with Jean Gabin and Simone Simon as its stars, there was, at least, a certain haunting terror, a certain mood of dark malevolence conveyed. The mind of the locomotive driver became an area of agonizing pain, and the pounding of railroad wheels and the shriek of whistles credibly drove the man insane.But even that morbid fascination is missing from this film, which has been directed in a flat, lethargic fashion by the usually creative Fritz Lang. Mr. Ford seems no closer to madness when he finds himself lusting for Miss Grahame than he might be if he were yearning for a chocolate malted milk. And when finally Mr. Crawford obliges by violently disposing of her, too, the whole weary business is concluded on a hollow note of "so what?"

1140-> ' Dial M for Murder' Is Shown at Paramount
THE elegant coils of murder drama that Frederick Knott contrived in his play, "Dial M for Murder," a recent favorite on the Broadway stage, are given a proper twisting in the transmission of that play onto film. In the pliant hands of Alfred Hitchcock, past master at the job of squeezing thrills, the coils twine with sleek and silken evil on the Paramount's screen.Let's understand at the outset that Mr. Knott's one-set play is a difficult chunk of melodrama for an hour-and-three-quarters cinema. All of its critical action logically takes place in one room, and its considerable plot development must necessarily evolve from lots of talk.The dark machinations of a London husband to get his wife bumped off and then, failing that, to twist the evidence so that it looks as though she willfully murdered the man who tried to murder her are matters of wicked rationalization rather than physical activity. The thrills come in following a succession of dawnings in people's minds.But Mr. Hitchcock has presented this mental material on the screen with remarkable visual definition of developing intrigue and mood. His actors unfold the drama in their very appearances and, as the chic and malevolent plot thickens, so do their various attitudes.This is a technical triumph that Mr. Hitchcock has achieved —the tensing of interest and excitement with just a handful of people in a room. It is one for which he needed good actors. He has them—and the best of the lot is John Williams, late of the stage play, who is the detective who solves the sinister ruse.Mr. Williams, a virtual stranger to movies, tosses knockouts with a flick of his mustache, a lifting of an eyebrow or a mild exclamation of "oh!" Wisely, of course, Mr. Hitchcock has worked him in close camera range. It is as thrilling as watching Native Dancer just to see Mr. Williams perform. Ray Milland as the machinating husband is excitingly effectual in using expression, too, and Grace Kelly does a nice job of acting the wife's bewilderment, terror and grief. Anthony Dawson, also from the stage play, has the manners and appearance of a snake as the hired murderer. Robert Cummings is negative as a fiction-writing friend.Excellent color and color combinations add to the flow and variety of the drama's moods. Shot for 3-D but offered here in "standard," the film is vividly pictorial right straight through. DIAL M FOR MURDER, screen play by Frederick Knott from his play; directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

1463-> Two Imports Arrive; Plaza Offers 'Edge of Divorce,' a Drama Family Theme Treated in British Picture
THE British moviemakers, who have developed the business of being restrained into a fine art, are being especially civilized about an imminent break-up of a tight little family circle in "Edge of Divorce," which took up residence at the Plaza yesterday. Their efforts are commendable even If they are not entirely in keeping with some American, emotional standards.The small but thoroughly professional cast—including a trio of engaging youngsters—tussles with a sad but familiar problem and arrives at an expected answer. If there are but a few fireworks in what should have been an extremely volatile set of circumstances, the principals do manage to extract the basic poignancy and potential destructive effect of divorce from them.Warren Chetham-Strode and Don Sharp, who adapted Mr. Chetham-Strode's play to the screen, are not involving their players in purple passages or embarrassing situations. Barbie Lomax and her lawyer-husband John have been married for sixteen years, the last two of which have seen the seemingly strong edifice they had built begin to crumble under the effects of constant bickering. When the final decision to part is made, it is not because of another man, although Bill Ogden, a friend of the couple, already has declared his love for Mrs. Lomax. Although there is no tawdry specter of backstreet amour here, there are hurdles to be faced by the resolute pair.Informing their children—a scene, incidentally, which is uncommonly tender—is a major task, but one which is accomplished with understanding and compassion. The children, however, are another matter. This shocking revelation has varying results. "It is simple to us but not simple to them," their mother says, underestimating her youngest daughter's plaintive question, "but where will be our home?" and the effects on her son and older daughter. The children, as may be guessed, eventually assure the happy ending toward which this sentimental journey is inevitably headed.The children, it should be added, contribute the acting highlights to the drama. Sensitivity of direction and performance is evident in the portrayals of Mandy Miller (seen here in the fine English drama "Crash of Silence") as the pitifully disturbed youngster of the moppets; Jeremy Spenser as the son who is childishly ready to commit murder to preserve the family and Janette Scott, the teen-age daughter, who selfishly regards the affair as a new and happy adventure.Although she suffers and yearns in standard fashion, Valerie Hobson's characterization of the mother is competently turned. Philip Friend's delineation of her husband is a mite stiff and austere. Norman Wooland genially plays the other man and Lilly Kann does well by the role of the solicitous family retainer. Although "Edge of Divorce" is a variant on an ancient theme, its sentimentality bears repetition. EDGE OF DIVORCE, screen play by Warren Chetham-Strode and Don Sharp; from the play "Background" by Mr. Chetham-Strode; directed by Daniel Birt; produced by Herbert Mason; a Group 3 presentation, released by Kingsley International Pictures.
