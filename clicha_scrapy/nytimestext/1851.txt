The Liberty People at Buffalo disbanded on Thursday, after nominating Mr. GERRIT SMITH of New York, for President, and Mr. CHARLES DURKEE of Wisconsin, for Vice-President of the United States.

I shall have opportunities to express morn  and retort in detail the practical meaning of thane words--  I came hither for practical  to the great  of freedom fur which we  and for which we will struggle once more. 1 lee!  happy to Lava tho  gratifying intelligence, by your addresses, that in the Clty of Baltimore them in not only n sympathy, but that there is a manning  to that sympathy-a meaning which I Loped and ex petted to find when I name to your . And I  highly gratified, also, that 1 have the honor to see from these  that you, gentleman, and your fallow.. citizens have bestowed so  attention to the        of Huagery se not to be subjected to , but so as to be able readily to understand ate. That is n grunt benefit to me, because, unfortunately, though 1 de clare that 1 find here in the Unite) States  a more just and exact  of tile iron stain of the cause of Hungary than elsewhere in the , stilt I am  to rind that there are    and misrepresentations concerning that cause as for instance, I have had the opportunity to rend this day a report of the debates yesterday in the Senate of the United States, where nn  member stated that the struggle of ;;ary was not a struggle for the principles of freedom an) liberty ouch as is going on throughout Europe, bill a struggle for an ancient charter. Now this is nn entire  lion of the nature of our cause. Thorn is  in the struggle of Hungary which cal be characterized by that word, but vva had oleo a struggle tbr  rights, because the right of self government in an ancient right of Hungary . It was no stew acquisition to our revolution : it was nn ancient right of a thousand years. Now we have seen that this ancient right of -tLe right of -though  by a thousand laws and by the coronation oat4 of thirty kings, every one of whore was committed, in , to a  perjury, is not now enjoyed but has 6o  come n dead letter in our book of laws. And therefore in our revolution, and before the revolution, in a peace. tul and lawful  of legislation, in 113 we struggled and we achieved to get same practical guarantees to thin ancient right of Hungary-such guarantees as were con.  necessary to insure that ancient right to Lo n practical benefit and not a mere  letter in our  of laws. Iu so much we have struggled for our ancient rights, but in rio other respect, because we have seen, that though this ancient right of self government was re  in n hundred laws and was guaranteed by  coronations,-still it was a dead letter-and why ? lle  the whole people warn not inten;sted in maintain ing the rights of Hungary-because tile  people had do constitutional rights, but only a class of the pen plo of Hungary. I Leg again to be permitted to make a remark which I have made elsewhere, not for your cake, Itcenuae you understand the nature of the cause of Ilun gary, but because there is published abroad n   In regard to facts. Then I say that the rights of Ilungary warn restricted in ancient times not to a race but to a class-to a class of nobles-not to a taco prop erly called  who carne out a thousand years ago from Aein, because in the  of the Magyars were men of every race which settled and remained in the flange. rian territory. There were nobles among the , Sclnves, Gernrana, Wallachians, and the poor who were deprived of their Constitutional rights, warn not only Sclaves and Croats, but Magyars. Tlteroforo it was not a privilege of races but of , of  of nobility, to have an interest in the ancient Constitu  rights of Ilungary. Now that single class of men -a mere handful, to which I, by the changes of faro and circumstances happen to belong-could never have been sufficient to maintain the rights of tire country against the continual encroachment of the  direc. lion, which it is so much in the nature of the house of Austria to exercise, that during all the centuries of its existence not a single man appeared in history out of the  of Austria, who was nut the enemy of  dom and of popular rights. So, having seen that that class of men was not  to maintain the pop ular rights, and chiefly ' having the conviction  it ie oat advantageous to have liberty  rights n privilege of a class, but that it  become the com mon  men in the country, it was our (fret duty of the revolution to abolish all these privileges and to .thorn by the common broad basis  liberty-liberty for the people of the whole country, without any  as to what Church a man prays in, or what tongue ho speaks. (Applause.]

1307-> Mr. Thrasher.
There is little doubt that Congress will take some action in behalf of this unfortunate gentleman, when it gets the facts and the time The Executive, to whom a resolution of inquiry has been directed by both branches, may be unprovided with information; but there are surely enough notorious facts to base diplomatic proceedings upon. 
--------
1308-> Kossuth and Hungary.

--------
1309-> LATEST INTELLIGENCE; By Telegraph to The New-York Times. Criticisms on Kossuth at the Capital--Mr. Foote--Mr. Clay.
The Washington Republic and the National Intelligencer are very severe on KOSSUTH's projects, and, of course, upon certain New-York papers, which they assert are turning his head by fulsome adulation.

' The Lonaon Daily News suggested some time ago that a penny subscription should be made among the working classes, to procure a copy of Shakspeare for the illustrious hungarian. The proposal meets with much favor on all sides; and as the only difficulty seems to be the best plan of carrying it into effect, Mr. DOUGLAS JERROLD adds his suggestion upon this particular.

1321-> A Free Press in England.
A year or so ago an Association was formed in England for the purpose of agitating the abolition of stamp duties. The tremendous growth of The Times, threatening, as it did, to absorb the circulation of all the other morning papers, was the immediate prompter of the movement; and since the returns of the Stamp Office for the last year were made up, we may perceive the reasonableness of the apprehension. 
--------
1322-> The Wreck of the Steamer Mayflower, &c.
The storm, which abated somewhat in violence this morning, has commenced again, and now amounts to a hard ?? gale. Considerable auxiety is felt for the Empire State, which is still out. further intelligence indicates that the Mayflower will prove a perfect wreck; she will beat to pieces on the rocks before she can be got off .

--------
1331-> Governor Johnston Shot at.

1335-> PHILADELPHIA.; Triumphant Reception of Kossuth--Popular Sympathy for Hungary. Gov. Kossuth's Illness.---The Municipal Banquet.---State of Feeling. The Preparations at Baltimore--Health of Gov. Kossuth--the Banquet of the People.
The events of to-day have dispelled such doubts as the doubting expressed last evening of the triumphs of this occasion. The reception of the great Magyar, the enthusiastic demonstrations of the masses, the noble response to his brief expression of views and sentiments, must have convinced every unprejudiced mind that Philadelphians, though more taciturn, perhaps, than their neighbors of New York, are as ready as they to espouse the cause of humanity when fairly presented. 
--------
1336-> The American Art Union.
The distribution of this popular institution, be it remembered, is to take place on New Year's Eve. The collection, and we rather pique ourselves upon correct connoisseurship, is decidedly the finest the Association has ever assembled, and as the number of subscribers will be limited, the chances of obtaining a valuable picture are greatly enhanced.

The departure of KOSSUTH has left a blank not easily to be filled up, especially at this season of fogs, suicides and stagnation. Public affairs share the leaden influences which cloud and depress the physical aspect of outward things, and the proverbial dullness of November is realized in full perfection.

1342-> Indians at Sault Ste Marie.
The brig Sophia, Captain Thomas Kidd, which passed through our canal early in June last, laden with presents for the Indians at Sault Ste Marie, returned on Friday last. The S. was nearly three weeks at the Sault ere the presents were distributed, during which time the captain and officers were entertained by the Government Commissioners residing there in a manner that would have done credit to any of our towns or cities. 
--------
1343-> A Northwest Passage.
This great commercial desideratum since Columbus found the way to the East Indies, bar red by the American continent--is, in all likelihood now abandoned for ever.

MAN WORSHIP.-The Buffalo Republic and Rochester American are performing a pleasant little duct between them, and the burden thereof is the tendency of Whigs to man worship, We heartily wish the allegation were a trifle less romantic.
