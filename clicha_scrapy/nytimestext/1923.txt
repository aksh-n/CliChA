370-> THE SCREEN
The Lyric Theatre was filled last night with people who seemed no different in the main from the usual crowd that gathers for amusement in a Broadway playhouse, and they sat for two hours with evident interest watching a motion picture of the kind often damned in the trade as "educational." Frequently they broke into spontaneous applause—such expressions of enthusiasm as Douglas Fairbanks calls forth when he accomplishes an especially hazardous or unexpected feat. Not once did the interest lag.The film was "Hunting Big Game in Africa With Gun and Camera." It was made on a two-year expedition into the Dark Continent, led by H. A. Snow and his son Sidney, who went out for the Museum of Natural History of Oakland, Cal. It seems safe to say that it is the most complete, which means the most instructive and the most thrilling, motion picture of wild animal life ever made. Paul Rainey, the cinematic Henry M. Stanley of Africa, did it first, and did it well. His pictures are still remembered, and it was a generous, if deserved, recognition of Rainey's work for Mr. Snow to have him mentioned in a subtitle. And other good African pictures have come. But they all, it seems, have been leading up to the film now at the Lyric. It appears to be about the last word, at least so far as animal life on the continent is concerned.It is in the first place, composed of remarkably good pictures. By Perseverance, skill and the use of the latest photographic equipment ??? including a telescopic lens and a portable developing outfit. Sidney Show, who was the cameraman of the expedition, obtained close-ups as well as clear distant views of every kind of African animal the average man has heard of and many he will not know the existence of until he goes to the Lyric. The beautiful, the ugly, the swift, the ungainly—they are all there singly and in herds, at water holes and darting across the plain or diving into the jungle undergrowth. And much of the photography is excellent by any standard. All of it is exceedingly good considering the conditions under which the camera was used.But the film is more than just an interesting collection of animal pictures. It is as thrilling in places as anything shown on Broadway for a long time.There is or instance, a sequence of scenes in which the hunters are attacked by elephants. Even if it is made up of pictures taken at different times, it seems real and is undoubtedly true. And it certainly is exciting.Furthermore, the film is one of the most intelligently edited pictures ever shown. The sub-titles are light enough to be entertaining and at the same time informative. They never throw away valuable information for a joke. But, on the other hand, they do not tell the whole story, and so make the pictures mere illustrations. They explain the pictures where explanation is necessary, and leave to the pictures all that they are capable of saying by themselves. The result is alert interest in the successive scenes, which, it must be added, have been assembled with unusual skill. Comedy is introduced here and there to relieve any possible boredom on the part of spectators, and the exciting scenes are wisely distributed.The program does not give the editor of the film, but, whoever he is he deserves no small share of the credit for the picture's success as popular entertainment—which it decidedly is.And, lastly, the musical accompaniment, arranged by Gino Severi heightens every pictorial effect. Whether the scene is of giraffes lumbering across the plain or of a held of elephants stampeded, the action seems suited to the notes.It is impossible here to report on the picture in any detail. There is so much of it—without there ever being too much of anything. One unusual feature should be mentioned, however. It is the pursuit of fleet game with a Ford. Mr. Snow found that Tsetse flies killed his oxen, so he ordered two Fords sent out to him, and in these he ran down antelopes and other speedy beasts that tried to escape him on the broad plains. Also, it is scarcely necessary to say, the flivvers, just by their appearance in pursuit of fleeing animals, provide effortless comedy relief.And there does not seem to be any more killing than necessary in the film. Wild Animal Thrills.HUNTING BIG GAME IN AFRICA WITH GUN AND CAMERA, by H. A. and Sidney Snow. At the Lyric.The adventurous Martin Johnson, who, it will be recalled, went into the South Seas some five years ago and returned with that most unusual and interesting motion picture, "Cannibal Isles or the South Pacific," which was shown at the Rivoli in July, 1918, and whose second film, one on Borneo entitled "Jungle Adventures," came to the Capitol in September, 1921, has a third picture at B. S. Moss's Broadway Theatre this week. It is "Head Hunters of the South Seas," and is part of the Pictorial record of Mr. Johnson's second visit among the Dig Numbers and other savage tribes. And it is just as interesting as the other two.In some respects it seems even more so, which may be accounted for by the fact that in making it Mr. Johnson had the advantage of his previous experience and acquaintance with the natives. One scene in particular was possible only on his second trip. It shows the savages looking at motion pictures of themselves made by Mr. Johnson the first time he went among them. They laughed at the pictures in the same nervous way that many spectators laugh at them.Among the many strange people shown ??? a tribe who bind the heads of their babies to make them grow long, and another tribe of tree-climbing acrobats, whose prehandle does seem to relate them more closely to the anthropoid ape than may be pleasing to timorous folk who, despite clothes and hair-cuts, resemble them in other particulars. They remind one rather forcefully of what civilized man may have been like some ten or fifteen minutes ago on the timescale that measures evolutionary ages by the hour.The hero of the film is Mr. Johnson's old friend Nagapate, chief of the cannibalistic Big Number tribe, which was reported to have planned a big banquet of, rather than for, the Johnson party on the occasion of their first visit. The old fellow seems genial enough now, however, though, according to the subtitles, Mr. Johnson kept his eye on his boat and his hand on his rifie while enjoying his hospitality for the second time.The strangeness of the savages is emphasized by the presence of Mrs. Johnson among them in many scenes. Looking as trim and easy as a girl out for everyday sport, she brings contrast interestingly into the pictures.Considering the difficulties under which the pictures were made, the camera work is remarkably good, too. A visit to the Broadway this week is well worth while."The Third Alarm," an Emory Johnson production, with Ralph Lewis, opened at the Astor Theatre last night.

560-> THE SCREEN
It was generally supposed that the last Northwest Mounted Police story had been filmed and shown months ago, and that no more were to be inflicted upon the public. Nevertheless, "The Eternal Struggle," which is decorating the Rivoli screen this week, is still another of those old-fashioned narratives, with two of the men, "who always get their man," quarreling over a girl. The sub-titles are of the old school. One of them reads,??? "He welcomed the storm that stilled the tumult in his breast." Others inform the spectators when it is morning, evening, Winter and Spring.The main title was inspired by the struggle men have for the particular women they love. The heroine in this yarn, which was adapted from G. B. Lancaster's "The Law Bringers," is a French-Canadian girl, who is quoted as saying "tam" for time and "kees" for kiss. She is known as Andrée Grange, the part being played by Renée Adorée, who indulges in endless weeping, fighting and kissing. The villain, Barode Dukane, portrayed by that well-known screen heavy, Wallace Beery, is charmed by the pretty face of the girl, and one evening, after she is caught in the rain, he escorts her to his shack and gives Andrée a stimulant, and then tries to kiss her. Andrée struggles, and finally picks up a knife and, after a motion-picture pause, flings the weapon and it strikes Dukane, who staggers and falls. Andrée rushes out of the place after knowing Camille Lenoir (Barbara La Marr) had seen her hurl the knife. Andrée tells her father that she has slain Dukane and ???Plerre Grange and a Chinese help her to escape.Two Northwest Mounted Police, both of whom are infatuated with Andrée, follow her. Sergeant Tempest (Earle Williams), whose affection is more of the avuncular order, trusts they won't catch Andrée, but Bucky O'Hara (Pat O'Malley), a stickler for duty, evidently wishes to do something dramatic. Eventually it is discovered, as might be imagined, that the wound was not fatal. But Camille, true to her name, confesses that she, in a subsequent struggle with Dukane — carefully shown in a flash-back—slew the villain. He really died that time.Sergeant Tempest and O'Hara have a thrilling time in the frigid regions after having caught Andrée. There is a sequence showing Tempest and the girl trying to get away in a canoe cavorting over the rapids. These scenes are worth seeing, because the man in the boat is obviously an expert in steering a canoe in raging waters. Toward the end the man doubling for the Sergeant leaps from a dizzy height into the torrent.An effort is made to give an idea of the maddening loneliness of the trio during the Winter. Tempest???, bored to extinction, tears a pack of cards in half. One feels like doing the same thing when sitting through this picture, which is relieved only by a couple of sequences.Other Photoplays."The Green Goddess" is attracting such crowds at the Capitol that, in order to relieve congestion, the theatre will open its doors at 12:15 P. M. every day. A special and beautiful prologue precedes this picture. It includes an East Indian ballet staged by Michio Itow and performed by Itow, as the spirit of the Green Goddess, and Mile. Gambarelli, as the principal temple dancer. A splendid effect is obtained by having the Green Goddess and the dancer lighted up with a sort of phosphorescent effect. In screening the features S. L. Rothafel is employing an effective new method of screening which frames the picture and lends to it a sense of relief. An Old, Old Story.THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE, with Renee Adoree, Warl??? Williams, Barbara La Marr, Pat O'Malley, Wallace Beery, Josef Swickard, Pat Harmon, Anders Randolf, George Kuwa, E. J. Brady, Robert Anderson and others; adapted from G. B. Lancaster's novel,???

903-> Marble Hearts and Halls.
The beguiling and resourceful tactics of a flapper, from her plebe days to her graduation as a bachelor of hearts, are engrossingly portrayed in "Flaming Youth," the new picture which is adorning the Strand screen this week. The censor, possibly with an eye on the artistic photography and settings, appears to have exercised unusual leniency with this photoplay, which was adapted from the novel of the same name published under the pseudonym of Warner Fabian.One bedroom in this picture is shielded from the gaze of the curious by filmy lace portieres, and of course no production of this sort would be complete without its swimming bath sequence, which happens to be done in a different way in this film. The order for lights on and swimming is followed by the guests being shown in a semi-silhouette, disrobing, revealing their undergarments, the men being in knee-length summer attire and the women in the usual lace decorated affairs. Undoubtedly the director has observed box-office regulations in making this rather risqué entertainment, which it is safe to prognosticate, will be more than moderately successful, as the heart affairs, the dancing scenes, and the characterization of the saucy flapper who becomes infatuated with her late mother's erstwhile devoted admirer, will prove quite entertaining to both sexes.Colleen Moore gives a vivid performance of the jazz-devoted novice once she gets her hold of the theme. There are moments in the beginning when her rendition is a little artificial. But after her awkward trip downstairs in exotic pajamas—which are not really graceful—she lives the part of a pert young thing, whose hair is cut with a bang on the forehead, whose eyes are full of mischief and whose arms are long and slender. She is Patricia Fentriss, known as Pat, whose eyelids are touched up a shade lighter than elephant's breath, with eyebrows which in their neatness and abrupt finish are similar to those on a wax doll. She is a busy little bee, ready with her sting, or to give a "white kiss," but who becomes inflamed with rage when a "red" or real kiss is forced upon her lips. Her profound study seems to consist of Gertrude Atherton's "Black Oxen."At the outset Pat from the balcony observes the gay party going on in her home, and she decides to wear one of her sister's evening gowns and join in the gayety. She sees her mother, Mrs. Fentriss (Myrtle Stedman) in the arms of a man, and soon is discovered herself in a similar pose, and instantly ordered off to bed."Baby must go back to her cradle," taunts the young man.The mother finds herself a victim to the giddy life, and after asking another admirer to write her a letter every day regarding Pat's conduct, she says that she feels that her time has come "to face the great Dim Guess." She dies, and Dr. Bobs faithfully writes the letters about Pat, placing them in a small safe, to which the mother before breathing her last, has given Pat the combination. Cary Scott, impersonated by Milton Sills, who has been in Paris, appears at the Fentriss home, and is shocked to hear of his old friend's death. He instantly takes a great interest in the flapper daughter, but soon has to go abroad again. In the meantime the effervescent Pat becomes enamored of a wet-lipped violinist, Leo Stenak, and she forms one of a party aboard a yacht.The musician insults the girl, who locks herself in a cabin, the door of which is broken open by the passionate and infuriated violinist. Pat eventually escapes by flinging herself into the sea, and is rescued by a sailor. There is a shot of a big liner entering New York Harbor, passing the little yacht. On the ocean grayhound Cary Scott is seen. He concludes the yacht is carrying a three-mile limit party.Milton Sills is sympathetic as the hero, and Myrtle Stedman is charming as the mother. Other performers give a splendid impersonation of their respective parts. The moral of this picture is to show the emptiness of the pace-killing life. FLAMING YOUTH, with Colleen Moore, Milton Sills, Elliott Dexter, Sylvia Breamer, Myrtle Stedman, Betty Francisco, Phillips Smalley, Walter McGrail, Ben Lyon, George Barraud, John Patrick, Gene Carrado, Gertrude Astor, Michael Dark and others, adapted from the novel by Warner Fabian, directed by John Francis Dillon; potpourri of light music. At the Strand.Laughter is described as "a movement of the involuntary muscles of the face, particularly of the lips, usually accompanied with a peculiar expression of the eyes, indicating merriment, and attended by an interrupted expulsion of air from the lungs, peculiar to the human species." This interested us, as did also the allusion of F. W. Robertson, who wrote: "That man is a bad man who has not within him the power of a hearty laugh." We felt better after seeing the Rivoli film. "To The Ladies!" adapted from the play by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, as for the past week we have not seen any production that caused any flicker of merriment in the eyes or a movement of the involuntary muscles of the face. And we thought we were becoming ascetic.But when we saw "To The Ladies," we were first amused and then went through the whole performance described in more or less detail in the dictionary. One sequence in this photofarce will be appreciatel by all who see it, and especially by those who have a recollection of their first attempt to "say a few words."Two salesmen attached to the office of a piano factory are invited to a banquet by the head of the concern, and it is surmised by these two men that their employer will probable select as a manager the man who makes the best speech. A third salesman, hungry for a chance to save his employer's life, lends a book on speechmaking to Thomas Beebe (Edward Horton). The selected speech begins: "I am feeling at this minute exactly like a man about to be seasick * * *"The dinner is shown, with all the men sitting next to their wives, and the superintendent officiating as toastmaster. Beebe is toying with a napkin and constantly repeating the first lines of the speech he has memorized, expecting to be called upon, and dreading the performance. He makes all the errors a man usually makes on such a nerve-racking occasion, and one can imagine that his heart is thumping against his ribs. Evidently he wouldalmost give up the chance of his career than get up on his feet.Eventually his colleague is introduced, and as Beebe is repeating once again in his wife's ear the introductory paragraph to the little talk, to his amazement he hears Tom Baker's voice, firm and resolute, pronouncing: "I am feeling at this minute exactly like a man about to be seasick * * *." Beebe senses only too clearly that his rival has literally "stolen his stuff," and is appalied by the knowledge that, aside from the words the other salesman is uttering, much to the mirth of the guests, he is inarticulate.Called upon he cannot even summon sufficient strength in his knees to rise. Then Mrs. Beebe, acting on the theory of "What Every Woman Knows," stands up and forthwith delivers a forceful and interesting address, saving her husband from ignominy, by explaining that it is his speech and he is suffering from laryngitis.Nothing much funnier has ever been expatiated upon in a picture, and James Cruze, the director of this production, has not missed the scintilla of a chance to lead up to this sequence, always avoiding anything in the nature of slap-stick comedy. Horton is splendid as the distracted and uncomfortable guest waitng to be called upon.There are minor comedy situations in this film, but the speech is the outstanding feature. Running it a close second are the sequences dealing with the famous efficiency cabinet installed by Tom Baker. A button is pressed and out pops a shelf, the pushing of a second button giving out the letter or card being sought. The cabinet appears to work thoroughly until the employer. John Kincaid (Theodore Roberts), tampers with the buttons, with the result that the drawers open one after the other, showering the letters over the office floor.Louise Dresser is comely and captivating as Mrs. Kincaid, looking quite young for the old man's wife. Mr. Roberts and his cigar are quite at home in this production; in fact one could not wish for a better actor in the part. Helen Jerome Eddy is efficient as Mrs. Beebe. All the players were exceptionally well cast in this most welcome picture. Mr. Cruze directed "The Covered Wagon" and "Hollywood." He was also responsible for "Ruggles of Red Gap," which was adapted from an angle which weakened it. However, Mr. Cruze does well when he hits the nail on the head squarely three times out of four.Other Films.A new film version of "The Light That Failed," is the attraction this week at the Rialto."The Day of Faith," adapted from Arthur Somers Roche's novel, is the feature at the Capital."This Freedom," adapted from A.

1216-> From Sing Sing to Psalm Singing.
Charlie Chaplin is at the Strand again. That's enough for most people. Those who stand apart from the crowd may talk of Mr. Chaplin's "art," and those who stop to measure one thing by another may put his latest comedy beside "Shoulder Arms" and "The Kid" and tell you how far short it falls of the while set by these classics; but, meanwhile, they are showing "The Pilgrim" eight times a day, and eight times a day the crowd will laugh at it.And not from habit, either. If Chaplin had never made another comedy. If he had never been heard of before, "The Pilgrim" would be a hit. That's the test, and no one can doubt, surely, that "The Pilgrim" meets it.No, this picture is not the equal of "The Kid." It lacks that comedy's subtleties, it isn't as sharply pointed with humanity, it isn't as finely characterized, but it's a genuine Chaplin, nevertheless. It has subtleties of its own, it is human in flashes and its characters are a good deal more than stage clowns. Furthermore, if it is broader than "The Kid," it is also more direct as a burlesque. It has its own field. It is neither aimless buffoonery nor an imitation. And this is to Chaplin's credit. He has not copied himself nor has be played low to the mob with haphazard slapstick. He has aimed at something in his new work and hit it.The object of his jesting is Main Street, small-town life, the small-town congregation, little people who look large to themselves—and are afraid to have any fun. And what fun Chaplin has with them! He isn't vicious, his ridicule is general rather than specific, and it does not seem likely that any one will be offended by his mockery—except, of course, those who are too much like the people in the picture to enjoy its ji???es. It's a rare man, you know, who can look into a mirror and laugh. But, though good natured, the fun is pointed with an idea and it does hit something. When you see Chaplin as an escaped convict masquerading in a preacher's clothes, delivering a most earnest sermon at a hard-shelled congregation, familiar scenes are recolored for you, and when, at the end of the performance, a boy in the audience begins to applaud enthusiastically you feel the unconventional appropriateness of the preacher's smiling bows as he takes the curtain call. It is a darned good sermon, too.Chaplin passes through the town. For a day and a half he is accepted as its new parson, and then a kind-hearted Sheriff leaves him straddling the international boundary line between the United States and Mexico, with the dangerous lawlessness of the latter counry to the right and the dangerous law of the former to the left. He must choose between them—but before he is driven to either terrifying alternative the picture mercifully fades out, with the meek little clerical convict still astride the boundary line. It's a neat ending—and, incidentally, a good beginning for another comic tragedy.What goes on in the town while Chaplin is there forms, of course, the main part of the comedy, but it would dull the edge of it to supply details here. Pure farce, pointed satire, sentimental touches and bounding horseplay are mixed up together, all, as the saying goes, for your delight. And the peculiar joy of the picture is that it is a motion picture. It's what happens in the scenes that makes the story: it is the expressiveness of the pictures, and most of all of Chaplin's own exclusive pantomime, that gives "The Pilgrim" and all its predecessors a true cinematographic character of their own. And to those who believe that a motion picture above all things should be a composition of pictures that move and mean something, this is the film's most important and significant recommendation—and the chief reason why the Chaplin comedies are so popular, whether those who laugh at them know it or not.Also on the varied and evenly excellent bill at the Strand is one of those skillful Bray cartoon comedies, "Colonel Heeza Liar, Detective"; an interesting split reel called "Odds and Ends," a Prizma color work, "I Know a Garden," and "Robert Louis Stevenson," a Kineto picture.Shakespeare on the screen, of course is not Shakespeare. He who goes to see an adaptation of one of the poet's works is certain to be disappointed. But Shakespeare's plays were built on solid stories, and it is possible for a producer to take one of these stories and from it fashion a photoplay that will stand on its own feet as screen entertainment.And this is what the Russian director, Dimitri Buchowetzki, has done with the German film "Othello," which began a two weeks' engagement at the Criterlon Theatre yesterday afternoon. With Emil Jannings—the Jannings of Louis XV., Henry VIII., Pharaoh and Danton, you must remember—as the Moor, and Werner Kraus—Caligari and Robespierre, you know, as Iago, he has told a stirring story of simplicity, courage, honesty, villainy and revenge which rises by many degrees of excellence above the usual offering of the screen. It has vitality, it is direct and true, it is a thing of action. It's a full-blooded motion picture.Jannings's performance as Othello is an impressive piece of work. He makes you feel the genuine character of the Moor, his simplicity, his strength and his weakness. He gives you the man himself—and that's something to have from a performance, isn't it?Werner Kraus's Iago will probably strike different people differently. Some will like the character, while others will think the part overplayed and dissipated in too much jumping about, grimacing and gesticulating. It all depends on the Iago you want. If you can conceive of this Italian villain not only as emphatically Italian, but as a traditional Italian of the Middle Ages, you will not think that Kraus goes too far. You will feel, rather, that he stamps his rôle realistically, and also puts himself in effective contrast with Othello. And certainly he is vital and clearly understandable at all times—and this is an asset in any screen performance.The acting of the photoplay, as a whole, is distinctive. These Europeans do make themselves mean something. They do not just pose and promenade. They act. And even if their style is different, even if they sometimes seem to exaggerate, the spectator usually forgets the difference, and fails to note the exaggeration as he is carried along by the sweep and the significance of motions, of expressions, of gestures, of postures that reveal the people he is supposed to be looking in upon.The settings of the picture also play a dynamic part in the story, and the crowds, and the composition of the scenes. They are all in, and not on, the photoplay. Which means that Dimitri Buchowetzki, the director, has assembled and handled his plentiful material effectively. He has made it serve a common purpose—the telling of a stirring story, nothing less and all of that. You can find fault with the continuity; the photography is not always perfect, and it is doubtful whether the story of Othello will arouse the sympathy of everybody; but when this is said, this picture at the Criterion remains a forceful work and one sure to commend the interest and the admiration of many.Also on the program is an amusing "Out-of-the-Inkwell" cartoon by Max Fleischer??? a tempting scenic of the Riviera, and a diverting animal picture from the Bray studios.Other Films.Cecil B. DeMille's latest production, "Adam's Rib," and a Funny Face comedy by H. S.
