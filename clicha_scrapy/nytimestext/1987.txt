1-> MORE STATES JOIN BAPTIST REVERSAL
Three more Southern Baptist state conventions have joined Georgia and North Carolina in turning away leadership bids by fundamentalists, who have enjoyed nearly a decade of control of the nation's largest Protestant denomination. Delegates in Texas and Louisiana elected moderate or unaligned presidents Tuesday in what one moderate described as ''a turning point day'' in the 14.2 million-member Southern Baptist Convention. And delegates in South Carolina elected a moderate yesterday. Texas Baptists unanimously elected the Rev. Joel Gregory of Fort Worth as president. Mr. Gregory was supported by moderates and fundamentalists, but Walter Knight, editor of a moderate Baptist newspaper, said the election of two moderates, the Rev. Dick Maples and the Rev. Leo Bardo Estrada, as first and second vice presidents meant ''people appointed in Texas are going to be moderate-leaning.'' In Louisiana, the Rev. Calvin Phelps narrowly defeated the Rev. Fred Lowery, a fundamentalist. Mr. Phelps described himself as in the mainstream, saying he had good friends in both camps. In South Carolina yesterday, delegates elected the Rev. Jimmie E. Harley of the First Baptist Church in Florence, who is considered a moderate. Big Change in Georgia The most dramatic reversal occurred in Georgia, where delegates meeting in Savannah refused to re-elect an eligible president for the first time in 166 years. They also passed several resolutions restating support for Mercer University, the Baptist-affiliated school that has come under attack from fundamentalists since Playboy magazine depicted it as a party school. Those victories prompted the moderates to put up a last-minute candidate, the Rev. Jim Pitts of Valdosta, who was elected to lead Georgia's Southern Baptists over the Rev. Clark Hutchinson of Marietta. North Carolina Baptists decisively elected the Rev. Leon Smith of Goldsboro, a moderate, over a fundamentalist, the Rev. Ned Mathews of Gastonia. Both Baptist factions describe themselves as theologically conservative, but fundamentalists believe the Bible is literally true in all respects, while moderates believe there is room for interpretation.

2-> REPORT SHOWS CHURCH MEMBERSHIP IN U.S. IS GROWING SLOWLY
Church membership in the United States is growing gradually, almost at the same rate as the population, as is the number of people unaffiliated with any church. In recent years, the proportion of church members to nonchurch members in the nation has remained unchanged, with about 60 percent of Americans active members of churches or synagogues and the other 40 percent unaffiliated. The statistics were compiled for the ''Yearbook of American and Canadian Churchs 1987.'' They were prepared by the research department of the National Council of Churches, and published by Abingdon Press of Nashville, Tenn. Growth Has Slowed ''Over all, United States churches are neither gaining nor losing membership,'' said the editor of the yearbook, Constance H Jacquet Jr. of the council's research and evaluation office. ''Mainline church losses have slowed, and growth in even the fastest growing church bodies has tended to slow down a bit.'' The figures, covering 218 religious bodies, show total membership at 142,926,363, a gain of 754,225, or 0.53 percent for 1985, the latest year for consolidated totals. At the same time, Government statistics indicate that the population grew by almost 1 percent. While the data collected from the church bodies themselves show about 60 percent of Americans affiliated, polls regularly show more than 70 percent say they are involved with a church. Contributions Have Increased The yearbook also gives other church data, including financial statistics showing the average church member gave $322, up from $300 the year before, the increase is greater than the inflatation rate of 3.8 percent. Per capita giving has increased 366 percent since 1961 when it was only $69, but when the figures are adjusted for inflation, the increase is only 29.7 percent in real terms. In Canada, overall religious membership increased by 0.31 percent for the year, somewhat less than in the United States, growing to 16,526,723, or 49,857 more than the year before. Seminary enrollment remained steady at 56,355, slightly down in the United States and slightly up in Canada. Seminary students now represent 26.4 percent of total student, a proportion that has grown for 13 years. The yearbook cites figures from the Gallup Religious Research Center in Princeton, N.J., showing 42 percent of American adults attend worship weekly. The proportion varies between Roman Catholics, 53 percent; Protestants, 42 percent; and Jews, 31 percent. The denomination reporting the biggest percentage gain in membership was the Assemblies of God, up 2.28 percent to 2,082,878.

3-> New Rightist Activity Worries Some Koreans
As the South Korean election nears, there is rising concern here about new extreme right-wing groups that charge that the Government is soft on Communism and vow to take action themselves. Human rights groups and some diplomats have expressed concern that the new groups could become vigilante organizations. But their leaders insist that their only purpose is to counter the influence of the left, and that they will do so without violence. In the last month, two such right-wing groups were founded - one by prominent ex-military men, and the other by a group of politicians and businessmen. Both say that they are determined to prevent radicals from taking advantage of the elections scheduled for next month, and that neither the Government nor influential leaders of society have done enough to stamp out leftism. ''During this presidential election, there is a kind of political vacuum,'' said Lee Chul Seung, a representative of the National Assembly and the head of the Pan-National Union for Liberal Democracy, one of the rightist groups. ''There is a very good chance for Communist elements to penetrate our society now. Communist ideology is like a drug addiction - we have to support our students and pull them out of Communist traps. The Government has failed to safeguard our society against Communism.'' Chung Il Kwon, a former Prime Minister and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Korean War, echoed these charges when he founded another anti-leftist group last month, called the Federation for the Safeguard of Freedom and National Salavtion. Both he and Mr. Lee say their groups will fight leftism by holding lectures on the dangers of Communism, running television and radio advertisements, publishing newsletters, and encouraging the formation of student groups on the right in order to counter the activity of those on the left. But the groups are vague about their exact plans. Mr. Chung told a monthly magazine here that his group was formed because ''we could not just sit back and watch what was going on'' and that his group would ''cooperate with other civilian groups in eradicating bad elements.'' Such language leaves some Western diplomats and human rights groups uneasy. Moreover, the charge that the Government is soft on the left comes as a surprise to groups that monitor human rights in South Korea, who are concerned about what they see as an intensifying Government crackdown on the more left-wing elements of the opposition. Communism is against the law here, and so rights that Americans take for granted, such as freedom of expression, do not apply to South Koreans who advocate Communism. But human rights groups say that some people who are critical of Government economic policy and of the United States role in South Korea are being wrongly labeled pro-Communist. Since the Government pledged to undertake democratic measures on June 29, the police have arrested more than 350 people who advocated boycotting a recent national referendum, called for President Chun Doo Hwan to resign in favor of a neutral cabinet, or advocated policies that the police charged mirrored North Korean propaganda, according to human rights groups and newspaper reports. They have also arrested people who were active in the wave of labor unrest that swept the country in August. The arrests and subsequent publicity, as well as the disruptive activities of some radicals, have prompted concern about student radicals among the general public - a concern these new right-wing groups can tap. Two housewives sitting in a coffee shop the other day brought up, unasked, their concerns about students. ''I feel there's something wrong there,'' said one housewife who gave her name as Mrs. Yu. ''I don't understand their mood - I'm frightened and worried. When I think about our national security, I disapprove of these students, but I am upset when they are beaten by the police.''

4-> Group Gets Stake in Manpower
A group of investors led by Bear, Stearns & Company announced today that it had acquired a 5.1 percent stake in Manpower Inc., the temporary employment services company that is the target of an unsolicited takeover attempt by Blue Arrow P.L.C. of Britain. Bear, Stearns, which acquired 818,000 shares of Manpower, said it intended to review Manpower's actions before disclosing its intentions. However, the announcement seems designed to put Manpower and its chief executive, Mitchell S. Fromstein, on notice that any anti-takeover measures that caused Manpower's stock price to fall would be likely to result in a shareholder lawsuit by the Bear, Stearns group. The seven directors of Manpower, the world's largest temporary employment agency, last Friday rejected a $1.21 billion offer by Blue Arrow, Britain's leading employment services concern. The board called Blue Arrow's $75-a-share tender offer ''inadequate'' and urged shareholders not to tender their stock. Manpower said it was exploring several alternatives to maximize shareholder value and preserve its independence. Mr. Fromstein said such actions could include acquiring a temporary-employment services concern that is smaller than Manpower or merging with a larger firm looking to diversify into the employment services industry. Higher Offer Expected Since Blue Arrow's offer, Manpower's stock price has traded above the $75-a-share offer, and as high as $80 a share, indicating that a higher offer is expected. Today in composite trading, Manpower closed at $78.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $2.50 on the day. Bear Stearns, in a statement filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that ''in light of Mr. Fromstein's stated intention 'to do what is best for shareholders' and that he is 'pursuing things that look like they may be more valuable,' Bear, Stearns intends to examine carefully Manpower's actions.'' Bear, Stearns said 520,600 shares had been purchased for its discretionary accounts - money managed for other investors - and the remaining 297,400 shares for its private accounts. The company said it had purchased the shares between June 19 and Aug. 12, at prices ranging from $46.75 to $79.25 a share. Separately, Manpower and Blue Arrow officials said today that they had met in a New York hotel to discuss Blue Arrow's offer. In a statement, Mr. Fromstein said discussions with Blue Arrow were preliminary and had not reached the point where price had been discussed. Blue Arrow's chairman and chief executive, Antony Berry, said he and Mr. Fromstein had discussed how the two companies would operate after a merger. He would not say whether a sweetened bid was in the works. ''We're always looking at our options,'' Mr. Berry said. ''Price will have to be discussed in due course, but for now everyone is quite relaxed.''

5-> GOING OUT GUIDE
Rock in Brooklyn Two of the most popular rock groups of the late 1960's and 1970's, Three Dog Night and America, will give a free concert tonight at 7:30 P.M. at Midwood Field in Brooklyn, near East 16th Street and Avenues K and L. The outdoor show, which is part of a nine-year-old summertime series sponsored by State Senator Martin Markowitz, Democrat of Brooklyn, will open with Joy Behar, a local comedian. America - which was formed in England by three sons of American servicemen - achieved fame with such soft-rock hits as ''Horse With No Name'' and ''Ventura Highway.'' Three Dog Night is said to have been named for the purported Australian custom of using dogs to keep people warm during frigid nights in the Outback. Beginning in 1969, the group recorded a string of best-selling singles, including ''One'' and ''Easy to Be Hard.'' Concertgoers are encouraged to take folding chairs and blankets. Information: (718) 469-1912. Honoring the Accordion ''Road to Patagonia'' is ''a trip through the accordion's role in the history of American vaudeville,'' according to William Schimmel, who wrote, directed and appears with Micki Goodman in this two-person show, to be performed tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M. at the 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street. ''Road'' traces the intertwined histories of American popular dance and accordion playing in a fast-moving melange of theater, dance, monologues and music. The show is produced by Merry Enterprises Theater, and is part of its Dawn Project Series, which was designed to develop new works of music-theater. Tickets are $10, $5 for students and the elderly. Reservations: 876-0827.

8-> MUSIC: CHARLES AZNAVOUR
CHARLES AZNAVOUR tackles disturbing subjects for a pop singer: mortality, divorce, infidelity, couples locked in battle. He's been perfecting an air of autumnal reflection at least since 1964, the year he wrote ''Yesterday.'' And Wednesday at Radio City Music Hall, the silver-haired, 63-year-old songwriter played his self-created roles - rueful observer, wronged party, victimizer, romantic - with artful casualness, sounding intimate even in the vast hall. Mr. Aznavour was accompanied by an orchestra, rather than the small band he brought to Carnegie Hall in 1985; the rich backdrop allowed him to deliver his songs with conversational ease and an actor's flair. In ''You've Let Yourself Go,'' he started out with the grizzled voice of a sour drunk, then let his voice mellow and glide into the closing reconciliation; in a new song about falling in love with a deaf woman, he made graceful sign-language gestures as he sang. Although the orchestra was sloppy at times, Mr. Aznavour was a paragon of mature pop singing. Pia Zadora opened the concert, and returned to sing a ''Fiddler on the Roof'' medley with a gallant Mr. Aznavour. In a set of standards, Ms. Zadora revealed both her skills - secure pitch, a warm vibrato - and her weaknesses, including a narrow range and little ability to swing an uptempo song. Ms. Zadora overuses one device, putting a crescendo and a widening vibrato on just about every sustained note, a la Liza Minnelli. But it's impossible not to appreciate the chutzpah of someone who calls the audience ''you, the public'' and announces brightly, ''I'm a native New Yorker; I was born in Hoboken.''

9-> COMPANY NEWS; NEKOOSA TO ACQUIRE OWENS-ILLINOIS UNIT
The Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the forest products holdings of Owens-Illinois Inc. for $1.15 billion. The acquisition, one of the largest in the paper industry, would increase Great Northern Nekoosa's presence in the growing shipping-box business at a time when the export market has strengthened because the dollar has declined in value. Under the agreement, Great Northern Nekoosa would acquire three container board mills, 21 corrugated box plants and about 700,000 acres of timberland, 140,000 acres of which are under long-term lease agreements. Owens-Illinois had been expected to sell the forest products properties since the company was acquired in February in a $3.64 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. ''The purchase of Owens-Illinois's highly integrated system will significantly strengthen our position in both the containerboard and container business,'' said William R. Laidig, Great Northern Nekoosa's chairman. The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., is the world's largest producer of office copier paper. It is also a leading producer of newsprint for the New England and Middle Atlantic States. Through the company's Great Southern Paper subsidiary, Great Northern Nekoosa has been a major maker of containerboard, which is used in making shipping boxes. The company entered the box manufacturing business last fall when it acquired four corrugated box plants from the J & J Corrugated Box Company of Fall River, Mass. The company is the largest land owner in Maine, where it owns 2.1 million acres of timberland. Great Northern Nekoosa also owns another 800,000 acres of timberland in several other states. Great Northern Nekoosa's stock dropped $1.375 yesterday, to $41.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the move reflected uncertainties about the long-term demand for corrugated boxes and the debt the company was assuming to make the acquisition. The Owens-Illinois forest products group, based in Toledo, Ohio, had sales of $730 million in 1986. The group employs about 4,500 workers. Analysts said that proceeds from the sale would help reduce the huge debt incurred by Kohlberg, Kravis in its buyout of Owens-Illinois.

10-> ADVERTISING; William Esty Promotes Itself in Newspaper Ads
Nothing like a bit of adversity and some new management to change an ad agency's modus operandi. Which leads to the question: Would you ever have dreamed that the William Esty Company, the sphinx of 42d Street, would run an ad promoting itself? Well, it has. The company, now part of Saatchi & Saatchi, will be spending almost $60,000 for full-page ads in The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, Advertising Age and Adweek.

11-> Sports World Specials; An Unsteady Start
Losing baseball games and being away from home were two experiences that were foreign to Willie Banks in high school. But the 18-year-old right-hander received an education in both while struggling through a summer of discontent with the Elizabethton (Tenn.) Twins in the Class A Appalachian League. With a 90-mile-per-hour fastball, Banks was regarded as the best high-school hurler in the country last year while pitching for St. Anthony's High School in Jersey City. He was selected third by the Minnesota Twins in the June draft. His transition from schoolboy sensation to the minor leagues, however, was about as smooth as a wild pitch. The 6-foot-1-inch, 186-pound Banks struggled with his control, was not enamored with attempts to alter his delivery and had difficulty adapting to the Southern environment. He labored through a 1-8 season with a 6.99 earned run average, striking out 71 and walking 62 in 65Z innings. ''Every night I was there, I wanted to go home,'' said Banks, who received a signing bonus of $160,000 from the Twins. ''It was probably the first time he was away from home,'' explained Jim Rantz, Minnesota's minor-league director. ''We had a very young club in Elizabethton, and Willie put extra pressure on himself. We were very happy with the way he finished up.'' Banks concluded his first professional season with a sterling performance in the Florida Instructional League. Pitchers only went three innings, so the pressure was minimal. And the town of West Palm Beach had more of the urban atmosphere to which Banks was accustomed. He allowed only 8 earned runs and struck out 24 batters in 28 innings. Six days after Minnesota won the World Series, Manager Tom Kelly visited and encouraged Banks. ''He called me a home boy because we are both from New Jersey,'' said Banks, who, with Kelly in attendance, pitched four innings, allowing no runs and striking out six. ''After watching me throw, he told me that he doesn't see any reason why I shouldn't be up in the majors.'' Rantz concurred. ''There aren't too many kids who can throw 90-plus miles an hour,'' said Rantz. ''He is a good athlete and a good competitor. The rest is up to him.''

12-> ADVERTISING; AN OFFER TO LIFT BID FOR JWT
Martin S. Sorrell raised the ante for JWT Group Inc. yesterday. His WPP Group P.L.C., a British marketing services company, said it would be willing to pay $50.50 a share, or about $470 million, for the JWT stock it didn't own. On Friday, WPP began an unsolicited $45-a-share tender offer for JWT, the parent of the J. Walter Thompson Company, a major advertising agency. A spokesman for the British concern noted yesterday that it was not actually increasing its tender offer. According to its latest letter to JWT, WPP is offering an incentive for the company to enter into ''a definitive merger agreement along the lines of the agreement we submitted to you on June 10.'' WPP also said yesterday that it seeks to place six of its nominees on JWT's board and that it would seek the consent of other JWT shareholders if JWT does not accept WPP's acquisition proposal, Reuters reported. By 10 o'clock yesterday morning JWT's stock price, which has continually outpaced the offer price, had climbed $1.375, to $52, where it closed on the day in heavy trading. The stock action indicates that Wall Street thinks there is another potential buyer, which may or may not be a ''white knight.'' But several analysts indicated that it would be difficult to top the WPP offer. MCA Inc., the entertainment conglomerate, was still being mentioned as a potential buyer. Hal Haas, MCA's corporate treasurer, said last week that it was company policy not to comment on such rumors. Meanwhile, the Ford Motor Company, JWT's most important worldwide client, promised an agency review should the ownership or senior management of the company change. The Ford division, which makes Ford cars and trucks, was responsible for slightly less than 10 percent of the JWT Group's total revenues in 1986, or about $60 million. All Thompson clients are watching with interest, and Eastman Kodak, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Philips International B.V. have implied that they might switch agencies if there was a change in management. Unlike last week's letter, which was addressed to Don Johnston, chairman and chief executive of JWT, yesterday's message from Mr. Sorrell was addressed to JWT's board. Mr. Sorrell, chief executive of WPP and previously a financial executive at the acquisitive Saatchi & Saatchi, did not let the JWT board overlook the events leading to his buyout attempt. ''We are sensitive,'' Mr. Sorrell wrote, ''to the special needs and demands of a service organization such as JWT, from the viewpoint of both its clients and employees, and particularly in light of the difficulties and turmoil experienced by JWT over the last several months. We understand the uncertainty can be unsettling and can damage stockholder value.'' The ''turmoil'' would refer in particular to the ''palace coup'' in January that led to the dismissal of Joseph W. O'Donnell and John E. Peters, who had but recently been named chairman and president, respectively, of the worldwide Thompson organization. Mr. Sorrell has announced Mr. Peters's willingness to come back, perhaps in the company of other former JWT executives. Mr. O'Donnell, once heir apparent, is now chief executive of the William Esty Company. Before concluding the letter with an appreciation for Thompson's history, tradition and professional strengths, Mr. Sorrell said: ''Management has been reported to have been considering a management-led leveraged buyout transaction. Under these circumstances, we are confident that the outside directors on your board, with independent advisers, will recognize the special responsibility placed on them in making a fair and thorough evaluation of our proposal.'' Mr. Sorrell had obviously been prepared to sweeten his proposal. His original offer was for all outstanding stock beyond the 4.98 percent his group owns, yet his first letter said that he had ''entered into financial arrangements that could provide up to $530 million.'' He also stressed last week that all proposals in his first letter were open to negotiation. The financing for the deal has been arranged by Samuel Montagu & Company and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. Donald Deaton, a JWT spokesman, said that the latest letter, the tender offer and other options would be brought to the attention of the board when it meets this week, possibly tomorrow. Many directors are traveling, he said, and JWT is having difficulty getting them together. For Wall Street the new offer was proof of Mr. Sorrell's tenacity. James D. Dougherty of County Securities U.S.A. said he thought it would effectively keep Mr. Johnston from getting the financing for a management-led leveraged buyout, especially with his company's recent profit problems. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said his analysis of Mr. Johnston showed that he was a man conscious of the history of the company and his place in it. If he leaves now, he leaves under a cloud, the analyst said, so the pressure is on him to carry off something special, perhaps a JWT acquisition or a particularly lucrative sale of JWT, maybe even to a Japanese company. Another analyst, who also asked for anonymity, said he had received calls from parties interested in buying part of JWT, which also includes Hill & Knowlton Inc., a public relations firm; Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc., an ad agency, and MRB Group Inc., a research company. But he said that nobody wanted the whole thing.

13-> RELATIONSHIPS; CHILDREN AND 2D WEDDINGS
HE had a teen-age son; she had two daughters in grade school. When the couple were planning their wedding, neither he nor she was sure how best to handle the children. Should they take part in the ceremony? Would it be better if they were simply guests at the wedding? Or would they be more comfortable if they didn't attend? Counselors say these questions are increasingly being raised as more marriages involve young children from previous marriages. It was once the custom, said Jeanette Lofas, president of the Step Family Foundation, a New York counseling and research organization, for the couple to slip away to a secret destination and announce their marriage upon their return. Experience has shown, however, that this often left the children with psychological scars. ''It exaggerates the child's sense of loss,'' Ms. Lofas said. ''They may be afraid they are being abandoned. They see actions taken that involve their lives, and yet they are being completely left out.'' Those who are old enough to make a decision seem to be most comfortable when presented with options, said Claire Berman, a past president of the Stepfamily Association of America and an author who has written widely on stepfamily issues. ''Let them know about the plans, and ask what they want to do. And then listen - don't insist.'' Unless the children object, it is usually best, therapists said, to involve them as closely as possible in the preparations and the ceremony. ''Present the idea as if it were the whole family's wedding,'' said Phyllis Rosenblum, a psychotherapist in Suffern, N.Y. ''The children will pick up on that attitude.'' The couple might even include the children in the wedding photos, said Marjabelle Young Stewart, the author of ''The New Etiquette'' (St. Martin's Press, $22.95). ''For years afterward,'' she said, ''they will look at that photo on the piano and think of it as 'our wedding.' '' Including the children's names as hosts on the invitations is also gaining wider usage, she added. So is the idea of giving the children a key role in the proceedings, to underscore that this is a family event. Diane Young-Shaw and Anthony Shaw Jr. of Westfield, N.J., involved their children when they were married last November. Each child was assigned a task. Mrs. Young-Shaw's 5-year-old daughter, Devon, escorted her mother up the aisle. ''She got a big kick out of the role and felt very important,'' Mrs. Young-Shaw said. Mr. Shaw's 14-year-old daughter, Amy, an aspiring singer, was the wedding soloist. ''She also had her moment in the spotlight,'' Mrs. Young-Shaw said. Mr. Shaw's younger daughter, Danielle, 9, was a ring bearer. ''We wanted it to be a joining of families, not just two people,'' said Mrs. Young-Shaw. The wedding helped the children develop a positive attitude toward the marriage, she said. But not all children are eager to be so closely connected with the marriages of their parents, who should be sensitive to that possibility. ''Many children feel they are betraying their biological parent by being part of the ceremony,'' Mrs. Berman said. If the child flatly refuses to attend the ceremony and appears to be very upset, that reaction should be treated as a warning signal, Ms. Lofas said. Clearly, the child has strong feelings about the new partner or about the prospective marriage, she added, and these should not be lightly dismissed ''because they will only get worse.'' The parent may want to reconsider his or her actions or seek professional help, she said. The person who will be officiating at the ceremony should be consulted in advance to make sure that he or she understands that the children will be present or will be participating in the ceremony. ''Tell the minister what is going on,'' Ms. Rosenblum said. The aim is to avoid any suggestion that the couple's prior marriages were mistakes. When making plans for the honeymoon, care should be taken to allay the children's fears, especially a child who is very young. Taking a child along on the honeymoon and then having a private holiday later when the new family unit is more firmly established might not be as foolish as it first appears, Ms. Lofas said. Indeed, that is just what happens in Danielle Steel's new best seller, ''Fine Things.''

14-> City Dad, Country Mom
Two friends recently transferred to New York talked about the effects of the change on their families. One family chose to live in the city, the other chose to live in the suburbs, and they have reciprocal regrets. As their conversation shows, the grass is always greener; so is the non-grass. City Dad: It's a weird life for a kid. Do you realize what I have to do when my daughters want to ride their bikes? Go get the car from the garage, load up the kids and the bikes and drive to Prospect Park. That doesn't leave a lot of spontaneity in bike riding. Country Mom: Yeah, well my kids can ride their bikes around the block any time. As a matter of fact they can ride their bikes around the block about 50 times between when they get home from school and when I get home from work. People say, ''What's more important for kids than fresh air and open space?'' And I think, ''Me, that's what.'' City Dad: But look at the freedom your kids have. They walk to the public school, walk to the neighbors' house to play, bike to the swimming pool. That's the way life is supposed to be for kids. In the city, we spend hours just trying to figure out who's going to escort which kid from one place to another and when. Country Mom: You think organizing kids' lives in the suburbs is a cinch? Everything is sprawled all over the place. The library's in one direction, ballet lessons in another and there's no subway or bus. Maybe that's the way life was supposed to be when Mom was around to drive them everywhere. At this point, there was a change of subject but not for long. The debate has plenty of life left in it.

17-> Military Magistrate Confines the Private Who Fled to Russia
A military magistrate ruled today that an Army soldier who defected to the Soviet Union earlier this year should be detained at the Philadelphia Naval Yard. The magistrate, Capt. Brenda Pifer, said the defector, Pvt. Wade E. Roberts, should be detained in the naval yard's brig because he posed a risk of escape and could have knowledge about sensitive military information. His civilian attorney, Ronald Kuby, called the detention ''punitive and unnecessary.'' Private Roberts, dressed in Army fatigues, sat quietly at the 15-minute proceeding as Mr. Kuby sought an administrative discharge for him, which would avoid a court-martial but would rescind all military benefits. The discharge would be ''under other than honorable conditions,'' military officials said. Private Roberts, 22 years old, of Riverside, Calif., has been in Army custody since his arrest Nov. 4 in Europe on a charge of desertion. On Thursday he was brought to Fort Dix, where he remained until Sunday, when he was taken to the Philadelphia Naval Yard. The Army limits confinement at the Fort Dix facility to 72 hours. Two-Year Sentence Possible Private Roberts could face two years at hard labor if convicted at a court-martial on the desertion charge. He said that at the time of his arrest last week he was told by United States officials he could face a less serious charge of being absent without leave. The charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison, but Army officials said this charge would probably result in only a dishonorable discharge. Army officials have said they are interviewing Private Roberts in an effort to determine if he discussed sensitive military secrets while he was in the Soviet Union. That investigation, which began at Fort Dix last week, was continuing at the Philadelphia brig. Private Roberts deserted his Army post at Giessen, West Germany, in April. He first fled to the Soviet Embassy in East Germany with a West German female companion, Petra Neumann, then left for the Soviet Union. He told the authorities that he left the Army when his superiors complained he was spending too much time with Miss Neumann. Miss Neumann, who is pregnant, did not accompany Private Roberts to the United States.

19-> Question Box
QUESTION: Has a major-leaguer ever hit 50 or more home runs in a season and failed to drive in 100 runs that season? The 50-homer hurdle has been cleared 10 times in the American League and seven times in the National and each time the player also cleared the 100 runs-batted-in plateau. The lowest r.b.i. total for a 50-homer hitter was 112 for Willie Mays with the 1965 San Francisco Giants, when Mays belted 52 home runs. The most r.b.i. for a 50-homer player came in 1930, when Hack Wilson of the Chicago Cubs hit 56 homers, a National League record, and batted in 190 runs, a major league record. Harmon Killebrew never hit 50 homers in a season, but his total of 45 in 1963 for the Minnesota Twins represents the most by a player who failed to drive in 100 runs in a season. Killebrew batted home 96. Six others have had seasons of 40 homers and fewer than 100 r.b.i.: Duke Snider of the 1957 Brooklyn Dodgers (40 homers, 92 r.b.i.), Mickey Mantle of the 1958 Yankees (42 and 97) and the 1960 Yankees (40 and 94), Rico Petrocelli of the 1969 Boston Red Sox (40 and 97), Henry Aaron (40 and 96) and Dave Johnson (43 and 99; yes, that Dave Johnson) of the 1973 Atlanta Braves, and Darrell Evans of the 1985 Detroit Tigers (40 and 94). * * * QUESTION: Wasn't there a player in the 1950's who had a penchant for hitting home runs on Sundays? Indeed there was, an outfielder named Charlie Maxwell who supplied a good deal of Sunday punch for the Detroit Tigers from 1955-62. Maxwell, a left-handed hitter who came up with the Boston Red Sox in 1950 and ended his career with the Chicago White Sox in 1964, belted 148 home runs and 40 of them came on Sundays, or 27 percent. His best homer output for one season came in 1959, when he hit 31. Four of them came in a row during a doubleheader sweep against the defending champion Yankees in Detroit on May 3. A Sunday. * * * QUESTION: In a major league box score, does the number after the abbreviation ''DP'' indicate all the double plays by a team in the game or just the routine ones? All kinds of double plays are lumped in the total. If a team turns a double play from short to second to first on a grounder with a runner on first, it is reflected in the box score, as is a double play in which a runner is thrown out stealing on a strikeout. And so is the double-out play in which an outfielder throws out a runner from second at the plate on a single to center and the catcher throws out the batter attempting to go to second base on the throw home. * * * QUESTION: Suppose in the final round of a professional fight, the boxer who is winning the bout is losing his stamina. Then his opponent's punch floors him for the mandatory 8 count. Can the boxer seek to catch his wind, as well as knock some valuable time off the clock, by rising at the count of 8, then dropping to the canvas for another eight seconds? Or does the referee make one continuous count during a knockdown? If a boxer keeps falling to kill time, he runs a big risk of killing his chances for victory, too. The countdown begins when a boxer's knee or glove hits the ring floor. If he rises to his feet before the count reaches 10, he must be in a position to defend himself, in the judgment of the referee. But if he goes down again - intentionally or unintentionally - then the referee generally will consider him unfit to put up a defense and will rule a knockout victory for the opponent. Such a boxing miscalculation occurred Dec. 12, 1969, in a heavyweight bout at Madison Square Garden between George Chuvalo and Jerry Quarry. With Quarry winning the fight, Chuvalo connected with a left hook to the temple in Round 7 that sent Quarry down. He was up by the count of 3, then dropped to one knee to await the rest of the count. But he failed to get up again before the count ended, saying later that he was watching the clock and did not hear the referee's count. Whatever the reason, Referee Zack Clayton declared Chuvalo the winner by knockout at 2 minutes 59 seconds of the round, and Chuvalo said afterward of his opponent: ''If he couldn't tell 9 from 10, it must've been a good punch.'' * * * QUESTION: If the Denver Nuggets, the team with the worst regular-season record in this year's playoffs (37-45), had shocked everyone and gone on to win the National Basketball Association championship, would they have remained entitled to pick eighth in next week's college draft? As long as the Nuggets had the eighth worst record (also the 16th best record) in the regular season, they earned the No. 8 pick, and their status as league champions would make no difference. However, the Nuggets turned over that first-round pick to Chicago in the deal for Darrell Walker, so the Bulls will make the eighth pick. Barring trades, the N.B.A. draft is based on the regular-season final standing, and it entails a lottery system among the seven teams that fail to qualify for the playoffs, followed by picks from the other 16 teams in an order that requires the worst to go first. It's different from the National Football League format, which bases its college draft on the order of finish in the regular season and the playoffs, with the Super Bowl champion picking last and the Super Bowl loser next to last no matter where they finished in the regular season. * * * QUESTION: Did Paul Volcker, the 6-foot-7-inch outgoing chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, ever play pro or college basketball? There is no record of him doing so at Princeton or in the N.B.A., as a starter or a reserve, Federal or otherwise.

20-> POPE SETS TERMS FOR ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH POLISH STATE
Pope John Paul II declared today that the Holy See could not establish diplomatic relations with the Polish Government until his local bishops were willing to pursue the struggle for political freedom and the Government did not interfere. The Vatican, which does not now maintain full diplomatic ties with any Warsaw Pact country, would find relations with Poland, with 36.8 million Catholics, ''a normal and right thing,'' John Paul said in a speech to Poland's bishops. But the speech laid down a challenge to both church and state in his homeland. Before accepting the Government's request for relations, which the Polish bishops recently embraced, the Pope said both church and state face important challenges in shaping Polish society. 'Truth About Man and His Rights' Poland's bishops, he said, must commit themselves to proclaiming ''truth about man and his rights,'' including ''the principle of participation in deciding about the matters of one's own philosophy even in the political sphere,'' and by implication, Vatican officials said, the Government must allow bishops to perform this role. The Pope added that full diplomatic ties could be achieved only after ''serious work'' to make the idea ''credible'' to the Polish people and to the world. In the past, both the Vatican and the Polish bishops have insisted that diplomatic relations could only be reached after the state recognized the legal status of the local church. Private Meeting With Jaruzelski However, John Paul made no explicit mention today of an accord, and a Vatican official said diplomatic relations could be established even without it. John Paul's first public comment on the Holy See's relations with Poland came shortly before he held an unscheduled private meeting with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish chief of state, who has sought the legitimacy that the Pope's diplomatic blessing would bring. The talk, lasting 55 minutes, took place at the Warsaw airport just before the Pope ended his weeklong visit to Poland. Met With Warsaw's Jews The Pope's final hours here were crowded with events that commemorated martyrs, all of them victims of a tragic history that always loomed darkly in the background of John Paul's messages to his countrymen. Early in the morning he met with representatives of Warsaw's Jews and prayed briefly at a Ukrainian church. He then visited the grave of a priest killed by the Communist secret police and beatified a bishop who died in the Dachau death camp. This afternoon, John Paul knelt in prayer aboard his specially-built vehicle at the center of a solemn religious procession that crossed the heart of Warsaw. An Unparalleled Event Steelworkers in their distinctive beige suits and matching broad-brimmed hats, coal miners in plumed caps, monks, nuns, acolytes and tens of thousands of others made a dramatic show of spiritual power. Vatican officials called the one-and-a-half-mile march an event unparalleled in any Communist capital. And, the officials said, it was the popular strength demonstrated in Warsaw today that General Jaruzelski would like to contend with by receiving full diplomatic recognition from the Holy See. After the huge mass in the center of the city, a group of several thousand people marched behind Solidarity placards, chanting Solidarity slogans. The police did not move to break up the noisy but small demonstration, as they had done in Gdansk. Significant Change of Tactics John Paul's address to the bishops this afternoon implied a significant change of tactics in the Vatican's dealings with the Polish Government and perhaps a broad shift in its approach to Eastern Europe, according to a senior Vatican official. For the last 30 years the Vatican has had an Eastern European policy of small steps, seeking gradual improvements in the church's status under Communist rule while resisting major initiatives that would grant legitimacy to any Marxist state. Openly Critical of the Government A clear change in this policy might emerge from the establishment of diplomatic relations with Poland if this took place while the local church's status remains unresolved and while the church finds many fundamental Government policies reprehensible. Throughout his third visit home, John Paul was openly critical of the Government, and he called on the Government to fulfill agreements reached with the Solidarity movement before it was crushed after General Jaruzelski's regime declared martial law in December 1981. Vatican officials said it was not clear whether the Pope would insist on any of the reforms he so dramatically suggested in speeches before cheering crowds as preconditions for full diplomatic recognition of the state. Subject of Talks for Decades Both Vatican and local church officials interpreted John Paul's pro-Solidarity speeches as a call for Poland's bishops to follow his example in proclaiming the movement's ideals of freedom and pluralism as part of the church's basic social doctrine. Today, he urged the bishops to follow the course in order to win the nation's confidence before establishing diplomatic relations, which have been the subject of talks off and on for decades. John Paul's speech was less than a complete policy statement, but it touched on a wide variety of sensitive issues involving global diplomacy as well as his own relationship to his homeland. The Pope noted that the Holy See, which represents the whole of Catholicism and not just the Vatican city-state, maintains diplomatic relations with 116 nations, including some where Catholics are a tiny minority. The absence of such relations with a Catholic country such as Poland, he said, ''is something rather abnormal,'' adding, ''it might be a kind of 'harm' for this nation.''

21-> Mexico Talks With Canada
Mexico and Canada may negotiate a new trade agreement similar to the one that Mexico just signed with the United States, legislators from both countries said today. Speaking at talks that began here on Tuesday, the legislators said that existing bilateral trade arrangements should be extended. ''An ad hoc mechanism is needed to resolve disputes, a procedure that is quicker than that established in the GATT,'' said Hugo Margain, chairman of the Mexican Senate Foreign Relations Committee, alluding to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mexico signed a trade accord with the United States last Friday that set up mechanisms to settle disputes.

22-> Schmidt Smacks 3 Homers
Mike Schmidt, who enjoyed one of his greatest thrills ever at Olympic Stadium, produced one of his greatest games here today. Schmidt hit three homers, drove in six runs and got his 2,000th career hit, powering the Philadelphia Phillies past the Montreal Expos, 11-6. Schmidt has now hit 53 home runs at Olympic Stadium, more than any visiting player. ''It's a memorable moment, but I've had one moment here that was even more memorable,'' he said. On the next-to-last day of the 1980 season, Schmidt hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning that clinched the National League East championship for Philadelphia and eliminated Montreal. The Phillies went on to win their only World Series. Today, Schmidt tied Mel Ott for 13th place on the career home run list with 511. Schmidt, who tied his single-game career-high with six r.b.i., has hit three home runs in a game two times and once hit a homer four times in an extra-inning game. He hit a three-run homer in the third inning against the starter, Lary Sorensen (3-3), for a 4-0 lead. Schmidt connected again in the sixth off Curt Brown for his 2,000th hit. Schmidt hit a two-run homer, his 16th of the season, off Randy St. Claire during a six-run seventh that made it 11-1. Schmidt, who grounded out in the second inning, came out of the game after his third homer. Said Schmidt: ''The condition of my ribs, the 11-1 score, and the fact that it was a day game after a night game, and my ribs were getting a little sore, it was right that I come out of the game.'' He returned to the lineup last Wednesday after being on the disabled list since May 26 with a strained muscle beneath his rib cage. Don Carman (4-5) carried an 11-3 lead into the eighth before Andres Galarraga's run-scoring double and a two-run homer by Reid Nichols, his second of the season, brought in Kent Tekulve.

23-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
THE ESSAYS OF VIRGINIA WOOLF: Volume I 1904-1912. Edited by Andrew McNeillie. 411 pages. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $19.95. ANYONE confronting this collection of Virginia Woolf's essays - the first of a projected series that will include all her nonfiction pieces -could be forgiven for sighing a small sigh. Haven't we already got enough Bloomsbury material to keep us going? Will the line trail on to the last tremor of doom? If you respond to Virginia Woolf at all, however, you only have to dip into the volume to find your resistance weakening. For a start, so much of what it contains has never been reprinted before - 83 of the 109 essays included. True, many of the newly resurrected pieces are brief reviews, and many of the longer ones have already been made available in earlier collections from ''The Common Reader'' onward. But new or old, it is a great advantage to have them presented in the order in which they were written (something that previous editions failed to do). Then, as you settle down to them, the essays quickly start working their spell. You forget the fashionable and distracting aspects of the Bloomsbury revival and remind yourself how very good Virginia Woolf could be, how daring and beguiling an imagination she possessed. Much of her earliest literary journalism appeared in The Guardian, a weekly paper catering to a highly respectable High Church readership. According to Andrew McNeillie, in his introduction to the essays, it tended to carry advertisements for such things as church organs, patent medicines and something called Vino Sacro, recommended as a wine that ''does not permanently stain altar linen.'' The first piece she wrote for The Guardian, at the age of 22 - in November 1904, some nine months after her father died - was a review of a novel by William Dean Howells, ''The Son of Royal Langbrith.'' It is too stiff to give you much idea of her quality; but in her second contribution, an account of a visit to Bronte country, she is already moving at her ease. Within a few months she had begun to write for other journals as well, notably The Times Literary Supplement (where reviews were anonymous) and her father's old paper, The Cornhill. She found herself, as young reviewers often are, assigned a great many novels, few of them offering much scope for brilliant comment. When she did have something worth getting to grips with - Henry James's ''Golden Bowl,'' no less - her review was subjected to some cruel editorial cuts (Mr. McNeillie reprints the very full and conscientious notes she had made while working on it), though she still had enough space to complain, along with her words of praise, that ''Mr. James tortures himself and wearies his readers in his strenuous effort to get everything said that there is to say.'' The only other novels she reviewed that are still remembered today were ''The House of Mirth'' and ''A Room With a View.'' On the Edith Wharton she was no more than adequate, on the Forster rather cool. (By the end of the story, she reports, ''the view is smaller than we expected.'') But she is not really a writer you go to for brisk clear-cut verdicts. She is at her best when she can let her thoughts play around a subject or wind her way into it. There are some old-fashioned occasional essays in this volume, in the tradition of Lamb or Robert Louis Stevenson, one or two descriptive pieces that come close to being prose-poems and a few articles on topics you don't immediately associate with Virginia Woolf, such as opera. But mostly she writes about literature or near-literature; not so much on its own account (though she often makes excellent points - about the profundity of some of Tom Hood's puns, for instance), but as a means of negotiating life more rewardingly, with more finesse. A good deal of her own strength is brought out when she complains that a biography of the eccentric Lady Hester Stanhope is altogether too staid. You feel that the biographer is smoothing things over, she observes, ''as though we were all at a tea-party together. It would be polite there to remark, 'Lady Hester is very fond of cats,' but in private, and writing is private, one should allow oneself to luxuriate in the fact that she kept forty-eight of them, choosing them for the harmony of their stars with her own, joining in a deep bass voice with their music at night, and accusing her doctor of a lumpish, cold, effeminate disposition if he found the noise intolerable.'' ''And writing is private.'' She was never in much danger of adopting a formal public manner herself, but in the course of these essays we can see her acquiring the full courage of her privacy, perfecting an intimate conversational style, learning to probe deeper into her own experience. The last of the essays in the volume was written in 1912, shortly before her marriage to Leonard Woolf. She was already at work on the novel that was eventually to be published as ''The Voyage Out,'' and it is natural to scan the essayist for signs of the future novelist. If she had gone on to write more conventional novels, the clearest evidence would no doubt be her growing ability to evoke character in the robust traditional sense. Some of the essays are splendid portraits in miniature - the sketch of the indomitable 18th-century bluestocking Elizabeth Carter, for instance. But a few go further, exploring the mysteries and half-lights of the inner life in a way that foreshadows ''Mrs. Dalloway'' and ''To the Lighthouse.'' The most striking example is an extraordinary fiery essay on the memoirs of Sarah Bernhardt. Along with the reviews of Howells and Edith Wharton, incidentally, the collection contains other pieces of American interest, among them a wry account of a book about Theodore Roosevelt called ''A Week in the White House.''

26-> OUSTER IS SOUGHT AT U.N. FARM UNIT
The United States, Britain and several other nations, most of them Western, plan to open a campaign here this week to replace the head of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, whom they accuse of mismanaging the organization and pursuing anti-Western policies, according to Western diplomats. At a meeting Monday of the F.A.O.'s 49-member executive council, the diplomats say, these nations will press for the replacement of the official, Dr. Edouard Saouma, when his second six-year term expires at the end of 1987. In his place, they want to appoint Moise Mensah of Benin, who is deputy director of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which also aids third-world farmers. Dr. Saouma, a Lebanese, could not be reached for comment over the weekend, but an F.A.O spokesman denied the charges, saying that under Dr. Saouma the organization has become more efficient and more oriented toward helping poor countries. The spokesman said spending on headquarters posts had fallen from 77.2 percent of the 1974-75 budget to 54.5 percent in 1986-87. At the same time, the spokesman said, Dr. Saouma has created a ''streamlined evaluation service'' designed to test the efficiency of the organization's programs. Dr. Saouma has ''strengthened field activities and slashed administrative costs,'' the spokesman added. Asian Food Gains Cited In the latest F.A.O. annual report, Dr. Saouma defends himself against Western charges. In particular, he stresses that in Asia, ''food self-sufficiency is close at hand,'' although 20 years ago ''the prospect of that area ever producing sufficient food looked bleak.'' The drive to replace Dr. Saouma is the latest move in a campaign by Western and some other nations to deal with what they call inefficiency by the United Nations and a tendency by many of its agencies to pursue policies inimical to Western interests. The United States and Britain have withdrawn from Unesco, charging that the educational, scientific and cultural body is badly run and promotes controversial political causes. The 11 biggest Western contributors to the United Nations and its agencies have agreed to put a limit on its spending increases. The United States has reduced its 25 percent assessed share of all United Nations spending. In recent weeks, the Western diplomats said, the Lebanese Government has pleaded with Western nations for Dr. Saouma's reappointment, saying his replacement would constitute a further humiliation for wartorn Lebanon. Secretary of State George P. Shultz was persuaded only with difficulty to endorse the removal of Dr. Saouma, according to the diplomats. The nations that want to replace Dr. Saouma are concerting their strategy in secret meetings of what is known as the Camberley Group, after the town in England where the first meeting was held last year. The original members of the group were Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. U.S. Excluded at First France, which supports Dr. Saouma, was not invited to the group's meetings. The United States was also excluded at first because its representative to the F.A.O., Millicent Fenwick, a former member of Congress, was believed to support Dr. Saouma. But since her departure a few months ago, the United States has been associated with the move against Dr. Saouma. Supporting Dr. Saouma are most Arab and African nations and many other third-world nations, diplomats say. Italy has declared itself neutral. With a two-year budget of $420 million and about $1 billion in pledges from donor countries for food programs it administers, the F.A.O. is the second-largest United Nations aid-giving organization, after the World Bank. Western governments say it is poorly run, often encouraging grandiose products in developing countries that are not suited to their needs. Under Dr. Saouma, the organization is also accused of drawing up contentious guidelines for world farm trade that impinge on other bodies.

27-> BOND IS ASKED FOR CAPTURED FUGITIVE
Silas (Trim) Bissell, a captured fugitive who was once a member of the radical Weatherman organization and eluded Federal agents for 17 years, apparently by living as a ''model citizen,'' may be released on bond in the next few days, his lawyer said today. Mr. Bissell, arrested last week on a Federal charge of attempting to bomb an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps building at the University of Washington in 1970, was described before a Federal magistrate here today as a model citizen who assumed the name Terrence Peter Jackson and got college degrees, made speeches, was interviewed on radio and was now a physical therapist. Larry Finegold, Mr. Bissell's attorney, said his client took out student loans, had a medical operation paid for with Federal welfare money and wanted to repay the Government for food stamps he had accepted, ''but the bureaucracy said unless there was fraud involved, he couldn't repay them.'' No Share in Family Fortune The lawyer said Mr. Bissell, a member of the family that manufactures carpet sweepers, had no money from the fortune that was begun by his great-grandfather and had not been engaged in any political activity except voting since he and his wife, Judith, forfeited $50,000 bail in 1970. In a plea for release, Mr. Finegold told Magistrate John L. Weinberg, ''Contrary to the image you and I have of a fugitive, Mr. Bissell lived quite openly, and obviously that's why he was finally arrested.'' Now 44 years old and baldish, Mr. Bissell pleaded not guilty to firearms and conspiracy charges and told the court he would not flee and would return to his physical therapy job in Eugene, Ore., while awaiting trial, which has been set for March 31. Three Offer to Put Up Bond Judge Weinberg, dismissing objections from the Federal prosecutor, agreed to let Mr. Bissell go home if three friends who knew him as Terrence Jackson would carry out their offer to put up equity in their homes as a $95,000 property bond and make court appearances. Mr. Finegold said he hoped to have Mr. Bissell free ''within a few days.'' Assistant United States Attorney Kenneth Parker objected to any bail, saying, ''You don't reward him for living a successful life as a fugitive.'' He said Mr. Bissell committed ''a very violent act'' in attempting to blow up the R.O.T.C. building here on Jan. 17, 1970, ''and highlighted the problem by not telling officers, after his arrest, that the bomb was still ticking.'' The homemade bomb did not go off. Doubt Over Weatherman Role Mrs. Bissell, now 42 and estranged from her husband, was arrested in Seattle in 1977 and convicted of a charge of attempted bombing. She served 22 months in a Federal prison and was released in 1981. Mr. Bissell had been described by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as one of the most sought-after ''fugitive terrorists,'' but officials now say they have no evidence that he was a founding member of the Weather Underground, an revolutionary offshoot of the militantly leftist Students for a Democratic Society. But Mr. Finegold said his client was a Weatherman member in 1970 when the University of Washington was shut down often because of campus unrest. In a 1969 demonstration, according to an outstanding charge, Mr. Bissell clubbed a police officer. The Impetuous Decade ''He may have been an impetuous young man, judge, but those were impetuous times,'' Mr. Finegold told the court, but today, ''Mr. Bissell is a kind, sharing person, someone who has devoted his life to public service.'' Except for a phone call from Abbie Hoffman, the prominent leftist of the 1960's who was in Seattle this week, Mr. Bissell has not been in touch with any political acquaintances he made in the 60's, Mr. Finegold said. He described how Mr. Bissell, a college teacher who was an award-winning poet in the early 1960's, assumed an alias, ''Pogo,'' and started his new life in less than a year after he and his wife jumped the $50,000 bail bond put up by his parents. After separating from his wife, he worked his way into Eugene's community life as a stand-up comedian, a grocery clerk, and by volunteering to help the local folk dancing society. He had knee surgery as a welfare patient ''and he repaid that on his own, two years later,'' Mr. Finegold said. Seeking degrees in biology and physical therapy in the 1970's, he attended several schools, including the University of Oregon, Oberlin, the University of North Carolina, and Duke. Mr. Bissell paid for much of this education with the student loans, his lawyer said.

28-> GOING OUT GUIDE
NOTES FROM ABROAD Followers hereabout of traditional Irish fiddling believe that, first of all, Irish fiddling is the ultimate form of the art. It is, they say, technically superior to most European fiddling and musically more imaginative. . And second, New York is the Irish fiddling capital of the Western Hemisphere. In the 1920's and 30's, for example, local Irish fiddling proponents performing on records, the old 78's, had a profound affect on the sound of Irish fiddling locally and in Ireland. The Eagle Tavern is to Irish fiddling what Madison Square Garden is to heavyweight boxing, and tonight two prominent fiddlers will harmonize at the tavern. Paddy Reynolds left Garvary, Ballinamuck, in County Longford some 40 years ago. He came to the Bronx and in the 1950's built a reputation by performing at weddings and dances. His playing represents the New York style of fiddling. His partner this evening will be Brian Conway. Mr. Conway was born in the Bronx and last year won the All-Ireland fiddling championship. The duets will be performed at 9 and 10:30 P.M. Admission is $5. The Eagle Tavern is at 14th Street and Ninth Avenue. For further information, call 924-0275. BETTER LATE . . . Tonight is the unofficial opening night for the American Jewish Theater's second production of the season. ''Panache!,'' a comedy by Ron Mark, tells the story of an actor in the Yiddish Theater who was deprived of an opportunity to play a role he coveted, Cyrano de Bergerac. Now, at age 68, he gets his chance. Sam Gray plays the actor. Yusef Bulos, Sol Frieder, Steve Gilborn, Richard Parnell Haversham, Ann Sachs and Rebecca Schull are also in the cast. Stanley Brechner directs. Curtain time is 8 P.M. Henceforth, performances will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 2 and 7 P.M. The official opening is Jan. 15. Admission is $18.50. The American Jewish Theater of the 92d Street Y is at 1395 Lexington Avenue, at 92d Street. Information: 427-6000, extension 100. LAST CALL This weekend the Queens Museum offers the final opportunity to view a historic exhibition of drawings, ''American Masters: Works on Paper From the Corcoran Gallery of Art.'' This show is a display of drawings in pencil, charcoal, chalk, watercolor and gouache by more than 50 major American artists.

30-> MAN IN THE NEWS; A Seasoned Counselor: Peter Lenard Zimroth
Early in 1980, Peter L. Zimroth, then chief assistant to the Manhattan District Attorney, was considering two job offers, one to join a small Wall Street law firm and the other to become Mayor Koch's criminal-justice coordinator. Mr. Zimroth turned down the Mayor's offer. Instead, he entered private practice, after 14 years as a prosecutor and law professor, ''to get more breadth as a lawyer,'' Mr. Zimroth recalled yesterday after Mr. Koch named him the city's new Corporation Counsel. Despite that concern of seven years ago, Mr. Zimroth's resume and interviews with his friends suggest that diversity has long been one of his greatest assets. ''I think I'm a very good lawyer, I do,'' Mr. Zimroth said in an interview after a brief news conference in the Mayor's City Hall office. ''And I've had a very broad experience in the law. ''I've been a prosecutor, a defense lawyer, a teacher. I've been an administrator. And I really feel very strongly about using the law as an instrument for social good. That's why I became a lawyer.'' In Past, a Top Advisory Post The Mayor's two previous Corporation Counsels - Allen G. Schwartz and Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who officially left the post Thursday after five years to return to private practice - each became a close adviser to Mr. Koch on matters of general policy as well as of law. Mr. Koch said yesterday that he hoped Mr. Zimroth would ''occupy the same role that they occupied.'' Mr. Zimroth, a 43-year-old native of Brooklyn, was offered the job Monday and accepted it Tuesday. He said he had not yet formulated specific ideas or themes that he might emphasize as the city's top lawyer and head of an office of 500 lawyers. In addition to defending the city, he said, he hoped ''to use the law in an imaginative way.'' Mr. Zimroth also said that he thought the city corruption scandal was ''more a challenge than a liability'' to someone entering the administration, because it provided an opportunity to work toward fundamental changes in government and politics. Friends said Mr. Zimroth's tenure as the top assistant to District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan from 1977 to 1980 would serve him well in his new job. 'Experience in Public Issues' ''He's had a lot of experience in the kinds of public issues that the Mayor's lawyer needs to consider,'' said Judge Pierre N. Leval of Federal District Court in Manhattan, an old friend and colleague. Born Jan. 11, 1943, Peter Lenard Zimroth was raised in the Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay sections. His father, Sol, owned a dry-cleaning store in Brooklyn, and later sold insurance and mutual funds. His mother, Ruth, was a homemaker during his youth and later worked as a bookkeeper. His parents now live in Connecticut, as does his sister, Alice. Mr. Zimroth graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, Columbia College and Yale Law School. He was editor in chief of The Yale Law Journal. He was a law clerk to Chief Judge David L. Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, then to Justice Abe Fortas of the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. Zimroth worked as an assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan for several years before joining the law school faculty at New York University in 1970. He taught courses on the Federal courts, criminal law and criminal procedure and attained the rank of professor. A Reunion With Morgenthau In 1974, he published a book, ''Perversions of Justice,'' about political trials in the United States during the late 1960's and early 1970's. In 1975, he rejoined Mr. Morgenthau - under whom he had worked in the United States Attorney's office in the late 1960's - in the District Attorney's office. Since entering private practice in 1980, he has specialized in criminal and civil litigation. Mr. Zimroth described the practice as ''a broadening experience.'' ''The demands of the courts and clients are really different from those in public life,'' he said. ''Every case that you have, you have to learn a new thing, a new business, a new industry.'' Robert S. Fink, a partner with Mr. Zimroth in the firm of Kostelanetz & Ritholz, described the new Corporation Counsel as ''a perfectionist.'' Knows How to Relax ''He is an extremely hard worker; he's a workaholic,'' Mr. Fink said. ''He is, I think, a very, very brilliant lawyer. And he is probably the best trainer of young lawyers in our firm.'' While Mr. Zimroth will work through the night when necessary, Mr. Fink said, he also knows how to relax. It was during such a moment that Mr. Zimroth met his wife, the actress Estelle Parsons, 14 years ago. She was filming a movie, ''Four Play,'' at a bar in SoHo and Mr. Zimroth, who accompanied a mutual friend to the set, got a role as an extra. ''And he had those beautiful blue eyes,'' Ms. Parsons said. The couple lived in the same building on Manhattan's Upper West Side but had never met. Married four years, they are still there, with their son, Abraham, who is 3. Mr. Zimroth, who will earn $94,500 a year, said he had taken a ''very substantial'' cut in pay to return to government. Asked how long he expected to remain Corporation Counsel, he answered, ''As long as I can afford it.''

31-> COLUMN ONE: THE COURTS; Guidelines Ordered For Attorney Fines
Court administrators in New York are bracing for what one official says could be ''a real hot potato'' - formal rules stating the fines judges may impose on lawyers for bad courtroom behavior. Judges are already allowed to penalize lawyers for behavior ranging from showing up late for a hearing to filing frivolous legal motions that slow cases. But in practice, court adminsitrators say, judges have seldom chosen to impose fines. Last month, however, a case in which a judge had imposed such a penalty came before the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. In its ruling, the court said there should be guidelines stating what level of fine is merited by which behavior. The ruling instructed the State Office of Court Administration to draft guidelines as quickly as possible. ''It's going to change the rules of the game a lot,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, the deputy chief administrator of the courts. ''It will give judges much more power to control their caseloads.'' Administration officials said it was difficult to say how stiff the penalties might be. One state law already on the books, however -which only covers personal injury suits - allows fines of up to $10,000. ''If we're going to have a meaningful sanction, it will have to be more than a token amount,'' said the counsel to the state Office of Court Administration, Michael Colodner. A spokesman for the City Bar Association, however, warned that forming the guidelines, a job that administrators will start this month and hope to complete next month, will not be easy. ''It's going to take some time and a great deal of thought,'' said the chairman of the Association's Committee on Professional Discipline, Stanley S. Arkin. ''There are lawyers who abuse the process,'' he said, but ''you don't want to inhibit novel and creative lawsuits.'' Stacking Courthouses A joint city-state committee studying the problems of New York City's crowded court buildings is considering a uniquely New York solution for at least one site: building on top of an existing courthouse. Committee members say engineering studies are under way on a proposal to add as many as four stories to an eight-story, 57-year-old building at 80 Centre Street in lower Manhattan, which is currently used for courts and state offices. Members of the committee say the proposal, part of a $200 million capital improvements project pledged by Mayor Koch last August, illustrates the difficulty they face in trying to expand and improve courts in the congested areas where most of the city's court buildings are situated. ''Finding new land in Manhattan is going to be difficult, if not impossible,'' said a member of the committee, Harvey W. Spectre, a deputy budget director at the city's Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Spectre said construction on the 80 Centre Street site could begin next year if the project is found to be feasible. Jurors' Identities More and more court clerks and judges are refusing requests from reporters and the public for the names of jurors in highly publicized trials, administrators say. The reason: a recent appeals court ruling that said they are not required to provide the names. The ruling, by an Appellate Division panel in Brooklyn, resulted from one of the first legal challenges to a 1978 state law that called such information ''confidential'' and only subject to release by order of the Appellate Division. Administrators said the ruling has been circulated to clerks in courtrooms across the state. Whether such rules are needed and will be universally applied in courts throughout the state are still subjects of debate. ''In my experience, there's very little harassment of jurors,'' Justice Peter J. McQuillan, administrative judge of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said. New Post, Cold Shoulder New York State's first Director of the Office of Security Services is expected to be named sometime next week, but court administrators say he will likely get a cold welcome from many members of the current court security force. The reason, administrators and court security officials say, is the long-simmering opposition among many unionized court workers to the idea of a court security office in general and to this particular administrative version. A key conflict, they say, is that court clerks, who have traditionally supervised in-court security, are not to be considered for promotion to the supervisory jobs that are to be created under the direction of the state security chief. Instead, the supervisor's jobs - there are to be at least six deputies or assistant directors -are reserved for uniformed court officers. ''We wanted to give them a career ladder,'' said Mr. Crosson at the Office of Court Administration, referring to the uniformed officers. ''But it's been a real mess.'' ''This is just the first shot,'' said Robert W. Olivari Jr., spokesman for the New York State Court Clerks Association, referring to the director's appointment. ''Are we going to continue to oppose it?'' he said. ''Definitely yes.''

32-> Slow and Fast Solutions on Teen-Age Pregnancy
To the Editor: It took a 15-member expert panel of the National Research Council two years and 337 pages to come to the empty conclusion that ''we currently know very little about how to effectively discourage unmarried teen-agers from initiating intercourse.'' Based on their inability to arrive at a more suitable solution, their recommendation was to provide teen-agers with low-cost contraceptives. This is my solution, and it will take only two seconds and three words to relate it: ''Thou shalt not!'' Or, in the words of St. Paul: ''Flee youthful lusts'' (II Timothy 2:22). To supply teen-agers with an easy exit is to spell failure from the start. Teen-agers need to feel that parents have a sense of confidence in their integrity. If they feel they are expected to engage in sex before marriage, they probably will. DIANE DEW Milwaukee, Dec. 11, 1986

34-> Hebrew Department Established at N.Y.U.
New York University has created a department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, the first of its kind in the school's history, with endowments totaling $4.2 million. The university's president, John Brademas, said the new department, which will open next fall, would be named in honor of the late Jack H. Skirball, a businessman, realtor and movie producer. The Skirball Foundation donated $3 million. The gift will be used to endow two professorships in modern Jewish history and modern Jewish thought or literature, as well as for student scholarships, library acquisitions, seminars and symposia. An additional $1.2 million was donated by the S. H. and Helen Scheuer Family Foundation, named after the parents of Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of Queens, to be used for another endowed professorship. And $250,000 was contributed by Etta Silverstein, the mother of Larry Silverstein, a developer and university trustee, for student scholarships.

35-> INQUIRY INTO L.I. POLICE IS ASSAILED BY OFFICIALS
The State Commission of Investigation, in the second day of a public inquiry into the Suffolk County Police Department, today questioned department procedures and drew angry reactions from police officials and a roomful of detectives. DeWitt C. Treder, Commissioner of Police, who testified today about the procedures, criticized the state panel afterward at a news conference. He said the two days of hearings did not support the panel's allegations that police officers had fabricated evidence or committed perjury. The hearings, at the Suffolk County legislative building here, followed a 14-month investigation by the commission, which has no prosecutorial powers but can subpoena witnesses. A lawyer who represents the Suffolk County Detective's Association also denounced the hearings. ''There is no need at all for this public spectacle,'' the lawyer, Thomas J. Spota, said in an interview. He said that all the testimony taken in the hearings had already been given privately to the commission. Most of those who testified had been interviewed privately by the commision, commission officials said. Protest by Officers In a quiet protest this morning, about 200 police officers and detectives demonstrated against the hearings outside the building where they were held. Inside, 100 detectives and prosecutors from the District Attorney's office attending the hearing were more vocal. The largely hostile audience applauded witnesses and jeered the commission. At one point, the commission's chairman, David G. Trager, threatened to throw the audience out. The commission asked Mr. Spota, who has accompanied many of the witnesses as they testified, to address the audience. ''There is no reason to clap, no reason to boo,'' he said. The department's salaries, which range from $19,000 to $40,277 for police officers, make it one of the highest paying in the country, according to a department spokesman. Its 2,500 officers patrol the county's five western towns. Villages in the five eastern towns have separate forces. Defense by Prosecutor On Wednesday, the commission said that wrongdoing by police officers was ''shamefully tolerated by the District Attorney's office.'' Testifying before the commission, Patrick Henry, the District Attorney, denied that his department participated in or condoned any wrongdoing. At today's hearing, L. Kevin Sheridan, a commissioner from Nassau County, asked Dennis Rafferty, a Suffolk homicide detective, ''Do you think police procedures should be tightened, the leadership better?'' Detective Rafferty had already provided lengthy testimony about two murder cases he investigated, both of which led to acquittals by juries. Answering Mr. Sheridan, he said he disagreed with the commission. 'Very Effective' ''I thought we were very effective,'' Detective Rafferty said. ''I'm not going to criticize the homicide squad, no.'' The five commissioners and two staff lawyers questioned 12 witnesses today about two cases: the murder of a Brentwood lawyer, Archimedes Cervera, and the mistaken arrest of an 18-year-old man who has accused the police of beating him. Instead of centering on the charges of perjury and fabricated evidence, as it did Wednesday, today's hearings dealt more with what the commission called a lack of proper procedures in the police department. The commission will issue its findings and recommendations in several months, officials have said.

37-> CHILD SUPPORT: AN ANXIETY MILL FOR MOTHERS, FATHERS AND THE LAW
To the Editor: In ''It's Getting Harder to Cheat Children'' (editorial, Jan. 5), you again criticize absent fathers. But has anyone bothered to examine how child support is actually used by the custodial parent? Perhaps there's as much cheating committed by custodial mothers who apply child support to their own pleasures rather than the needs of the children. Perhaps absent fathers become disenchanted with sending large checks to their ex-wives only to see their children in tattered clothes and rundown shoes or needing haircuts when they visit. Perhaps absent fathers grow tired of bearing the entire burden of financial support for their children in cases where the mother simply refuses to work, preferring to punish her ex-husband by using the children as income producers. Fathers are not heartless bums. Many are converted to mere wallets for children they aren't permitted to see regularly. The measures now available for use against ''delinquent'' fathers are a step in the direction of protecting vulnerable children. But the best way to insure that children are adequately cared for, following divorce, is to address the lopsidedness of the system and require mutual responsibility and accountability. Only then will the children benefit. DEBORAH H. PERKINS Redding, Conn., Jan. 6, 1987

38-> N.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP: GIANTS vs. REDSKINS; Tradition, Pride and Now Glory: Line
SINCE two-platoon football came to the National Football League in 1950, the Giants, in lean years and good, have been celebrated for their defense. The heroes are legendary. There was Sam Huff, the prototype middle linebacker, and Tom Landry, the genius defensive back who became a genius coach. There were the old-time defensive ends such as Andy Robustelli and Jim Katcavage and the modern-day linebackers such as Brad Van Pelt, Harry Carson and the ultimate, Lawrence Taylor. The Giants team that plays the Washington Redskins today for the National Conference title and a Super Bowl berth is well endowed on offense. It is superb on defense, which should be no surprise because its coach, Bill Parcells, was a college linebacker who became an N.F.L. defensive coach and coordinator. ''Defense keeps you in the game,'' says Parcells. ''There are going to be some days when the offense doesn't play that well. If the defense plays well, that gives you a chance.'' So Parcells, who became the Giants' head coach in 1983, has built his team defense first. In 1984, when the Giants had many needs on offense, he used the third choice over all in the draft to take Carl Banks, a linebacker. The Giants, with a linebacking crew about to become the best in the league, hardly seemed to need another linebacker, but the choice turned out to be a blessing for them. This season the Giants accumulated six draft choices in the first three rounds, and used all six for defensive players: Eric Dorsey, Mark Collins, Erik Howard, Pepper Johnson, Greg Lasker and John Washington. None of these rookies is a starter, but except for Washington, who went on injured reserve a week ago, all will play against the Redskins. Collins, Howard and Johnson have made significant contributions filling in for injured starters. Parcells says it is not important who starts and who does not because he uses 17 or 18 defensive players regularly. His situation substitutions sometimes give more playing time to a nonstarter than to a starter. Parcells wants his defensive players to fit molds. He likes his ends big and tall, his nose tackles solid and blocky. He likes his outside linebackers tall and solid, his inside linebackers big and strong and his defensive backs tall and strong. One theme runs through those job descriptions: big players. The defense he has put together has an additional theme: good players. The result has been domination. The Giants were second in the league in total defense - first against the rush, holding opponents to 80 yards a game -and their total of 236 points allowed was second to the Chicago Bears. Here is an inside look at each part of the defense and at the man who is in charge, Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator. LINE 75 George Martin: DE, 6-4, 255, 12th Year 64 Jim Burt: NT, 6-1, 260, 6th 70 Leonard Marshall: DE, 6-3, 285, 4th 74 Erik Howard: NT, 6-4, 268, Rookie 78 Jerome Sally: NT, 6-3, 270, 5th 77 Eric Dorsey: DE, 6-5, 280, Rookie THE small room just off the main locker area in Giants Stadium is virtually wallpapered with inspirational sayings handwritten on cardboard cards. By one recent count, there were 58 of them, on all four walls, above the door, between the blackboards, up to the ceiling: ''Doing nothing is the most tiresome job in the world because you don't have time to rest;'' ''Men don't fail, they give up trying.'' In such an atmosphere, it seems improbable for even a chronic sinner or a lowdown skunk to want to do anything but straighten up and fly right. Now! The fact that these homilies were gleaned, penned and posted to motivate a handful -no, a vanful - of beefy young men to crash into, run over, and knock down other contingents of beefy young men is beside the point. ''My favorite saying?'' says Lamar Leachman, the man behind this theme room, and the defensive line coach of the Giants. ''That's hard, but how about, 'As long as you're green you continue to grow. It's when you think you're ripe that you begin to rot.' '' Leachman is a wiry-haired, white-haired Georgian who, from this room, spends long hours devising the strategies for the defensive line: the three nose tackles (Jim Burt, Jerome Salley and Erik Howard), the three defensive ends (George Martin, Leonard Marshall and Eric Dorsey) and the defensive end without portfolio, who lines up at that position for rushing the passer, Lawrence Taylor. Ranging in size from Burt, at 6 feet 1 inch, 260 pounds, to Dorsey, 6-5, 280, they are a unit within a unit within a unit. And Leachman's reward for all his labor? ''What we like to do to Lamar sometimes,'' said Dorsey, the rookie defensive end, ''is put tacks on his chair, or, because we know he likes fruit, punch a hole in his orange when he isn't looking and pour in white-out ink.'' One other reward should be noted: That defensive line of Leachman's is considered by many to be perhaps the finest in the National Football League. Nor are rookies immune from the perpetration of pranks, and Dorsey also has a memento enshrined in Leachman's office. A brown paper bag, a presentation by the other members of the line, hangs nailed to the bulletin board in the room, and bears the inscription: ''To Eric Dorsey, in honor of his 1st sack in the N.F.L.'' Dorsey accomplished the feat only last week - in the season's 17th game -against the 49ers. But he's proud of the memento. For his sack, to be sure, but also for the feeling of acceptance by his fellow linemen. ''The sense of being together, like being in a war, is what I think helps make us so successful,'' said Dorsey. ''If I ever went into combat, I'd want to go with these guys. They're tough - some of the toughest people in the country - and they know what they're doing. They've got excellent technique.'' There's the standard head-and-shoulders fake to get around the offensive lineman, or the slap hands up or the slap hands down or the double-slap sideways, but the object is always the same, according to the teachings of Chairman Leachman: ''Hit people. Always be around the ball. Never give up.'' ''And you saw that in last Sunday's game against the 49ers,'' said Leachman. ''Remember when Jerry Rice broke into the open and then dropped about near his end zone? Well, when he did - and he's one of the faster guys in the league - there were nine of our guys around him to go after the loose ball. Not only are they there to recover the fumble, but to block for the guy who recovers it and starts to run. That's effort.'' The defensive line is close-knit, the members agree. Before each practice session, they hold Bible readings, with each of the linemen (and Taylor) taking turns leading the session. And some of their closest friends are often fellow linemen. The player who sets the tone is probably Martin, now in his 12th N.F.L. season. He makes sure they talk to each other during the game. ''If there's a problem,'' said Howard, ''George is first to try to clear it up. And when one of us makes a good play, there's George saying, 'Way to go.' '' ''There's kind of a buddy-buddy system with us,'' added Howard, ''You watch his back, and he'll watch yours.'' Salley said that it was Martin who ''nurtured me when I was a rookie.'' ''He's the grandfather defensive end, one of the wise men,'' he said, ''and he showed me certain moves, especially about the pass rush. 'Hey, Jerome,' he'd say, 'that guy's tryin' to hook you.' When you're new, you think you may have to try new things, but George told me, 'Never go away from your pet moves.' '' After Christmas meal at his home, Salley ventured over to Martin's. ''I go there a lot, several of us do,'' said Salley. ''I like to wrestle with his three boys.'' Martin's boys are ages 10, 8 and 4. Marshall also points to Martin as an important guidepost. ''I was a high draft pick and a lot was expected of me when I came here five years ago,'' said Marshall. ''And then I was 7 or 8 pounds overweight and I was expected to step right in and replace Gary Jeter, who had been very good. I was confused. And George, with his counseling, helped take the pressure off me.'' There's great respect, but there's also a looseness, around Martin. ''He's a religious man, a man of high moral character,'' Dorsey said, ''and sometimes when someone cusses in front of him, they'll apologize to George. And he says, 'It's too late, now.' That happens all the time.'' Howard found Burt to be helpful in the big-brother manner, too. And Burt also teaches by example. ''He may not have as much ability as some of the other nose tackles in the league,'' said Leachman, ''but I've never seen a tougher guy than Jim Burt, and one who has developed such fine technique.'' Burt helps keep not only the defensive line relaxed with pranks and witticisms, but the entire team. The other day, on the public-address system in the clubhouse, he made an announcement concerning one of his offensive linemen and a defensive linemen for the Redskins: ''Hear this, Brad Benson has just named his dog Dexter Manley.' '' Meanwhile, Lamar Leachman, in his office of utmost inspiration, looks over an orange on his desk, sees something white seeping out of it, and tosses it in the trash can. ''You gotta have a sense of humor,'' he said, with a brave smile. ''You gotta be flexible.''

42-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; SETON HALL SENDS GEORGETOWN TO FIRST LOSS OF SEASON, 74-53
After years near the bottom of the Big East Conference, Seton Hall could be ready to become a contender this season. ''This was the biggest win for Seton Hall ever - no question,'' Coach P. J. Carlesimo said after Seton Hall upset previously unbeaten Georgetown, 74-53, today. ''This win will go a long way toward making them believe they are good players.'' Mark Bryant, a junior averaging 14 points, scored 24 for Seton Hall, 9-1 over all and 1-1 in Big East play. It was the first time in 15 games that the Pirates had beaten the Hoyas. The Pirates controlled the game from the start, taking a 5-3 lead on a 10-foot jumper by Bryant, and never trailed. After a Georgetown basket, Seton Hall then ran off 8 straight points, including three baskets by Bryant, to go up by 16-5. The Pirates led by as many as 17 points in the first half, while limiting Georgetown's scoring leader, Reggie Williams, to 2 points. Williams came into the contest averaging 25.2 points. Perry McDonald led Georgetown (9-1, 0-1) with 18. Williams had 7. Syracuse 88, Connecticut 71 NEW HAVEN (AP) - Sherman Douglas scored 8 of his 20 points during a 16-2 run midway through the second half to help the Orangemen to their 12th straight victory. Connecticut, 5-6 over all and 0-2 in the Big East Conference, stayed with Syracuse through the first 28 minutes before Douglas, a sophomore and the team's leading scorer, took charge. Notre Dame 71, Penn 67 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - David Rivers scored 24 points, including a pair of 3-pointers in the final three minutes, as the Irish (7-2) overcame a 15-point deficit. Rivers, held to 2 points in the first half, scored 22 after intermission, including 14 of 17 from the free-throw line. Penn is 1-6. Navy 72 N. Carolina-Wilmington 58 ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - Cliff Rees scored a career-high 26 points to lead Navy in a Colonial Athletic Association opener. Navy trailed early, but a 3-point field goal and two free throws by Rees gave the Midshipmen a 12-10 lead, and they never were behind after that. Navy's David Robinson, the center who entered the game with a 30-point average, fouled out with 4:30 left and finished with 12. The Midshipmen raised their record to 6-3, while North Carolina-Wilmington fell to 4-5. Georgia Tech 65 Wake Forest 59 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -Craig Neal scored 18 points to lead Georgia Tech (7-3) to the overtime victory. It was the Demon Deacons' 18th straight loss in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Wake Forest (5-3) led at halftime, 25-24, and built a 41-33 lead with 11:43 left. But the Yellow Jackets rallied to take a 56-53 lead on a 3-point field goal by Neal. Tyrone Bogues hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 56-56 with 58 seconds left in regulation. Duane Ferrell of Georgia Tech scored 5 points in overtime, and Tom Hammonds scored on a dunk with 36 seconds left to give the Yellow Jackets a 63-59 lead. Purdue 87, Michigan St. 72 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -Everette Stephens scored 22 points to rally Purdue in the Big Ten Conference opener for both teams. Darryl Johnson scored Michigan State's first 7 points to help the Spartans take a 21-11 lead with 12:18 remaining. But Purdue scored 14 straight points to take a 25-21 lead, with Stephens scoring 6 points during the rally. Purdue led by 43-38 at halftime and Michigan State never got any closer. Purdue (9-1) got all of its scoring from its starters. Melvin McCants had 21, Todd Mitchell 19, Troy Lewis 17 and Doug Lee eight. Johnson scored 31 points for Michigan State (5-6). Illinois 95, Michigan 84 CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - Ken Norman scored 29 points to lead Illinois in the Big Ten opener for both teams. Glynn Blackwell added 28 points to the Illinois effort. Michigan was led by Antoine Joubert, a senior guard who scored 24 points. The triumph lifted Illinois to 9-2 over all. Michigan fell to 8-5. Iowa 80, Northwestern 44 IOWA CITY (AP) - Kevin Gamble, Brad Lohaus and B. J. Armstrong each scored 11 points as Iowa overcame a sluggish start and rolled to an 80-44 victory over Northwestern in their Big Ten opener. Iowa ran its record to 13-0, the fastest start in school history. Northwestern (5-6) suffered its fourth straight loss this season and lost its 21st straight here. N. Carolina 79, La Salle 72 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Jeff Lebo scored 13 of his 14 points in the second half, including the go-ahead free throws with 1:26 remaining, to lift North Carolina to victory. Kenny Smith's 22 points paced North Carolina, which won its ninth straight game to bring its record to 11-1. Tim Legler led La Salle (6-5) with 25 points, and Lionel Simmons had 22. La Salle took a 72-69 lead on a jumper by Legler with 2:05 left in the game. But a field goal by North Carolina's Dave Popson cut the deficit to 72-71. The Tar Heels took possession again on an offensive foul against La Salle's Rich Tarr, setting up two free throws by Lebo giving North Carolina the lead with 1:26 to play. Pitt 76, Providence 67 PITTSBURGH (AP) - Charles Smith scored 22 points, including four free throws in the final minute, as Pittsburgh rallied from a 12-point deficit to win the Big East game. The Panthers, trailing 60-59, scored 9 consecutive points - the first four by Curtis Aiken - to take a 68-60 lead on two free throws by Tico Cooper with 2:06 to play. The Panthers (9-2) blanketed Providence's high-scoring backcourt duo of Delray Brooks and Billy Donovan. Brooks, who was averaging 22, was held to 7 and Donovan, averaging 20.8, had 15. The Friars are now 9-2. Kentucky 63, Auburn 60 AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - With Rex Chapman scoring 21 of his 24 points in the second half, Kentucky withstood a furious rally to win the Southeastern Conference game. Chapman, a 6-5 freshman guard, hit five 3-point goals in the second half to help Kentucky to a 13-point lead with 3:23 left. But Auburn, behind a full-court press, clawed back to within 62-60 after Frank Ford's 3-point play with 46 seconds to go. A steal with 23 seconds left gave Auburn a chance to tie, but Johnny Lynn missed a 3-point attempt with five seconds left. Kentucky's Ed Davender then hit a free throw to account for the final margin. Kentucky is 7-2 over all and 1-1 in the S.E.C. Chris Morris led Auburn, which is 7-2 and 1-1, with 22 points. DePaul 80, Dayton 64 DAYTON (AP) - DePaul broke its four-game losing streak at the University of Dayton Arena and Dayton lost its coach, Don Donoher, who was ejected in the second half after arguing that the referees were not calling DePaul players for fouls and after going onto the court and bumping Referee George Solomon. Donoher stayed at his bench for several minutes before Solomon spotted him and tossed him out. Kevin Edwards scored 24 points and Dallas Comegys 21 for DePaul (10-0). Temple 81, Rhode Island 65 KINGSTON, R.I. (AP) - Nate Blackwell scored 31 points and Tim Perry added 18 to lead Temple in an Atlantic 10 game marked by a bench-clearing brawl that erupted in the second half and lasted about five minutes. Temple's Ramon Riuas and Rhode Island's Bonzi Colson began fighting and both benches emptied with the Owls ahead, 74-63, and 3:44 remaining. When peace was restored, Temple Coach Don Chaney was hit with two technical fouls. Temple pulled away late in the first half and went on to its 12th victory in 13 starts, including 2-0 in the conference. Rhode Island, 8-3 over-all and 1-1 in the conference, was led by Tom Garrick with 22 points. Duke 70, Virginia 63 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -Kevin Strickland triggered an 11-0 run midway through the second half that propelled the Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast opener for both teams. Duke, improving to 9-1 with its eighth straight victory, placed four players in double figures, with Strickland leading with 18 points. Sophomore guard Richard Morgan tallied a career-high 24 points to lead Virginia (6-3).

43-> IN SUMMARY; THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE RAISES U.S. HOPES
Japan's central bank bought billions of American dollars last week, and officials in Bonn hinted at a tax cut to stimulate the West German economy. Both countries were also said to be considering lowering interest rates as they scrambled to slow the precipitous drop in the value of the dollar, which closed Friday at 153.10 yen in Tokyo and 1.8465 marks in Frankfurt. American officials blew hot and cold, alternating remarks likely to keep the dollar sliding with assurances that they would not permit a free fall that could damage the world trading system. Washington hoped cheaper dollars would mean greater sales of United States products abroad and reduced purchases of foreign cars, computers and video cassette recorders. None too soon. Imports exceeded exports last year by an estimated $175 billion, a record deficit, about $30 billion above that of 1985. (Shielding injured industries, page 5). Some Administration officials were reported to want the dollar to decline further, which added to downward pressures. The White House did not deny the substance of the report but dismissed it as ''unauthorized.'' The Federal Reserve Board said the dollar had fallen far enough. Stock prices, meanwhile, rose to new highs in New York. The Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial stocks has set records 10 times since Jan. 2, rising on 11 consecutive days.

44-> NOTED WITH PLEASURE
The Rough and Tumble of Life Though she created some of the most memorable women in American fiction, Willa Cather was conspicuous in college for her identification with men. In ''Willa Cather: The Emerging Voice'' (Oxford University), Sharon O'Brien quotes Cather's views on football. Athletics are the one resisting force that curbs the growing tendencies toward effeminacy so prevalent in the eastern colleges. Football is the deadliest foe that chappieism has. It is a game of blood and muscle and fresh air. It renders distasteful the maudlin, trivial dissipations that sap the energies of the youth of the wealthier classes. . . . It doesn't do Cholly or Fweddy any harm to have his collar bone smashed occasionally. . . . The field is the only place that some young men ever know anything of the rough and tumble of life. Like the fagging system at Eton it is good because it lays the mighty low and brings down them which were exalted. Neither his bank book nor his visiting list can help a man on the eleven, he has nothing to back him but his arm and his head. Steep Thoughts As we know from painting, landscape is character. In ''Let Us Build Us A City'' (Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), Donald Harrington speculates on the mountain man's psychological relation to his steep environment. Why did the mountaineers pick mountains? For many reasons. Mountain land is infertile and therefore cheap at half the price. Being so steep, it takes twice as much exercise, for man and beast, to cultivate, and this builds bodies and character. It offers good views but, paradoxically, limited views, only as far as the next range. The air is said to be superior, and mountain spring water has no equal in the bottoms. There is more variety in the topography, and this range of highs and lows, peaks and depths, ins and outs, becomes a metaphorscape for achievement and disappointment. Flatlands have little mystery, less visual stimulation, and less challenge. Lost Souls How does it feel to lose your soul? According to the anthropologist Richard A. Shweder, it feels uncanny. This is from one of many essays in ''Culture and Depression'' (University of California), edited by Arthur Kleinman and Byron Good. When you feel depressed you feel as though your soul has left your body. What you feel is empty, and a body emptied of its soul loses interest in things, except perhaps its own physical malfunctioning as a thing. The phenomenon of soul wandering is widely acknowledged among the world's cultures, and the phenomenology of soul loss has, for millennia, been a topic of theoretical and practical concern. A sophisticated and nearly universal doctrine has emerged which has it that the body is routinely emptied of its soul at the time of death and while sleeping or dreaming. Despite all the historical and cross-cultural variations and theories of the soul, most religious and cultural traditions associate death and sleep with soul loss. Against this background of common understanding it is perhaps not too surprising that when a fully conscious, awake person loses his soul, he finds it difficult to (is afraid to?) sleep or dream, and he spends much of his now extended waking time fantasizing about death and wondering why his soul has been withdrawn at such an uncanny time - while awake and still alive. Crocodile Identity In the drawings of Saul Steinberg, says Harold Rosenberg, ''everything that exists is an artist'' staging ''a fiction of what it is.'' Mr. Rosenberg offers this surmise in ''Art & Other Serious Matters'' (University of Chicago). A virtuoso of exchanges of identity, Steinberg is naturally inclined toward comedy. His concept of the comic relates both to the fantasies of human beings and to their rigidities. Comedy also arises out of his consciousness of self-invention. Steinberg's art is a parade of fictitious personages, geometric shapes, items of household equipment, personified furniture, each staged in a fiction of what it is - or in a dream of being something else. His little man, anonymous citizen, is burdened with projects and conditions, from sneaking up on a question mark with a butterfly net to dreaming of a woman who is dreaming of him. . . . In Steinberg's view everything that exists is an artist and is engaged in refining its appearance - a curious version of Darwinism. ''The main thing to find out,'' he declared to an interviewer, ''is what sort of technique the crocodile employs to show itself.'' We Eat What We Are ''No diet,'' says Hillel Schwartz, ''comes without a larger social agenda.'' In ''Never Satisfied: A Cultural History of Diets, Fantasies and Fat'' (Free Press), he observes that we lack ''a sense of stewardship'' in the management of our bodies. Our bodies and our foods are as much social constructs as they are proteins, carbohydrates, fats. . . . We are not what we eat. We eat what we are, and how we are. We are, still, dazed by appetite, disturbed by hunger, and distrustful of both. Not that we are haunted by a malign Puritanism which sours all pleasures, curdles all judgments. Rather we have so far failed to make good on that sense of stewardship by which some Puritans managed a separate peace with the bewildering richness of the New World. We are, still, fearful of abundance. As long as that fear remains, we will eat cautiously, pinch an inch, watch our weight. Our desires will confuse us.

45-> LANDLORDS ATTACK HOBOKEN LAW ON PRESERVING APARTMENTS
A law to preserve apartments for middle-income tenants here is drawing the ire of landlords. Under the law, the owners of apartment buildings are required to find new tenants in 60 days for units that become vacant. Landlords who try to keep apartments vacant longer than that face fines of up to $500 a day. Although a landlord group has lost a challenge in Federal court to the so-called anti-warehousing statute, the battle to open apartments to middle-income renters, rather than hold them off the market for conversion to luxury condominiums, is not over. The landlord group is suing in State Superior Court to have the ordinance voided. The statute, enacted last June, has not resulted in sanctions against landlords because of a temporary restraining order Judge Herbert J. Stern issued before he dismissed the suit in Federal District Court in Newark. Charge of Confsication In an opinion filed weeks ago, Judge Stern ruled that the owners' challenge could not be sustained on constitutional grounds and that the plaintiffs' assertions that the ordinance was pre-empted by state statutes should be taken before the state courts. The property owners, who have formed a group called Help Hoboken Housing, charged in their suit that the law was confiscatory and deprived them of their right to own property and manage it the way they saw fit. They contended it was unconstitutional. The group received an initial setback last November when Judge Stern heard oral arguments in the case and dismissed it. He issued a 17-page decision late last month. A member of the board of the landlords' group, Suzanne Warren, said in an interview that the group was inclined to ''pursue a Federal appeal, if it's warranted,'' and to ''take it to state court.'' Dispute Over Listing Ms. Warren said the group thought the law was unconstitutional because ''to a tremendous extreme, it takes someone's private property and tells them what they can or cannot do with it.'' She said city officials had declared the need for such a law by listing 500 apartments they said were being held off the market. ''Every one of those buildings is either filed legally as a condo conversion before they put together the list or is unlivable,'' Ms. Warren said. She added that many of the apartments had no plumbing, no walls or burned-out joists. ''The housing in Hoboken is terribly run-down,'' she said. ''They are setting up a system where landlords can be harassed. This is not going to create new housing; it's going to create more condo conversions.'' Availability of Waivers The lawyer in the case for tenants, Maureen Schweitzer of Hudson County Legal Services, hailed Judge Stern's decision. ''This is a substantial victory for the tenants of Hoboken and for tenants in other municipalities who are faced with the same shortage of housing,'' she said.

49-> Topics: Circumlocutions; Why Not Speak Up?
The famous question during Watergate was, What did the President know and when did he know it? That's also being asked in the Iran-contra arms affair, but there's now another necessary question: When will the President know and when will he tell the American people? After a flurry of promises to get the facts out, President Reagan has become unresponsive, leaving it to aides to say he must wait for reports from other sources. His spokesman, Larry Speakes, says it should be obvious that Mr. Reagan needs ''to be circumspect.'' Vice President Bush says the President is ''forestalled'' from public comment by all the investigations. Nancy Reagan says: ''He'd like it all out. He said that in the very beginning.'' She also says, ''Sometimes, you know, it's harder to say nothing, when you really want to say something.'' Then why not say something? What prevents the President from speaking up? At a criminal trial the defendant often waits to testify, if he testifies at all, until all the other witnesses have appeared. That's prudent for an accused, but why should a President behave that way? It's time for Mr. Reagan to redeem his early pledges to get out all the truth and fast.

53-> CONTRA WAR: SHARP UPTURN FORECAST SOON
Government and military officials in Central America say they expect a sharp upturn in fighting between the Nicaraguan rebels and Sandinista forces in the first quarter of 1987. In recent interviews, American, Nicaraguan, Honduran and rebel officials all seemed to agree that fighting would step up in the coming months. They gave two reasons. One is that United States military aid is now reaching the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, which will allow them to pick up the pace of their operations. Second, these officials said, the contras believe they must score early military successes to challenge the Sandinista Government for control of Nicaragua and to justify the continuation of American aid. Congress approved $100 million in aid to the contras in October, $70 million of which was for military equipment and training. Of this aid, $30 million has already been given to them. More Money Due in February An additional $40 million is due to be released in February, unless Congress votes to cut off the aid. If that happens, President Reagan would have to veto the Congressional action to keep the money flowing. In the view of those interviewed, continued American support is critical to the contras' survival. Nicaraguan officials express confidence that their military strategy will prevent major gains by the contras regardless of American aid. In a New Year's Eve address, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said that United States assistance to the contras had ''produced nothing'' and that the rebels were ''in the process of decomposition.'' Nicaraguan strategy is designed to keep pressure on the contras along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border so they cannot infiltrate the interior of Nicaragua from their camps in Honduras. Despite the overall confidence expressed by the Sandinistas, there is speculation by some senior Sandinista officers that the contras might try to seize and hold a town in Nicaragua in the coming months. These officers say they believe the contras' goal would be to declare the surrounding area ''free Nicaragua.'' This, they said, would give Mr. Reagan a pretext to recognize the contras as the legitimate government and to come to its aid by invading Nicaragua. U.S. in Honduras Maneuvers United States military maneuvers in Honduras are viewed by the Sandinista military leadership as preparations for such an invasion. The Nicaraguan Defense Minister, Humberto Ortega Saavedra, who is the President's brother, said in a year-end review of military operations that any contra attempt to seize and hold Nicaraguan territory would be defeated. In 1983, the contras succeeded in capturing and temporarily holding the small Nicaraguan farming community of El Porvenir, near the Honduran border. Since then, there have been no known similar attempts, although in October 1983 the contras raided the town of Pantasma in the interior. Although both the Ortega brothers play down the abilities of the contras, the Defense Minister acknowledged that the Sandinista Army had not been fully successful in keeping them out of Nicaragua. He puts the number of contras in Nicaragua at 1,000; United States officials in Nicaragua say there are about 4,000 contras there now. Enrique Bermudez, military leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Forces, the largest of the contra groups, said that American military aid was getting to the contras and that his forces would make inroads against the Sandinistas in the coming months. An American military expert who was in the contra camps just before Christmas said he had observed two groups of more than 100 well-equipped guerrillas leave on a infiltration mission into Nicaragua. Hit-and-Run Raids Seen Contra representatives declined to say exactly what the rebels plan to do with their forces inside Nicaragua. It is generally believed by military officers in both Nicaragua and Honduras that for the immediate future the Nicaraguan contras will be capable only of hit-and-run raids against isolated Sandinista outposts in the sparsely populated mountains. The Sandinistas also say the contras may in desperation undertake a spectacular commando raid against Soviet-supplied helicopters as a way of attracting Congressional attention. They say they believe that there are contras now being trained in the United States for just that purpose. American experts in guerrilla warfare say that if the contras hope to overthrow the Sandinistas, they need to develop a broad base of political support. This, they say, means the contras must develop organized opposition to the Sandinistas within Nicaragua, particularly in the cities. Diplomats and military experts view an urban-based resistance movement as critical to the success of any insurgency. Officials at the American Embassy in Managua acknowledge that the contras face a difficult task in developing a base of urban support. They point out that although there is opposition to the Sandinista Government in the cities, Interior Minister Tomas Borge has been highly successful in suppressing it in the principal population centers. Even if the contras have immediate military success in the countryside, they say, it will be difficult to capitalize on those successes in the cities in the foreseeable future.

54-> BLACK FOE OF PRETORIA DEFENDS VIOLENT RESISTANCE TO APARTHEID
The head of the African National Congress, Oliver R. Tambo, offering a stark defense of the use of violence by his followers, says the occasional killing of South African whites gives hope to blacks and will make white people ''used to bleeding.'' Mr. Tambo complained bitterly in an interview Thursday about the criticism by some, including the State Department, of his group's violent tactics and its long association with the South African Communist Party. Although he said the congress, the principal organization fighting to topple the Pretoria Government, did not officially approve of the killing of civilians, he described some of the consequences of such deaths as beneficial. Asked to describe the reaction among blacks when a white is killed, he replied that blacks have been killed in such numbers that they have come to expect it. But when they learn that a white has died in the violence that has become a common feature of the South African political situation, he said, ''that kind of thing comes like a drop of rain after a long drought.'' Whites, in turn, ''are used to blacks being killed,'' he said, but ''they are not used to bleeding themselves.'' Indifference is Charged Mr. Tambo said white people in South Africa and many of his critics were astonishingly indifferent to the large number of black children and youths who he said had been killed by Pretoria's security forces. ''When it's a white child,'' he added, ''it's something else.'' He said the death of white children aroused a great response among whites who otherwise would remain in their ''own world.'' More than 2,000 people, almost all of them nonwhite, have been killed in outbreaks of violence in South Africa over the last two years. A few white children have been killed, and their deaths have received great attention in the white South African press. Mr. Tambo's remarks come at a time when the African National Congress is coming under intense scrutiny in Washington and European capitals. The congress has been making an aggressive bid for respectability both among those governments and South African whites. Mr. Tambo, who delivered his opinions in a soft voice in his hotel suite in Manhattan, is in the midst of a hectic visit to the United States of which the highlight is to be a meeting Wednesday in Washington with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Object of Curiosity The State Department has stressed that the meeting does not represent approval of the group, but rather a recognition that it is an important player in the unfolding situation in South Africa. The visit with Mr. Shultz will be the highest-level meeting between a congress representative and the United States Government. On previous visits to America, Mr. Tambo has generally been inconspicuous. But on this trip he has the schedule of one who is suddenly an object of political curiousity. During the week, he conferred with Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, and Don King, the boxing promoter. He and Mr. Kissinger discussed the situation in South Africa. Mr. King, who once became embroiled in a dispute over promoting a fight there and then sold the rights, said he had pledged to raise a million dollars for black South African causes, including the congress. Mr. Tambo also received a rapturous reception this week at a talk at Riverside Church in Manhattan. Conservative groups said they would picket when he visits Washington next week. He also conferred this week with a group of executives from many of the country's largest corporations to discuss their dealings in South Africa. Mr. Tambo told the group that they should not try to encourage Pretoria to change its policies, but that instead those companies that had not already shut down their operations inside South Africa should do so immediately. Among those attending the Wednesday luncheon were John S. Reed, chief executive officer of Citibank, and W. Michael Blumenthal, the head of the Unisys Corporation. Mr. Tambo warned them, according to a source, that the African National Congress will remember which companies were its friends and which were its enemies. 'I Am Not Controlled' In the Manhattan interview, Mr. Tambo also disputed the conclusions of a recent State Department report that said the congress was deeply obligated to Moscow and the South African Communist Party for providing weapons to wage its guerrilla campaign. The report suggested that Moscow hoped to exploit its association with the congress and dominate any new black government. ''Because we are getting arms from them for free does not mean we are mortgaging ourselves,'' he said. ''And I dominate the A.N.C. Yes, I dominate, I am not dominated and controlled.''

55-> LEFTISTS IN MEXICO SEEKING A MERGER
Mexico's political left, traditionally divided, is trying to unite into a single party that could present a greater challenge to the governing party. Five leftist political groups, including the United Mexican Socialist Party, the country's largest leftist group, have reached an agreement in principle to unite later this year. As yet, the new party has no name, nor is it clear what its ideology will be. But portions of a document related to the merger, published here this month, said that the new party would not establish pacts with international organizations, an indication that the new group would not be bound to Moscow or Peking. A united Mexican leftist party would be expected to take a strong anti-United States line, calling for a moratorium on payments on Mexico's foreign debt and a sharp curtailment of programs that would increase Mexican dependence on the United States technically and economically. Goal Is Unified Front for '88 The leftist leadership's hope is to field a single candidate in the 1988 presidential election campaign who could provide the strongest possible challenge to the dominant party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. So powerful is the PRI, which has governed without interruption for nearly 60 years, that a united left will have no chance of actually electing a president. But the left, perceiving an increasing disaffection with the PRI because of the country's steadily worsening economic situation, has concluded that this is an opportune time to seek a a larger role in national political life. ''United we can attract all those people who belong to no party at all, those who recognize our grave national situation but see nowhere to turn,'' said Pablo Gomez, secretary general of the Unified Mexican Socialist Party. ''They are our natural target for support.'' In a position paper issued this month, the five groups said, ''Our reasons are determined by the grave situation of the country and because we are responding to the challenge with an alternative that recognizes the interests of the working man and the country.'' The PRI, which has withstood pressure from the well-organized conservative wing of the political spectrum, regards the leftist unification effort with a mixture of disdain and amusement. ''This effort to form a united party will fail eventually because among the leftist leaders there is too much ambition and too little will to compromise ideas,'' said a senior official in the Interior Ministry, the Government agency that oversees the country's political activities. ''They will soon be in disagreement.'' 'Forget the Holy Texts' The unification process had its beginnings a year ago when two parties, the Revolutionary Workers Party and the Mexican Workers Party, announced plans to form the Authentic Revolutionary Party. The goal, party leaders said then, was to bring together farm and labor groups. ''Our aim is to consolidate as a party and forget the holy texts and bossism that exists among the left and causes disunity,'' Herberto Castillo of the Mexican Workers Party said at the time. Last May, three more groups, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Revolutionary Patriotic Party and the Revolutionary Movement of the People, joined with the first two and signed a pact as a step toward unity. Missing, however, was the Unified Mexican Socialist Party, a key group because of its size. Meetings among the leftist groups continued. Last fall, the Unified Mexican Socialists joined in, along with another Marxist group, the Communist Union of the Left. The appearance of these two Marxist groups was too much for the Mexican Workers Party, which abruptly dropped out. The Socialist Revolutionary Party also dropped out at about the same time, bringing the number of coalition members back to five. Ideological Stress Fractures ''We felt that there were not sufficient conditions provided in the fusion proposal for us to continue,'' said Ricardo Pascoe Pierce, a leader of the Mexican Workers Party. His party's decision to quit the unity move was a telling example of the complexities of leftist rivalry. The Mexican Workers Party is Trotskyite, and the Unified Mexican Socialists and the Communist Union of the Left were considered too closely aligned with Stalinist thinking for the tastes of the Mexican Workers Party. But in a recent interview in the leftist Mexico City daily Unomasuno, Mr. Pascoe Pierce raised the possibility that his party's central committee will reconsider its decision when it meets again in April. ''Qualitatively and quantitatively,'' he said, the Mexican Workers Party ''would be a great contribution for the new party.'' He added that his party should not remain on the periphery of a movement so important as the unification drive.

56-> 4TH LINE BOLSTERS ISLANDERS
Bob Bassen, who contributed a goal and assist in a 3-2 victory against Toronto Saturday night, sat back on the towel-strewn locker room bench at Nassau Coliseum and tried to remember the last time the Islanders had assembled a three-game winning streak. He could not. Actually, the team had enjoyed three straight victories, two of them courtesy of the Devils, in mid-December, but the five-game streak without a victory with which the club limped through the holiday season was more prominent in Bassen's mind. ''I don't know why it is,'' he said, ''but it's hard to remember the last time things were clicking for us. For some reason, the times we struggle seem a lot more real.'' Bassen, a member of the Islanders' fourth line, is accustomed to struggling. Slight of frame and not blessed with a knack for goal scoring, the center has managed to hold his position on the team through persistent hard work and fearless play. Coach Terry Simpson, who has an eye for such players, pronounced himself especially pleased with Bassen and his co-workers, Ari Haanpaa and Alan Kerr, after Saturday's game. ''Their effort doesn't always show up on the scoreboard,'' said Simpson, who has used the line as a motivational force, ''but it has a lot to do with generating our momentum.'' Aggressive Play, Fine Defense The last three Islander outings, all of them victories and each of them differently earned, have featured the often unartistic but always enthusiastic fourth line. Against Minnesota, the most ill-tempered game of the trio, the line was aggressive at both ends of the rink and maintained the level of belligerence that seemed a key to the 5-3 victory. Against the Rangers on Friday, the line was conscientious about its defensive game, and on Saturday, emboldened by their increased ice time, Bassen and Haanpaa each contributed goals. ''We know we're out there because we work hard, and that's the example we're supposed to set,'' said Bassen, ''but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing more scoring.'' Bassen said he was occasionally haunted by the memory of former Islander fourth lines. ''I know that those lines did make the difference in the cup years, and that the players did figure in the scoring. I'd like that to be the case with us, because we can't expect this team's goal-scorers, except maybe for Mike Bossy, to score every night.'' In fact, Haanpaa, the Finnish second-year forward, had never scored a National Hockey League goal before Saturday and had been used in only half the team's games this season. The Islanders displayed no offensive fireworks against either the Rangers or Maple Leafs, but according to Billy Smith, the winning goalie in both games, the team played wisely, and as a unit. ''If they weren't there playing strong defense in front of me, I wouldn't be able to do anything,'' he said. ''This has been the best defense I've seen by us all season, and that's what's going to save you in a lot of one-goal hockey games.'' Both games were won by employing the unspectacular technique that's emblematic of a successful fourth line. ''We grinded these wins out,'' said Bryan Trottier. ''It doesn't always happen by design, but if it gets the win, that's all that matters.''

58-> MYERSON, AT GRAND JURY, INVOKED 5TH AMENDMENT
Bess Myerson, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, invoked the Fifth Amendment last month before a Federal grand jury investigating a contractor, but did not tell Mayor Koch or any member of his administration about it until a television station broadcast a news report Friday night, the Mayor said yesterday. ''She called me last evening to tell me she had taken the Fifth Amendment on the advice of her counsel,'' the Mayor said in a statement. ''I want to find out the reasons for her appearance at the grand jury and her reasons for taking the Fifth Amendment.'' In a subsequent telephone interview, Mr. Koch made it clear that he was angry with Ms. Myerson's failure to tell him about her testimony, or lack of it ''She said her lawyer didn't think it necessary to tell me because he didn't think anything futher would result from her appearance there,'' he said. ''I think she realizes it was an error on her part.'' He said she had agreed, at his request, to meet with two of his top aides next week to explain what happened. Broadcast Report Last June, amid reports that an official of the city's Transportation Department refused to testify before a Bronx grand jury, the Mayor said that officials who invoked their Fifth Amendments rights against self-incrimination could be subject to dismissal because their refusal to testify might raise a ''question of my confidence in their judgment.'' The Mayor only learned about Ms. Myerson's grand jury appearance because of the newscast Friday evening on WNBC. Mr. Koch said yesterday that he did not know the nature of the grand jury investigation, but believed it involved Carl A. Capasso, a city contractor and regular companion of Ms. Myerson. First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff and the Mayor's counsel, Patrick F. X. Mulhearn, also said that they did not know the details of the investigation by the Federal panel. Federal and city agencies have been investigating whether Mr. Capasso paid kickbacks to help obtain a $53.6 million contract to build a sewer plant in Brooklyn. Mr. Capasso and his company, the Nanco Contracting Corporation, won the contract to do work for the Owl's Head sewage treatment plant in 1983, submitting the lowest of five bids for the project. When the issue was first raised last spring, city officials said the contract was awarded because Nanco had been the legitimate low bidder. Investigators have also been looking at Mr. Capasso's 1983 divorce and at whether Mr. Capasso, who has entertained Koch administration officials and politicians, was improperly seeking political advantage. The United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has subpoenaed records of the Capasso divorce from his former wife, Nancy, according to her lawyer, Raoul Felder. Nancy Capasso has charged that Ms. Myerson broke up the marriage. Related questions have been raised about Ms. Myerson's decision to hire the daughter of the judge who presided over the divorce case, Justice Hortense Gabel of Manhattan Supreme Court, for a $21,000-a-year job in the Cultural Affairs Department. Other Testimony A city official familiar with the investigation said yesterday that the central issue is the sewage contract. Another Koch administration official, Herbert P. Rickman, said yesterday that he, too, has appeared before the Federal grand jury on the same case, at his own request. Mr. Rickman, special assistant to the Mayor, said yesteray that he volunteered to go before the grand jury as an informational witness, did so without a lawyer and told Mr. Mulhearn about it. Mr. Rickman, a friend of Ms. Myerson's, declined to discuss the nature of his testimony or the questions asked. In an interview Friday on a related subject, Ms. Myerson said that she could not have been involved in the sewage contract because they were closed bids, ''like the Oscars.'' A message left at her home yesterday on a telephone answering machine was not answered. Ms. Myerson's lawyer, Frederick P. Hafetz, said, ''My client has done nothing wrong.'' 'A Negative Inference' In June, Mayor Koch said that while he would not automatically discipline or demand the resignation of anyone who refused to testify, he held his own appointees, as opposed to civil service appointees, to a different standard. He said yesterday, ''I believe a negative inference has to be drawn when the Fifth Amendment is used. There is no question an explanation is required here.'' Ms. Myerson and her lawyer will, at Mr. Koch's request, provide one this week to Mr. Brezenoff and Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., who has resigned as Corporation Counsel but will serve unsalaried until Thursday.

59-> MOSCOW UPGRADES ARMS-TALKS TEAM
The Soviet Union has privately informed the United States that it is upgrading the level of its representation to the Geneva arms talks, according to Soviet and American officials. The Soviet Union at the same time has asked the United States to send an official of comparably high political standing. The new head of the Soviet arms-control delegation will be Yuli M. Vorontsov, first deputy foreign minister. The former head of the delegation, Viktor P. Karpov, will also be present in Geneva, a Soviet official said. American officials have informed the Soviet Union that Max M. Kampelman will continue to represent the United States as the chief arms-control negotiator at the talks, which begin next week. No Indication of New Offers American officials said that they had no indications that the Soviet Union would offer any new arms control proposals. ''That is the really intriguing question,'' an official said. Another official said that the the appointment of Mr. Voronstov might only be a public relations move. Officials said that Mr. Vorontsov was well regarded from his previous diplomatic service in Washington and said that the Soviet move could improve the atmosphere at the talks. Mr. Karpov is not well liked by some American arms-control officials. Mr. Kampelman said on Friday that the United States does not plan any major new offers and that Moscow should respond to American proposals that are the negotiating table. Proposal to Drop Ban In a related development, State Department officials have proposed that American negotiators be given the authority to drop the Administration's proposed ban on long-range mobile missiles during the next round of arms talks, Administration officials said today. The State Department officials reportedly say that such a ban is inconsistent with the Administration's plans to develop two new types of mobile missiles - the Midgetman and MX missile, which are to be carried on rail cars. They argue that continuing to propose the ban damages the Administration's credibility with a Congress that has generally supported the Midgetman program. The State Department approach is opposed by civilian Defense Department officials, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Edward L. Rowny, an adviser to President Reagan, officials say. The opponents say the Soviet Union should first demonstrate that it is possible to monitor limits on such missiles effectively. The next round of the Geneva arms talks is scheduled to begin on Thursday, and the issue is now before the National Security Council, officials say. The question is primarily one of negotiating tactics, in the view of some officials on both sides of the issue. The Soviet Union has already deployed a long-range mobile missile that is carried on a vehicle and is developing another mobile missile that can be carried on a rail car. Many officials believe that some types of these missiles must be allowed if an agreement is to be reached. Change in Policy in '85 The Reagan Administration proposed in November 1985 that mobile long-range missiles be banned. The change in policy reflected several concerns, including the view of American military officials that it would be difficult to find and attack Soviet mobile missiles and arguments by civilian officials in the Defense Department that the American Midgetman program was too expensive. The proposed ban was also intended, in part, as a tactical counter to new Soviet demands that cruise missiles launched from bombers and from ships and submarines be banned. The Soviet Union has since dropped that demand. The proposed ban on long-range mobile missiles sparked an uproar in Congress among supporters of the Midgetman program, who argued that mobile missiles are needed to make the American missile force less vulnerable to attack. Since then, the Administration has indicated that it will consider dropping the ban if the Soviet Union can convince American negotiators that limits on deployed mobile missiles can be verified. And over the opposition of civilian Defense Department officials, the Administration has decided to begin full-scale development of the Midgetman missile. The Pentagon has also proposed that the United States deploy MX missiles on rail cars. The Midgetman is designed to be a small mobile missile with one or two warheads. The MX carries 10 warheads.

60-> HOW ENTREPRENEURS CARVE OUT CAREERS IN UNEXPECTED FIELDS
AT the A & T Ironworks in New Rochelle, the president makes the coffee. ''I do what has to be done, even if it's only making coffee,'' said Gelsomina Tassone. ''I guess you could call my management style 'democratic.' Our 21 employees help one another. We don't have any prima donnas.'' A & T Ironworks, a manufacturer of ornamental wrought iron and structural steel, started out a dozen years ago as a one-man iron shop in a two-car garage on Union Street in New Rochelle. The business grossed $20,000 a year in its first few years of operation. This year, Mrs. Tassone estimates that A & T sales will reach the $2 million mark. Mrs. Tassone's career illustrates how one woman has become successful in a non-traditional occupation. After a marriage ended, she held a series of part-time jobs while taking night courses at a nearby community college. ''I certainly didn't have any image of myself as an entrepreneur,'' she said, recalling the job she took as a bookkeeper/telephone answerer for Armando Tassone in his ironworks shop. ''I was so glad to be working at a full-time job that I didn't even mind commuting 120 miles a day to New Rochelle.'' At the time, she lived in Monroe in Orange County with her four daughters. ''I started learning as much as I could about ironwork as soon as I took the job,'' she said. ''I've always been interested in construction; my father was a craftsman who built marble altars for the Archdiocese of New York, and construction was always a topic we discussed.'' She moved to New Rochelle and two years later she married Mr. Tassone. She recalls that when she and Mr. Tassone first decided to expand the business, they did not think in terms of a financial plan. ''We didn't know any bankers, we just forged ahead using our personal savings,'' she said. ''At first Armando was doing all the work manually. It was hard. But when we began to grow and the time came to buy machinery and deal with suppliers in order to expand, I followed a pattern I use to this day. I went to suppliers directly in person and asked for 60 days. Then I paid them back in 45 days. That earned us a reputation as good payers and the word got around. We were able to get credit. I'm very up front with suppliers and they appreciate it.'' The year 1980 marked a turning point for the small company, said Mrs. Tassone, who is 42 years old. ''We bid on a job for the New York City Housing Authority to build 125 balconies for an apartment project in the South Bronx,'' she said. ''We got the contract for $92,000. I made a deal with the supplier, who agreed to settle for a deposit until we were paid by the Housing Authority. It was our first big job and a very big one for us. Since then we've been awarded many city contracts, in addition to those from hospitals, universities and corporations such as Con Edison, International Businss Machines, New York Telephone and Anheuser Busch. Mrs. Tassone said that a contract for $600,000 was not unusual and in order to handle the increased business, ''we bought out two other ironworks firms, Majestico Ironworks and G. Zaffino & Sons, both long-established, and we renovated the Zaffino building and incorporated the business of both.'' Mrs. Tassone, who taught herself to read blueprints and specifications, handles all the company's office work, bids on all the commercial and municipal jobs and monitors the approximately 200 job-projects the crews work on each month. She also buys all the machinery and equipment. ''It sounds like a lot of work,'' she said, ''and it is. But my husband and I work as a team. He's happiest in the field, so he works with customers on site, and he's also our chief estimator. It's a very good division of labor.'' Although she says she seldom has a problem dealing with male employees in a business dominated by men, Mrs. Tassone acknowledged that she sometimes has a hard time explaining her role to new customers. ''Once in awhile I get someone who refuses to believe I'm in charge,'' she said. ''No matter how hard I try to convince the caller that I was the person he wanted to talk to, he wouldn't listen, but kept saying, ''Please let me speak to someone who knows something.'' The considerable ''something'' that Mrs. Tassone knows has won her numerous awards from her peers. The Contractors Council of Greater New York named her Businesswoman of the Year last year. And last May A & T Tassone was a Westchester winner in a program honoring small businesses sponsored by the County Chamber of Commerce and the United States Small Business Administration. ''I work 12 hours a day six days a week,'' she said. ''And that's not counting the mailings and correspondence I catch up with at home. If that makes me a workoholic, that's O.K. with me. Work is what I enjoy doing the most. When I see some of our completed jobs, like the structural work we did under the Brooklyn Bridge, I feel really good.'' The Tassones live in the north end of New Rochelle. ''We've been asked every time when we expand if we're going to leave New Rochelle,'' said Mrs. Tassone. '' 'No way,' I answer. We've expanded and modernized our facility on Cliff Street several times. We now have 20,000 square feet. And recently we were able to buy the building across the street and it eventually will become our offices. We like New Rochelle.'' Mrs. Tassone's four daughters are grown now. All of them have had summer jobs at A & T. But their mother said that she would prefer that they get jobs at other companies before joining the family firm. ''I'd love to see my girls in the business, but frankly I thinks it's better to have worked for someone else first.'' In contrast to the Tassones' well-established company, the owners of Audio Antics in Bronxville have just begun to carve out a place for their business in a non-traditional field. Susan Winthrop and Nanci Hersh, the founders of Audio Antics, said they were aware that the recent strides made by women in unconventional businesses did not always bring salaries on a par with men. So they used their musical background to form a company that produces audio cassette tapes for musicians and commercials with original musical scores for radio and television spots. ''We were members of the same all-woman rock-and-roll band when we first met,'' said Ms. Hersh, who is an audio engineer. ''After the band broke up we began writing songs together and we tried to help actors and musicians we knew market themselves more effectively by designing labels for their tapes, doing location recordings for them and tape duplications. That's how the company started in Boston, where we were living at the time. Our first real break came when we recorded a concert of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology band.'' ''I used to play the clarinet and the bass clarinet in the M.I.T. Concert,'' said Ms. Winthrop, who is 31, ''and we offered to give the M.I.T. Concert Band a great quality recording, something they had never had before. It was a terrific success and once we had a master tape, we packaged it and sold copies to most of the players, and we were in business.'' The fledgling company's first two bank loans - one for a drum computer, the other for multi-track equipment - totaled $5,000. ''We got it from the Cambridge Trust Company,'' said Ms. Hersh, who is 32. ''We heard how difficult it was from other women entrepreneurs to get loans, but actually, honestly, it couldn't have been easier. Maybe we were just lucky, because we had a female loan officer who knew something about music and she encouraged us to enter what is still predominantly a man's field.'' When Audio Antics moved to the New York area last year it was to be closer to the center of the music world, Ms. Winthrop said. ''The center of the recording world is in New York City,'' she said, ''but since Nanci and I both grew up in Westchester - she's from Yonkers and I graduated from Edgemont High School in Scarsdale - we decided to settle in Westchester and we found an ideal place in Bronxville. The rents were lower in Westchester and we thought the area was safer, and since we work late hours recording it was an important consideration.'' Audio Antics' start-up costs -$20,000 - were financed privately, with the help of both women's families. ''Most of it was needed for construction, but we kept the costs very low because we did most of the work on the studio ourselves,'' said Ms. Hersh. ''Six months ago we were ready to open for business and we went out making cold calls.'' One of the first calls, to a local bank, produced results. ''They listened to our tapes and we quickly got a commission to write a musical signature for them - a 60-second instrumental with a voice over. They seemed very pleased with it,'' said Ms. Winthrop. Original music commercials and jingles generate 30 percent of the company's business; tape duplication, location recording, editing and retail tape sales make up the remainder. ''But location recording is proving very strong in this area,'' said Ms. Winthrop. ''We've picked up an amazing number of customers from music schools, including Juilliard as repeat clients.'' However, the recording industry, noted Ms. Hersh, is still predominantly male. ''As an audio engineer, I still encounter a certain amount of prejudice,'' she said. ''More than once, when I show up someone says, with what I can only describe as a sneer, 'Who's the sound guy?' ''

61-> POSTING: Westhampton Colony;
The yearnings of those who want to live by the water - both fresh and saline - may be quenched by a single-family house development planned for Westhampton, L.I. The 67-acre tract includes a nine-acre lake, and South Shore beaches are only a ''couple of minutes away by bicycle and a lot more minutes by car in summer traffic,'' according to Harvey K. Orens, president of Renaissance Capital Corporation, the developer. Construction is scheduled to start this summer on the 39 three- and four-bedroom houses, with occupancy scheduled for the middle of 1989. About half the homes will share 3,000 feet of lake frontage, and each will have a tennis court and a swimming pool. Sears & Sears Architects of Westhampton will offer several contemporary styles for the two-story homes, which can then be modified according to the tastes of individual buyers. The homes are expected to range from 2,100 to 3,200 square feet and to cost between $350,000 and $700,000.

62-> MUSEUM HOPPING IN ATHENS
Along with the Acropolis and a few other sites of antiquity, the museums of Athens are the principal attractions of a city that increasingly disappoints visitors by falling short of its renown. The museums compensate, by their variety and interest, for a capital that has suffered more than most from rapid urban growth and the effects of air pollution, noise and traffic. Athens has become a city in which few visitors linger longer than is necessary to see the Acropolis and ancient Agora before catching a bus to Delphi or Olympia or a boat or plane to the islands. Most visit at least the National Archeological Museum, but there are many more fine, less frequented collections of art and other displays of the varied glories that were Greece. The following is a listing of the most interesting showcases of the past, the best antidote against the rigors of the present: National Archeological Museum In bewildering profusion this great institution presents a magnificent array of the finds of excavations throughout Greece through all the periods of pre-Christian antiquity. The problem for the first-time visitor is to guard against succumbing to museum fatigue induced by the quantity on display before coming face to face with the masterworks that should induce the thrilling shock of recognition. One way around this risk is to look at the highlights first and then spend whatever absorptive capacity the visitor has left on a second tour, stopping wherever one's eye lands. A well-illustrated booklet in English, ''The Highlights of the National Museum,'' is on sale at the entrance for $1.50. It presents what the title promises in a sensible itinerary. Its author, Catherine G. Korres, suggests one and a half hours for her tour, which seems a bit meager. With apologies to those whose favorite works are omitted, this guide presents his own nonexclusive listing of indispensable stops: The astonishing golden masks from Mycenae, including that which its discoverer, Heinrich Schliemann, mistakenly held to be the mask of Agamemnon. The gold cups decorated with relief scenes depicting bulls in Display Case 32. Hall 5, the Mycenean Hall. The statues of the ''Harp Player'' and ''Double Flutist'' in the Cycladic Hall, No. 5. The statue of a youth known as the ''Sounion Kouros,'' Hall 8. The ''Volomandra Kouros,'' Hall 10A. The tombstone of Aristion, Hall 11. The statue of Croesus and the base of a statue decorated with bas-reliefs of sports and games (Exhibit 3476), Hall 13. The great bronze statue of ''Poseidon of Artemision,'' Hall 15. The Funeral Stele of Hegeso, Hall 18. The ''Youth of Antikythera,'' Hall 28. The lifelike Hellenistic bronze heads of men (6439 and 14612), Hall 30. The collection of small bronzes in Halls 36 and 37. The Byzantine jewelry, the most modern items on display, of the Helen Stathatos collection, Hall 32. The Santorini frescoes, in Hall 48 on the second floor. (The museum (1 Tossitsa Street; telephone 8217717) is open from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. weekdays, Sunday from 9:30 to 2:30. Admission is $2.25.) Acropolis Museum The many visitors who, sated with the superb temples of the Parthenon, Erechtheion and Propylaia, neglect the museum at the rear of what may be the world's most visited hilltop are missing as splendid a collection of Greek sculpture as they are likely to find anywhere. In the most spectacular display, they will see behind a glass wall in the final room of the small museum the Caryatids of the Erechtheion, which have had to be removed and replaced with copies to protect them against the perilous pollution of Athens. Dramatically lighted, the maidens create a striking effect even when relieved of their assigned function of supporting a temple roof. Presented far better than the statuary of the National Museum, which makes almost no attempt at labeling to place the works in a historical and esthetic context, the statuary in the Acropolis Museum is accompanied by explanatory labels that orient visitors. Outstanding in the first three galleries are a monumental sculpture of a lioness killing a cow (Gallery 1), a statue of a patriot bearing a sacrificial calf (Gallery 2) and a bas-relief of two lions devouring a bull (Gallery 3). Gallery 4 contains a splendid horseman of the sixth century B.C., an exceptionally realistic marble dog and a series of female statues, particularly a seated Athena of great immediacy. A larger-than-life battle between gods and giants dominates Gallery 5. In great contrast to the violent action of that work is a bas-relief of a pensive Athena, her head bowed, leaning on a spear in the next gallery. Galleries 7 and 8 offer striking segments of the friezes of the Acropolis's remaining temples, masterpieces perhaps from the school of Phidias, the greatest Greek sculptor. (The museum (3236665) is open Sunday from 8 A.M. to 4:45 P.M., Monday and Wednesday through Saturday from 7:30 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. and Tuesday from 11 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Admission to the Acropolis, including the museum, is $3.) Goulandris Museum Of Cycladic Art This is the newest and most valuable addition to the Athens museum scene. One used to have to rise early and climb to the Acropolis at dawn, when the sun has just risen and the tourists and hawkers have not yet, to discover the Greece of the mind, the land visitors imagine when they think ''Athens'' or ''Greece.'' It is hard to recognize in today's city the fountainhead of Western civilization, the Platonic ideal of noble clarity, simplicity and reason, all symbolized by classic columns sharply limned by an unsparing sun in a cloudless sky. The Goulandris Museum, opened in 1986, has brought this Greek ideal within reach, making it possible to cross the cultural gap between the quotidian and the sublime simply by walking through its door. A state-of-the-art building and display facilities present the private collection of the late Nicholas P. Goulandris, a shipping magnate, and his wife, Dolly, a widow's labor of love in her husband's memory. It is a choice collection, second not even to that of the National Museum, of those deceptively ''modern'' figurines of white marble that are the beginning of Greek art. Some are abstract, reducing the human figure to the shape of a violin sharply pinched at its waist. Others are more realistic, particularly a delightful figure of a jolly man, sitting on a stool and raising a cup. Five thousand years old, each of these works of nameless masters from the Cycladic islands in the Aegean Sea could have sprung from the ateliers of Picasso or Henry Moore. The works stand out in a beautifully lighted and spacious setting and can be savored as they cannot be in the clutter of the National Museum. One returns outside aware despite today's turmoil that it is indeed in Greece where began Western man's striving to impose order upon chaos, to seize stone and make it art. (The museum (4 Neophytou Douka Street in the Kolonaki section; 7234931 or 7249706) is open Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., Saturday from 10 to 3. Admission, $1.10.) Byzantine Museum A splendid collection of religious art from the beginning of the Christian era to the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule in the last century is well displayed here in a 19th-century Florentine-style villa. Icons are the principal attraction, but the museum also shows early Christian sculpture, marvelously elaborate examples of the craft of medieval and later goldsmiths and silversmiths and artfully woven and decorated cloths for liturgical use. Paintings from abandoned churches in the Greek countryside display vigorously naive folk artists of the 18th and 19th centuries. (The museum (22 Vasilisis Sophias Avenue, near the Hilton Hotel; 7211027) is open daily from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., closed Monday. Admission, $1.50.) Benaki Museum The museum is the elegant mansion of the late Anthony Benaki, who compiled an eclectic collection and converted the family home into a museum. The bulding has been added to, and the collections expanded, but their initial character has been preserved. The principal concentration is on Greek art and history through the ages. Greece's nearness to the world of Islam and of the Copts is also reflected by examples of their art. There are rich collections of Byzantine and post-Byzantine painting. The quality of painting declines in patriotic 19th-century works, which are historically interesting for depicting the Greek struggle for independence. Folk art, particularly embroideries and costumes, is well represented. (The museum (Vasilisis Sophias Avenue at Koumbari Street; 3611617) is open every day except Tuesday from 8:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. Admission, $1.10.) Canellopoulos Museum This is a real sleeper among Athens museums. A sharply focused private collection assembled by a couple both wealthy and endowed with refined taste, the museum stands at the foot of the Acropolis in a handsome town house in the neo-classical style and is largely passed by both by Greeks and tourists. It is a superbly displayed array of Greek art from the Archaic period through the Middle Ages, unified by the exacting standards of Paul and Alexandra Canellopoulos, who bought nothing that is mediocre. So personal is the collection that the 83-year-old Mr. Canellopoulos, now nearly blind, can still take a visitor through its three stories and two basements and point out lovingly, as though with a seeing hand, the features of the works he no longer sees but with his mind's eye. Stone sculptures, ceramics, bronzes and icons of exceptional beauty repay a long visit to a small house. (The museum (in the Plaka section below the Acropolis at Theorias and Panos Streets; 3212313) is open weekdays from 8:45 A.M. to 3 P.M., Sunday from 9:30 to 2:30, closed Tuesday. Admission, 75 cents.) National Gallery A display of rather derivative Greek painting since the last century, enlivened occasionally by special exhibitions or loan shows. (The gallery (46 Vasilisis Sophias Avenue, opposite the Hilton; 7211010 and 7235937) is open daily except Monday from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., Sunday from 10 to 2. Admission, 25 cents.) War Museum A modern, rather brutal structure close to the Byzantine Museum, it is interesting to the general viewer for its collection of weapons since the Neolithic Age as well as for its account of the military aspects of Greece's long history, beginning with the campaigns of Alexander the Great. It features a fine scale model of the Acropolis in its time of glory in the 2d century B.C. (The museum (Vasilisis Sophias Avenue at Rizari Street; 7290543) is open Tuesday through Saturday from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M., Sunday 9:30 to 2. Admission is free.) Museum of Greek Folk Art, Center of Folk Art and Tradition Two pleasant places for taking a break on strolls through the old Plaka section at the foot of the Acropolis. They feature the arts and crafts of the ordinary Greek of the last century, with emphasis on woodcarving, needlework and naive painting. (The museum (17 Kydathineon Street; 3123018) is open daily except Monday from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. The center (6 Hatzimihali Street in the Plaka section; 3243987) is open Tuesday and Thursday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. and from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M., and Sunday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. Admission to both is free.) Jewish Museum A touching compilation of remembrances of the vanished life of one of the Jewish communities most cruelly diminished by Germany during World War II. The ingeniously designed displays include the salvaged, reconstructed interior of a provincial synagogue, religious articles, costumes and objects of everyday life. (The museum (on the third floor at 36 Amalias Avenue; 3231577) is open daily except Saturday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. Admission is free.) Goulandris Natural History Museum In the suburb of Kifissia, a stately mansion converted into a modern display case of fauna and flora, with special emphasis on the land, sea and air species found in Greece. The displays are imaginative and attractive, and the museum is an ideal change of pace for travelers with children complaining about being dragged to archeological sites and museums that they find more educational than fun. (The museum (13 Levidou Street, Kifissia; 8080254) is open weekdays, except Friday, from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M., Sunday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission, 75 cents.)

63-> POSTING: New Condo for Yorkville; A Midrise Rarity
Most of the condominiums to emerge in recent years in Yorkville, the upper stretch of the Upper East Side, have tended to be tall, with 35 stories not uncommon. But the Louisiana, a new condominium building at 300 East 90th Street, is only 10 stories high. Two four-story tenements were torn down to make way for the L-shaped structure, which will have a rose-brick facade, large windows and a curved-corner design upon its completion in the late spring. Developed by First Finance Corporation, whose principal is Habib G. Zoghbi, it will have 32 units, ranging from 658 to 1,072 square feet, with one studio, 26 one-bedrooms and five two-bedrooms. Eight of the units will be duplexes. One-bedrooms will run from $167,000 to $350,000, and two-bedrooms from $295,000 to $450,000. About 2,990 square feet of commercial space will be leased or sold on the ground floor. Rates have not yet been set. Because of the rather small parcel of 3,750 square feet, the developer was only allowed to build nine stories at first. ''It took us 18 months to get the extra story from the Board of Standards and Appeals,'' said David Mandl, the architect. The building is named after Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase because, says Corcoran Group Marketing, the exclusive sales agent, it is the ''purchase of a lifetime.'' All the units will have marble bathrooms, and an elevator will lead to a landscaped sunroof.

64-> Chemistry Professor Granted Permission to Leave Soviet
Irwin Cotler, a local lawyer, said today that Yuri Tarnopolsky, a Soviet chemistry professor and poet, hade been given permission to emigrate. Mr. Tarnopolsky was told Friday that he could leave with his wife and daughter, Mr. Cotler said. Mr. Tarnopolsky spent three years in a Siberian labor camp on charges of anti-Soviet agitation. He was released in March and allowed to return to his home in Kharkov. He originally applied for emigration in 1979.

65-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; SUCCESSOR FOR SPEAKES
With the appointment of Marlin Fitzwater as the next chief White House spokesman, a search is under way for a successor to Mr. Fitzwater in his old post as Vice President Bush's press secretary. Tom C. Griscom, who served as press secretary to Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate Republican leader, was sounded out for the Bush job but did not express any interest. Mr. Bush is in need of a new press spokesman fairly quickly. He is to give a series of Lincoln Day dinner speeches in a few weeks in such politically potent states as New Hampshire and Michigan, and favorable press attention is something the Vice President needs as he approaches his Presidential candidacy. The Vice President did fill one vacancy, created when his speech writer, Clark Judge, was shifted to President Reagan's staff. Mr. Judge was replaced by Mark McIntyre, who formerly served as press secretary to Representative Bob Livingston, Republican of Louisiana. Mr. Fitzwater takes over his new role next week, succeeding Larry Speakes, who managed Mr. Reagan's press affairs for almost six years. In leaving, to take a job with Merrill Lynch, Mr. Speakes is showing that he can manage his own press affairs as well. Today's briefing will be his last, and Mr. Speakes has counted them all up and has determined that today's will also be his 2,000th, which probably is a record, although no one is known to have kept track of that statistic.

67-> COVERING RISK ON THE SLOPE
The Europeans seem to have come up with an emergency rescue card without which one should never put foot to ski boot. It is Carte Neige, or Snow Card, and advertisements prominently posted around the French Alpine ski resort of Courchevel last season touted it as the best thing since chairlifts. The card covers the cost of searching for and rescuing an injured skier (up to about $1,000 to $3,000 an occurrence, depending on where the accident occurred and how extensive the rescue operation was), then transporting the skier to a medical clinic, hospital or home (up to about $900 an occurrence). It also pays for emergency medical treatment (up to about $800), for the forfeiture of lift ticket and ski school pass and for legal defense if the skier is sued for property damage or for injury to other skiers. Its brochure says Carte Neige will even pay for transporting the insured's body to a mortuary in the event of a fatality. The coverage is not limited to ski resorts in France; it extends worldwide, according to the brochure. And, a spokesman said, it covers all mountain sports except activities like parasailing. For all this, the individual vacationer pays about $20 for the season beginning and ending Nov. 15, or about $15 for an eight-day vacation. A family of four can buy coverage for about $65 for the season. Carte Neige is available through the French Ski Federation (La Federation Francaise de Ski), at French travel agencies and at ski schools. For more information, one can call the ski club in Annecy (50.51.40.34) or Carte Neige headquarters in Paris (45.72.64.40). Skiers as well as professionals knowledgeable about medical insurance said they knew of no coverage offered in the United States similar to Carte Neige. In any event, the American skier headed for slopes abroad should consider how Carte Neige might duplicate medical insurance coverage he or she already has or could get with a travel insurance policy. A member of a health maintenance organization like Health Insurance Plan of Manhattan, for example, would have to bring back all itemized bills showing diagnosis, date of service and date of charge and then could expect to be reimbursed for all ''reasonable and customary'' doctors' charges, hospital charges in full and other charges directly related to the injury. But would this include, for example, the ski patrol's charge for search, rescue and transportation off the slopes? ''That's a gray area,'' a HIP spokesman said. And how long might the skier wait for a claim to be processed and for a reimbursement check to arrive in the mail? A minimum of six to eight weeks. A subscriber of Blue Cross-Blue Shield who has basic coverage would be required to bring back all itemized bills and ''have them put into English and American money,'' a spokesman said. Most physician and hospital charges would be reimbursed in full, but the basic policy would not cover any transportation charges, she added. And the claimant would wait at least 21 working days for reimbursement. The HIP and Blue Cross clients, of course, would pay nothing extra for this coverage, but neither would they be gaining such Carte Neige benefits as legal-defense insurance and reimbursement for the unused lift ticket. The initial reaction of Americans on their first ski trip to Europe might be: Is this a good deal? Is Carte Neige even necessary? The answers require a comparison of, well, les pommes et l'oranges. It helps to compare some basic fiscal, philosophical and jurisprudential differences between French and American ski resorts: * In France, an injured skier requiring rescue by the ski patrol is charged a fee ($85 to $150, or more if a helicopter is required) that must be paid on the spot unless one is covered by Carte Neige or similar medical insurance programs available in France; thus the ski patrol is a service that, in effect, helps pay for itself. In the United States, there is no charge for rescue or transport by the ski patrol, unless one considers that the cost of this service is, in effect, included in the price of the lift ticket, so all skiers actually pay for it whether they need it or not. On the other hand, some Americans would argue that, relative to French resorts, United States resorts provide far more amenities for the skier's dollar and the ski patrol is one such amenity. * In France, ski patrols are staffed by professionally trained, state-tested and state-regulated emergency medical technicians who are paid by the resort operators. In the United States, ski patrols operate under very little governmental regulation; although most major resorts are moving toward all-professional patrols, a spokesman for the National Ski Patrol System acknowledged that most ski patrolers nationwide are volunteers who are usually paid with free season ski passes and must heed only those training requirements established by the resort managers. * In the United States, the cost of liability insurance has helped push up lift ticket prices and threatened to close some ski resorts. Paul Parot, director of skiing services at Killington, Vt., said ''one of our main reasons for going pro'' in ski patrol services was the liability insurance issue. In France, this seems to be a nonissue, mostly because of differences in the legal system that result in far fewer lawsuits for damages. Carte Neige's basic coverage could also be approximated in a travel insurance policy. Mutual of Omaha, for example, sells four types of travel accident insurance; a policy for eight days' duration that pays $15,000 for loss of life, limb or sight, $1,500 accident medical expense benefits and $150 monthly in the event of total disability would cost $3.08. It would not pay the ski patrol's rescue charge, but a separate trip cancellation policy would cover emergency transportation to the nearest medical facility if you had to interrupt your vacation because of covered illness or injuries. That would cost $30.40 for $800 worth of coverage. The two policies together would thus cost $33.48. After so many apples and oranges, the skier is likely to be a bit dazed by the options available, much in the way of someone shopping for the best buy among video cassette recorders. An American skier in Europe probably ought to consider buying the eight-day Carte Neige; its $15 cost would be well worth it if only for the rescue service that would otherwise cost $85 and might not be reimbursed. But, then, the ski patrolers at Courchevel boast that the huge resort records only 350 injuries among the more than 1.5 million skiers who use it each season. Such a figure is hard to verify, given the ski patrols' differences in definition and recordkeeping, but if it is true it is only about one-tenth the average rate of injury reported by American resorts. Philippe Mermin, a Courchevel ski patroler for 15 years, attributed this record to the well-staffed operation of the resort, to the grooming that the trails are given year round, to the European skiers' penchant for instruction and safe skiing and to the Europeans' less litigious nature. Interviewed atop La Saulire, one of the highest peaks at Courchevel, one very foggy morning, Mr. Mermin said - and an officer of the company later confirmed - that Service Public des Trois Vallees, the owner and operator of Courchevel, had been sued only once in 20 years. The plaintiff, a man who had been injured while skiing, lost his case.

68-> EX CONGRESSMAN W.R. POAGE, 87; TEXAN HEADED AGRICULTURE PANEL
W. R. Poage, who represented central Texas's 11th Congressional District in for 42 years until retiring in 1978, died yesterday of heart failure after emergency surgery at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Tex. He was 87 years old and a resident and native of Waco. Representative Poage, a Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 1936 after working a farm, practicing law and spending 12 years in the State Legislature in Austin. In Washington, he sat on the House Agriculture Committee for 34 years, serving as its chairman from 1967 until a new generation of Democrats in the House openly rebelled against its rigid seniority system toward the end of 1974. As a junior member of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Poage had championed the small farmer. He railed against the farm policies of the Eisenhower Administration, which he held responsible for forcing farmers off the land instead of insuring their prosperity. Forced to Make Compromises But the power of rural interests in Congress was in a long, historic decline that coincided with his tenure. His own political influence, derived from incumbency and his Southern power base, waned with the farm bloc and, even as he held the chairmanship, he was forced to make compromises with urban Democrats. Mr. Poage had looked askance at Federal food stamps and sought to restrict their use. He also was skeptical of various other proposals to give food assistance to the poor and, as late as 1968, disputed the presence of hunger in the rural South. To preserve his influence, he became more open to arguments from differing farming interests and even courted urban liberals by supporting a more generous approach to food stamps so as to win passage of a farm bill he could live with in 1973. The revolt that gathered force the following year was fueled by first-term Democrats elected in the wake of the Watergate scandals. Their first target became Wilbur D. Mills of the Ways and Means Committee, perhaps the most powerful chairman of them all, who resigned under fire in December. By then, Mr. Poage's role as the defender of the small farmer had become overshadowed by his defense of strict sugar quotas and subsidies to corporate cotton growers. In a stunning upset, in January 1975, Mr. Poage was deposed from his committee chairmanship along with two other long-term Southern strongmen: Wright Patman, a fellow Texan, from the Banking and Currency Committee, and F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana, from the Armed Services Committee. Had Surgery in 1977 Mr. Poage, who continued as deputy chairman of the Agriculture Committee, underwent an operation in 1977, then announced that he would not run for another term. At the time he was the second-ranking House member in seniority. After his return to Waco, he pursued a lifelong avocation by writing books on the history of central Texas and McLennan County and the recollections of his boyhood. He worked largely out of the W. R. Poage Legislative Library Center at Baylor University, his alma mater. The center for advanced studies and research was built with private funds and formed another of his principal interests. A nursing supervisor at the Waco hospital said yesterday that Mr. Poage had suffered a heart attack Dec. 10 while driving in Waco. His car mounted a divider and struck a tree. Mr. Poage was hospitalized until Dec. 20, was readmitted last Monday for intensive tests and underwent the emergency surgery Friday, the supervisor, Betty White, said. Spent His Youth on a Cow Ranch William Robert (Bob) Poage was born Dec. 28, 1899, in Waco but spent part of his early youth on a cow ranch the family ran in western Texas. He attended Waco High School and served a year in the Navy as an apprentice seaman in 1918 before enroling at Baylor University, where he honed his oratory as a member of the debating team. He graduated in 1921 and worked as an undergraduate instructor in geology while earning his law degree at the Baylor law school. He was admitted to the Texas bar in 1924 and practiced in Waco until 1935. Mr. Poage served four years in the Texas House of Representatives, 1924-28, and in the state Senate from 1930 until his election to Congress. A widower, he is survived by a brother, Scott A. Poage of Waco; a nephew, Scott T. Poage, also of Waco, and a niece, April Poage Woolsey of Austin. A funeral service is to be held at 2:30 P.M. tomorrow at the First Presbyterian Church in Waco.

To the Editor: Regarding your Dec. 7 article on Brewster [ ''If You're Thinking of Living in Brewster,'' ] : You failed to mention that those young professionals moving into the area probably first heard of Brewster while watching television when they were growing up in the mid-60's. Brewster was introduced to a national audience as the home of ''That Girl,'' Ann Marie, one of the first female ''yuppies'' of the television age, portrayed by Marlo Thomas. Particular mention was often made in the program of the easy commute to and from New York City. ''That Girl'' can still be seen regularly on cable television, and thus a whole new national audience is being introduced to Brewster. MARCIA CONRON Elizabeth, N.J.

72-> COMPANY NEWS; BUYS HYATT MAUI
The Kokasai Motor Company, Japan's largest taxicab and livery service, has agreed to acquire the Hyatt Regency Maui hotel for $320 million, a record price for a hotel property, according to the Sonnenblick Goldman Corporation, the mortgage banker in the transaction. Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan's fifth-largest bank, provided financing. The seller was a partnership sponsored by VMS Realty Partners Inc. of Chicago. The deal is expected to close this spring. It was the second major real estate acquisition in the United States in as many months by a family-held Japanese company. In December, the Kato Kagaku Company, a food processor, bought a Manhattan skyscraper, Tower 49, for $301 million. The Hyatt, a beach hotel on the island of Maui, opened in 1980. The hotel's 818 rooms are spread among three midrise towers, with a connecting atrium that contains a miniature rain forest.

73-> CONNECTICUT OPINION; ONCE UPON A TIME -- AT THE MOVIES
''WHAT, again?'' my mother used to exclaim. ''You went last week. You'll grow up stupid!'' It was a weekly argument my mother and I had when I grew up in the 1940's in the Five Towns. The argument was whether I was to be permitted to join my friends at the Cedarhurst Movie Theater, the only movie house in all of the Five Towns. (I read recently that the theater has been converted into a shopping center - a little bit of news that released this flood of memories.) ''That movie house is a baby sitter for all the parents who want to get rid of their kids on Saturday,'' my mother used to protest while I silently prayed, ''Why can't my parents be like other parents?'' The only way I would get to the theater, I knew, was to convince my mother how educational the movies were. Consequently I would prepare arguments as to what ''Tarzan,'' ''The Thin Man,'' ''Love Crazy'' or ''Casablanca'' had to offer an 11- or 12-year-old girl. Getting permission, however, was the least of my problems. One had to have a ''date'' with a girlfriend. The one you went to the movie with determined your popularity. These dates were arranged no more than two days in advance. Sometimes if there was an important football game in our small private school, the Woodmere Academy, we would opt to go to the football game rather than the movies. However, if it rained unexpectedly, ''dates'' had to be arranged hurriedly in the morning. During the 40's most people had only one phone number, and the stock market used to stay open on Saturdays until noon. That meant I had to make my calls quickly while my father groaned that he could not even call his broker on the one day he had time to talk to him. The ''date'' started with lunch at one or the other's house, and one parent driving us to the movie. We would spot our friends from school and stand in line with them. Out of the corner of our eyes we would notice, too, if any of the boys we knew had come to the movies. I was very much influenced by the movies, and perhaps that is what my mother disapproved of. Sometimes I wore my hair over one eye like Veronica Lake; other times I tried an upsweep. I bought all the movie magazines and after reading all the gossip about my idols cut out the pictures and pasted them in a scrapbook. In private I wrote preposterous short stories to be sent to Hollywood. Years later, re-reading these efforts, I recognized rehashed plots of my favorite movies. Much, much later, when our marriage was breaking up, the marriage counselor said, ''We want to keep in mind that your generation was influenced by those romantic movies where all was glamour and perfect love.'' My first love was Gregory Peck. He was - for a young girl - a safe love up there on the screen. Of course, I was dreaming about the future -what was possible once I got out of the Five Towns. Because the Five Towns had no other entertainment than the Cedarhurst Movie Theater, it was our only release from the weekly routine of homework, gym and home. It made us laugh, cry, cheer and at times gave us nightmares. It assured us that romance was around the corner and that the good guys always win, and reminded us that even though our lives were tranquil, the world was at war. Perhaps it is only right that if the theater had to go, it should be converted into a shopping center. Don't we in a sense shop to project our dream of how we would like to see ourselves? But I have another dream - a wish as unrealistic as the movies we used to watch. I hope that at night, when they lock up the shopping center, Gregory Peck, Hedy Lamarr, Richard Conte, Veronica Lake, Cary Grant and all the rest with their wonderful romantic stories come right through the walls to haunt the place.

76-> EXPERTS QUESTION MARKET RATIONALITY
Those who make it their business to analyze the inner workings of the nation's stock markets from a distance see an irrational tinge to the behavior of investors in the wild start for 1987. ''You have to distinguish between what's rational and what is happening,'' said Franco Modigliani, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. ''The only time the ratio of share prices to company earnings has been higher was in 1961. But that was when the interest rate on the Treasury bill was at 2.3 and the United States was on the verge of tremendous growth.'' Profit Expectation Cited Professor Modigliani noted that expectations of higher corporate profits were a driving force in the current market. And investors have been attracted to stocks because the interest rates on alternative investments, such as bonds and savings accounts, have been going down. However, interest rates are higher and growth prospects far worse than in 1960. ''We have reached a point that's surprising,'' Professor Modigliani concluded. ''It's hard to find an objective justification for today's level.'' Nevertheless, academic analysts and theorists who work for leading investment houses feel driven to explain what they have seen to date by trends, such as the rise of foreign investment, or characteristics of the market that are easily recognized, if not always perfectly understood. ''I don't know of anything that has fundamentally changed,'' said Fischer Black, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company of the sharp run-up in prices since Jan. 3 and the unprecedented volatility of trading yesterday. Optimism Seen as Factor Mr. Black said that the main force driving the market, at least until yesterday's reversal, appeared to be increasing optimism about the economy, in part because of the possibility that the decline in the value of the dollar will spur sales of American products abroad. Richard McCabe, general manager of the technical analysis department at Merrill Lynch & Company, agreed. ''The latest advance over the last three weeks seems to be anticipating earnings improvements this year,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''The previous phase in late 1985 was interest-rate driven, which you could see in the kinds of stocks that reacted well, such as banks. This time the primary interest is in cyclical, economy-sensitive stocks such as papers and chemicals.'' Mr. McCabe noted that the sequence was a typical one for multi-stage stock market rallies. ''The sequence seems to be on a more stetched-out time scale than 10 or 15 years ago, perhaps because of the slowness of the economy in responding to falling interest rates,'' he added. Effect of Foreign Investment But Mr. McCabe also believes that the increasing ability of investors to move funds around the world has added to the recent spurt in United States stocks. Economies everywhere are growing slowly enough that investors have more money than they want to put into assets, such as new factories. As a result, they move it wherever they believe they can get good returns from financial assets. Foreign investors continue to be attracted to United States equities for a wide variety of reasons. Some see the United States as a safer place to invest their money than their home countries. Japanese investors like American stocks because they look like bargains compared with the prices of the Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo exchange. In addition, as the dollar falls, a foreign investor can buy an increasing amount of shares with his or her currency. Sharp Increase in Liquidity Noted Martin Shubik, professor of mathematical and institutional economics at both the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics and the Yale University School of Management, also cites the sharp increase in liquidity as a major factor. But that does not make the recent prices reasonable, he said. ''I think we have a classical frenzy on our hands,'' Professor Shubik said. ''It could go up a couple hundred points or down 300 without any trouble at all.'' Professor Shubik said that part of the problem is the herd psychology of fund managers who ''get a report card every day'' and are painfully aware that they have underperformed the market average for the past few years. ''That's no way to run a financial system,'' Professor Shubik said.

78-> MCFARLANE TOOK CAKE AND BIBLE TO TEHERAN, EX-C.I.A. MAN SAYS
A retired Central Intelligence Agency official has confirmed to the Senate Intelligence Committee that on the secret mission to Teheran last May, Robert C. McFarlane and his party carried a Bible with a handwritten verse from President Reagan for Iranian leaders. According to a person who has read the committee's draft report, the retired C.I.A. official, George W. Cave, an Iran expert who was part of the mission, said the group had 10 falsified passports, believed to be Irish, and a key-shaped cake to symbolize the anticipated ''opening'' to Iran. These and other details of the secret American operation are discussed at length in the report, but much of the material has already appeared in public in the more than two months since the revelations began with publication of a story about the McFarlane mission in a small Beirut weekly. In effect, the report supplies a useful chronology of the events. The rather bizarre details of the McFarlane mission were first made known by the Iranian Speaker of Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, on Nov. 4, when the secret operation first became known. Hojatolislam Rafsanjani also said that the Americans had been disguised and that they had carried sets of Colt pistols as gifts. But these details were not confirmed in the report. Nevertheless, until the committee's report began to circulate in Washington, all the Iranian assertions about the McFarlane mission were either derided as fanciful or not confirmed. Today, a senior State Department official independently confirmed that Mr. McFarlane, a former national security adviser, did carry the Reagan Bible as authentication for the group. But he said he was not sure about the cake and declined to discuss the passports. The Irish Government complained publicly when the reports appeared that the McFarlane group had carried Irish passports. The report noted that Mr. McFarlane, in his testimony, said he had carried his own United States passport but had never had to show it. One earlier report said Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North carried all the fake passports. When asked in November about the Iranian reports, Mr. McFarlane dismissed as fiction many of the details, such as that the participants were wearing disguises. According to participants in the trip, the McFarlane mission, on May 28-31, turned out to be a major disappointment for the Reagan Administration, the committee report said. Under an elaborate plan worked out in advance by Manucher Ghorbanifar, an Iranian businessman, and an Israeli official, Amiram Nir, the McFarlane mission was to deliver three planeloads of weapons starting with their flight to Iran. In return, all the American hostages were to be freed in Lebanon. When no hostages were freed, the group's three days were spent in fruitless argument with low- and middle-level Iranians. The Iranians complained that they had been overcharged for weapons previously sent to them via Israel. The committee, in its report, covered in depth in chronological fashion how the United States became involved in the Iran operation. Some of the material was made known earlier in the week by NBC News, and some was broadcast over the Israeli radio today by its correspondent, Shimon Shiffer. Other material has been supplied by committee sources who have read the report. The draft report concluded with a criticism of the way the Reagan Administration handled the Iran operation. It said the plan to sell arms to Iran in the hopes of releasing the American hostages was originated by the Israelis, who had their own agenda in seeking to improve their own ties with Iran. Questions on Israeli Motives The report said it appeared that the Administration had failed to undertake a formal assessment of the Israeli initiative to Iran, to see if the objectives and motives of the Israelis were identical to those of the United States. Secretary of State George P. Shultz was quoted approvingly by the committee for sounding a warning to Mr. McFarlane in July 1985, when Mr. McFarlane was still national security adviser. He had just been approached by David Kimche, a high Israeli official, about the initiative toward Iran. According to an exchange of cables between Mr. McFarlane, who was in Washington, and Mr. Shultz, who was in the Far East at the time, Mr. McFarlane endorsed the Israeli plan as promising, even though it included the possibility of selling arms to Iran. Mr. Shultz replied that although he agreed that the United States should not turn its back on the prospect of gaining the release of the seven hostages then in Lebanon, and perhaps renewing ties with a more compatible regime in Iran, he cautioned Mr. McFarlane about the risks. A Warning About Risks He said the United States should be essentially passive and await further signs from the Iranians. He also expressed concern that Israel might be seeking to supply arms to Iran for its own reasons, which were not those of the United States, and that there was ''a peril in undertaking such an initiative with Israel.'' The report does not have definitive findings on the issue of how the Iranian payments for arms were diverted to the contras. But it is thorough in recounting the chronology of the Iranian operation. It says the initial discussions were held in Israel in late 1984 - earlier than first believed - by Mr. Ghorbanifar; Jacob Nimrodi, an arms dealer who was a former Israeli defense attache in Iran; Al Schwimmer, a founder of Israel's aircraft industry who was close to Shimon Peres, then Prime Minister, and Mr. Kimche. The committee report says they discussed ways of opening channels to Iran, including the sale of arms. Mr. Ghorbanifar told the Israelis that there were many high officials in Iran who wanted to pursue a more pro-Western course, but that arms were needed to improve their standing with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader. Saudi's Role Highlighted The report also highlighted the work of Adnan M. Khashoggi, a Saudi arms dealer who helped finance the early arms shipments to Iran and who was close to Mr. Ghorbanifar. None of these foreign participants, who have figured in press accounts, were interviewed by the committee. In April 1985, Michael Ledeen, who was a consultant to the National Security Council staff at the time the agency was completing a study on Iran, met in Israel with Mr. Ghorbanifar. He told the committee, the report said, that he thought Mr. Ghorbanifar was serious and had good contacts with moderates in Iran. Mr. Nimrodi told Mr. Ledeen that the situation in Iran was in flux, the report said. On May 17, 1985, the report said, the Central Intelligence Agency produced a report on the opportunity for strategic contacts with Iran, raising for the first time the question of selling it arms and ending the embargo on such sales. U.S.-Israel Talks Continue Meanwhile, talks between the United States and Israel continued. Mr. Ledeen traveled to Israel again and met with Mr. Peres and Shlomo Gazit, former head of Israeli military intelligence, and they agreed on the usefulness to Israel and the United States of opening channels to Iran. This appeared to be the first time that Mr. Gazit's role in the affair was mentioned. Mr. Ledeen met also with five recent Iranian immigrants to Israel, and those talks encouraged Mr. Ledeen to believe there was an opportunity to bring about changes in Iran. The report does not appear to deal with how much influence, if any, Mr. Ledeen had in Washington. Mr. McFarlane has insisted that Mr. Ledeen did not go to Israel on instructions from him, and was more or less acting on his own initiative. But Israeli officials, whenever they discuss the origins of the policy, cite the Ledeen trips as evidence that Washington was pushing it. Mr. Ledeen has said very little publicly. T.W.A. Hijacking Recalled In June 1985, after the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet to Beirut, Israeli officials said they had asked Mr. Ghorbanifar to ask Iranian authorities to free the American hostages on the plane. Two days later, this was done. This, according to the report, enhanced Mr. Ghorbanifar's reputation with the Israelis for reliability. On July 3, 1985, Mr. Kimche visited Mr. McFarlane in Washington, to tell him of the Ghorbanifar connection and to assert that Iranian officials had asked Israel to find out if the United States had interest in political talks. Mr. Kimche was optimistic, Mr. McFarlane told the committee, that if the connection was opened, the American hostages would be freed. The report quoted Mr. McFarlane as saying he discussed the Israeli ideas with Mr. Reagan on July 13 and received a signal to go ahead. Meanwhile, Mr. Ghorbanifar met with Mr. Nimrodi, Mr. Schwimmer, Mr. Kimche and Mr. Khashoggi in Hamburg, West Germany, to discuss possible arms sales. Discrepancy Noted As previously reported, Mr. Kimche returned to Washington in early August and raised more specifically the possibility of the sale by Israel of some 500 TOW antitank missiles to Iran, in exchange for the hostages. The report notes a discrepancy between the testimony of Mr. McFarlane, who said that on Aug. 6 Mr. Reagan approved the sale and promised to replenish the Israeli stocks, and that of Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, who said Mr. Reagan did not approve the sale ahead of time but did not say anything when he learned of it after the fact. Two Israeli shipments were made, at the end of August and on Sept. 13, leading to the release of the first American hostage, the Rev. Benjamin Weir. Another shipment was undertaken Nov. 19, to send 80 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles via Portugal. The Portuguese refused to allow the plane to land, however, leading to a decision by Mr. McFarlane to enlist the help of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, his aide, and of the C.I.A. Colonel North secured permission from the C.I.A. to send another plane to Israel to pick up the 80 missiles, but the substitute aircraft was too small to take all 80, and instead took 18. Sale Is Suspended No new hostages were freed, and in December, Mr. McFarlane testified, Mr. Reagan, on his recommendation, agreed to close down the arms sales. But in early January 1986, Mr. Nir became involved on the Israeli side, replacing Mr. Nimrodi, Mr. Schwimmer and Mr. Kimche. On a trip to Washington in the first days of January, Mr. Nir, according to the report, persuaded Colonel North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, who had replaced Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, that the only way to secure the release of the hostages was through further arms sales. The report suggested Mr. Nir also may have planted the idea of diverting Iranian payments to the contras. The report said Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d told the committee that Colonel North had told him that the diversion idea came from his talks in January 1986 while Mr. Nir was in Washington. In Rome tonight, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, reiterated Israel's denial that it had anything to do with diverting money to the contras. Colonel North has refused to comment or testify on his role on the ground that it might incriminate him. There is also a statement in the report that last Sept. 19 Israel shipped Soviet-made arms to the contras by boat. Elliot Abrams, the State Department's official in charge of Latin America, with jurisdiction for contra affairs, today denied knowledge of such a shipment. Because the McFarlane mission to Teheran last spring failed, the report revealed, the Administration grew wary of the Israelis and Mr. Ghorbanifar. The report said for the first time that on Sept. 17, 1986, Colonel North opened a new channel of communications with Iran without telling the Israelis. The report disclosed that on Oct. 3, 1986, Colonel North, Mr. Cave and other Americans met in Frankfurt, West Germany, with the new Iranian contact, who was not identified. Some sources have said it was the son of Hojatolislam Rafsanjani. In October, one American hostage was freed, and in November, another. Contacts continued for a week after the disclosure of Mr. McFarlane's mission in early November, but five Americans remain hostages in Lebanon.

83-> Bravely, Let Federal Pay Increase
Members of Congress will face issues of greater obvious importance this session but probably none requiring such political courage as whether to pay higher salaries to themselves and 2,500 other top Federal officials. These raises are in everyone's best interest. The raises, ranging from 2 to 16 percent, were included in the President's new budget. By law, they take effect next Wednesday unless Congress disapproves. The Senate voted this week to disapprove. The House should resist pressure to follow suit. Government cannot attract the people public service needs unless it pays fairly. The President's recommendations are reasonable. They fall short of those of the quadrennial Federal pay commission, which last month called for increases as high as 80 percent. But they strike a balance between the need for austerity and the need to make up for severe erosion in top Federal salaries in recent years. To ordinary taxpayers, the salaries and raises may look high. Congressional pay, for example, would go to $89,500 from $77,400; Federal District judges to $89,500 from $81,100; Cabinet officers to $99,500 from $88,800. But the question is, compared with what: most occupants of these jobs could earn two or three times as much in private life. At some point the financial loss outweighs the appeal of public service - and the public loses able officials. Some people who support pay raises object to the backdoor method of increasing them. The raises go into effect unless Congress votes against them. But this is probably the only way a majority of legislators can summon up the nerve to overcome fear of a voter backlash. That fear produced the pay erosion that now must be overcome. A more worthy procedural objection is to tying Congressional salary increases to raises for other top officials, especially Federal judges. Cabinet members hold their jobs for limited periods. Judges accept appointments for life. That makes them hostages to the political fears of legislators, which is neither fair nor wise and ought to be changed. Other reforms may be in order. The pay commission recommended, for example, that the price of Congressional raises be no more speech fees or other honorariums. That's a sound proposition, to be taken up later. What's needed now is for the House to show the courage the Senate didn't - the courage to do nothing, and let the raises take effect.

84-> COLUMN ONE: AROUND RHINEBECK; Unwelcome Guests From New York City
THE people in this Dutchess County town sometimes feel as if the invasion will never end. ''I don't see how anyone can do this to Rhinebeck,'' said one resident, Charlene Cortese, expressing her outrage at a recent Rotary Club luncheon. ''It's no worse than what the Russians are doing to Afghanistan.'' Mrs. Cortese was referring to Daytop Village Inc., the private New York City organization that bought the Rhinebeck Country School for emotionally and mentally disabled children on Dec. 31 and announced plans to convert it to a drug treatment center. There is talk of establishing a similar school at a different site. The drug patients will come from all over the state, many of them from New York City. The 400-bed center is to open this spring. ''The city takes our land,'' said another resident, Aida Wilder, one of the legions of former Manhattanites who have migrated here in the last decade. ''It takes our water. Now, they're sending us their problems.'' In an attempt to block the center, Mrs. Wilder, Mrs. Cortese and a group of others have formed Rhinebeck Against the Impact of Daytop. They maintain that Rhinebeck already has enough alternate care centers. In a town where many people don't lock their doors, they say they also fear that the center will threaten the safety of their families. Daytop operates 13 drug treatment centers in the state, including one in the Dutchess County town of Millbrook. Daytop officials say that another center is needed in Dutchess and that the Rhinebeck Country School, with its 400-acre campus, is an appropriate setting. ''We've never gone anyplace where they wanted us,'' said Daytop's vice president and executive director, Charles Devlin. ''Every town is angry about it.'' When Dutchess County proposed putting a landfill on a horse farm here last fall, nearly 1,000 people packed a meeting in protest. While a site has still not been chosen, it seems unlikely that the landfill will end up in Rhinebeck. ''Now, people are saying, 'Bring back the dump,' '' said Charles LaForge Jr., the owner of the Beekman Arms hotel. ''They'd rather have the dump than the drugs.'' The Beekman Arms was built in 1766, one of the historical landmarks in a village that was first settled in 1686 by a group of Dutchmen. Some German settlers who arrived in 1713 named it Rhinebeck in remembrance of their beloved Rhine. With its rich farmland and its proximity to the Hudson River and New York City - 90 miles south - Rhinebeck prospered. In the early 20th century, a group of America's aristocrats and nouveau riche, the Livingstons, the Astors and their relatives, built grand estates along the river. Today, the village has 2,500 residents, 344 buildings listed as a National Historic District, one red light and no parking meters. In the town of 7,500 people that has grown up around it there are no fast-food outlets and no shopping malls. More and more people are moving here, buying up the Victorian homes that are selling for between $200,000 and $400,000. The newcomers are part of the growth being experienced throughout the Hudson Valley. Rhinebeck's planning officials were among the first in the valley to impose a temporary moratorium on development last year. ''Businessmen used to complain that they didn't have any customers,'' recalled 74-year-old Homer Staley, a retired realtor who was born and raised here. ''Now, we have an attitude that we don't want another person in town.'' The first Japanese restaurant opened three years ago, with the fresh fish for sushi being trucked up regularly from the city. ''Everybody was waiting for sushi,'' said one of the restaurant's owners, Mariko Yoshida. Art inevitably followed sushi. Glenn Bell, a former English teacher from Brooklyn, opened the first art gallery last spring. Three other galleries have since come to town. ''Rhinebeck is going to be the next SoHo,'' said Mr. Bell, making just the sort of proclamation that alarms old-timers as well as newcomers who moved here to get away from such Manhattan phenomena as SoHo. ''We like it the way it is, naturally,'' said Bronson Chanler, a retired investment adviser who lives in the French country house his father built along the Hudson shortly before World War II. ''The town is getting precious. It's getting filled with boutiques. I don't like boutiques. I never go shopping.'' Mr. Staley, one of the town's storytellers and philosophers, holds court at the Beekman Arms. ''We don't care much for excitement here,'' he was saying the other day. ''There are no discos here and we don't want any.'' The last time Mr. Staley made the journey to New York City was 14, maybe 15, years ago. ''Why would I go there?'' he asked. ''The deer hunting isn't any good - or the skiing.''

87-> WHAT RAIL TICKETS REALLY COST
Improvements in Metro-North's rail service have been widely acclaimed in recent years in the press, by public officials and even by commuter groups that are usually critical of railroad service. Typical is the article ''Metro-North Basks in Progress'' [ Nov. 9 ] . The article discusses how bad conditions on the railroad were only three yeas ago and how good the service is today. Mr. [ John S. ] Boritas of our Metro-North Rail Commuter Council is quoted: ''It's been a night-and-day change.'' In the entire article, the only hint of criticism is: ''As a result of the improved service . . . the increased ridership has created . . . a surge in demand for parking spaces at train stations.'' One widely recognized explanation for that improved service is the excellent new management of the railroad under the leadership of president Peter E. Stangl. Another obvious explanation is the multibillion-dollar capital program that has been in progress on all Metropolitan Transportation Authority facilities since 1981. Amid this euphoria, however, is a looming crisis that needs to be more consciously recognized by commuters and by all who are concerned with continued good mass-transit service. Associated with that M.T.A. capital program is an enormous expenditure of public funds, both capital and operating, by M.T.A. agencies. For Metro-North, the actual full cost of a commuter ticket is now more than $400 per month. The commuter pays less than a third of that directly; the balance is paid out of general public taxes and in bonded indebtedness. The present capital program for Metro-North alone calculates out to about $50,000 per each and every commuter. That is in addition to the fares he pays directly and to the annual public subsidies for operating deficits. (Imagine trying to collect that additional amount from each commuter directly.) There is almost no awareness at present among commuters or others that the actual cost of Metro-North service is that high. It is possible that, even if they were aware, commuters would support the public policies of providing those funds for mass transit. But the commuter should be concerned about the possibility that those numbers, which are readily accessible from public records, might be used to create antitransit repercussions among, for example, not only upstate legislators but also his own neighbors who may not even use the train. A basic factor at issue is that mass transit is supposed to be the efficient, economical way to move large numbers of people within an urban area. A commuter ticket should not cost $400 per month. A rail system already in existence, even having suffered through a recent period of neglected maintenance, should not require additional capital expenditures of an amount of $50,000 from each and every commuter. Abundant evidence can be submitted to show that the reason why those amounts are so high is because they are based upon a ''wish list'' approach to expenditures rather than upon prudent, economical and cost-effective considerations. Such excessive levels of spending may appear satisfying to commuters for the moment but they pose a dire threat to the viability and quality of future service. Despite the abundance of funds now being made available to the M.T.A., commuters and the transit operators might be well advised to place more-urgent emphasis upon efficiency and productivity so that good mass-transit service can be provided at a total cost that is within reason.

88-> CURRENCY MARKETS; DOLLAR UP SHARPLY IN HECTIC TRADING
In sometimes-frenzied trading on foreign-exchange markets, the dollar rose sharply yesterday, despite some profit taking in New York late in the day. In hectic European trading, the dollar's major strength stemmed from the belief, which was later justified, that the United States' December trade figures would show a huge improvement over the record $19.2 billion deficit previously reported for November. The Commerce Department reported that the December trade deficit was $10.6 billion, the lowest trade gap in nearly two years. In active New York dealings, the dollar remained strong, trading at higher levels for most of the session. The dollar was particularly strong against the West German mark. As New York currency dealers closed their books for the weekend, James Baker, a trader at Bank Julius Baer of Zurich, quoted the mark at 1.8330 to the dollar, compared with 1.7900 Thursday. The Japanese yen was also weaker, quoted at 153.70 to the dollar, compared with 152.50 late Thursday. The strength of the dollar caused gold to tumble by $8, to $404.50 an ounce, according to the Republic National Bank of New York. The dollar's rise also caused a steep plunge in futures prices for gold and other precious metals, although the losses were trimmed by the end of the day. [ Page 42. ] Dealers also said the demand for dollars was uncommonly strong in West Germany, where the Bundesbank eased credit. The central bank canceled a scheduled sale of three-day Treasury bills at a time when month-end financial settlements would normally tighten credit and push up interest rates. One result of the increase in banking liquidity was that call money rates dropped as low as the Bundesbank's 3 percent discount rate. The rate decline, in turn, caused a dramatic rush out of marks and into dollars before the trade figures were announced in Washington, dealers said. Despite the dollar's strong gains, however, many traders remained bearish on the prospects for the currency, which has recently fallen steeply. Albert Soria, manager of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation, said: ''While there was more buying by those who had been selling dollars short, and some foreign-exchange houses here and overseas established new long positions in the dollar, the fundamentals still point to a further decline in the dollar. We dealers are still waiting for Washington to signal that it would no longer tolerate a further decline in the dollar.'' Some dealers predicted that the dollar might even resume its decline before next week's Treasury auctions of $29 billion of notes and bonds. They pointed out that a weaker dollar could inhibit foreign buyers of the Treasury's quarterly refunding issues. But others noted that the record $9.36 billion December trade surplus reported by Japan yesterday would generate sufficient interest in the auctions. Japan's 1986 trade surplus was given as $86 billion. Dealers said the dollar was also helped yesterday by comments by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, who told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that he would prefer that the marketplace set the dollar's value. But they added that they were confused by his further comment that the Administration was considering a meeting with the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Britain and France but had not yet made a decision. Japan has been seeking a Group of Five meeting to stabilize currency rates. In New York, most other major currencies also lost ground to the dollar. Mr. Baker at Bank Julius Baier quoted the dollar at 1.5460 Swiss francs, up from 1.5060 on Thursday, and it took $1.5140 to buy a British pound, compared with $1.5370. But the Canadian dollar, benefiting from continued Japanese and other foreign investments, rose to 1.3380 to the United States dollar, from 1.3410 on Thursday. Despite the dollar's rise during the last two trading days of the week, it remained considerably weaker than at the start of the month. On Jan. 2, it took 1.92 marks to buy a dollar, 158 yen, 1.61 Swiss francs and 1.38 Canadian dollars. And it took $1.49 to buy a British pound.

90-> Exemption From Rent Regulations
To the Editor: A question was raised in your Q. & A. column on Nov. 16 about creating exempt status on rent-regulated apartments. The answer stated: ''The only way to rid a building of its rent-regulated status is through a gut-rehabilitation includingnew ceilings, floors, walls, etc.'' I must take issue with Thomas R. Viola, the spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, who supplied that answer. The statute refers to substantial rehabilitation and not gut rehabilitation. A number of court decisions have ruled on these matters and essentially held that the key test is the addition of livable units. In the matter of Romanov v. Heller 121 Misc. 2d 886, 888, for example, the court produced the following two tests: 1. New dwelling units should be added to the housing stock and should predominate over the number of pre-existing units, or 2. The multiple-dwelling status of a building should be upgraded. See also Baxter v. Crow Management 128 Misc. 2d 254 and Nelson v. Yates 127 Misc. 2D 234. The Housing and Community Renewal officials are infamous for creating their own standards and ignoring court decisions. JOHN P. FARRAUTO Yonkers

94-> HOME VIDEO; FROM 'NAPOLEON' TO MOZART TO SINCLAIR LEWIS
'Arrowsmith' Starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes. Directed by John Ford. 1931. Embassy Home Entertainment. 101 minutes. $39.95. In this era of DNA, RNA, electron microscopes and genetic engineering, there is something extremely quaint about the kind of scientists who were called microbe hunters. As depicted in this adaptation (by Sidney Howard) of the Sinclair Lewis novel, they are people who puff cigarettes around culture incubators, brew serums in their kitchens, refer to germs as ''bugs'' and treat both bubonic plague virus and their wives with fatal condescension. Still, the current of idealism that pervades this story of Dr. Martin Arrowsmith and of the conflict between pure science and humanity, and between altruistic inquiry and the prospect of fame and money, proves bracing in this more cynical age. Both science and performance styles have changed greatly since this movie was made, and the videocassette provides a valuable medium for pondering the differences.

96-> SCIENCE FICTION
THE FOLK OF THE AIR (Del Rey/Ballantine, $16.95) by Peter S. Beagle, a fantasy novel set in contemporary California, mixes science and the supernatural so seamlessly that the bedazzled reader soon ceases to care which is which. Certainly none of the characters in this book stay up nights worrying about such distinctions. The woman known as Sia is a psychotherapist of sorts who lives in a house with an indeterminate number of windows; describing her clients as ''the displaced ones,'' she adds, ''You can be uprooted from imaginary places too, you know.'' Joe Farrell, an attractive drifter who plays a mean lute when the mood strikes him, readily identifies himself as a man born out of his time; he would have preferred the heyday of the galliard, the pavanne and the madrigal. Farrell's old friend Ben is a scholar with a more than academic interest in the vikings. Together with Ben and an old girlfriend, Farrell is caught up in the antics of the League for Archaic Pleasures, whose members masquerade on weekends as medieval lords and ladies and witches and bards. Farrell's refusal to deny the evidence of his senses makes him an unusually reliable guide to events that keep stretching the conventional coordinates of reality. Mr. Beagle (whose 1968 novel ''The Last Unicorn'' is generally considered a landmark in modern fantastic literature) knows how to use language to keep the reader from peering too closely at the machinery of a tale. Here, he pokes fun at the ''Classic Comics talk'' of his make-believe medievalists, before drawing blood from the all too solid flesh beneath their outlandish gear. Farrell's encounters with supernatural forces are cunningly described in metaphors lifted from modern science. When Sia is compelled to reveal her power, the epiphany is manifested as ''a single blinding silence like a star, endlessly devouring itself.'' The plot unfolds at a languorous but inexorable pace that seems entirely appropriate to the matters at hand. The ending manages to be satisfying in itself while pointing the way to a sequel that I, for one, eagerly await. THE SHORE OF WOMEN by Pamela Sargent (Crown, $16.95) is a post-nuclear-holocaust parable that takes a postfeminist look at male-female relationships. In the wake of a devastating atomic war, a new human society has emerged: exclusively female cities with a somewhat shaky grasp of technology are surrounded by a wilderness in which all-male bands of hunters roam. Since the females despise the ''primitive'' males, yet need fresh sperm to reproduce, they have imposed on the hunters a Goddess Cult whose principal sacrament is artificially induced ejaculation. Ms. Sargent works hard to induce the reader to accept this rather implausible future history as background for the story she chooses to tell: the step-by-step reawakening of sexual love between Birana, a young woman who has been expelled from a city, and Arvil, a young man who has lost the comradeship of his band. The story is told in alternating first-person chapters by Birana and Arvil (with occasional interpolations by Laissa, a friend of Birana's who stays behind in the city and becomes a historian). By remaining inside the minds of the protagonists, Ms. Sargent can keep the focus on the details of their relationship, as socially inculcated prejudices give way slowly before the pressure of biological urges. The operative word is slowly. In their search for a place where they can realize their destiny, Arvil and Birana sample a variety of social structures, each of which is described in exhaustive detail. I applaud Ms. Sargent's ambition and admire the way she has unflinchingly pursued the logic of her vision; her sensitive handling of the homosexual relationships among both women and men (in their respective single-sex communities) is especially fine. But in the long run the voices of Birana and Arvil are not quite distinctive enough to sustain our interest in their slow, painful progress toward a new sexual and social order. MIRRORSHADES (Arbor House, $16.95.) is subtitled ''The Cyberpunk Anthology.'' The editor, Bruce Sterling, explains in a brief preface that ''cyberpunk'' is a new science-fiction esthetic for our time, born of ''an unholy alliance of the technical world and the world of organized dissent - the underground world of pop culture, visionary fluidity, and street-level anarchy. . . . Cyberpunk comes from the realm where the computer hacker and the rocker overlap, a cultural Petri dish where writhing gene lines splice.'' A few pages of this word-hype and it is a relief to turn to the stories themselves, 12 in all, the earliest originally published in 1981, the most recent in 1986. What we find is a science fiction that takes the runaway power of science and technology for granted, that plays paranoia straight and finds comic relief in anarchy, and that gives center stage to characters who ask of the future not, ''What's new under the sun?'' but ''What's in it for me?'' The best known exponent of cyberpunk is William Gibson, whose 1985 novel ''Neuromancer'' (a computer hacker's power fantasy) won every major prize in science fiction. Unfortunately, Mr. Gibson is represented in ''Mirrorshades'' by a minor story (circa 1981) and a pedestrian collaboration with Mr. Sterling. The sense of on-the-edge excitement that made ''Neuromancer'' so popular is captured here in a long story called ''Freezone'' by John Shirley. Ignore the first three pages of background synopsis, which is as unconvincing as it is unnecessary; the rest of the story offers a funny yet affectionate portrait of the artist as a hard-core rock ''classicist'' who cannot stand the ''new'' artificial music and who is drawn into an assassination plot because he likes the looks of one of the plotters: ''Bare breasts, nipples pierced with thin screws. . . . Her makeup looked like a spin painting. Her teeth were filed. Rickenharp swallowed hard, looking at her. Damn, she was his type.'' Rudy Rucker, a mathematician by trade, contributes a breezy ''Tales of Houdini'' that tickles the imagination and then vanishes without a trace. In a zany collaboration called ''Mozart in Mirrorshades,'' Lewis Shiner and Mr. Sterling see time travel as opening the door for exploitation of the earth's resources on a scale undreamed of by today's most ruthless corporate polluters; the serious-slapstick style of this tale reminded me of the movie ''Brazil.'' There are also some good, if unremarkable, stories by Tom Maddox, Pat Cadigan, Mr. Shiner solo, James Patrick Kelly and Paul Di Filippo, any of which could have appeared in science fiction magazines any time in the last 25 years without benefit of the ''cyberpunk'' label. Mirrorshades are, of course, mirrored sunglasses that hide the wearer's eyes from the gaze of passers-by. TALES FROM THE PLANET EARTH (St. Martin's, $15.95) is a theme anthology with a difference. The cover and title page inform us that the book was ''created by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull,'' a curious phrase to describe a volume of 19 short stories by 18 different authors from 17 different countries. However, the phrase is not entirely inaccurate. In 1984 Mr. Pohl published a short story in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction about an alien invasion of earth in which the extraterrestrials do not arrive here bodily but simply take over the minds of susceptible humans, who are forced to do the extraterrestrials' dirty work - which involves, mainly, dividing up the earth's resources for shipment to the stars. Since Mr. Pohl is also one of the founders of World SF, an international organization of writers, editors and other professionals in the science fiction field, he and Miss Hull (who subsequently became Mrs. Pohl) decided to solicit stories on the same theme - the ''invasion'' of earth by telepathic aliens - from writers in other countries. As might be expected, the resulting anthology is conceptually and stylistically uneven. Some of the stories are based on turns of plot that have become cliches in Western science fiction. Others are too earnestly didactic, seizing the opportunity to lecture a wide readership on such topics as national pride and international brotherhood. The entries from Brazil, Italy, Bulgaria, Uruguay, Poland, China (two stories), West Germany and Japan had to be translated into English, with varying degrees of success. But the theme of telepathic invasion is wonderfully elastic, lending itself to all sorts of speculations about the humiliations and pleasures of possession, about relationships both parasitic and symbiotic, about the difficulties of communicating across cultural and linguistic boundaries. And despite all the obstacles, some of the stories are memorable, in particular ''The Legend of the Paper Spaceship'' by Tetsu Yano (Japan), ''On the Inside Track'' by Karl Michael Armer (West Germany), ''The Owl of Bear Island'' by Jon Bing (Norway), ''Infestation'' by Brian W. Aldiss (England) and ''Fiddling for Water Buffaloes'' by Somtow Sucharitkul (Thailand).

98-> BLACKBOARD NOTES; Factory-Guaranteed Teachers
WHEN Dan Woods was graduated from Nebraska's Doane College, he received a degree in education and his employer received a warranty testifying to his abilities. The warranty is the answer of some schools of education to complaints about the poor quality of teachers being turned out. Eager to prove their graduates' value, some schools have enlisted in a quality-assurance program, begun by Doane in 1983 and since adopted by institutions as large as the University of Virginia and Oregon State. ''It's like the warranty consumers receive with electrical appliances,'' explains Dr. Robert Barr, dean of education at Oregon State. The warranties promise the college's support if a teacher graduate has difficulty adjusting to classroom stress or if he confronts subject matter he was not trained to teach. Dr. Barr says that school principals are offered a variety of services if they hire Oregon State graduates. These include on-site observation and comment by education professors, and funds for substitute teachers so new staff members can attend workshops aimed at improving their skills. If necessary, the college will pay the teacher's tuition for an additional semester back at school. ''It's all part of the great consumer revolt that's happening in other areas of life,'' Dr. Barr says. ''There's so much anxiety about the poor quality of education these days, we're going to have to do things of this nature. Human warranties may be gimmicky, but they work.'' More colleges have included quality assurance programs in their curriculums as a result of recent public scrutiny, says Penelope Early, director of policy development for the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. ''More and more states are suggesting there's an obligation to teachers after graduation,'' says Ms. Early. ''They are also revising their programs to better prepare teachers. Unpreparedness is the most common complaint about their quality.'' Some states, including Alabama and Oregon, are investigating the possibility of statewide warranty programs. Specific terms of a warranty vary from college to college. Oregon State extends its warranties throughout the nation; most colleges set geographical limits. Schools also offer different time limits. At the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, warranties last three years, but at Virginia they end after the teacher's first year in the classroom. At least 15 schools now use the program. ''In order to issue a warranty,'' said James Cooper, dean of education at Virginia, ''you have to be confident of the graduates; otherwise you're going to be spending a lot of time and money putting out brush fires.'' Virginia has used warrantied teachers for two years and none of the schools that hired its graduates has yet taken advantage of the services. ''Everything else being equal, I'd rather hire a student with a warranty,'' says Harley Rector, assistant principal of Norfolk Junior High School in Norfolk, Neb. Two years ago he hired Mr. Woods, fresh out of Doane. ''He was one of the finest first-year teachers we ever had,'' Mr. Rector says. ''He didn't need the warranty, but we used it anyway. We just wanted to try it out.'' During Mr. Woods's first school year a Doane professor observed his classes and polished his techniques. Mr. Woods, a 24-year-old science teacher, says the warranty gave him confidence. He felt he had somewhere to turn.

99-> Salvador State of Siege to Expire
A state of siege that had been in effect almost continuously since 1980 has expired after members of the conservative minority in the National Assembly, who are on strike, refused to act on a bill to renew the restrictions. The emergency measures, which had generally been renewed every 30 days but had lapsed several times before for brief periods, expired at midnight Thursday. The state of siege, first declared March 6, 1980, to help the Government combat leftist guerrillas, gave the Government wide powers to censor the press, ban public meetings and hold military trials for people accused of rebel activity. It also gave security agencies wide powers of search and arrest. Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the military chiefs of staff, warned that allowing the state of siege to lapse would endanger national security. But Hugo Carrillo, a conservative who is the assembly's deputy speaker, said: ''The world is definitely not going to fall down because of the state of siege. In the seven years it has been in force it has solved nothing.'' A two-thirds majority of the 60-member assembly was required to renew the state of siege. The 25 legislators from three opposition parties, joined by two independent deputies, refused to act on the bill as part of a 12-day-old strike to pressure President Jose Napoleon Duarte to cancel new economic austerity measures. President Duarte's Christian Democratic Party holds 33 seats. The striking legislators are attending assembly sessions but refuse to vote or take part in debates.

100-> BEIRUT ABDUCTORS LINKED TO SUSPECT
Senior officials in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government said today that they believed the kidnappers of two West Germans in West Beirut were probably relatives of a Lebanese imprisoned in Frankfurt who is wanted by the United States for hijacking and murder. The Lebanese, Mohammed Ali Hamadei, 22 years old, was arrested last week in Frankfurt after liquid explosives were found in his luggage. Apparently in retaliation for his arrest -and evidently to prevent his extradition to the United States - gunmen kidnapped two West German business representatives this week in West Beirut. On Thursday night, in a television debate in connection with the parliamentary elections on Sunday, Mr. Kohl suggested that the Government had made contact with the kidnappers of the two West Germans, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt. News agency reports from Beirut today suggested that two more West Germans had apparently been kidnapped. But at a news conference, Mr. Kohl said he could not confirm the reports, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman this evening dismissed the reports. The reported abductions appear to be having litle or no effect on the outcome of the elections, in which the Chancellor's center-right coalition is expected to be returned to office. While the two German hostages are front-page news here, there appears to be nothing approaching the national outrage that has erupted in the United States over the hostage issue. One German official said today that he thought American television was making more out of the missing Germans than the West German media. After the kidnapping of Mr. Cordes and Mr. Schmidt, the Government urged West Germans still in West Beirut to leave the heavily Moslem side of the city, and a number of them were escorted to the relative safety of East Beirut by Lebanese gendarmes. Although West Germany maintains a 35-member embassy in East Beirut, it has been steadily reducing its presence in Lebanon, closing a high school and the Goethe Institute office in Beirut. German businessmen have been in and out of Lebanon in recent months but the resident West German population is thought to be quite small. The Foreign Ministry here said it believed that most of the people in Lebanon holding German passports were Lebanese or spouses of Lebanese, mostly women. According to sources, Mr. Hamadei lived in West Germany from 1982 to 1984, and is the father of the daughter of a German woman who lives in the city of Saarlouis. He had originally applied for political asylum but withdrew his application when he returned to Beirut in 1984. Fingerprints Implicate Suspect Mr. Hamadei's fingerprints on his asylum application enabled investigators to confirm that he was one of three hijackers of a Trans World Airlines plane in June 1985, according to the sources. An American passenger, a Navy diver, was killed at Beirut airport at the outset of the hijacking, which led to 17 days of captivity for 39 American passengers. The kidnappers were widely linked to the Party of God faction in Lebanon, a pro-Iranian group that seeks to radicalize Lebanon's downtrodden Shiite Moslem population and provoke armed confrontations with Israel. They ultimately surrendered their hostages to the more moderate Amal group of Nabih Berri. According to a West German official, a brother of Mr. Hamadei is a high-ranking figure in the Party of God security network. Another brother, Ali Abbas Hamadei, is a West German citizen who is married to a German woman who lives in Merzig in the Saarland. West German investigators say they believe they may be dealing with a tightly organized and fiercely loyal family clan similar to the one that French authorities say was responsible for a series of bombings in Paris last Sepember. It is believed that the bombings were the work of a Christian Maronite clan trying to free Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, a terrorist leader. No Quick Solutions Sought The Reagan Administration has made it clear that it would like to have Mohammed Ali Hamadei extradited as swiftly as possible. But the Kohl Government, fearing for the lives of the two kidnapped Germans, has indicated that it is in no hurry to reach any quick decision in the case. Officials say the Justice Ministry in Bonn is in the process of forwarding the American extradition request to the Frankfurt prosecutor's office which, in consultation with a local court, must check to see that it is in order. If the papers are deemed acceptable, Mr. Hamadei still has the option under West German law to appeal an extradition order, a step that could drag out the proceeding for several weeks. Once the appeals channel is exhausted, the final decision must be made by the Kohl Government. Under the extradition treaty between the United States and West Germany, Bonn would be obliged to dispatch Mr. Hamadei to Washington if the American request was considered valid. But a complicated legal procedure gives the Kohl Government ample possibilities to delay extradition for months. One delaying option would be to prosecute Mr. Hamadei here for smuggling explosives into West Germany on a false passport. ----Envoy Meets With Leader BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 23 (AP)-Ambassador Antonius Eitel of West Germany met today with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the reputed spiritual guide of the Party of God, which has taken responsibility for the abductions of two West Germans. Meanwhile, Terry Waite, an envoy of the Anglican Church, negotiated for a fourth day with captors of American hostages. A Lebanese Christian radio station said the release of two American captives, Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, was imminent, but officials cast doubt on the report.

To the Editor: ''Through Alaska On Your Own'' by Virginia Van der Veer Hamilton (Travel, Dec. 21) reminded me of a favorite part of my own independent trip through the Canadian Rockies and Alaska last summer. We took a local train from Anchorage to Denali National Park and saw a rich variety of people and scenes: professional couples heading for their weekend cabins, retired railroad workers debarking at their front doors, a horde of people netting king salmon in a stream, a load-carrying huskie and its owner, mail tossed out the window at specific locations and an anxious-looking man from California, holding a fishing pole, who hoped his son hadn't forgotten to meet him. We were allowed to roam through the train. Residents couldn't imagine that tourists would want to take the slower train. It was a wonderful trip and I recommend it.

102-> SUPER BOWL XXI; Willhite Matches Elway Step for Step
Where Elway goes, he goes. ''I take care of him and make sure nobody takes real cheap shots at him,'' says Gerald Willhite, a 5-foot-10-inch running back who has football's equivalent of eyes in the back of his head. For when the peripatetic John Elway, the Denver quarterback, takes off, sprinting for cover or trying to make a play, he is unprotected except for the 200-pound Willhite. Elway's scrambling gives the Broncos' offense a special dimension. But most people who have analyzed Super Bowl XXI believe that Elway will often be chased out of the pocket by someone on the Giants, most likely Lawrence Taylor. ''I use a scramble technique,'' Willhite says. ''Once I see him leave the pocket, I become his personal bodyguard.'' Personal bodyguard is not a common job description in the National Football League. But it is one that Willhite has adapted to because he had no other choice. They're Not Perfect The Broncos' running backs are not ''your prototype halfbacks or fullbacks,'' concedes their coach, Nick Nicolau. That is a polite way of saying that the halfback, Sammy Winder, is not a game-breaking speedster and Willhite, the fullback, is not a burly barreler. ''In our scheme, we need a guy who's more than one-dimensional,'' Nicolau says. ''He has to block a Lawrence Taylor once in a while. But if we had one of those 200-pound fullbacks blocking Taylor all the time, we'd go bankrupt.'' Thus, the Broncos generated 94 more passes than running plays during the season - even though Elway himself was the team's third-leading rusher. He took off 52 times for 257 yards. But that doesn't count the times he improvised, throwing on the run, or throwing off the wrong foot while stepping backward. This sort of thing isn't practiced. ''How can you practice him scrambling?'' Willhite says. ''It's just instinctive for me.'' This is not what Willhite had in mind at San Jose State, where he was the most productive ballcarrier in the school's history. He also caught 77 passes as a senior. The Broncos took him as their first draft pick of 1982. He ran only 70 times as a rookie, but averaged 5 yards a carry. So why isn't he running more now? Role He Had to Accept ''Basically, I had an off season my second year,'' Willhite says, ''and it kind of dictated what I could do -blocking and pass-catching. I had no choice. They gave me that role and I had to accept it.'' He suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out half the season. But if he wasn't a productive runner, he still could catch passes. This season, he led the Broncos with 64 receptions, 19 more than anyone else. When Willhite scores, he has a signature: the back flip. ''I've been doing flips since I was 9 or 10 years old,'' he says. ''I never had any gymnastic training. I started doing it because everyone was doing something and I felt stupid because I wasn't doing nothing. I said, what can I do? And nobody was doing the flip.'' He hints he could be doing that flip against the Giants, even though he is suffering from a groin pull that required extra taping during practice. ''I think we can run. With an offensive line as fired up as our is, we can run.'' If so, it would change not only the Broncos' image, it could change the direction of the game, a game in which few believe the Broncos' runners can hurt the Giants' defense. Then again, Willhite may not have to run forward. He merely may have to run in front of Elway, keeping Giants from the quarterback. The Broncos continued their weeklong easy approach to the game, amusing themselves in practice today by wearing one another's jerseys and imitating their playing styles. ''They're very much relaxed. I think that's important,'' said Dan Reeves, their head coach. . . . An 11-foot-high, 6-foot-long bronco made of old car bumpers guards the front entrance of the Broncos' headquarters here. It was put together by a 25-year-old Colorado artist named Sean Guerrero. But he didn't have the football team in mind when he assembled the sculpture from materials found at a place called Denver Bumper, using such artifacts as chrome bumpers from a '57 Chevy, '52 Buick, and '60 Ford. . . . Elway was standing outside his stretch limousine one night, impatient and ready to go. ''We're going to see Eddie Murphy filming 'Beverly Hills Cop,' '' he explained, referring to the sequel to the hit movie. ''But we're waiting for Keith Bishop.'' Bishop, the Pro Bowl left guard, had to run back to his room for his videotape camera. He is shooting footage for CBS-TV.

103-> Can RICO Help?
To the Editor: Prof. Robert Blakey asserts that if Congress had passed the reform of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) proposed last session, financier Ivan Boesky would no longer have been subject to a treble-damage RICO civil action (''The Public's Secret Weapon vs. Boesky,'' Forum, Dec. 7). Professor Blakey implies that Bronx political leader Stanley Friedman also would have secured immunity from RICO liability. Neither assertion is accurate. Mr. Boesky has agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and Mr. Friedman already has been convicted of criminal violations. The bill that almost passed Congress carefully preserved treble-damage liability for any person convicted of criminal violations of RICO-related laws. The record made before Congress last session demonstrates that civil RICO has become principally a tool to intimidate legitimate businesses, labor organizations, and professionals. Moreover, in the Supreme Court decision referred to by Professor Blakey, the Court recognized that ''. . . in its private civil version, RICO is evolving into something quite different from the original conception of its enactors.'' A reasonable balance should be struck between the need to protect victims of organized criminal activity and the need to end the misuse of this statute in ordinary commercial disputes. We intend to seek action early in the new session of Congress to enact much needed relief from a statute run amok. PHILIP B. CHENOK President, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants New York, Dec. 17

JANICE POWELL wanted to become a track star like Edwin Moses when she was in high school, but she changed her mind when professors at the University of Maryland introduced her to computers in a special science program for minority high school students. Today she is earning straight A's as a computer-science major at Wilberforce University, a black institution in Ohio. Richard Jeeter took an aptitude test in junior high school that indicated he was best suited for a career in interior decorating. But his high school teachers encouraged him to attempt a career in the sciences, and today he is double-majoring in chemistry and biology at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Miss Powell and Mr. Jeeter are the products of an expanding national effort to increase the number of black, Hispanic and American Indian students pursuing science-based careers. Public school systems, colleges and universities and a variety of industries throughout the country have undertaken these efforts to improve the status of minority members in technical and science disciplines because of the severe underrepresentation of minorities in these fields. Blacks and Hispanics choose science and technology fields at a substantially lower rate than average, according to a 1986 study by the National Science Foundation. The study, titled ''Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering,'' found that blacks account for only 2.3 percent of all employed scientists and engineers, though they represent 10 percent of the overall American work force. Hispanics make up 5 percent of all employed persons but account for only 2 percent of all scientists and engineers. Even when they get to college, blacks and Hispanics earn a disproportionately small fraction of the degrees in science and engineering. Blacks and Hispanics in engineering schools, for example, are said to have an attrition rate of about 65 percent compared with about 35 percent for white students. When blacks and Hispanics do obtain science degrees, they are likely to be in the social sciences and psychology. ''The pool of qualified minority candidates is far too low when you consider the substantial, even pervasive role that science and engineering play in our lives and the expected growth in the minority population,'' said Richard F. Neblett, president of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (Nacme). The council is a nonprofit organization founded by large corporations, educators and professional societies to increase the number of underrepresented minorities who graduate from engineering schools. Over the last five years Nacme has distributed about $13 million in financial aid, donated by large companies. In addition, it supervises a host of precollege and university retention programs that try to steer minorities toward science careers. One program, the Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement Program, sponsored by large colleges and universities in California, is run like a sports team. Each high school has a program adviser, or coach, who coordinates game activities such as bridge-building projects and math contests, leads trips to corporations and engineering schools and lines up speakers from engineering companies. ''The students learn to work together as a team on projects and problem sets,'' said Luis A. Miranda, who heads Nacme field services. According to the National Science Foundation report, one of the main reasons blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in these fields is that they participate less often than others in precollege academic programs and advanced math and science courses. The study found, for example, that they were considerably less likely than whites and Asians to have taken courses in calculus, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and chemistry. ''The primary limitation is academic achievement and education at the precollege level,'' Mr. Neblett said. ''There are not enough minority students taking the right courses and being educated appropriately to undertake disciplines as rigorous as pure science and engineering.'' Decisions about majoring in a science should be made as early as junior high school. Many blacks and Hispanics, however, are steered away from college-preparatory tracks by their peers and counselors, who tell them that advanced courses are too difficult for them, Mr. Miranda said. ''Instead of taking physics, chemistry and advanced math, many minority students are encouraged to take softer courses like science of the environment and practical math.'' Mr. Miranda said that in most black and Hispanic districts, counselors were so overburdened with a variety of student problems that they did not have the time to give proper guidance to those capable of handling advanced courses. ''We are trying to change this in our field programs, where we push them to pursue the more difficult courses,'' he added. THE Mid-America Consortium for Engineering and Science Achievement, based at Kansas State University, combines ''gee-whiz'' activities such as science experiments with a strong emphasis on academic achievement. Funded by local universities, school districts and industries, the program relies on advisers at high schools to make sure that students take the appropriate college-prep courses and standardized tests. Tutoring is given to students who earn grades below B. In a recent activity, students at 13 high schools wrote essays describing a nonexistent technology that would contribute to a better world. The winners from each school received watches, and the overall winner received a trip to Epcot Center in Florida. The winning design was a toothbrush for a paraplegic. One minority group, Asian-Americans, has been able to excel in science and math. Almost 5 percent of all employed scientists and engineers in the nation are of Asian heritage, though they represent less than 2 percent of the work force. Many educators attribute their achievements to the traditional Confucian values regarding education prevalent in many Asian families. Some educators see the problem of black and Hispanic underrepresentation in the sciences mainly as one of instruction. ''The biggest criticism is of the quality of education in the ghettos and barrios where there are mainly elderly and very young teachers who are not well rooted in science and advanced math,'' said Lee F. Browne, director of secondary school-relations at the California Institute of Technology. ''No matter how much money you spend motivating and identifying potential science students, you won't improve the numbers and performance of the students unless you improve the quality of teaching directed toward them,'' he said. A chemist, Mr. Browne has headed the Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement Program, the first statewide effort in California to increase minorities in the sciences. Mr. Browne noted the number of students who get A's in math, science and English and then score as low as 340 on a scale of 200 to 800 on certain standardized tests. ''Their teachers say that the kids just had a bad day,'' he added. ''The truth is the kid had never been exposed to the material.'' To improve the numbers, Mr. Browne said that school districts must be willing to pay qualified teachers more to stay in education. ''There are many young people who don't mind going into the inner city, but you have to pay them.'' THE Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, sponsors training programs for math, science and language-arts teachers, who teach black, Hispanic and Indian students in grades 6 to 12. ''We assist teachers in identifying minority students who have an aptitude for science and provide them with curriculum modules that have real-world applications,'' said Carolyn C. Chesnutt, executive director. ''Many teachers who have lost their motivation and are thinking of leaving the classroom are motivated anew when they attend these sessions.'' Because most minority students who decide on technical majors have poor backgrounds in science and math, many colleges and universities have begun programs to bring them up to speed. ''If they are deficient, we hold their hands and bring them along,'' said Dr. Frederick S. Humphries, president of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, at a conference sponsored by the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the Federal Office of Science and Technology. In discussing ways of improving the numbers of blacks in the science fields, Dr. Humphries said that many black colleges had instituted summer programs in which they offer minority members an intense review of advanced mathematics and the physical and biological sciences. He called for more support for black colleges and universities from the Federal Government and from private industry. Black colleges and universities are not alone in their efforts. Engineering schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Instititute of Technology have a variety of programs designed to identify minority high school students with an aptitude for the sciences and offer them academic assistance in completing courses of study at these schools. Dr. David S. Saxon, chairman of M.I.T., said that Ronald E. McNair, the black astronaut who was among the seven crew members killed aboard the space shuttle Challenger last year, completed his undergraduate degree at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and received his doctorate in physics from M.I.T. through one of these programs. ''There are other Ron McNairs out there, and we must continue to give them a chance,'' he said. Upon graduation from college, Janice Powell and Richard Jeeter plan to attend graduate schools. ''When my career-aptitude test told me I was only fit to become an interior decorator, I was outraged,'' said Mr. Jeeter. ''So I decided I would prove that the test was wrong. But I don't think I would be here studying science if my high school teachers had not kept me on track.''

NEW LANDS, NEW MEN America and the Second Great Age of Discovery. By William H. Goetzmann. Illustrated. 528 pp. New York: Viking. $24.95. IN 1967 William H. Goetzmann won the Pulitzer Prize for history and the Francis Parkman Prize for ''Exploration and Empire: The Explorer and the Scientist in the Winning of the American West.'' And his success was deserved. ''Exploration and Empire'' was a brilliant synthesis of wide-ranging scholarship, and a terrific read. For many of us - outside the scholarly establishment - the book marked a true turning in our understanding of the history of the American West. In detailing and dramatizing his investigation of the American West as a place to be scientifically understood (then valued and used - some say exploited - in terms of that understanding), he made us see it as vastly more than a staging ground for the endless series of gunfights delineated in popular mythology. Vividly peopled and rendered, his story dealt with both ideas and adventure, revealing a tradition of relationship between scientific investigation and social consequence in the 19th-century West from the time of Lewis and Clark to John Wesley Powell. In so doing he helped establish in the popular mind the need to seriously and continually reevaluate the ways in which we use our great Western territories in the 20th century. Unfortunately his latest book, ''New Lands, New Men: America and the Second Great Age of Discovery,'' is not so brilliantly worked out. An ambitious and potentially useful undertaking once again, it is an attempt at synthesizing another huge pile of research into the story of what the author describes as ''the emergence of a culture of science which was carried over the globe, just as it had spread into and governed our knowledge and goals in the American West.'' The first great age of discovery, according to the author (and his scheme seems quite bulletproof), dates roughly from Columbus to a time in the 17th century when the post-Renaissance ''Age of Reconnaissance'' (as the historian J. H. Parry called it) came to a climax. The second great age derives from the 17th-century scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, when reason came to be considered the dominant human faculty and progress the dominant human goal. Explorers went out determined to map the earth precisely, along with its riches, peoples and possibilities, determined to come home with measurements and specimens, hard knowledge. As Mr. Goetzmann says, ''History on a vast scale was rediscovered in the nineteenth century - natural history and recorded human history, as well as the prehistory of man.'' In essence he is telling the story of the conquest of the world by scientific method, what he rightly calls ''the emergence of a culture of science.'' SO why does this vast, resonating story, from James Cook in the Pacific to Robert Peary at the North Pole (or not), seem such a falling-off from ''Exploration and Empire''? Part of the problem, no doubt, lies in the fact that we've heard a lot of this before, some of it from Mr. Goetzmann himself. Sections of the book simply rework information from ''Exploration and Empire,'' which could be forgiven if the story were told freshly and well. But while the book is most often brilliantly articulated sentence by sentence, Mr. Goetzmann's narrative sense seems to have deserted him. The storytelling is often haphazard and repetitious. Many pages simply dissolve into a numbing recital of names, dates and places, and the reader is left struggling to find the significance of it all. In the end Mr. Goetzmann says that his book ''should certainly have made clear the broad outlines of a rapidly emerging culture of science that, in its amoral search for empirical truth and laws that will 'work' pragmatically, is taking over the world and washing over countries and cultures more powerfully than the ice floes of the long-sought polar sea.'' If only he had made it clear.

106-> Caroline Jones Is Bride of Peter Galison
Caroline Jones, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Jones of Princeton, N.J., was married last night to Peter Galison, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Gerald Galison of New York. Rabbi Peter Rubinstein performed the ceremony at the One Fifth Avenue restaurant in New York. The bride, who will keep her name professionally, and her husband both graduated from Harvard College. She is a graduate fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center and a doctoral candidate in art history at Stanford University, where he is an associate professor of the history of science and the co-director of the Program in History of Science. Mrs. Galison, formerly assistant director of the Harvard University art museums and of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is the author of ''Modern Art at Harvard,'' published in 1985 by Abbeville Press, and a producer of documentary films. Her father is Stuart Professor of Psychology at Princeton University. Her grandfather the late Edward S. Jones was dean of students at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Mr. Galison received a doctorate in the history of science and theoretical physics from Harvard University. His father is the president of Galison Books in New York, and his mother, Marion Galison, is a social-science teacher at the A. Philip Randolph High School in New York. The bridegroom is a grandson of Milton Bluestein of Palm Beach, Fla., who is retired and was formerly president and chief executive officer of the Plymouth Shops.

107-> Why Asians Succeed Here
No characterization of Asian success in the United States should fail to note that the wave of Asian immigration comes at a point in American political and social history that minimizes the possibility of political and social discrimination (''Why Asians Succeed Here,'' by Robert B. Oxnam, Nov. 30). Statutes on all levels of government are in place. Almost two generations of Americans have grown up and have been educated in a society that places compelling legal and moral disapproval of prejudicial conduct based on nationality, race and religion. Immigration is a central feature of the American experience. We can all be thankful that it has never been as appreciated and admired as it is today. IRVING J. SLOAN Scarsdale, N.Y.

108-> BOAT SHOW; OWNING A NEW BOAT CAN BE EASY AS READY, SET, SIGN
Financing a boat has never been easier. At the National Boat Show, 16 lenders have taken space, ready to write loans on new or used boats for as little as $3,000. Five years ago there were just a handful of lenders, and they wouldn't talk to you unless you were financing a new boat with a loan of more than $25,000. Even though every kind of loan imaginable is being written, including variables, interest caps, floating rates and balloons, most smaller boat loans (under $25,000) are fixed-term, fixed-rate financing. Buyers want to know how their boat fits into their budget, without any surprises. This year, buyers may find that their monthly budget will enable them to finance a bigger boat. That's because interest rates have come down even lower, and boat loans are now being written for longer terms. Lower Monthly Payments Geraldine Waltz, an executive vice president of Essex Credit Corporation, says that at last year's boat show, she made loans at 11.5 percent for a maximum of 15 years. Financing $50,000 resulted in a monthly payment of $584.09. This year, she says, Essex is making loans for 20 years at 9.4 percent. Financing the same $50,000 this way brings the monthly payment down to $462.81. Bankers are learning to like boats. Unlike cars, boats don't depreciate rapidly. In fact, a 10-year-old fiberglass boat, routinely maintained, is probably selling for more today than it did in 1977. And bankers love boaters. Not only is the default rate far lower than for auto loans, but boat owners tend to be better potential bank customers. Greg Proteau, an executive director of the National Marine Bankers Association, says boat owners tend to have a better credit profile and a better net worth. Banks believe that by writing a boat loan, they will be able to sell the customer other bank services. Acting on that belief, Chemical Bank this year wrote a boat loan program tied into checking account services. Fierce Competition With the competition among lenders so fierce, it pays to shop around. ''With all the lenders at the boat show,'' Proteau says, ''you'll quickly get a feel for what is available.'' It may also pay to talk to your tax adviser. While the deductibility of consumer loan interest will be phased out by 1991, smaller boats can be financed, within limitations, as part of a home equity package, with the interest cost fully deductible. Some larger boats may qualify as a second residence. Arthur Goldstein, a tax manager at Arthur Young, quotes from the Internal Revenue Code regulations on vacation homes: ''The term dwelling unit includes . . . (a) boat . . . which provides basic living accommodations, such as sleeping space, toilet and cooking facilities.'' Howard Sample, a New York partner at Price Waterhouse, says Treasury Department regulations specifically cite the example of a ''boat suitable for overnight use.'' ''This is generally interpreted,'' he says, ''to mean a boat with a berth, a head and a galley.'' In other words, don't expect to qualify a 16-foot fishing boat just because you occasionally spend the night out trolling for blues. Sample points out that qualification as a second dwelling means that you can deduct both the interest cost and any personal property tax. He goes on to say that although there is no authority yet, you have a good argument that the interest cost on a condo boat slip would also qualify for exemption. In short, even though the sales tax deduction has been lost, boat owners have fared better than most taxpayers. Geraldine Waltz, of Essex Credit, thinks tax revision may help the boat industry. ''People who enjoyed boating but never owned a boat, may buy one now,'' she says. ''They've lost most of their other deductions.''

110-> PUGILISTS' PROGRESS
THE MANLY ART Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America. By Elliott J. Gorn. Illustrated. 316 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. $24.95. ''CLOSEST thing to dyin' that I know of'' was Muhammad Ali's memorable description of the ''thrilla in Manila,'' in which he and Joe Frazier fought 14 fierce, wearying rounds. His words characterize even more fittingly many of the bare-knuckle prizefights Elliott J. Gorn recounts in his exemplary book, ''The Manly Art.'' In 1889, for instance, the great John L. Sullivan defended his title in 100-degree heat under the Mississippi sun. The challenger, Jake Kilrain, could boast that the famous gunfighter (and future sportswriter) Bat Masterson was on his side, but he had little else going for him. Sullivan stalked and battered him for over two hours - more ring time than Gerry Cooney has had in the past seven years. Mr. Gorn, who teaches American studies at Miami University in Ohio, has written a social history as well as a sporting one. Gloveless boxing was illegal in most parts of the United States in the 19th century, but it stayed half a step ahead of the law and became hugely popular among the working class. It had flourished in England in the late 1700's, relished by the rich and the rabble alike; nevertheless, the rising middle class there declared war on gambling, drinking and ''public bloodletting'' and drove the sport underground. British boxers sailed for America, a country with a far less carefree aristocracy for whom pugilism was a sign of Old World dissipation, ''more pernicious than horse racing or the theater.'' It was left to men of the lower classes (especially Irish immigrants and their sons) to thumb their noses at the bourgeoisie and make boxing, in the words of a New York politician, ''one of the fashionable abominations of our loafer-ridden city.'' The author captures both the fights and the fighters. In an 1842 match Thomas McCoy, about to become the late Thomas McCoy, had been knocked down 80 times; he ordered his seconds to ''nurse - nurse me and I'll whip him yet.'' Also engaging are the quotations from newspapers, which routinely denounced boxing while reporting round-by-round details. Pity the New York Tribune writer at a fight in 1857, who found himself among ''the most vicious congregation of roughs that was ever witnessed in a Christian City.''

111-> Manila Orders Four Officers Arrested For Part in Attacks
The Chief of Staff, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, ordered the arrest today of a general and three officers said to have been involved in armed attacks this week. The order came as the armed forces were put on alert against further disturbances after a two-day episode in which dissident soldiers took over a broadcast station. General Ramos said 13 officers, 359 enlisted men and 137 civilians were being held after attempts to seize nine broadcast and military installations. General Ramos said an order had been issued to arest Brig. Gen. Jose Maria Zumel, Col. Rolando Abadilla and other officers. The two men were also involved also in the two-day takeover of the Manila Hotel in July. Also today, Communist rebels issued a statement saying they would ''formally withdraw'' from peace talks with the Government. The peace talks, which are the substantive element in a 60-day cease-fire that ends Feb. 8, had been suspended for a week after negotiators for both sides reported receiving death threats.

112-> U.S. Says Kiev Is Safe For Visits by Tourists
The United States said today that it was safe for Americans to visit Kiev, a city close to the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster last April. The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said the judgment had been made in a report issued by an Energy Department team that visited Kiev in October to assess radiation. The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to open consulates in Kiev and New York, although these plans are yet to be carried out. The report issued today means that the United States could rescind a warning to Americans issued after the Chernobyl accident, he said. The three-man team of experts brought back samples of water, food, foliage and soil for analysis by the Food and Drug Administration.

114-> EAST EUROPEANS MOVING TO ORGANIZE DISSIDENCE
CONTACTS among political dissidents and human rights advocates across the borders of the East European countries are growing in number and intensity. Poles, Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and, to a lesser extent, East Germans and even a few Rumanians have been exchanging views and signing joint appeals. In November, more than 100 dissidents from all five countries signed what they called the Budapest Declaration, proclaiming the 1956 Hungarian uprising as the ''common heritage and inspiration'' of all East European states. The declaration was followed by a less-publicized but equally significant brief that was submitted to the Vienna conference on European security and cooperation. This paper was signed both by East Europeans promoting human rights and representatives of West European peace and disarmament groups. The document asserted the claims of citizens of all countries to organize freely on issues ranging from peace, ecology and labor organizing to resistance to the draft. Some East European dissidents have been establishing vague, albeit not altogether satisfactory, ties with West European peace groups. Most of the East Europeans stress human rights issues, and often they are patronizing toward and merely tolerate the peace groups' disarmament strategies. Still, for the Easterners, links with groups in the West that are the targets of Soviet propaganda and persuasion tend to provide some protection from official harassment. The Budapest and Vienna efforts required considerable organizational skill, reflecting the intensifying, although still largely spontaneous, links that the dissidents have been establishing. ''There has definitely been a change,'' said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a Polish mathematician and the former spokesman of the now-outlawed Solidarity independent union federation. ''Psychologically, there was always the will to cooperate across borders but the technical capabilities lagged behind,'' he added. Now, partly as a result of direct-dial international telephoning and the establishment of links through Western supporters, as well as the possibilities for peaceful protest demonstrated by the Poles during the Solidarity era, contacts are proliferating. Polish underground publishing houses are producing translations of works by Soviet, Hungarian and especially Czechoslovak dissidents. In Czechoslovakia, a more modest operation has printed Polish writers. And Hungarian editors of uncensored work have visited Poland to study clandestine production and distribution methods. Poles Mark Hungarian Uprising An observance in a Roman Catholic church near Warsaw of the 30th anniversary of the Hungarian revolt, and its suppression by Soviet troops, drew 500 people, far more than were able to mark the day publicly in Budapest. A book of poems about the uprising was published clandestinely in Polish and Hungarian. A tablet in both languages was dedicated, commemorating those killed or wounded in battles with Soviet tanks. At the same time, ''Largo Desolato,'' a play by Vaclaw Havel, the frequently imprisoned Czechoslovak writer and leader of the Charter 77 human rights group, is being performed in Warsaw homes by a theatrical troupe. In Budapest, directors have staged Polish plays about the cities now known as Lvov and Vilnius, which passed from Polish to Soviet control. Hungarian audiences liken the play's nostalgic references to their own yearnings for Transylvania, the province under Rumanian control, where the Hungarian language and culture and, according to many, the safety of ethnic Hungarians are threatened. Furthermore, emigre groups in the West, who have usually concentrated on their own separate concerns, are establishing closer links. The American periodical, Across Frontiers, and the London-based East-West Foundation publish the work of East European rights activists. And Kontinent, a magazine founded with West German backing by Soviet emigres, has various nationalities represented on its editorial board. Cooperation across East European frontiers ''is significant but it is moving at an uneven pace because of different levels of repression,'' Mr. Onyszkiewicz said. The Bucharest Government punishes Rumanians who are caught even speaking with foreigners. In Bulgaria, the closest Soviet ally, no significant dissident movement, apart from the oppressed Turkish minority, seems to have coalesced. Several activists cited the effort to assemble signatures for the Budapest Declaration, which said that the Budapest rebellion, the 1968 ''Prague spring'' and the Polish Solidarity era all expressed the yearnings for change. When issued, the document carried the names of 54 Hungarians, 28 Poles, 24 Czechoslovaks and 16 East Germans. In fact, while the text was being quietly circulated, some 500 Poles volunteered to sign it. There were many hurt feelings as the Polish group was winnowed down so as not to overwhelm the others. ''The Poles have the strongest opposition and they have the freest hand,'' said a Hungarian organizer. He added that perhaps the most remarkable achievement of the declaration was that three Rumanians later added their names, thus risking severe punishment. ''As Poles, we have to avoid setting the pace without considering the dangers that exist elsewhere,'' said Mr. Onyszkiewicz. ''A few years ago, some of our dissidents met with our Czechoslovak friends from Charter 77 at a border town. For our people, it meant two days of questioning. For the Czechs it meant months and even years in prison.''

116-> O'CONNOR EULOGIZES NUN SLAIN AT SHELTER IN BRONX
As snow fell yesterday outside St. Pius V Roman Catholic Church in the South Bronx, the nave was lighted with candles and filled with voices in prayer at a funeral mass for a 65-year-old nun stabbed last Monday. Calling her death in service to the poor and the needy ''a form of martyrdom,'' John Cardinal O'Connor celebrated the mass in Spanish and English for Sister Virginia Thomann at the small church at 420 East 149th Street, which she had faithfully attended. The nun, a Sister of the Good Shepherd, was killed at a South Bronx residence for the employed homeless, My Brother's Place, where she had worked since last fall. A former resident of the shelter who had been dismissed for taking drugs, Norberto Torres, 19 years old, was charged Tuesday in the murder. The Cardinal told more than 150 worshipers, including city officials and Catholic clergy, that it was the ''contempt for a person that pervades our society'' that contributed to homelessness. He called on government to address the problem, adding, ''If we had any sense, we would be struggling to reorder our society.'' Compassion and Piety Cardinal O'Connor also offered his ''personal prayer and hope'' that the slaying would not deter others from working with the homeless. For many at the church in the Mott Haven section, Sister Virginia - a newcomer to the South Bronx - was remembered solely as a kindly face seen at mass. Those who knew her characterized her as a private woman whose trusting compassion and deep piety was extraordinary, even for someone from a religious cloister. ''She was one of the great little people who made no noise and did great things,'' said John Fitzgibbons, a neighbor of Sister Virginia's mother in Ardmore, Pa. ''Caring for others was her only care,'' said Sister Mary Inez, a member of the Sisters of Mercy who worked with Sister Virginia at an infirmary for Jesuit priests in Philadelphia for more than 10 years. Requested Work in Bronx Born in the coal-mining area of Cambria County, Pa., Sister Virginia became a registered nurse before joining the Good Shepherd Order, which, for almost 400 years, has been dedicated to sheltering and aiding the poor, particularly women. After many years of working in health and child care in the Philadelphia area, Sister Virginia applied to work at My Brother's Place at 342 Willis Avenue, according to Mark Redmond, program director of the organization. Excited at the prospect of working with the young and the needy, Sister Virginia was ready to go to the shelter sight unseen, Mr. Redmond recalled. ''I kept saying, 'But this is in the South Bronx,' '' he added. 'Saints' of the Streets She worked with the 10 residents at the house with dedication, love and, even, innocent attention while working as a bookkeeper and counselor, Mr. Redmond said. ''Even though they were street kids,'' he said, ''she always described them as saints.'' Relations between Sister Virginia and Mr. Torres were described as amicable by staff members. ''He is also a victim,'' the assistant pastor at St. Pius, the Rev. Peter Ensenat, said. ''And Sister would feel the same way.'' Private services were held yesterday in the Philadelphia area.

118-> BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, JANUARY 31, 1987
The Economy The nation's trade deficit plunged 44 percent in December, to $10.6 billion, the lowest level since March 1985. The strong improvement resulted entirely from a drop in imports. It more than offset the sharp deterioration in November, when the gap by which imports exceeded exports soared to an unprecedented $19.2 billion. Today's figures, plus a downward revision for November, made Government officials and private analysts more confident that the debilitating trade deficit has at least stabilized and perhaps even begun its long-expected decline. [ Page 1. ] Prices received by farmers for raw products dropped an average of 1.7 percent in January. [ 36. ] Funds for a giant $6 billion atom smasher will be sought by the Reagan Administration. [ 1. ] Companies LTV lost $453.4 million in the fourth quarter, despite rising steel profits, because of a newly reported $600 milliion charge related to expected suits by creditors. The results increased LTV's total losses for the year to $3.25 billion, by far the biggest loss ever recorded by an American company for an entire year. The large charge relates to contracts that LTV broke when it filed for bankruptcy protection last July. [ 33. ] United Air plans to lay off 1,016 employees, or nearly a third of its corporate staff, starting next week. Most of the layoffs will be made at United's headquarters.

119-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER; The Frustration Factor in Vacation-Club Bargains
Searching for the best deal in a cruise or tour can be a laborious and frustrating chore that may make you wonder, in the end, whether any money saved was worth the effort. There are clubs, for example, that offer deep discounts if you book on short notice. With the encouragement of cruise and tour operators - whose names are usually withheld from club advertising - they sell space that otherwise would probably go empty. Club rates are generally far lower than the original rates for the tour or cruise. But when you make reservations, you cannot always be sure of what you are buying, and you may have difficulty getting answers to important questions. For the last year, using my home address and not identifying myself as a travel writer, I have been a member of several discount clubs, including Discount Travel International of Narberth, Pa. (for information, 800-824-4000); Moments Notice of New York (212-486-0503); Stand-Buys Ltd. of Chicago (800-255-0200), and Vacations to Go of Houston (800-624-7338; in Texas, 800-833-8047). With information from the clubs' telephone hot lines, which offer tape-recorded listings of current offerings, and from their reservations numbers, where further details, including ship names, are available, cruise offerings were compared last month. A typical finding involved the Dec. 13 departure of Commodore Cruise Line's Caribe 1 on a seven-night Caribbean cruise out of Miami. It was offered by Discount Travel International (D.T.I.) at $779 a person for an inside cabin, based on two occupants, and $799 outside. Stand-Buys offered the same sailing at $795 inside and $919 outside. D.T.I. said its inside cabins were in the ship's categories 7 through 10 and its outside in categories 3 through 6; Stand-Buys did not specify. A spokesman for Commodore said all the cabins D.T.I. offered had two lower beds and embraced neither the cheapest nor most expensive aboard ship. She said normal rates on that sailing for categories 7 through 10 were $995 to $1,045 a person and categories 3 through 6 from $1,095 to $1,145. This sailing was also offered by the Cruise Line, a Miami travel agency that specializes in cruise discounting (800-327-3021; in Florida, 800-443-7447). It quoted $789 inside and $829 outside - slightly above D.T.I.'s rates - but promised, for those prices, some of the best cabins still available. If all these figures seem confusing, they are. The discount clubs are inconsistent in how they describe their offerings. Some give the category of cabin, others do not; some do with some of their listings but not with all. Also, within a group of categories, say 7 through 10 on the Caribe 1, there can be a significant variety of accommodations and prices. Therefore, although discount clubs may indeed offer genuine bargains, it can be extremely difficult for a shopper to determine how much of a bargain is involved. Among other cruises on which discounts were recently available were the Dec. 13 departure of Princess Cruises' Pacific Princess on a seven-night Mexican sailing out of Los Angeles, the Dec. 20 departure of Costa Cruises' Costa Riviera on a seven-night Caribbean cruise out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the Jan. 14 sailing of Sun Line Cruises' Stella Solaris on a nine-night Caribbean, Mexican and Panama Canal cruise out of Curacao (reached by air after an overnight stay in New Orleans), every-Monday-in-January sailings of the Bermuda Star Line's Veracruz on five-night Caribbean cruises out of Tampa and the Jan. 16 and 24 departures of Sitmar Cruises' Fairsky on eight-night Caribbean sailings out of Fort Lauderdale. Lawrence R. Fishkin, president of the Cruise Line, said he had booked someone for $1,230 into a Fairsky cabin that normally sold for $2,035 a person. Price comparisons alone do not give a complete picture of what you ought to know about cruise shopping. Other factors to keep in mind include these: * When you buy at short notice, you are usually taking pot luck, with the most desirable accommodations already gone. You may have no choice of cabin assignment and may not know until the last minute what your cabin will be. Travel agencies, unlike short-notice clubs, often begin booking a year or more before departure, when the range is much greater, and can help you find the best-available cabin to suit you. Cruise lines often offer discounts of their own to passengers who commit themselves far in advance. Sometimes they make last-minute discounts retroactive. * Clubs charge dues, generally $35 to $50 a year, and travel agencies do not. * Clubs are essentially order takers with clerks who often have neither the time nor information to advise you about shipboard activities, food, quality of service and the type of passengers that particular cruises attract. * However you buy, it is important to determine whether your fare includes transportation from home and transfers between airport and ship at the city or cities where your cruise begins and ends. * Travel agencies that specialize in cruises sometimes have discount programs for repeat passengers or discounted rates on particular sailings. Shopping for the best deals in air-hotel packages proved inconclusive. Discount clubs' short-notice offerings to the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii, Israel and Brazil were compared with those of Liberty Travel, a major East Coast agency. Often the club rates were slightly lower, but Liberty offered a much broader variety of departures to the same destinations and a greater choice of hotels. To best determine what a club is offering, it is often necessary to listen to a hot-line tape several times, noting carefully whether there is a choice of departure dates and hotels. Hot lines sometimes connect you in the middle of a tape and cut you off before reaching that point again. Often there is no easy way to compare club rates with original prices of tour operators or to determine, even in later conversations with reservations clerks, what airline you will fly, what tour company has set up the package and what type of room you will get at a hotel. Some packages use scheduled flights, others use charters. ''You often get obsolete information,'' said Dana C. Nadel, a New York graduate student whom I asked recently to survey hot-line tapes and club reservations services. ''Some tapes list trips that have already taken place,'' she said, ''or trips that are sold out.'' ''The reservations numbers will often put you on hold right away,'' Miss Nadel said. ''They often make you feel like it's an imposition to ask questions. A great many of the people are simply reading from brochures and you have to wait while they look up any answer.'' If, after completing a phone call with a club reservations clerk, you think of another question and call back, chances are you will be connected with someone else and have to start from the beginning, because your first contact will be on another call. When you deal with a travel agency, you typically consult with one counselor. If you vacation frequently (though perhaps for no more than a long weekend at a time), can make up your mind instantly, can leave home almost right away and are familiar with where you plan to go, joining a discount club may indeed prove fruitful. Whenever you consider short-notice travel, however, be sure to ask about penalties if you cancel and what can be done to avoid them. Payments are often nonrefundable because there simply would not be time for a trip that you cancel to be resold to someone else. Ask about insurance that will reimburse you for cancellation or for any additional expenses that you may incur by cutting a vacation short and returning home. Such insurance is widely available through travel agencies - whether or not you buy your vacations through them - but be aware that it usually covers only medically documented illnesses and has exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

120-> CHILDREN'S BOOKS
MIDNIGHT HOUR ENCORES By Bruce Brooks. 263 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $13.95. (Ages 12 & up) AT 16, Sibilance T. Spooner is a professional cellist. She has won three international music competitions, been a soloist under prominent conductors, performed all over Europe and recorded a few digital albums. When not on tour she lives a comfortable life in Washington with her doting father, Taxi. She has everything a girl could want - except a mother. A few months before she is scheduled to pack her bags for Juilliard, Sibilance announces she is finally ready to meet the woman who discarded her at birth. Taxi drops what he is doing and buys a 20-year-old Volkswagen bus which he equips with military surplus gear: duffel bags, tent, mattress - the works. He's in a frenzy to justify to Sibilance the ideology that permitted his wife to abandon both of them; he wants to make her understand the 60's. Sibilance is not amused. When she, who is accustomed to late-model Volvos and American Tourister suitcases, sniffs at the lumpy green duffels, Taxi suggests their usual formal black luggage wouldn't be ''appropriate'' for this particular journey. ''Appropriate? What are we going to do -invade Cuba?'' his daughter snorts. ''Midnight Hour Encores'' is a narrative in Sibilance's voice; naturally she gives herself all the good lines. She is an arrogant, accomplished child of extraordinary and narrow intelligence; she is a whiz at music, sarcasm and manipulating people, yet does poorly in school, doesn't read books, has no friends and, as it turns out, has deluded herself about her feelings for her nurturing father. Bruce Brooks keeps his heroine's scintillatingly cynical voice consistent throughout, but the tone of this monologue is bound to create difficulties for its intended audience, the MTV generation, one of the objects of his heroine's scorn. It will be difficult for a young reader to cultivate sympathy for a character so flashily contemptuous of pop culture. Most teen-agers don't know the Debussy Quartet from the Ravel; most probably don't care, either. But as Sibilance rattles along snottily, using musical jargon miles beyond the comprehension of the average young adult, she sounds tauntingly superior. This is bound to be off-putting and frequently bewildering. Early in the story, for example, she makes a casual, derogatory comment about ''Ma doing the Bach suites.'' True, that is precisely how a real child-cellist would have articulated the phrase, but most American teen-agers won't have heard of Yo-Yo Ma and will probably deduce that Sibilance is talking about her missing mother - who has been mentioned already on the dust jacket and in the story. Van Halen fans aside, there does exist a substantial pool of classically trained students who would relish a novel that reflects their rarefied milieu so unapologetically, but unfortunately ''Midnight Hour Encores'' suffers from inconsistencies sure to alienate the musical child, too. Sibilance blithely states, ''the circle of international music critics puts me about third or fourth in the world right now,'' then proceeds to specify today's most renowned cellists (to whom she considers herself superior). This is an outrageous assertion, even for the most egomaniacal of Juilliard freshmen. Sibilance claims to be a self-made woman, but musically that's impossible. If she has won so many competitions, where is her mentor? Who is her coach? She refers to her beloved first teacher, long dead - but who has helped her get to Brussels, Prague and Rome? No matter how talented, no 16-year-old blossoms into an artistically consummate world-class instrumentalist on her own. To pretend otherwise is an insult to the discipline, and those who study music know this. CONSPICUOUSLY absent from Sibilance's monologue is any consciousness of the business side of her career. Who has booked all the concerts with the major symphonies? Who has negotiated those recording contracts? In an atmosphere where teen-age virtuosos jockey for positions on prestigious rosters and agents cluster like flies around young talent it is inconceivable that Sibilance could produce such a long monologue with no references to this aspect of her life. Also problematic are the discussions about music which sound researched and tend to flatten the natural drama of the story. When Sibilance and Taxi improvise a tone poem, as an homage to the ''Age of Aquarius,'' it does not seem spontaneous. This is a lengthy, pivotal scene, but dull. In his award-winning first novel, ''The Moves Make the Man,'' Mr. Brooks used similar expository techniques with great success - but he was describing basketball, not musical passages. It might be that sports are intrinsically more exciting on paper than classical music - or, more likely, that the author is more excited by sports. In any case, ''Midnight Hour Encores'' lacks the zip of his earlier work and such listlessness obscures what would have been an engaging story about selfishness, self-exploration and self-discovery. One hopes that Mr. Brooks, who has a keen ear for the adolescent voice, will focus his next attempts on a protagonist less pretentious.

121-> HOCKEY; ISLANDERS LEARN WHY FLYERS ARE NO.1
Beaten again, and by Philadelphia, the team they need to learn how to subdue in order to be contenders for the Patrick Division title, the Islanders showered and dressed slowly, ruminatively. That they were in no hurry to board the bus waiting outside had much to do with its destination: Philadelphia, where this home-and-home series will conclude Sunday night. The Flyers defeated the Islanders, whose game seems to be in an unfavorable holding pattern, by 4-2 this evening. The Islanders have scored three or fewer goals in their last five games, haven't had a victory in three consecutive divisional games, and tonight watched the chasm between themselves and the Flyers widen to 17 points. ''They're riding a strong mental approach to the game,'' said Denis Potvin, ''and we're still stuck with an attitude problem. They go out, tell themselves just to play hard, and they seem to sense that the goals will come. We go out, and we don't feel that same confidence. And we don't get the necessary goals. Besides that, we don't play with the intensity we should have when we know we're playing the best team in the league and that if we aren't intense, we won't win.'' Mike Keenan, the Flyers' coach, said that the work ethic is what has bred his team's success. ''The Oilers are by far the most talented team in the league, and yet we're in first place, and we're there precisely because of our consistency,'' said Keenan. ''Our players accept the responsibility of playing hard every night. It's an accepted and expected attitude.'' Familiar Face in Goal In the opening moments of the game, the Islanders put the pressure on Chico Resch, who was appearing in just his sixth game of the season and his first against his former teammates this season. After Bryan Trottier had won a faceoff in the Flyer zone, Ken Leiter sent a pass to Gord Dineen just inside the blue line, and Dineen took three strides and slammed a 45-foot slap shot into the top of the net 1 minute 59 seconds into the game. Two minutes into the second period, the Flyers, suddenly more aggressive, popped two goals by Billy Smith in a 17-second span, taking a 2-1 lead. Smith, who had given up 12 goals in two previous appearances against the Flyers and was pulled from the nets after allowing them six goals in two periods in a loss Dec. 18, managed to fend off the Flyers for the remainder of the period but was victimized twice more in the final period. Rich Kromm's game-tying goal was quickly nullified as Tim Kerr and Murray Craven put the Flyers in front to stay, 4-2.

122-> GOOD SEX AT HOME IN ANCIENT ROME
THE CARE OF THE SELF Volume Three of The History of Sexuality. By Michel Foucault. Translated by Robert Hurley. 279 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $18.95. FOUCAULT: A CRITICAL READER Edited by David Couzens Hoy. 246 pp. New York: Basil Blackwell. Cloth, $45. Paper, $14.95. ''THE CARE OF THE SELF'' is presumably the last whole work from Michel Foucault's hand to appear in English, although the remaining volume of his ''History of Sexuality,'' unfinished at his death, may yet be brought out in both French and English. This is why ''Foucault: A Critical Reader'' can bill itself as ''the first major assessment'': edited by David Couzens Hoy, who teaches philosophy at the University of California at Santa Cruz, it is the first collection of essays based on the entire extant corpus of Foucault's work - including interviews in the press, a laudable innovation in scholarly research techniques, especially in this context. Although Mr. Hoy's ''Critical Reader'' does not break much new ground, his introduction and 13 essays by scholars in fields ranging from philosophy to sociology do offer a good survey of the many epistemological controversies and approaches Foucault inspired or exacerbated. Some of the contributors were friends who agreed with Foucault; some were critics, who here continue long-standing opposition. The collection will enable long-time Foucault readers to condense and organize some of their thoughts and will help the uninitiated to appreciate the evolution of and context for difficult works like ''The Care of the Self.'' Ultimately, however, the latter, adequately translated by Robert Hurley, may be a better introduction (and memorial) to the perplexities of Foucault's extraordinary genius than any critical assessment. Initially, the reader of the third volume of ''The History of Sexuality'' will feel more at home in its social landscape than he did in those of the earlier volumes of the series. The culture of imperial Rome in the first centuries of the Christian era appears, through Foucault's eyes, almost uncannily familiar. Its population, like that of the industrial West in the 1980's, is obsessed with personal health and the care of the body. Pop medical authorities cater to this preoccupation by providing guides to diet, exercise, sex and regimen that seem surprisingly modern - down to such fine points as the recommendation to eat a lot of bran. Unlike the disconcerting Greeks, whose philosophy is so provocative and whose domestic arrangements -with their cloistered wives and inexplicable penchant for homosexuality - seem so bizarre and alien, the Romans pose few ethical problems, and they idealize conjugal union and nuclear families as the norm of erotic fulfillment. (The problem presented by ''boys'' does not even appear in the book until the end, by which point its difficulties are easily contained and compartmentalized in Foucault's schema.) This world and its concept of sexuality are even introduced through the discussion of imperial manuals of dream analysis - a stunning parallel to Freudian erotic-dream analysis, which one might have thought uniquely modern. The book's central argument is that Rome represented and effected a transition between the sexuality of the ancient world (Greece, discussed in the previous volume) and that of Christian Europe. In the former, sexual ethics and politics were organized around axes of social power and domination, and understandable largely in terms of hierarchical systems of interpersonal relation. Romans, by contrast, evince a more solipsistic focus. The issue for them is the self rather than the household or city or the demands of philosophy: how to employ sexuality so as to maximize the self's health, well-being, happiness. There are enough hints here about the unpublished fourth volume on early Christianity that one can reasonably infer its thesis: this preoccupation with the well-being of the self becomes the basis for a Christian ethics in which the salvation of the individual soul is the fulcrum of moral activity and thought; Roman advice about how to optimize health and happiness is transformed into absolute rules about how to behave to attain salvation. This is an ingenious, if not original, formulation, and there is much to it. ''The Care of the Self'' is quite accurate in depicting a greater emphasis on conjugal eros and affection in imperial Rome than there had been in Europe before or would be long after (under Christian influence eros would hardly be allowed in marriage at all); and Foucault rightly affirms recent arguments by the French historian Paul Veyne and others that the apparent disjunction between Roman hedonism and Christian asceticism is an illusion. ''The Care of the Self'' shares with the writings on which it draws the characteristic of being carefully constructed, exquisitely reasoned and internally cogent, but oblivious of and irrelevant to the ordinary human beings whose sexuality it purportedly treats. Apart from a reference to Pliny and a few others, its analysis is based entirely on learned writings by specialists in two fields, medicine and philosophy: the dream book of Artemidorus; medical texts of Galen, Aurelianus and Oribasius (who? even classicists might ask); philosophical writings of Epictetus, Musonius Rufus, and Plutarch; and the dialogue on love dubiously attributed to Lucian. It is ironic that this arcane and bloodless approach to sexuality should be adopted by the writer who so brilliantly persuaded his readers in the past that ''what we take to be rational, the bearer of truth, is rooted in domination, subjugation, the relationship of forces - in a word, power,'' as Arnold I. Davidson, a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, puts it in his essay in ''A Critical Reader.'' One could perhaps make sense of this if Foucault argued that these authors represent the ruling classes, and that the socially powerful through their discourse and articulations shaped the sexual attitudes and experiences of the rest of the population; or that the particular texts chosen themselves reflected or determined some reality. But in fact no such argument is made, and at several points Foucault notes in passing that his texts are not even representative. This is true: despite its ostensible parallel to Freud, for example, Artemidorus' dream book had no influence either on the sexuality of the age or on subsequent discourse about it. The interpretation of dreams was a recondite specialty, about as influential as urology journals today. To argue that this is the result of Foucault's intention to write intellectual history misses the point, as does the historian Mark Poster's observation, in his essay ''Foucault and the Tyranny of Greece,'' that it results from the ''brilliant manoeuvre'' of focusing not on general codes of conduct but on the ways in which sex was ''a problem for the individual in his or her effort to lead a moral life.'' In earlier works (for example, ''Discipline and Punish'') Foucault showed quite convincingly how the social manipulation of ideas and language affected individual lives. Here he offers no indication -not even his own conviction, much less evidence - that the trends he discusses affected either the society at large or any individuals other than the writers. Is this then a ''genealogy'' of modern texts on sexuality? An ''archeology'' not of human sexuality but of writing about human sexuality? It would be hard to pin down, over the span of his writings, what Foucault meant by these characteristic and seminal terms. Most of the essays in the ''Critical Reader'' attempt to do so at some point; Ian Hacking (of the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, Victoria College, University of Toronto) and Barry Smart (of the Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield) make it the focus of their articles, and Mr. Poster addresses it specifically in the context of history, all without a clear resolution - doubtless in part because Foucault's own meanings for them evolved over time. But ''The Care of the Self'' could hardly represent either, in any intelligible sense. The almost total absence of a female perspective in a study of human sexuality creates such a profound distortion that the subject becomes effectively incomprehensible, even if masculine myopia makes it difficult to recognize this. THE relationship between the reality of conjugal unions and both the Greek and the Roman power elite's discourse about them - cause? effect? parallel? tangent? - would have constituted a splendid subject for the kind of analysis of power and language at which Foucault was better than almost any other modern writer. But the opportunity is forsaken, as is the chance to analyze the relationship of taboo, cultural fear and biological necessity to learned philosophical and medical thought. I kept hoping that after credulously repeating the elaborate justifications and rationalizations of Hellenistic philosophers and doctors about medical and philosophical reasons for not having intercourse naked or during menstruation or in daylight, Foucault would note that these same taboos occur in many other cultures without such intellectual rationales, and that this raises interesting questions about cause and effect. But no: the rationales are simply reported, discussed and enshrined as if they sprang Minerva-like from the minds of philosophers, and the docile population, moved by their evident veracity, adopted them. This is the more disappointing because, in the few places where Foucault chooses to address the broader context, he does so brilliantly (that is, in the very general and brief remarks on politics in Part Three, Chapter Two, or on the public aspects of marriage in Part Five, Chapter One). It would not be fair, indeed, to suggest that Foucault's own understanding of the sexuality of the period was based exclusively on the texts he discusses: he read widely and rarely makes an error of fact. But this hardly helps the reader to understand what sort of ''archeology'' is offered in a work treating ''human sexuality'' on the basis of a half-dozen specialized texts written by men about how men should organize their conjugal lives to maximize their happiness. Two explanations occur to me. By canonizing these texts as a kind of ''patristics'' (both a sacred literature and a statement of the authority conferred by age and gender) of human sexuality, Foucault may have been making a wry comment on truth as a scholarly artifact; or the vastness and complexity of sexuality in Rome may have seemed to him not reducible to comprehensive treatment, so he simply excerpted and selected texts to make the points he considered important without even trying to explain their context. The two are not incompatible, and either or both would constitute a worthy epistemological riddle from the author of so many previous challenges to the way we understand thought, language, history and their interaction.

124-> SHOPPER'S WORLD; BANFF'S RICH VEIN OF NATIVE CRAFTS
Banff, the resort in the Canadian Rockies long acclaimed for its natural beauty, has over the last decade or so emerged as a center for native arts and crafts. Shops emphasizing Canadiana, from Eskimo carvings to bronze sculptures, from paintings to jewelry incorporating native stones, have been profilerating along Banff Avenue, in the arcades off it and in the cavernous regions of the Banff Springs Hotel, which alone boasts more than 30 boutiques. A case in point is Canada House (403-762-3757), with perhaps the largest collection of prints by Canadian artists in the country. ''Certainly in western Canada I believe we represent more artists with greater depth of inventory than any gallery I've been in,'' says Peter McCaffrey, who founded the gallery at Caribou and Bear Streets, a block off Banff Avenue, 12 years ago. Then there is Marika, the jewelry shop representing Canadian goldsmiths that his wife, Marika McCaffrey, opened two years later in the Clock Tower Village Mall at 112 Banff Avenue (403-762-2678). The McCaffreys typify the trend that has made Banff a shopping destination not just for tourists but also for residents of Alberta. At Canada House customers can flip through the flashers of prints in limited editions divided into three categories - native Indian, Inuit, as the Eskimo are known in Canada, and artists of primarily European descent. Prints, though, constitute just a small portion of the stock, which includes original oils and watercolors, paper casts, Inuit and Indian carvings, bronze sculptures and jewelry. There is a story behind most of the items, which Mr. McCaffrey and his staff are happy to tell. Appliqued wall hangings made by the Inuit of wool duffel cloth might be written off as typical tourist items. But there is a historical precedent. The Inuit, who used appliqued hide dividers in their igloos and tents, have substituted the brightly colored cloth that the white man traded for skins; it is both easier to pack and lighter than hides. But they continue to use traditional hunting and fishing designs and Shamanistic transformations. The hangings, signed with Inuit syllabics, range from $72 to $578 depending on their size and complexity. (All prices given here are in United States dollars.) Most are from the Baker Lake area. Availability of the lyme grass baskets made by Inuit of the Ungava district in Arctic Quebec fluctuates, depending, they will tell you at Canada House, on the harvest of the grass, which grows to a maximum of six inches. The baskets, many with lids and soapstone handles, are watertight ($127 to $434). The Inuit are perhaps best known for their carvings in soapstone, whalebone and walrus tusk that are considered an art form rather than a craft and are priced accordingly. Large pieces at Canada House cost $7,229 to $8,674. The gallery also has soapstone carvings by the Thomas family, Iroquois Indians of southern Ontario, who leave parts of their work unpolished for ''a very nice difference in texture,'' as Mr. McCaffrey puts it. The work of Benjamin Thomas, the master carver of the family, has been presented to Queen Elizabeth and other heads of state around the world. The Thomases use key elements from Indian mythology in their carvings, which range from $36 to $217. Jewelry at Canada House is mostly Indian work and includes sterling silver and gold pendants and pins by the Kwakiutl and Haida work in argillite, a black stone traditionally used for carving totem poles. There is also a 39-inch totem pole here with abalone shell inlay by Rufus Moody. At $20,964, it is the most expensive piece in stock. The gallery has a strong holding of works by Alberta artists; mountain scenes and animals are particularly popular. The foremost artist working in bronze is Don Toney, whose ''Ski Run,'' in an edition of 12, is priced at $1,807. Design is of paramount importance at Marika, where Marika McCaffrey has assembled work by a talented group of contemporary goldsmiths, some of them winners of international awards. One-of-a-kind pieces at Marika include works by Varouj, Thomas Alt, Nicky Senator, Andrew Costen and Eugene Tuchel. Nino Djambazian's tiny 18-karat gold figures of animals and Inuit hunters set his work apart as clearly Canadian. Averaging an inch to nearly two inches in height, these pieces can be worn as pendants or displayed as free-standing sculptures. Some are placed on an iceberg of fluorite crystals in the shop. Prices range from $130 for a tiny seal to $578 for a man fending off a bear's attack. The English-born Andrew Costen has a particularly close relationship with the shop. He is associated with the McCaffreys' daughter, Edith McCaffrey, in Bustopher Goldsmiths in Vancouver and also designs unique pieces for Marika as well as small ornaments produced in quantity, such as a maple-leaf pin with a diamond dewdrop and snow-flake pins and pendants in 14-karat gold. This jewelry is priced from $145 to $217. The shop carries jewelry set with Canadian jade mined in British Columbia and ammolite, a gemstone with an iridescence similar to an opal from the Drumheller, Alberta, area. The pieces are chosen for their originality of design and not only because they make use of native stones. A butterfly pin with red and orange ammolite body and gossamer golden wings costs $372. A pendant with a textured gold maple leaf on one side that reverses to a plain jade disk is $16. While prices at Marika can climb to $14,460 for a major commission in 18-karat gold with diamonds, there are many modestly priced pieces. Both McCaffrey shops are open daily year round, except for Christmas, New Year's Day and Easter, from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. June through September, and from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. the rest of the year. Other shops worth a visit: The Quest at 105 Banff Avenue since 1958 (403-762-2722) has established a reputation for authentic crafts in a variety of media from all over Canada. ''Except,'' said Jos Storm, the owner, ''Prince Edward Island. That bothers me.'' A popular item here is the Yukon parka made by members of an Indian cooperative at $430. This calf-length garment consisting of an outer wind shell of cotton-nylon poplin worn over a wool duffel parka with hood, sleeves and hem edged with fur, is guaranteed to protect against Arctic cold. It comes in red, blue, gray, brown or dusty rose decorated with appliques of moose, geese or dog sleds in contrasting colors. The price range for items offered at the Quest is wide: from $1.60 for a ceramic cookie press to $2,168 for a tapestry (5 feet 11 inches by 5 feet) by Andrew and Johanna Subda depicting Canmore Valley in the fall. The Quest is closed Sunday. Wood is the specialty at Nijinska's, owned and run by Thomas Kouk and his wife, Natasha Kouk, a former dancer with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. At this two-year-old shop in the Harmony Lane Mall at 111 Banff Avenue (403-762-5006), 90 to 95 percent of the stock is made in Canada. Of particular interest are the inlaid wooden bookends, candlesticks, lazy susans and trivets made by Donna and Mark Sinclair of Langley, British Columbia, and the marquetry work by Dave, an Albertan who learned the intricate technique from his grandfather. His pieces, made from as many as 35 different kinds of wood, range from $9.35 for small ornamental plaques to $43 for elaborate bowls. They depict the Alberta wildrose, the official flower of the province, as well as rustic cabins against the craggy background of mountain peaks. The natural colors and grain patterns of many different woods are used like a painter's palette to provide contrast for picture details. The Sinclairs' work sells from $16 for a letter holder to $72 for a jewelry box; bookends and mirrors are available for $36. Connie Kowalevich opened Creations at Caribou Corner, 204 Banff Avenue (403-762-4442), just over a year ago. The works of the artists and artisans from across Canada that she represents are sold exclusively in her shop. Among the notable objects for sale here are the works of the glass blowers Martha Henry and Bob Held, both of Calgary and already established in their field before they became associated with the shop. Art Deco perfume bottles by Ms. Henry were presented to the Princess of Wales as a wedding gift; goblets by Mr. Held were selected for the governor-general's table. The Henry paperweights, perfume bottles and vases range from $36 to $145. Also popular at Creations are the Bennett Boxes, crafted of contrasting woods by Ken and Pat Bennett of Toronto to house treasures of all sorts. Prices: $29 to $542. The Hudson's Bay Company has had a stake in Banff longer than most. Sir George Simpson, governor of the company, paid the first recorded visit to the town site in 1841. The Bay, at 125 Banff Avenue (403-762-5525), can be depended upon for a selection of small Inuit soapstone carvings in the $72-to-$253 range as well as the heavy Cowichan sweaters hand-knit by the Indians on Vancouver Island. In natural grays, browns and white, these sell for around $115. Also in demand here are the traditional white woolen blankets with yellow, red, green and blue stripes and the warm coats and jackets made from them. The blankets start at $115 for twin or 3 1/2-point size, the points denoting the number of beaver pelts historically traded for the blanket, and cost as much as $217 for the 8-point size. A number of other shops in Banff also sell native arts and crafts. A discerning eye can spot, amid the gimcrack souvenirs, authentic Indian knitwear and well-made Canadian gift items. Nearly all of the shops are open daily.

125-> NUCLEAR ALARM STIRS HONG KONG ACTIVISM
A NUCLEAR plant under construction in China just 30 miles from Hong Kong is generating enormous heat in this crowded British territory. The project, which is not scheduled for completion until 1992, has already aroused a political typhoon and caused tension between Hong Kong and its vast neighbor to the north. No one in Hong Kong paid much attention to China's proposal to build the nuclear plant at Daya Bay when it was first discussed early in this decade. But in the last several months, after the accident in April at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union, Hong Kong residents have been distressed at the prospect of such a facility on their doorstep. Perhaps even more fundamentally, the situation raised new doubts about whether China can be trusted after it absorbs Hong Kong in 1997. If China does not heed the British colony's wishes now, some say, why should it pay attention to such concerns after the territory becomes a part of the motherland? A Chinese official in Hong Kong grimaced at that logic. ''A lot of resources already have been committed to the project,'' he said. ''China says, 'Why should we give it up because of a lot of people who don't know about nuclear power?' It's a very difficult situation for China.'' Of course, Hong Kong has been gripped by political events in the past. In the late 1960's the colony was shaken by riots sponsored by admirers of Mao Zedong, the late Chinese leader. But Daya Bay marked the first time that many Hong Kong residents had signed a petition or taken a controversial stand. The Hong Kong Government, led by a British-appointed governor, is also in an awkward position. At first it refused to release a 1984 study it commissioned to examine the Daya Bay proposal. Later the Government backed down and released part of that report. This unusual concession to public opinion hurt the antinuclear campaign; the report strongly favored the plant. ''A lot of people think if they can't get the plumbing right in Peking, how can they get nuclear power right,'' said Peter B. Harris, chairman of the political science department at Hong Kong University. Like many others, he believes that concern over the Daya Bay plant has forced Hong Kong for almost the first time to take a substantial interest in politics. Normally apathetic Hong Kong residents have rallied against the project, and 20 percent of the territory's 5.5 million residents have signed a petition objecting to it. ''The middle class woke up,'' explained Albert W.Y. Chan, a social worker and politician. Mr. Chan says that Daya Bay has for the first time created a political system based on mass participation, not small interest groups. Professor Harris agrees: ''There are signs that a political consciousness is beginning to emerge for the first time. In politics, you've taken the cork out of the bottle, and you won't be able to put it back again.'' British Engines ''Hong Kong people are quite reluctant to take a stance, especially on a political issue,'' explained the Rev. Fung Chi-Wood, a 30-year-old Anglican who is leading the campaign against the Daya Bay plant. Despite the protests and opinion polls showing that most Hong Kong residents favor a halt or delay in the construction of the plant, neither Hong Kong's Government nor Britain's seems to have done anything to dissuade China. Indeed, some Hong Kong residents charge that Britain has accepted the risk to Hong Kong because a British company will supply turbines for the $28-billion plant. Pushed into a defensive alliance, Britain, China and Hong Kong all assert that the plant will be safe, that it is sufficiently far from Hong Kong and that it will be the cheapest source of power. Southern China is desperately short of electricity, to the point that industrial growth must be curtailed, and Hong Kong is expected to face a shortage in the next decade. While 70 percent of Daya Bay's output will be sold to a Hong Kong utility, some will be left to ease the shortage in the area around Canton, China. The Daya Bay protests may not be enough to stop the nuclear plant, but they are likely to reverberate through Hong Kong's emerging political system. Proponents of direct elections to choose territorial leaders say their movement has gained support as a result of the nuclear controversy.

126-> BRIDGE; WHAT PRICE FAME?
In the year 1697 a tall young man named Peter, but not yet the Great, had some trouble in the Netherlands: He was mobbed by curious Dutch citizens who did not respect his wish for anonymity and privacy. When the Emperor of Russia sailed his boat on the IJssel, other craft would accost him. In a fury he drove away a mail-boat by throwing empty bottles at the captain's head, an unusual form of naval warfare. Last year, General Romadonovsky had a similar problem in the City of Atlanta. The General, or rather the actor who played that role in the television miniseries ''Peter the Great,'' was surrounded by women while competing in the National Swiss Teams at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals. These were not kibitzers interested in the bidding and play, but fans anxious to get as close as possible to Omar Sharif. He resisted the temptation to react in the violent manner of his Emperor, but eventually ventured a mild protest: ''Ladies, I have posed for photographs and signed autographs for you. But I came here to play bridge and I'd be grateful if you would allow my teammates to reach the table so that I can find out whether we have qualified for tomorrow's play.'' There was some evidence to suggest that the unfavorable circumstances had an impact on Sharif's technical performance. On the diagramed deal he spotted an unusual play too late. As South he had a problem when his partner opened one no-trump, showing 15-17 points, and East overcalled two hearts. He needed a way to invite game in spades, which can be done with the Lebensold convention: two no-trump, requiring three clubs with three spades to follow. As this convention was not in the partnership repertoire he had to jump to three spades, a slight overbid. The contract was not a good one, with three top losers and problems in both minor suits, but it was far from hopeless after the lead of the heart jack. The heart king was marked with East, so South won with the ace in dummy. He cashed the king and ace of spades and led a club, won by East's king. The shift was to a diamond, and Sharif cleared his first hurdle in fine style by playing the queen. He judged correctly that West held the ace and jack, so it was important to prevent a diamond continuation. Playing any other diamond would have been fatal, for West would have covered to force the king, and the road would have been open for the defense to take four tricks. West took the ace and led a club, won by East and producing this position after a diamond lead to dummy's king: South now pinned his hopes on scoring the club ten as well as the queen, which would permit him to discard a diamond from the dummy. This play led to defeat, and he later apologized for missing an unusual possibility. ''If I had led the heart queen in the six-card ending,'' he suggested, ''I would have forced West to protect hearts and caught him in a triple squeeze.'' His expert teammates accepted the apology and failed to come to his analytical rescue. As he saw later, the squeeze is an illusion: West can throw a diamond if South leads one trump, and can afford to unguard any suit if the last trump is led. Sharif did not consider blaming his gallery of intrusive fans for his slight post-mortem error. But one can hope that fans will be more considerate if, as is likely, he plays in New York late in 1987 during the Broadway run of ''Interpreters.'' Perhaps the solution is to avoid advance publicity, of his play rather than the play; but that did not help Peter the Great.

127-> Ms. McGrath Is Affianced
The engagement of Mary Denise McGrath to George D. Donovan Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs. Donovan of Andover, Mass., has been announced by the future bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs. Terence J. McGrath of Chappaqua, N.Y. Ms. McGrath, a 1982 graduate of Holy Cross College, is assistant director of student services at the New England Board of Higher Education in Boston. Her father is a dentist in Pleasantville, N.Y. Her mother, Anne R. McGrath, is a vice president of McGregor Travel in Greenwich, Conn. The future bride is a granddaughter of the late Christopher C. McGrath, a former surrogate of Bronx County and a former United States Representative from the northeastern Bronx. Mr. Donovan, who is studying for an M.B.A. degree at the University of New Hampshire's Whittemore School of Business and Economics, graduated from Holy Cross in 1982 and served as a lieutenant in the Navy. His father and mother, Marie K. Donovan, are principals in George D. Donovan & Sons, an importing firm in Andover.

130-> WHAT'S NEW IN PLEASURE BOATING
THE America's Cup challenge has brought new excitement - and new revenue - to sailing, and focused the eyes of the boating world on Australia. But the overwhelming message of the New York National Boat Show that winds up today at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center is that America's weekend sailors are still motorboat-mad. While sailboats command a section, powerboats overwhemingly dominate the exhibit floor. In an industry that last year produced $14.5 billion in retail sales, a dichotomy exists between the thriving powerboat sector and the struggling sailboat market, which holds only a 5 percent share of sales, down from 25 percent 15 years ago. All this comes at a time when conditions are ideal for boat buyers. Interest rates and fuel prices are down, and many potential customers are flush with newly realized capital gains. This, of course, makes industry officials optimistic. ''We're going to have a good year,'' said Jeff W. Napier, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, which produced the show. Privately, however, many in the industry wonder if the long-term outlook is so unabashedly rosy, given the upheavals of recent years. The swing in the sailboat market is the most dramatic example. Unit sales in 1985 were down 74 percent from their 1974 peak, according to N.M.M.A. figures. The drop has forced some sailboat manufacturers into powerboat lines, and driven many others out of business. ''A few years ago sail was growing more rapidly than power and power was having a somewhat difficult time,'' said Roger Hewson, president of Sabre Yachts, a sailboat manufacturer, and president of the Sailing Industry Association of the N.M.M.A. ''Now the cycles have reversed.'' Imports have also had an adverse effect on the industry. The $350 million worth of boats imported in 1985 is a 76 percent rise over two years earlier, says the N.M.M.A. Exports declined 15 percent during the same period. All this has put the industry on a roller coaster. In 1974, the industry's peak year, 729,000 boats were sold. Since then, the numbers have fallen in most years, though the slide appears to have stopped recently. Total sales, aided mostly by powerboats, have almost returned to the record levels of the 70's, with 660,000 boats sold last year. In particular, the powerboat makers are singing a happy tune. They have picked up market share and appear to have a healthier future. According to N.M.M.A. officials, the general outlook is bright for the long term. Those people most apt to buy boats are between 35 and 55, an age group that is increasing. ''More than that, the baby-boom people are different from previous generations'' in a critical respect, Mr. Napier said. ''They're a lot more activity- and outdoor-oriented. That fits our purchaser demographics perfectly.''

131-> METRO DATELINE; Stein Criticizes City On Poor Children
City Council President Andrew J. Stein said yesterday that the ''steadily deteriorating condition of the city's poorest children'' presented a ''moral disaster for our city.'' While the corruption scandal last year caused the city ''to lose money,'' he said at a luncheon meeting of the City Club of New York, ''in this scandal we are losing precious lives.'' Mr. Stein said such programs as education and foster care were not receiving enough support from the city. ''New York becomes even richer, while its children suffer increasing levels of misery,'' he said. A spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, Barbara Thompson, said the city had no comment on Mr. Stein's assertions. ''What we are witnessing,'' Mr. Stein told the meeting at the City University of New York Graduate Center on West 42d Street, ''is a process of decay that could unravel our social fabric and damage our most precious democratic institutions, particularly our public schools,'' where he said one third of all children are on welfare. Mr. Stein, a political rival of Mayor Koch, called the Koch administration's response to the problem ''timid and inadequate.'' He also accused the city government of ''continued bungling'' in its attempts to strengthen Special Services for Children division.

135-> SEOUL TO INVESTIGATE MAN'S DEATH IN POLICE CUSTODY
The South Korean Government has announced that it will investigate the treatment of a college student who died when he was being questioned by the police last week. Relatives and others say the student may have been tortured, and the United States Government has expressed concern about the matter. Two human rights organizations, Asia Watch and the Korean Institute for Human Rights, asserted Friday that the student might have died of wounds sustained from torture and that a Government investigation was not likely to produce credible findings. In Washington, the State Department, without directly criticizing the Government of President Chun Doo Hwan, said, ''We deplore torture as a violation of human rights.'' In a statement, it also said: ''We note that the Korean authorities have already begun an investigation. We expect it to be thorough and that they will apply the full force of the law should there be wrongdoings uncovered.'' The 21-year-old student, Park Jung Chul, was in his third year at Seoul National University, where he studied linguistics. He was arrested Wednesday morning and taken to the police anti-Communist bureau, where he was being questioned about purported anti-Government activities, according to the Government account. Government officials said Mr. Park fainted during questioning and died of shock later that day. But Mr. Park's relatives, who were present at his autopsy, told reporters in Seoul that they had seen skin wounds and other evidence of torture. The Seoul police chief announced Friday that the case would be investigated. Human rights campaigners in Seoul and the United States called for an independent investigation. ''When the branch of government that is responsible for the questionable action is the same that undertakes to conduct an investigation, we don't have any confidence that the official results will be credible,'' said Eric Schwartz, program director at Asia Watch, a human rights organization with offices in New York and Washington. The rights groups said Mr. Park's death was the first case in which a suspect had died in police custody during the Chun administration, although in the past prisoners had died in the custody of military security officials. ''We don't know for certain that Mr. Park was tortured,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''But we have very strong evidence that beating and mistreatment of prisoners and suspects is routine rather than the exception. It's surprising that this hasn't happened before.'' South Korean political dissidents and human rights organizations have asserted that many cases of torture and beatings have occurred at the police anti-Communist bureau, the interrogation center where Mr. Park was taken. Government officials have repeatedly denied assertions of torture but have refused to allow human rights organizations to inspect the building. Reports of torture and beatings of students, labor leaders and political dissidents have been frequent in the last year. In 1986, Amnesty International issued appeals for more than 70 cases in which it said it believed torture had been or might have been used. The Government has denied that it uses torture. ''There have been very few Government investigations into torture,'' said Kathleen Smith, a spokesman for Amnesty International. ''And there have been few instances where investigations that were set up revealed torture. During the last six years, Amnesty International is not aware of any prosecution of officials alleged to have ill-treated political detainees.'' South Korean security forces have arrested hundreds of students and opposition party members since a crackdown started last October. Government officials released many of them, but others have been charged under the National Security Act for actions supportive of North Korea. Dissidents assert that they seek to hold President Chun to his pledge to restore democracy.

The Giants held their final practice at home today before their Super Bowl game Jan. 25 against the Denver Broncos in Pasadena, Calif. For part of the 90-minute practice, the defense worked against the Broncos' two-tight-end plays. The special teams worked on field goals, and there was a broad review of running and passing situations. The Giants will fly from Newark Airport at noon Sunday in a chartered DC8 for the Long Beach (Calif.) Airport, a short drive from their hotel in Costa Mesa. After the players check in at the hotel, they will be free until Monday's meetings and practice. Coach Bill Parcells said he had been inundated with telephone calls from friends, acquaintances and fans seeking Super Bowl tickets. He said there were 97 calls last Monday, the day after the Giants earned a Super Bowl berth. Two calls were from former teammates at Wichita State. Parcells said he had tickets for them, but he said his tickets were gone now. Contribution for Denver American Express Company, under pressure to contribute to a parade in Denver as it promised it would for one in New York City, has agreed to donate $75,000 to a Denver Broncos' celebration. In addition, the company will donate a fixed percentage from all credit-card sales in Colorado this week. American Express has agreed to help underwrite a New York parade for $250,000.

All that racing around can bring on a big appetite, which is where sidewalk food vendors come in handy.

It may not be the greatest thing for the digestion, but eating on the run does leave more time for other things. Taxi! Taxi!

142-> POP: BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE
OF the many socially engaged singer-songwriters who emerged out of the folk music movement of the 1960's, few have offered a more clearly focused vision of injustice than Buffy Sainte-Marie, the longtime crusader for American Indian rights. Ms. Sainte-Marie's diatribes begin with facts rather than sentiments. ''Now That the Buffalo's Gone'' levels a cool, scrupulously controlled fury at documented Governmental betrayal of American Indians. The power of her pacifist anthem, ''Universal Soldier,'' lies in its central ironic notion of soldiers fighting to put an end to war. Although Ms. Sainte-Marie, who appeared at the Bottom Line on Wednesday, didn't offer any recent songs as powerful as her best 60's broadsides, her performances of vintage material still rang with a chilling clarity. And the singer's harsh folk alto with its buzzing vibrato and her clenched, emphatic delivery underscored her attitude of undiminished resolve. The other side of Ms. Sainte-Marie's songwriting is a romantic mysticism that blends symbolism from American Indian religious rites into a folk-pop context. Pieces of that imagery infused songs like ''Star Walker'' and ''Eagle Man'' with an occult intensity. The singer also delivered her best-known love songs, ''Until It's Time for You to Go,'' and ''Up Where We Belong'' (a collaboration with Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche) with a blunt, clipped directness that effectively undercut any sentimentality.

145-> MY BROTHER THE WITCH
TONGUES OF FLAME By Tim Parks. 137 pp. New York: Grove Press. $14.95. MANY novels about adolescence contain scenes in which the young protagonist is placed under extreme peer pressure, commonly involving drugs or cigarettes or premature sex acts. In ''Tongues of Flame,'' the hero undergoes peer pressure of an unusual variety: to fit in, 15-year-old Richard Bowen must start speaking in tongues. All around him people are doing it; wherever he looks, it seems, someone is muttering nonsense words in a corner. Tim Parks opens his first novel in 1968, in the wealthy, suburban English vicarage where Richard's father presides over an ordinary, peaceful parish. Enter Donald Rolandson, a young curate who brings with him the ''Sword of the Spirit,'' and with it a frenzy of religious fanaticism. Soon everyone in the parish has become obsessed - everyone, that is, except Richard. ''Tongues of Flame'' - initially rejected by six agents and 20 publishers, and last year's winner of England's Somerset Maugham Award for writers under 35 - is a hilarious and original portrait of a young boy grappling with good and evil, two concepts that have been instilled in him by his fanatical but well-intentioned father. According to Richard's father, Satan is lurking everywhere, manifesting himself in ''Chairman Mao, the Russians, the Vietnamese, the left-wing of the Labour Party, the unions, drugs, pornography, sex outside marriage, and certain types of modern music.'' Mr. Parks has a good eye for period detail, and he gives us a convincing illustration of British provincial life at a time when the world, according to Richard, was characterized by ''an explosion of new hairstyles and new religions.'' Although larger, political turbulence is alluded to throughout, for Richard the most visible turbulence can be found in his own home, where the drama is of a religious and, as it turns out, a sexual nature. Sexuality is embodied by Richard's older brother, Adrian, who openly sneers at the fanaticism that surrounds him and seeks fulfillment instead in smoking pot and sleeping with his girlfriend. As the Bowen family becomes more and more obsessed with big ideas about Satan, Adrian's way of life is tolerated less and less. Adrian is a complicated character; the author doesn't fall prey to making him a sensitive young rebel of the James Dean school, but instead fleshes Adrian out, making him both nihilist and hedonist, and a force to reckon with. Adrian is extremely bright, with ''a mind like a scalpel,'' according to Mr. Bowen, who goes on to tell his older son that he should treat Richard and his sister, Anna, kindly, for they ''weren't that bright in the end,'' but that everybody is ''equal under God.'' Richard meekly absorbs his father's perception of him, and this helps set Adrian's specialness into relief. To Richard, and finally to everyone in the community, Adrian is extremely powerful. In an ordinary late-60's household, Adrian would be viewed as just another sullen teen-ager with all the accouterments of the breed: long, unkempt hair, loud music and telltale smoke emanating from the bedroom. But in the Bowen household these elements are eventually decoded as ''signs,'' proof that Satan himself lives upstairs. The novel's climactic scenes take place during the church's annual Youth Fellowship house party, a religious retreat for teen-agers held at a ramshackle boarding school. The special guest lecturer this year is Joy Kandinsky, an American evangelist in a pink pantsuit. She tells an impassioned story about a young homosexual man who was eventually ''cured'' through the Lord, and then she goes on to announce that there is someone in the room who is tortured by homosexual longing, and she urges him or her to come forward and be saved. Richard, who throughout the novel has remained curious but neutral about matters both religious and sexual, is forced at this point to examine his Continued on next page entire identity, as well as the identities of those around him. He realizes that he must start to form opinions and choose sides. This realization is heightened by an outright witch hunt, of which Adrian is the quarry. A posse is formed to track down Adrian, who has been openly avoiding lectures and has been having sex with his girlfriend on the grounds of the boarding school. Richard watches in horror as his brother is apprehended, and a ritual exorcism ensues. This scene is perhaps the most powerful in the novel, and we hear a new voice emerging from Richard, one that is fierce and surprising. What happens next feels extraneous, tacked on by the author for the sake of action, when the most interesting action is internal. As one brother is exorcised of ''evil,'' the other brother, in a sense, is exorcised of passivity. ''Tongues of Flame'' approaches the notion of transformation on many levels - religious, sexual, emotional and intellectual. With all his inexperience and timidity throughout much of the book, Richard is a perfect character to embody that idea. Most of the characters in the novel are well drawn, and interact convincingly. The author seems to have had an especially good time inventing Richard's mild and sad mother, whose job it is to sit at the rear of the church and make hand signals at her husband if he isn't speaking loudly enough during a sermon. Also believable is Richard's humorless sister, Anna, who likes to play her guitar and sing ''I Gotta Home in Gloryland That Outshines the Sun'' on the chancel steps. What emerges is a compelling family drama. Like many families, the Bowens live in close quarters yet are, in reality, worlds apart. The gradual shredding of a child's conceptions of his parents and siblings is movingly explored here. What do you do, Tim Parks seems to ask, when you've been saddled with a crazy family? There are no simple answers to this, and it is to the author's credit that he doesn't attempt to give us any. The character of Adrian has not been overglorified; in fact, Adrian is often downright nasty to his younger brother, and difficult to love. Richard Bowen finds himself surrounded by friction, and it is this friction that finally ignites ''Tongues of Flame.'' Soul-Searching Parties Everybody was talking about Satan. Rolandson was talking about him almost non-stop, and I remember he said at the Youth Fellowship on Saturday how Satan was present in the words and music of certain progressive pop groups, called Black Widow and Black Sabbath, who sang about witches and black masses: so all the members of the Youth Fellowship who had bought records by these groups had to bring them into the meetings over the next weeks and have them smashed to smithereens in front of everybody, and the debris was put in the incinerator behind the vestries while we all sang ''Raised on a Dove's Wing'' together, standing on the patch of gravel there in the howling wind. The church started going out more into the community too, . . . sending out nightly parties to knock at every front door in the neighbourhood and invite people to our church. . . . The groups that went out knocking on people's doors were called ''Soul-Searching Parties,'' because they were supposed to be I was always afraid we would run into Adrian on the street, with his Afghan coat and club foot and the cynical small grin.From ''Tongues of Flame.''

146-> INVESTING; Slim Pickings Elsewhere
Outside the financial stocks, definitions of ''undervalued'' must be stretched for many names to surface. One money manager scanned his entire list for a cheap stock before coming back with a verbal shrug, ''None.'' The rare companies with low P/E multiples or large discounts from book value generally have problems that discourage analysts from recommending them. But here are a few offerings that managers cite as undervalued -at least compared with the rest of the market: * Oshkosh Truck, $28, could earn $3 a share in 1987, according to Preston G. Athey, a vice president with the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund. He also likes Giga Tronics, $13, in military electronics, with $5 a share in cash and $1 in earnings. * California Microwave, $9.50, a major bidder for an unmanned reconnaissance military aircraft, caught the eye of Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. He said the company could earn 85 cents a share in fiscal 1988 and estimated ''a point downside risk at the most, and six or seven on the upside.'' * Philips N.V., the Dutch-based maker of entertainment electronics, appealed to Ernest C. Kiehne, who runs the Legg Mason Value Trust. The stock, at $20, goes for about 10 times earnings and has about $115 a share in sales. He also cited CSX, $30, trading at less than 10 times estimates for 1987 net, and General Motors, $68, going for about 7 times earnings, as good long-term values. * The Criterion Group, a fast-growing Texas-based money management firm, looked cheap at $18 to John Johnson, of Johnson, Valliant & Broadfoot, who expects it to earn $2 this year.

147-> TECHNOLOGY/THEOLOGY IN UPDIKE
To the Editor: I was startled to read the description of John Updike's most recent novel, ''Roger's Version,'' in the first paragraph of the Rev. John P. Meier's fine article ''Jesus Among the Historians'' (Dec. 21). The young student pitted against Roger Lambert is not a divinity student but a computer programmer who has worked on computer research projects at the university where Lambert teaches, as the young man tells Lambert on page 18 of the novel. The fact that the young man's expertise lies in the area of computer technology and not in theology is an important feature of the novel. LAUREN A. HAHN Mundelein, Ill.

148-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; What's a Jersey Guy?
Just when everyone here thought nothing more could be said about that game tomorrow, more of nothing was said. It was one more day in which overkill held center stage. After nearly two weeks the end has come to intense pre-game interrogation of the participants with a concentration on analysis and psychoanalysis, on introspection, retrospection and reflection. As well as the circumspect exchange of secrets regarding items from rolling zones (never mind, Mick Jagger) and pulling guards to recipes and what good movies you've seen lately - in other words, a profound dearth of news. Now, finally, the two head coaches of the contending platoons, the Broncos and the Giants, were enlisted to speak at the last news conference before Armageddon. In separate back-to-back engagements in a banquet hall of the Anaheim Marriott, Bill Parcells and Dan Reeves assured the assembled truth-servers and soothsayers that, yes, their teams are ready to go. Yes, there is a high level of intensity. No, neither team is intimidated. ''Yes, we have to be concerned about the Broncos' offense because it contains a multiplicity of things,'' said Parcells. ''No, you don't stop Lawrence Taylor,'' said Reeves, ''you hope you slow him down.'' Someone asked Parcells, ''What's your definition of a Jersey guy?'' ''A guy who lives in New Jersey,'' he said. True, of course, as far as it goes. Aquestion was posed to Reeves concerning deja vu of these two masses (the Giants are said to weigh 10,321 pounds as a group, some 200 pounds heavier than the Broncos): Is there an advantage in one team's having played the other during the regular season? ''If any team has an advantage of playing each other twice,'' responded Reeves, ''both teams would have that advantage.'' True, of course, as far as it goes. In the last workout, Reeves said his forces displayed a ferocity that was worrisome. ''They were hitting each other so hard,'' he said, ''I was afraid of getting somebody hurt. Made you hold your breath.'' The Giants' last few days of practice have been, like some orange juices, high in concentration. But like the Broncos, the Giants would find ways to relax. In the training camp where the Giants have been ensconced, there is a dog - the clubhouse dog, he is called - and a game is sometimes played with him. A tennis ball is thrown at the door, and he jumps out from behind a garbage can and tries to snare the ball. ''He's kind of a goalie,'' said Parcells. ''The players enjoyed playing with him. I did it for about a couple of hours myself.'' Parcells did say that he was making sure in practice that ''you cover.'' He was talking about his defense, and not one of the most frequently asked questions about that football game tomorrow: Will the Giants cover? The reference is to the point spread, and not the defensive spread. Though the spread of the defensive cover could have a great deal to do with whether the Giants cover the spread. About the point spread for Super Bowl No. 21, the Giants are a 10-point favorite. ''I don't pay attention to the betting lines,'' Parcells said. ''It's a nonfactor. It's for someone else.'' Like Coach Reeves? ''An underdog could make a victory by them one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, considering the reaction when the Jets beat Baltimore,'' said Reeves. That was Super Bowl No. 3, in which the Jets were considered by oddsmakers almost three touchdowns inferior to the Colts. Perhaps it was only inevitable that Parcells would be asked about his self-control, given that the day before he had noted that football ''was not a game for well-adjusted people.'' Was he concerned about his temper getting out of control on the sidelines? ''Out of control, no,'' he said. ''Mad? Yes. Frequently? Yes. To the point where I appear out of control? Yes.'' And he laughed. ''I believe you're allowed to laugh,'' he said. ''Otherwise you go crazy.'' Reeves, made of stern stuff, was not all guffaws, and said he appreciated Parcells's sense of humor. ''I like the way he gives names to some of his units, like the offensive line. He calls them, what, 'Suburbanites.' He's got a knack for that.'' Both coaches appear to have a knack for forthrightness, however. This came out when Reeves was asked about the time in 1979 when he was being considered for the Giants' coaching job. ''Mr. Mara asked me to come to New York and not tell anybody,'' Reeves recalled, referring to Wellington Mara. He was interviewed for the job, and then went home. ''I got a phone call from Tim Mara, and he asked me if I had been in New York. I said no. ''I didn't know he had learned from Mr. Mara that I had been in New York. Well, it wasn't a good start of a relationship to be lying to somebody, and your chances of getting the job aren't real good.'' It was an astute observation, and Ray Perkins got the job. ''But I take coaching real good,'' said Reeves, with a glimmer of a smile. ''Mr. Mara told me to say no, and I said no.'' Coach, will the Broncos have any trick plays? ''The way people are considering our chances,'' he said, ''if we gain five yards people will think it's a trick play.'' Have the Giants done anything unusual in practice? ''It was like we were preparing for a regular game,'' said Parcells. A regular game? The Super Bowl? What a novel thought. News at last.

149-> MAYOR UPSET AT HAVING DOG WITH A PAST
SHERRY WILLIAMSON, the executive assistant to Stamford Mayor Thom Serrani, refers to it as ''Doggiegate,'' as do some members of the Stamford Police Department. While it is hardly a high-priority item, the police in Stamford, along with the Mayor's office, are trying to find out why no one told Mr. Serrani that a mixed-breed collie he adopted from the city dog pound on Dec. 23, and subsequently named Buddy, had bitten a 14-year-old girl on Dec. 2. There was a long-standing animosity between the Mayor and the dog warden, Beverly Bowler. Miss Bowler conceded in an interview that she might have been remiss in not telling Mr. Serrani that he was taking home a dog that had bitten someone. ''The Mayor has treated our office with contempt for three years, and maybe that was a factor in my not telling him,'' said Miss Bowler who officially stepped down as the dog warden last week. ''I probably should have told him that the dog had bitten the girl, but I didn't think it was important because the dog is not vicious. But I take responsibility for not doing so.'' Miss Bowler announced her resignation a month ago, and has insisted it was unrelated to the incident. The Mayor's adoption of the dog came about after the Police Department's liaison with the pound, Patrolman Daniel Vaccaro, ordered Miss Bowler and her three assistants to begin killing dogs because of overcrowded conditions. After countermanding Patrolman Vaccaro's order, Mr. Serrani announced that he planned to go to the pound to adopt a dog. The Mayor then toured the pound on Dec. 12 with his wife, Beth, and Gloria Scheuer, an official of Adopt-A-Dog, a nonprofit dog adoption service staffed by volunteers that is based in Greenwich. While at the pound, the Mayor and his wife took a fancy to the mixed-breed collie, which had been at the Magee Avenue site since biting the girl in a schoolyard in the Shippan section of town. ''Both Mr. Serrani and his wife walked and played with the dog, which is about 4 years old, and it seemed extremely friendly,'' Mrs. Scheuer said. ''When we asked one of the dog wardens about it, she said it was a lovable, friendly dog.'' ''But no one ever told us that the dog had bitten anyone or had been placed in quarantine, as biters are supposed to be for between 14 and 16 days,'' she said. ''If they had, we would have gone on to another dog.'' Mrs. Scheuer said that when she and the Serranis visited the pound, there were about 60 dogs, about double the acceptable capacity. ''The Stamford pound has always been very crowded,'' she said. Miss Bowler, the former dog warden, agreed. ''We've complained about conditions for years and have asked the city to expand the facilities, but they've ignored us.'' she said. But Mrs. Williamson, the Mayor's aide, said that $96,460 that had been allocated to the dog warden's office in the 1983-84 capital budget had never been used. ''The money is still sitting there and available,'' she said. Asked why the money had not been used, Miss Bowler said it was insufficient for expansion. ''We needed a lot more, and asked for another $155,000 in 1985, so that we could double the pound, but we never got it,'' she said. Miss Bowler, who was the dog warden for five years, said she thought her less-than-amicable relationship with Mr. Serrani stemmed from a series of incidents involving a dog he had owned before he became mayor. ''We got quite a few complaints from neighbors complaining about his dog, which was always running loose, and we got after him,'' Miss Bowler said. ''At the time, he was a state senator, but I didn't know him from Adam. I think maybe he hasn't forgotten about that.'' In response, Mrs. Williamson said, ''That's ludicrous, I'm certain that never happened.'' Deputy Police Chief John Moriarty, whose office has jurisdiction over the pound, said Mr. Serrani had commissioned a designer to see whether the pound can be expanded. ''Even though it's usually overcrowded, dogs usually aren't put to sleep unless they've been grievously injured or are seriously ill with no prognosis for recovery,'' he said. As it was, Chief Moriarty said, the order to do away with some dogs at the pound ''turned a negative into a positive'' once the public became aware of the situation. According to Mrs. Scheuer, about 18 dogs were adopted within a few weeks after Patrolman Vaccaro issued his order. Mayor Serrani was on vacation last week and unavailable for comment. But Mrs. Williamson, his executive aide, said he was ''disturbed that proper procedures had not been followed'' - meaning that the Mayor had not been told the dog he was adopting had bitten someone. ''The Mayor is a dog lover and his visit to the pound turned out to be a propitious one,'' Mrs. Williamson said. ''It's a wonderful dog, friendly and housebroken, and the Mayor and Mrs. Serrani are very happy with it.'' So much so, the Mayor's aide said, that they took the dog on vacation with them. As for Miss Bowler, she said she was moving to Schoharie, in upstate New York, to establish a house-cleaning service. ''I lost interest in the dog warden's job, and I finally just gave up,'' she said. ''Now, I want to get as far away from dogs as I can - at least for a while.''

150-> What Went Wrong?
Leon Wieseltier writes perceptively about how the White House style combines ''pure hearts and dirty hands.'' He then justifies the worst of President Reagan's dirty-handed actions, sponsorship of the Nicaraguan contras. Americas Watch (a nonpartisan human-rights organization, affiliated with Helsinki Watch, which has been active in monitoring Soviet human-rights violations) concluded in its 1985-86 report on Nicaragua that the contras routinely use terrorism to prevent civilians from cooperating with the Sandinista Government. The report said that the contras ''not only murdered their victims; they also tortured and mutilated them.'' Mr. Wieseltier thinks the President's support of the contras is sound. It is the financing of the contras with Iranian cash, not the contra terrorist program, that he associates with dirty hands. He finds fault with the form and approves the substance. But Ronald Reagan's form is his substance. EDGAR VILLCHUR Woodstock, N.Y.

151-> LICENSING PLANNED FOR NEW AIDS DRUG
Federal officials say the Government intends to grant an exclusive manufacturing license for an experimental drug to treat AIDS victims to Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of Nutley, N.J. Officials said Thursday that the license would be granted in 60 days by the Commerce Department's patent division unless there was evidence of Hoffmann's unsuitability. The drug, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, is being used on patients suffering from the advanced stages of AIDS in preliminary testing under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute, which found the drug to be promising in laboratory studies. ''In the lab, DDC has been found to halt the replication of the AIDS virus, allowing the body's immune system to begin rebuilding,'' said an official at the institute, who asked not to be identified. Officials said the drug would not cure or prevent the disease but would halt its progress. Some Success With Similar Drug Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune system, leaving victims vulnerable to a variety of infections and cancers. So far only one drug, azidothymidine, or AZT, also an antiviral agent, has been shown to prolong the lives of some categories of AIDS victims. But AZT has serious side effects that may limit its use, many scientists say. The Food and Drug Administration is nearing a decision on whether to license AZT, which is now being distributed to more than 3,000 AIDS patients in a research program undertaken by its manufacturer, the Burroughs Wellcome Company. In early laboratory tests on animals, DDC has been found to be slightly more effective against the AIDS virus and less toxic to the body than AZT, said United States officials, who also requested anonymity. John Doorley, a spokesman for Hoffmann, hailed the announcement about the licensing of DDC but said it might be ''a matter of years,'' if ever, before the drug went on the market. Terms to Be Negotiated ''We've passed a major hurdle,'' Mr. Doorley said in a telephone interview. He said the company would have to negotiate terms with the National Institutes of Health for developing the drug and with the Commerce Department for its financing. Under the license agreement, if the drug is ever marketed, the as yet undetermined royalties would go to the Government, which holds the patent on DDC. Extensive testing in patients and approval by the Food and Drug Administration are needed before the drug can be marketed, Mr. Doorley said.

153-> METRO DATELINE; 2 TEEN-AGERS HELD IN MURDERS OF FOUR
A high school honors student accused of murdering four members of his household, and a classmate charged with helping him, were arraigned yesterday in Columbia County Court. The two are charged with eight second-degree murder counts, two for each victim, and related crimes. The honor student, Wyley Gates, 17 years old, and Damian Rossney, 16, who authorities say conspired with Mr. Gates to kill his family, were arraigned in separate hearings. Columbia County District Attorney Eugene Keeler said the two teen-agers conspired for two months before the slayings of Mr. Gates's father, Robert Gates Sr., 39; his brother, Robert Gates Jr., 19; cousin Jason Gates, 3, and his father's companion, Cheryl Brahm, 36. Mr. Gates, already being held without bail, was sent back to the Columbia County Jail after his three-minute hearing before Judge John J. Leaman of County Court in this town about 50 miles south of Albany. Mr. Rossney was ordered held in $650,000 bail. If convicted of the murder charges, both youths could be sentenced to 25 years to life for each count.

154-> STAGE: PUERTO RICAN TROUPE OFFERS 'A LITTLE SOMETHING'
In ''A Little Something to Ease the Pain,'' two brothers, one a Cuban immigrant playwright in Toronto and the other a popular radio commentator in Santiago, Cuba, struggle to find where home really is in a world of exiles. That Carlos (Jorge Luis Ramos), who had gone to Canada after Fidel Castro came to power, cannot find it is obvious from the first scene, in which he returns to Santiago to discover the church of his childhood desolate, its last priest an abandoned invalid. He does not realize at first that the home in which he grew up is just as desolate, or that the exuberance of its occupants - his grandmother, aunts, brother and cousin - is only chatter to keep them from thinking about what Carlos's brother Nelson (Ruben Pla) finally admits: the revolutionary regime that has made them exiles at home prevents them from getting out. How much of Rene Aloma's play is autobiographical I do not know. He left Santiago when he was 15 and had a career as a playwright in Toronto until he died last year at the age of 39. But the emotions he explores in the play are profoundly personal, giving the generous good humor of his characters a special poignancy and making the almost unspoken political dogmas that drive them apart seem as insubstantial as the dust hanging in the air of the empty church. When, at the end, Carlos, having returned to Canada, writes to his brother and concludes, ''here is my play - I hope you like it,'' it seems clear he means the play just presented. The production, at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street (in English Wednesday through Friday evenings and in Spanish Saturday and Sunday matinees and evenings), opens the 20th season of the company. The director, Mario Ernesto Sanchez, and the nine cast members concentrate on the deep attachments all the characters have to one another - sometimes expressed in bitter conflict - and virtually mute the quiet but complex political remarks Mr. Aloma sprinkles through the dialogue. The result is dramatically right: the political divisions of the world become personally painful, and the only thing that eases the pain is the reticent reverence these people have for one another. If the audience leaves feeling that the play does not really end, that is right, too. For all its comic moments, if the play were pushed to its logical conclusion, it might end tragically. The playwright's somewhat perfunctory ending seems to be an intentional challenge to the audience to provide its own answers to the troubling questions he raises.

155-> WESTCHESTER OPINION; STORM WARNING: ON THE HOME FRONT
WITH the season for blizzards just around the corner, it's time to take stock and prepare for the worst. Last year, after almost 24 hours of dire warnings, all a cautious mother would learn from the television commentators was to lay in a supply of batteries, bottled water and masking tape. Frankly, that wouldn't get you through the first 15 minutes in a real storm if you had kids. Let's be honest, batteries are good either to make toy robots whir forever, or to make flashlights work so you can play coal miner. The best that bottled water will get you is a full water pistol. Masking tape, however, may come in handy if you finally decide to tape hands, feet and even little mouths after a full day in the house. In any case, in anticipation of a winter full of storms, any household with children should consider stocking the ''real'' necessities. To begin, at the first hint of a storm, assume school will close, thus assuring that the storm will go elsewhere. This means that the kids will be home all day with nothing to do, but you can't let them outside because the storm might hit. Entertainment is up to you. Therefore, first purchase a supply of important foodstuffs. Discount all suggestions of canned goods. Your children don't eat canned peas when there isn't a storm; they're certainly not going to eat them now. Do not buy any frozen dinners. If the microwave isn't working there is nothing worse than a frozen enchilada. Crunchy, possibly nutritious, but incredibly depressing. Do be sure and lay in a supply of soda, potato chips and cookies. To justify these purchases, remember that these foodstuffs do not have to be cooked, warm soda (should ice be unavailable) offends no one, and this type of food cuts down on the arguments about why there is never anything good to eat in the house. Put your guilt to rest by buying some fruit or sunflower seeds to munch on between serious snacks. I, personally, also suggest a supply of chocolate chips. Baking is a diversion for the children in between game shows and cartoons. While the kids may or may not help you cook, they most certainly will eat. Further, should all power go off, chocolate chips by the handful aren't a bad snack (for you or the kids). Remember, space your activities well. During one storm, I made the fatal mistake of baking cookies at 9:30 in the morning. That meant that by 10 in the morning we had already used up one of our best ''pass the time'' activities; the kids were well on their way to a sugar high and it seemed pointless to suggest that 10 in the morning was a tad early for soda. Which leads to the next point. At these times it's never too early for a snack. Overeating may possibly lead to naps - a welcome relief. Next, secretly buy a tape for your VCR - one with absolutely no redeeming educational value and that your kids have always wanted to rent. Hide it and save it for a rainy/snowy day. No need to point out that in the snow belt you need a VCR as a basic survival tool. Do not count on cable television to meet your programming needs. Cable transmission goes out when the sun is shining and the temperature is in the 90's. You can't count on the standard broadcasting networks either. Clearly members of the weathermen's union see storms, or even better anticipate storms, as their golden opportunity for stardom. All programming is permanently interrupted as meterologists compete to dazzle the audience with unintelligible gibberish about warm air masses that are about to dump 20 inches of snow either on my house or the Atlantic Ocean, whichever comes first. Scarcely the type of entertainment to prevent fratricidal homicide. Do not forget to buy a surge protector for the computer. Should the power go out in the middle of ''Pac Man,'' at least you won't lose thousands of dollars worth of equipment or software. This is no time for quibbling over how many hours a child can play computer games before his eyes glaze, his hand becomes permanently attached to the joystick and all brain cells atrophy. Lastly, try and make the storm work for you. The day before one storm, my first-grader came home with the news that his homework for the night was to prepare for a natural disaster. He was told by his teacher to be sure and clean up the backyard and bring in all the toys. Was it wrong of me that I suggested that hurricanes, tornadoes and blizzards were drawn inexorably to messy rooms? The list of essentials might get you through the first six hours of calamitous weather. By that point, one hopes, there are either snow drifts or puddles that the kids can attack. In any case it is clear that whoever wrote the lyrics ''the weather outside is frightful, but in here it's so delightful, let it snow, let it snow,'' did not have children at home.

159-> End of Low-Fare, Quick-Getaway Flights
To the Editor: ''Did Low Air Fares Die, Too?'' (editorial, Jan. 5) does not explore -no editorial or article really does -what it means for people unable to book ahead that unrestricted low air fares have died with People Express, as they did with Laker. The ability to move quickly is just as important for professionals of modest income as it is for those who are wealthy or on company expense accounts. It is equally essential not to be boxed into a return that can be canceled only with great penalty. Mobility and jumping on unexpected opportunities are indispensable to success in business and in many other aspects of our lives. Indeed, no questions should be asked about the reason a person wants to travel. There are plenty of urgent personal ones. By now, flying should be as simple as taking a bus, a train or even a subway. Moreover, deprived as we have come to be of an extensive railroad network, many depend on airlines, especially for long-distance travel. It is a kind of arrogance on the part of those who believe that people who want or need to fly should have either lots of time or lots of money - if not both. JUDITH CHILDS New York, Jan. 6, 1987

160-> Now Still Another Rerun Of the Perils of Amtrak
To the Editor: Here we go again. Just a few months ago, Congress rejected President Reagan's proposal to eliminate Amtrak, and now he is back again with the same idea (news story, Dec. 18). For whatever reason, the President seems obsessed with the elimination of Amtrak. However, Congress does not agree. Amtrak provides a necessary and vital service to our country and by all means, it should be continued in its present form. Amtrak and its employees have continuously, since its inception, improved their service and productivity, as well as meeting the legislative mandates placed upon them by Congress, such as reducing their dependence on Government funds. Likewise, rail unions have met their obligations to the government and public by negotiating wage concessions and work-rule changes to help offset Amtrak's fund dependency. The public and Congress are in sync to continue Amtrak. And that's a mandate the President should follow! ROBERT A. SCARDELLETTI Philadelphia, Dec. 23, 1986 The writer is general chairman of the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks.

162-> Market Place; Looking Past The Blue Chips
THE stock price of Subaru of America Inc. has been cut in half since reaching a record high of $39 a share in mid-1986. Stanley Lanzet of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. frankly describes this process as ''a horrible sell-off.'' But the analyst hastened to declare: ''We regard the price weakness as a buying opportunity.'' Mr. Lanzet, who tracks smaller growth companies for his firm, is no stranger to Subaru, whose stock finished Friday at $19.25 in the over-the-counter market. He first recommended it to clients in 1979 at an equivalent price of 62.5 cents a share. (All prices are adjusted for an 8-for-1 stock split last year.) ''Subaru's essential attraction - something that hardly anyone appreciated years ago - is that the company is not a manufacturer,'' the analyst said. ''Instead, it is an importer and distributor of Japanese-made vehicles.'' Subaru vehicles are made by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. ''Lately, the company's sales have been hurt by incentive financing from United States car makers and by the lack of lower-priced vehicles,'' he added. ''But the fact remains that Subaru is a superior company with 10 years of record earnings increases and it is now selling at a 40 percent discount to the general market. The company earned $1.92 a share for its fiscal year ended October 1986 and we estimate profits at $2.15 a share for the current fiscal year.'' In a sense, Subaru epitomizes the recent lack of investor appetite for those small and medium-size growth companies labeled ''emerging growth stocks.'' In the ever-changing fashion of Wall Street, these once-popular investments have seen attention swing instead to big-capitalization blue chips. In support of the growth-company sector, Mr. Lanzet said: ''Every company on our buy list has a price-earnings multiple less than that of the overall market, despite a significantly greater growth potential and a much higher return on invested capital.'' Analysts generally say that the overall market is priced at about 15 times estimated earnings for 1987. Some other issues recommended by the Drexel analyst also have experienced sharp sell-offs. But this makes Mr. Lanzet only more positive on their potential. Among his recommendations are Nike Inc. and Reebok International in athletic footwear and Emerson Radio, which sells consumer electronic entertainment equipment. Like Subaru, these are essentially marketing companies. Greg A. Smith, chief market strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities, pointed out that the sluggish domestic economy and a difficult business environment have adversely affected many small and medium-capitalization companies. However, he believes these companies now represent ''the most attractive part of the stock market.'' In Baltimore, the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, the nation's largest mutual fund investing in smaller emerging growth companies, has said that certain elements of the new tax bill - such as the increase in the capital gains rate and the equating of dividends and capital gains for tax purposes -have had a negative impact on these companies. Nonetheless, New Horizons officials said that ''the idea of investing on a long-term basis in a portfolio of small, rapidly growing companies has produced superior results in the past and we have every confidence that this will again prove to be the case.'' Since mid-1986, New Horizons has made new commitments that include the Progressive Corporation, which specializes in automobile insurance, and Tops Markets, an operator of supermarkets and convenience stores, along with Cellular Communications, an owner of cellular radio telephone franchises. Byron R. Wien, domestic equity strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, includes a number of small and medium-capitalization growth stocks in his model portfolio. Currently, two of his favorites are Computer Associates International, which develops computer software products, and the Pep Boys (Manny, Moe & Jack), whose stores sell automotive parts and accessories. ''Secondary stocks have lagged the market, but I think the bull market is still intact despite this divergence,'' Mr. Wien said. ''Early in 1987, I expect market participation to broaden and include the secondary issues.'' Like issues in any market sector, emerging growth stocks are apt to stumble occasionally. Merrill Lynch, for example, now looks for ''below-average'' performance over the next 12 months from Royal International Optical, which operates a chain of eyewear stores. The firm recently lowered its profit estimates for Royal, which is among 56 emerging growth companies it monitors. From this list, Merrill Lynch's Lawrence A. Rader picked six favorites for 1987: Community Psychiatric Centers, an operator of psychiatric hospitals; BDM International, which provides technical services for the Government; Pic 'N' Save, a retail chain specializing in ''close-out'' merchandise; Osten Corporation, a leader in the temporary help industry, and La Petite Academy and Kinder-Care Learning Centers, which operate private day care centers.

163-> METRO DATELINES; White Man Attacked By Brooklyn Blacks
A white man who was walking on a street in Brooklyn with two black women was beaten late Sunday by a group of young black men who said, ''You don't belong here,'' the police said yesterday. They called the attack racially motivated. The victim, John Bucaria, 34 years old, was listed in fair condition yesterday at Brooklyn Hospital with a head injury. The police said he was indigent and homeless. According to the police, Mr. Bucaria was walking with the women in front of 233 Sands Street in the Fort Greene section at about 11:30 P.M. Sunday when they were approached by six or seven black men between the ages of about 19 and 25. The police said Mr. Bucaria had known the two women since childhood. The group beat Mr. Bucaria about the head and body with a blunt weapon, the police said. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is continuing.

165-> Topics: Scrabble and Babble; Dishonor Roll
A redundulating cheer for the Unicorn Hunters, who publish a New Year's Dishonor List of Words Banished From the Queen's English. This year's deserving targets include ''shower activity'' for rain; ''colorization'' of movies when all that's meant is coloring, and ''hands-on participatory experience.'' Language, like a garden, often sprouts weeds and the Unicorn Hunters, based at Lake Superior State College in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., supply a welcome hoe. It's a hoe worth wielding also for reasons other than redundancy and verbosity. The Centers for Disease Control of the U.S. Public Health Service is one such reason - and the problem should already be obvious. There may be administrative logic in considering nine different centers as a unit, but it's logic that jars the ear and traps the eye into correcting what only looks like an error. The Centers, a singular institution, deserve a singular title. The other anomaly will be harder to correct: the title New York Supreme Court Justice. Evoking the white marble institution in Washington, that sounds like a position on the highest court in the state. That's no accident but it is, effectively, a lie. The New York Supreme Court is not an appellate court at all but a court of original jurisdiction two steps from the state's highest, the Court of Appeals. Only seven judges sit on that court; the Supreme Court Justice title is held by hundreds of judges all over the state. There may be among them many honorable judges who are embarrassed by the pompous deception. If so, let them speak out and let modest justice rule supreme.

167-> COMPANY NEWS; Rockwell Seeks to Issue Stock to Deter Suitors
The Rockwell International Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest aerospace concern, said today that it would seek stockholder authorization to issue a new class of common stock to deter unwanted takeovers. While analysts see no imminent takeover threat and the company says it knows of none, traders say there is at least a scattering of takeover rumors in the market. The Rockwell shares have been hurt by the expected end of the B-1 bomber program and the explosion in January 1986 of the Challenger space shuttle, for which Rockwell was the prime contractor. ''I think Rockwell's just taking precautions without any real objective in mind other than to stay independent,'' Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. Under the proposal, Rockwell will issue a new share of class A stock for each existing share, which will entitle holders to 10 votes each. Rockwell said the board believes the existence of weighted-voting stock will give it and stockholders adequate time to evaluate and consider any offers affecting control of the corporation. The class A stock proposal will ''result in long-term investors in the corporation having a more significant voice in its direction than short-term holders,'' Rockwell's statement said. Analysts said the Rockwell plan has a good chance of passing because employees own about 30 percent of the stock. The relatively low proportion of shares held by institutions - about 20 percent - will also help, analysts said. Institutional investors have generally opposed issuing a class of stock with preferential voting rights, fearing the stock price could be depressed by the move. Rockwell said the plan would be voted on Feb. 11 at the annual meeting. If shareholders approve the Rockwell plan, the company will declare a stock dividend of one share of class A common for each common share now outstanding. This is equivalent to a 2-for-1 stock split, Rockwell said. As an enticement for passage, Rockwell said it would also consider an increase in its cash dividend when the split takes effect. Rockwell's shares rose $1.375 a share, to $48, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.

168-> MORE RISK IN SURGERY OF PROSTATE
Although urologists say the risks incurred in prostatectomies remain small, recent studies involving thousands of patients show that those risks are higher than earlier research indicated. The new studies show that the chance of dying in the months following the operation, while small, are three to four times higher than had been believed. The death risk was generally regarded as about less than 1 percent, but it is now thought to be close to 3 percent, the new research indicates. The studies were independent of the medical treatment of President Reagan, who underwent such a procedure. They bore out what the President's doctors had told him: that the procedure was essentially safe but that it did carry risks. Several physicians said they worried that as a result of attention given to the President's surgery today, and the perception that it is without significant risk, hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who otherwise might not have sought treatment would undergo prostatectomies in the months ahead. The new research shows that not only are the mortality risks higher than had been thought but so was the likelihood of encountering such major health problems as incontinence, impotence or readmission to the hospital for treatment of post-surgical complications. Problem With Studies Urologists and other medical experts consulted in advance of Mr. Reagan's operation said the chance of death was less than 1 percent. That had been the prevailing view in the medical profession but is based on studies that typically have not followed the patients after they left the hospital, several urologists and other medical experts said in interviews today. ''The studies urologists most commonly quote really aren't realistic because they talk about just whether the patient gets out of the hospital alive,'' said Jack Fowler, director of the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts Hospital in Boston. But a recent Federal Government study that tracked more than 100,000 prostatectomy patients receiving Medicare, published in the journal Health Care Financing Review, said that while the death rate for trans-urethral resection of the prostate, the operation Mr. Reagan had, ''is not extremely high initially, it does not decline as rapidly as for other operations'' in the months after discharge from the hospital. The Federal study showed that about 2.7 percent of the patients who were 75 or older died within six weeks as a result of the procedure. The vast majority of prostatectomies are trans-urethral resections, but in an extremely small number of cases a portion of the enlarged prostate is removed after the physician makes a surgical incision in the abdomen. Over all, 10.5 percent of the Medicare patients 65 years old or older died within one year of the procedure. Although not all the deaths in that last statistic are known to result from the prostatectomies, the death rate is far higher than actuarial tables say would have been the case under ordinary circumstances. ''It's quite obvious that the number of people dying is a lot higher than is commonly supposed,'' said Dr. John E. Wennberg, a professor of epidemiology at Dartmouth University who recently completed similar studies of his own. Dr. Wennberg is widely regarded as an expert in this field. Asked about the upcoming operation over the weekend, Mr. Reagan said, ''It's a breeze.'' Studies showed that the number of women in this country who underwent simple and modified radical mastectomies nearly tripled in the years after First Lady Betty Ford had breast surgery in 1974. And early evidence indicates that President Reagan's colon surgery last year had the same effect. ''There was a sudden burst in people getting colonoscopies,'' said Dr. Albert Mulley, chief of the General Internal Medicine Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Wennberg said he was concerned that patients who have moderate symptoms of urinary tract obstruction might now contemplate a similar operation ''without accurate information on the magnitude of the risks.'' His studies tracking a large group of patients in New England show that the chance for readmission to the hospital for complications from prostatectomies was 8.2 percent and that ''the death rate varies substantially by hospital,'' from less than 3 percent at the best hospitals to more than 9 percent at the worst within three months of having the operation. A similar study in Maine last year, conducted under the auspices of the Maine Medical Association, showed that the rates for death and serious complications, such as impotence or incontinence, were significantly higher than had been previously believed. ''This has opened our eyes,'' said Dr. Robert Timothy, a practicing urologist who is president of the Maine Urological Association. Maine's urologists believe that prostatectomy patients are by nature sicker on average and more likely to die, he said. Still, ''this is not a benign procedure,'' Dr. Timothy added. ''The prostate surgery does play a role'' in the death rates. The Maine study showed that 20 percent of the roughly 500 patients followed for a year after the operation had become impotent and 8 percent had become partly or completely incontinent as a result of the procedure. The mortality rate, adjusted to include only those people who died of problems associated with the surgery, was close to 3 percent, Dr. Timothy said. Prior to the study, he said, he and many others in Maine usually quoted the ''common wisdom'' that the mortality rate from prostatectomies was less than 1 percent. Of that statistic Dr. Timothy now says, ''It was a little bit of nihilism.'' In the two years since the study began, the number of prostatectomies performed in Maine has dropped significantly. Now that Maine's urologists know the risks, they are less likely to recommend surgery for patients with moderate symptoms, Dr. Timothy said. Dr. Wennberg said the surprising mortality and complication figures for prostatectomies showed that ''we have a critical need for better outcome studies'' for many other medical procedures, a thesis he has raised in Congressional testimony and that is gaining credence throughout medicine.

169-> PSYCHIATRIST FILES A LIBEL SUIT OVER FILM OF PLATH'S 'BELL JAR'
A Boston psychiatrist who says she is the basis for a character in Sylvia Plath's 1961 novel about suicide, ''The Bell Jar,'' has filed a suit contending defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional damage, growing out of a 1979 movie version of the book. The case, which is to be heard in Federal District Court here later this week, sets the stage for a major test between the rights of artists to express themselves and the right of individuals to privacy. As such, the case may establish a precedent of unusual importance. Novel Is Semi-Autobiographical The psychiatrist, Dr. Jane V. Anderson, contends in her suit that she is the basis for Joan Gilling, a character in the novel and movie. Dr. Anderson's attorney said she did not object to the representation of the character in Miss Plath's novel, but based her suit on a scene from the movie involving homosexual advances on the part of the Gilling character. Defense attorneys say that although the novel is semi-autobiographical, the Joan Gilling character is fictional. If the suit succeeds, according to one of the defense attorneys, Victor Kovner, ''It would limit the traditional freedom to create fictional characters based upon the life experience of the author.'' Mr. Kovner, a prominent First Amendment attorney, added, ''It would be a very troublesome precedent because it would serve to limit expression of the authors of fiction.'' ''We're dealing with what we believe is one of the great works of contemporary American literature, a true work of art, the serious exploration of a woman's attempt to deal with mental illness,'' he said. ''It moved hundreds of thousands of readers in this country, if not millions.'' Dr. Anderson's attorney, Harry L. Manion 3d, said he would argue in the trial, for which jury selection will begin Wednesday, that the problem was ''carelessness'' by movie producers. Defendants in the suit include Ted Hughes, the present poet laureate of England, who, as Miss Plath's husband and administrator of her estate, sold the motion-picture rights, and several companies involved in producing and distributing the movie. The plaintiff, Dr. Anderson, is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School. Other defendants are the AVCO Embassy Pictures Corporation, which produced a television movie based on the book; CBS Inc., which broadcast it twice; Time-Life Films Inc., the owner of Home Box Office, which played it nine times, and Vestron Incorporated, which has made the movie available for home rental on video cassette, according to the plaintiff. Movie Is the Issue The case, which will be heard by Judge Robert Keeton, also names the director, Lawrence Peerce; the screenwriter, Marjorie Kellogg; Brandt-Todd Productions; Bonime Productions Ltd.; LaMarca Productions Ltd.; Jerrold Brandt Jr., and Michael Todd Jr. Mr. Manion said he would leave determination of damages to the jury. Lawyers on both sides of the case agree that Dr. Anderson's real-life relationship to Miss Plath is reproduced in several ways in the relationship between Joan Gilling and the book's central character, Esther Greenwood. In real life, Dr. Anderson was a year ahead of Miss Plath at Smith College and at different times each dated the same man; later they were patients at the same psychiatric hospital, as were Esther Greenwood and Joan Gilling in the novel. Mr. Manion said a major part of the case was a suggestion of homosexual tendencies made strongly in the movie, including an attempt by the Gilling character to lure the Greenwood character into a lovers' suicide pact. That incident is not in the book. ''We have no quarrel with the book,'' he said. The problem came, he said, ''when Hollywood got its hands on this property.'' The case is complicated by the inability of the author to defend herself. Miss Plath attempted suicide in 1953, before writing the novel, and killed herself in 1963, after the book was published in England under a pseudonym. It was published there under her own name in 1966, and in this country in 1971. A film with the same title was shown in movie theaters beginning in 1979, and a less graphic version, shot at the same time, was shown twice on CBS and nine times on HBO, and is now being distributed on video cassette by Vestron, the plaintiff said. The initial libel suit was filed in 1982 based on presentation of the motion picture in theaters. A suit alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress was later filed against the AVCO Embassy Pictures Corporation; CBS; Time-Life Films Inc.; HBO, and Vestron. The suits have been combined. According to Mr. Manion, Dr. Anderson is identified as the model for the Gilling character in two biographies of Miss Plath published in the 1970's. Mr. Manion also says one of the producers said he had a copy of one of the books, ''Sylvia Plath, Method and Madness'' by Edward Butscher, published in 1976 by Seabury Press. ''They either knew or could easily have found out that Dr. Anderson was the basis of Joan Gilling,'' he said. Dr. Anderson's lawyer said his client ''is not alleging that she lost patients.'' ''She is saying that this portrayal of her as having these homosexual tendencies, and as having participated in the suggestion of a suicide pact, has grossly damaged her reputation as a practicing psychiatrist and a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty,'' he said.

172-> SELLING AMTRAK NORTHEAST LINE IS STILL A BAD IDEA; The View From Ohio
To the Editor: It is sad to see you repeating the fallacy that passenger rail service alone of all travel modes is heavily subsidized (editorial, Jan. 8). How many times must this be refuted before you and the Reagan Administration get the message? All transportation is subsidized, and none come close to paying their own way. Subsidies for other modes are many times more than that for rail. Perhaps more disagreeable is your regional myopia. We are told that the New York City area is deserving of rail service, but the rest of the country has no need for it. The opposite is true. New York City and the North-east are well served by a variety of modes, but there are many places where Amtrak is the only public transportation available. Here in Lima, Ohio, for example, the nearest airport is 75 miles away, and bus service is near extinction. Soon Amtrak will be all that we have. In your view, however, we have no need of public transportation because we do not live in the Northeast. Would you be content to live in a city with no intercity transportation at all? The Reagan Administration wants to sell Amtrak. The reason offered is the revenue this would produce. Why, then, is there no proposal to sell the interstate highway system or the federally subsidized airline infrastructure? Either would bring far more revenue. It seems clear that the motive for selling Amtrak is a new ingenious attempt to kill it. With the almost daily reports of saturation on airways and highways, it is time for a massive expansion of the rail system, so that in America we can have the modern railroad system other industrialized countries take for granted. DUANE W. ROLLER Lima, Ohio, Jan. 9, 1987

173-> State Adds 'Win 10' Lotto
The New York Lottery last night introduced a new daily drawing, ''Win-10.'' The game permits bettors to pick from 3 to 10 numbers between 1 and 80. In each drawing, 20 winning numbers are selected from the 80. The new game, which is in addition to the Lottery's existing drawings, costs $1 to play, with the amount of the prize depending on how many winning numbers the bettor chooses. If three numbers are correctly selected, for example, the prize is $25, with the chances of winning about 1 in 72. If the bettor elects to pick six or more numbers, there is more than one way to win. For example, a bettor who picks nine numbers can win by matching seven, eight or all nine of the numbers with those drawn by the state. For ''Pick-10'' there is a $200,000 jackpot shared by players matching any 10 of the 20 winning numbers: The chances of winning are 1 in 8,911,711. ''Pick 10'' also pays off if any seven or more of the winning numbers are chosen. If none of the bettors ''Pick 10'' numbers match the 20 drawn, the bettor can still receive $4.

175-> SUPER BOWL XXI; DESIGNING A WINNING STRATEGY
If you were coaching one of this year's Super Bowl teams what would you stress in your game plan? That question was put to last year's Super Bowl coaches, Raymond Berry and Mike Ditka. Berry, with regard to opposing the Denver Broncos, cited strategies for containing John Elway, the quarterback, and Karl Mecklenburg, the ubiquitous linebacker. Ditka had plans for Lawrence Taylor, the Giant linebacker and pro football's most valuable player, plus the difficult short-yardage plays against the Giants' defense. Berry said of Elway: ''Because he can move out of the passing pocket so well when pressured, he makes his own protection. He buys himself time. Against him you go more to a five-man rush, rather than three or four. That way, you can cover and cut down the lanes he likes to go in. You've got to keep him inside, if you can.'' Mecklenburg, a big, fast tackler, lines up in different places according to the design of the defensive coach, Joe Collier. He can be a lineman down on the line of scrimmage with pass-rush purpose. Or he can line up as a linebacker, either blitzing or dropping into pass coverage. The idea is to confuse the reading of the defense by the offense. To keep the confusion at a minimum, said Berry, the Patriots ''treated him as a down lineman wherever he went.'' They were ready to block him with another lineman at all times, thus eliminating another guessing game. Apparently, it worked because Mecklenburg did not destroy the New England offense. Ditka said he would distract, even intimidate Taylor. The coach said: ''He doesn't have weaknesses. If you block him with a back you'll be successful once in a while. The majority of the time, you'll be beaten. You will be successful blocking him with an offensive lineman part of the time. ''The thing to do is to change up on him. Keep the tight end over him if you can. Make it so he's not playing against open air all the time. ''Hopefully, if you're playing real good and you've got good talent, you can take advantage of him, get his mind off the game, psych him a little.'' Then there are the short-yardage plays - third down and 1, third and 2 -so necessary to achieve first downs and sustain the offense. ''You'd have to try to get outside on these guys a little bit,'' Ditka said. ''You just hope you can work against the cornerbacks and the safeties rather than the linebackers. ''It helps to have a tight end who can hook a linebacker. Denver's tight ends are pretty good and big enough.''

177-> CHADIANS DOWN A LIBYAN JET OVER OASIS
The Chadian Army announced today that it had shot down a Libyan MIG-23 fighter over the Saharan oasis town of Fada in northeastern Chad. The announcement, broadcast over the Chadian radio, provided no details on how the Soviet-made MIG-23 was shot down. Chadian forces are equipped with anti-aircraft missiles. The broadcast was heard as American officials stressed the significance of the Chadian victory over Libya in a three-day battle for Fada last weekend. The officials put the death toll among the Libyan troops and their Chadian insurgent allies at several hundred, and said the Government troops had captured six Italian-built fighter planes as well as Soviet-made T-55 tanks. About 25 Libyan prisoners have been taken to Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, for interrogation and publicity purposes, the officials said. Libya Seized Border Strip in '73 Libya has been involved in Chadian affairs for 13 years, having seized an area known as the Aozou Strip along the border in 1973 and sporadically intervening in Chad. Libya's interest in spreading its influence, including support for Chadian insurgents against the French-backed Government in Ndjamena, has been cited by the United States as an example of Libyan efforts to subvert neighboring countries. In the wake of the fighting at Fada, American officials said the repercussions could well go beyond Chad itself, and affect the internal situation in Libya. Also today, Libya seemed to admit for the first time that its troops were operating in Chad, Reuters said. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, said in an interview in Liberation, the French left-wing daily, that Libya had sent ''a few hundred'' soldiers to Chad to rescue a group of technicians believed held prisoner there. Libya has denied having troops in Chad although Western intelligence has said that as many as 7,000 Libyans have been in combat there. Reuters also quoted the Chadian Information Minister, Moumine Hamidi, as having said that Libya had massed warplanes at Ouadi Doum in northern Chad, at Aozou, and at Matan as Sarra in southeast Libya. He said Libya had moved MIG fighters, Tupolev and Sukhoi aircraft and military helicopters to the three fields. The fighting in Chad, particularly after the defeat of the Libyans at Fada, has been coming under heavier scrutiny by American officials than would normally be the case for another African country, officials said. The Libyan setback at Fada is believed to have been the reason for Libya's decision to send warplanes south of the 16th parallel on Sunday. In ordering the raids, the Libyans were raising the possibility of a direct clash with French forces supporting the Chadian Government. France has warned that it may order its troops into action if Libya crosses the parallel. The latest fighting began Dec. 20 when Libyan troops, backed by Soviet-made tanks and Italian-built planes, seized outposts in the Tibesti Mountains. The outposts used to be controlled by Chadian allies that had split with the Libyans. The Libyan attacks against the Tibesti outposts, known as Bardai, Wour and Zouar, led to seesaw fighting, with the oasis towns changing hands several times in the last two weeks, American officials said. The most recent fighting was precipitated by a significant shift in Libya's political standing in Chad. Since 1980, Libyan forces had been in Chad at the invitation of Goukouni Oueddei, who has been involved in a power struggle with Hissen Habre. The entry of 7,000 Libyan forces in 1980 allowed Mr. Goukouni to seize power. But faced with African resentment, Mr. Goukouni in 1981 asked the Libyans to leave, and they did. This allowed Mr. Habre to take control of southern Chad, including Ndjamena. But Mr. Habre's forces were unable to defeat Mr. Goukouni's Toubou tribesmen in the north, leading to a de facto division of the country. In 1983, aided by several thousand Libyans who had re-entered the country, Mr. Goukouni attacked again, leading to the deployment of French forces in the south, and an infusion of American military aid. Last October, Mr. Goukouni's Toubou allies, who are Moslem, but not Arab, rebelled against Libyan efforts to ''Arabize'' northern Chad, American officials said. Mr. Goukouni, who was in Tripoli, Libya, was wounded in a shootout between his bodyguards and Libyans, and has been under house arrest since then. The Libyans in Chad have been aided by ethnic Arabs, but they are said to be a small number. Last month, Libya moved several thousand additional troops into Chad, to bring its forces up to 7,000, American officials said. French Help Set Up a Base The Chadian Government drive against Fada was supported by a French decision to help the Chadians set up an advance camp at Kalait, just south of the 16th parallel. From Kalait, Chadian armored personnel carriers moved in a column to Fada. An American official, referring to information obtained mainly from France, said: ''Our reports indicate that there was a significant Chadian victory at Fada with a large number of casualties on the Libyan side. We estimate that hundreds of Libyans were killed. A large number of Libyans were taken prisoner.'' Six Italian-made SF-260 jet trainers, used as ground attack planes by the Libyans, were seized on the ground. The official said that the Chadian Government had asked the United States to continue its military assistance. Early last month, in anticipation of the Libyan attack, President Reagan announced that $15 million in military equipment was being sent to Chad. This includes light arms, ammunition, and clothing, medical supplies, vehicles and transport planes.

178-> Telltale Holdup Note Leads to Quick Arrest
A man who wrote a holdup message on the back of his probation-parole card and then left it behind was arrested as he prepared to board a bus next to the police station, officials said Friday. ''He wasn't real sharp,'' Dave Griffin, a police investigator, said of the suspect, Terry Wilson, who was identified by the probation-parole card that he left at the bank. In the incident Thursday, a man stepped up to a Sun Bank teller with a holdup note. Police Officer Rick Epperson said the note on the back of the card read: ''Give me all your money or else I'll shoot you. Bang!'' The teller handed over some cash and the man fled. Mr. Wilson, who was described by the police as a 30-year-old transient, was arrested minutes later at a bus station a few blocks from the bank. Ted Rybicki, a bank spokesman, said that there were no injuries and that ''a nominal amount'' taken in the robbery was recovered.

179-> COMPANY NEWS; Chip Index Posts Gain
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator showed its strongest rebound yet, as chip makers in the United States, Europe and Japan reported increases in both orders and shipments, a trade group reported today. The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 for the three-month period ended in December, up from 0.99 in November and 0.96 in October. The book-to-bill ratio, which compares orders with shipments, is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1.08 means that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $108 worth of product was ordered, indicating growing demand. At $783.8 million, three-month orders for December were up 8.8 percent from the $720.1 million posted in November, and 29.8 percent higher than a year earlier. December shipments totaled $786.1 million, up 14.7 percent from the $685.2 million shipped during November, and 18.4 percent above the figure a year earlier. Despite the apparent upturn, analysts remained cautious. ''Implications of a suggested turnaround based on these numbers would be false,'' said Adam F. Cuhney, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company in San Francisco. ''What you're getting here is a distributor restocking, not of any great magnitude.'' Mr. Cuhney said the results were also tilted by much larger than average gains by a small number of manufacturers in the survey.

180-> SUPER BOWL XXI: PREPARATIONS BEGIN; NOT SO MODESTLY, MCCONKEY EXCELS
Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants has ranked Phil McConkey as the best on his team. McConkey has accepted the honor in the spirit in which it was offered. No, the coach of the Super Bowl Giants is not saying his wide receiver and punt returner is his best player or most talented or most valuable. He is saying McConkey has passed Jim Burt and Leonard Marshall as the No. 1 self-promoter on the team, with Sean Landeta always in the top five. On a losing team, such talk might be tinged with hostility and bitterness. On the Giants - 14-2 during the regular season, 2-0 in the playoffs and preparing for the Super Bowl against Denver - it is part of the kidding often found on winning teams with an easy coach-player relationship. Parcells said McConkey had reached the top by his ability to stir Giants Stadium crowds during the playoffs. McConkey raced along the sideline, waving to the fans, imploring them to cheer. They did. Today, before the Giants left their hotel here for morning meetings and afternoon practice, McConkey laughed about his promotion to No. 1. ''Bill's got something for everybody,'' McConkey said, ''categories for all kinds of guys. My stuff with the crowd is just something that evolved because of my personality. ''If I was to be anything different, I'd be phony. That's just the way I am. I wouldn't try to change it. I wouldn't try to change myself. It doesn't last very long, either.'' ''I'm a very emotional person,'' McConkey said. ''It carries over on the field. I think the fans respond to that. People like to have fun. That's why they pay hard-earned money to see a game. That's entertainment, and enthusiasm is entertainment. When the crowd responds, that provides a boost to the team. That's why they call it the home-field advantage.'' McConkey's enthusiasm also comes from being an underdog. At 5 feet 10 inches and 170 pounds or less, he is a lightweight in a heavyweight's sport. After his graduation from the United States Naval Academy, his pro football career was delayed five years while he served as a Navy helicopter pilot. This is his third season with the Giants, and he almost did not make it. The Giants waived him in the final preseason roster cut, and the Green Bay Packers claimed him. After the fourth game of the season, when the Giants' best wide receiver, Lionel Manuel, suffered an injured knee and their punt returner, Mark Collins, suffered a concussion, the Giants traded a draft choice to the Packers and got McConkey back. He thought they should not have waived him in the first place. ''Being a competitor and an athlete,'' he said, ''you always think you can do the job, so you think they made a mistake when they let you go. I knew I could contribute. ''But I had no anger. How could I be angry or bitter about a man or organization that a couple of years before gave a chance to a 27-year-old guy who hadn't played football in five years? If I never played another down after this year, I would be grateful.'' It was not surprising that the Giants brought back McConkey. Parcells is partial to the overachiever. ''Phil McConkey is a parking-lot player, a street player,'' Parcells once said. ''He's so conscientious and so concerned with doing things right. He can't play when you're supposed to go nine and a half feet and make two moves. I told him once in training camp to quit worrying about who's here and just think about playing a street game.'' McConkey plays the street game well, and he knows that pro football jobs carry no guarantees. ''I'm one of those marginal players who can't take anything for granted,'' McConkey said, ''who has to work his tail off every year to make it. That's O. K. with me. I like it that way.'' PRACTICE 'PRETTY NORMAL' The two-hour practice Monday was ''pretty normal,'' Parcells said. ''We worked mostly on the running game.'' Parcells said Lawrence Taylor, who is nursing a bruised right thigh, was 100 percent sound. As if to confirm that, Taylor was punting before practice. . . . On Sunday night, shortly after the Giants' flight arrived, three players drove to a nearby restaurant in rented cars. As Brad Benson told the story, Jim Burt, in the first car, made an illegal U-turn. Benson, in the second car, followed Burt and was stopped by a highway patrolman. Bill Ard, in the third car, saw the patrolman and decided not to turn. Benson got off with a warning.

181-> AMTRAK CHAIRMAN ATTRIBUTES CRASH TO CONDUCT OF CONRAIL CREW
The chief executive of Amtrak today attributed the fatal collision of a passenger train and three Conrail freight engines to ''the outrageous conduct of the Conrail crew'' and cited several violations of operating procedures. Speaking before a subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Transportation, W. Graham Claytor Jr, president and chairman of Amtrak, harshly criticized the Conrail crew members and suggested that they were ''impared by drugs.'' Citing at least six violations of operating procedures by the Conrail crew, Mr. Claytor said ''the evidence is overwhelming'' that the cause of the accident ''was the outrageous conduct of the Conrail crew in violating not one but a whole series of important operating rules.'' The collision on Jan. 4, which occurred near Baltimore when the Conrail train crossed over to the track being used by the Amtrak train, was the worst in Amtrak's 15-year history. Sixteen people aboard the high-speed passenger train were killed and more than 170 were injured. Crew Experience Is Noted Among the violations Mr. Claytor attributed to the Conrail crew were running past a stop signal, operating the train without a working radio and operating without a working track signal alarm whistle in the engine cab. Federal investigators have said the whistle was tampered with to prevent it from sounding. Asserting that the two Conrail crew members were ''experience people'' who knew standard operating procedures, Mr. Claytor said, ''The only way I can explain what happened is they must have been impaired by drugs.'' The two crew members, an engineer and a brakeman, were given drug and alcohol tests hours after the collision. Toxicological testing on blood and urine samples found the presense of traces of marijuana. Federal investigators, however, have cautioned against drawing conclusions about the cause of the accident or the performance of the crew based solely on drug tests. Richard B. Hasselman, senior vice president for operations for the Philadelphia-based Conrail, who also testified at today's hearing, did not comment on Mr. Claytor's criticism of the crew. Limit on Freight Trains Urged At the hearing, the first of several planned Congressional inquiries into the crash, Mr. Claytor also urged that freight trains be barred from using the same tracks as passenger trains. He said such a move ''is not only feasible but necessary if we are really to solve all aspects of this problem permanently and definitively.''. He also strongly endorsed a National Transportation Safety Board proposal made last week that all trains operating in the Northeast Corridor between, New York and Washington, be equipped with automatic control systems that would stop a train when its engineer failed to take the action called for by track signals. Such systems are on all Amtrak trains and some commuter lines, but not on Conrail engines. ''Had this device been in place on the Conrail engines, it would effectively have prevented this accident in spite of the multiple man-failures encountered,'' Mr. Claytor said. Conrail Has Diverted Trains Mr. Hasselman rejected the idea of eliminating freight operations from the Northeast Corridor, saying it was impossible. He said his company had already diverted substantial traffic from the corridor and ''continues to seek means of diverting further traffic.'' Between Trenton and Newark, for example, the number of scheduled freight trains using the corridor was reduced from 30 to 6 last year. Between Philadelphia and Washington, Conrail rerouted two daily trains to the CSX route, which parallels Amtrak's, and, this year, Conrail plans to divert four more daily trains to the CSX route, Mr. Hasselman said. He added that few other trains could be diverted because most of the remaining traffic serves customers at points along the corridor. However, Mr. Hasselman told the Senate panel members that some agreement could be reached to better coordinate the movement of Conrail trains that could not be diverted from the corridor. Mr. Hasselman also rejected automatic train controls for Conrail engines, saying that the braking procedures required ''can easily result in freight train derailments.'' John H. Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, stopped short of endorsing a requirement for automatic controls for freight trains, but said he was studying the proposal.

182-> ADVERTISING; National Car Rental Chooses Chiat/Day
Chiat/Day New York has been designated the agency for National Car Rental, which has been under new ownership since Jan. 1. Based in Minneapolis, the nation's third-largest car renter had been served by Campbell-Ewald, Detroit, for seven years. The new agency said the billings should be $25 million. The old agency said the billings should be $10 million. The advertiser company was acquired in a leveraged buyout from Household International, Prospect Heights, Ill., by a group of investors led by Paine Webber Capital. Among them were Vincent Wassig, formerly of Holland America Cruises, a former Chiat/Day client, and Hertz. National has about 22 percent of the rental market.

183-> 154 AT THE NEW YORKER PROTEST CHOICE OF EDITOR
In an unusual public protest, 154 writers, cartoonists and editors for The New Yorker - including the reclusive J. D. Salinger - asked Robert A. Gottlieb to withdraw his acceptance as editor of the magazine. But Mr. Gottlieb refused. Named earlier this week to the editorship, effective March 1, he said he intended to take over his new job ''as soon as is convenient and practical.'' The three-paragraph protest letter was drafted by a committee of six whose names were not revealed. It was also scrutinized and corrected by the magazine's fact checkers and proofreaders - as with any piece of copy at The New Yorker - and then sent by messenger Tuesday evening to Mr. Gottlieb, the editor in chief of Alfred A. Knopf. ''The New Yorker has not achieved its preeminence by following orthodox paths of magazine publishing and editing,'' the letter said, ''and it is our strange and powerfully held conviction that only an editor who has been a long-standing member of the staff will have a reasonable chance of assuring our continuity, cohesion, and independence.'' A copy of the letter was simultaneously sent to Samuel I. Newhouse, who appointed Mr. Gottlieb as editor on Tuesday. The Newhouse family owns the magazine and Random House, of which Knopf is a subsidiary. William Shawn, the outgoing editor of the magazine, did not help edit the letter nor did he comment on it, according to sources. A One-Paragraph Reply Mr. Gottlieb gave his one-paragraph reply to Mr. Shawn yesterday during lunch at the Algonquin Hotel, where Mr. Shawn has for years had a regular table. The informal Mr. Gottlieb, who almost never wears a necktie, was dressed in a jacket and tie for the occasion. ''Of course I understand the feelings you express in your letter,'' Mr. Gottlieb's reply said, ''and can even sympathize with them. And I also appreciate the fact that your resistance to my coming is not personal. But I do plan to take up this new job as soon as is convenient and practical, and can only add that I'm looking forward to knowing and working with you all.'' Other signers of the protest letter included Donald and Frederick Barthelme, E. J. Kahn Jr., Whitney Balliett, Jamaica Kincaid, Ann Beattie, Harold Brodkey, Mavis Gallant, Peter De Vries, Roger Angell, Janet Malcolm, Bobbie Ann Mason, John McPhee, Ved Mehta, Howard Moss, Jonathan Schell, Robert Shaplen and Calvin Trillin. The letter originated from a meeting Tuesday afternoon in an 18th-floor hallway of the magazine's offices on West 43d Street, attended by more than 100 confused and angry staff members. On hand was Mr. Shawn, who had been invited to discuss the previous day's events, when Mr. Newhouse informed the 79-year-old Mr. Shawn that he had chosen Mr. Gottlieb as his successor. People who were at the meeting said the staff was angered that Mr. Shawn was in effect being forced to retire, that he was not being allowed to choose his successor, and that an outsider was being brought in. By the time the staff gathered, at about 2 P.M., letters of protest and telephone calls were pouring in. After long discussion, and repeated expressions of anger at the announced change, six people were asked to draft the letter to Mr. Gottlieb. It was completed and the signatures gathered by the end of the afternoon. The appointment of Mr. Gottlieb, the letter said, ''had halted the orderly process, already well along, of providing the magazine with a new editor from within its present ranks.'' The allusion was to Charles (Chip) McGrath, the fiction editor of the magazine, who had been given the title of deputy editor by Mr. Shawn, and who was widely understood within the magazine to be Mr. Shawn's choice as his successor. ''There were no ringleaders,'' one veteran staff writers said of the meeting Tuesday, ''and there was none of the usual, 'Are you with us or against us' rhetoric. Writers, editors, fact checkers and messengers were urged to read it and sign if they agreed.'' The letter did not contain any threats about what the signers might do if Mr. Gottlieb did not heed their advice, and one signer said he did not expect any more protests as a result of Mr. Gottlieb's refusal. ''It was a means of expressing what we felt,'' he said. ''Everyone recognized this wouldn't make it easier for him, but we weren't necessarily trying to make it harder for him, either.'' In tone and construction, the letter was low-keyed and even polite in its references to Mr. Gottlieb. The final paragraph said: ''We wish to assure you - and we should have done so long before this point - that none of these feelings or reservations were directed against you. Many of us know you personally and professionally, and admire your splendid record at Knopf. We also know that you are a reasonable person. With this in mind, and cognizant of your expressed deep admiration and affection for this magazine, we urge that, after consultation with our owner, Mr. Newhouse, you withdraw your acceptance of the post that has been offered to you.''

A chart yesterday on the Washington Talk page, comparing the Congress of today with the first Congress, misstated the number of standing committees in the 99th Congress. The House had 22 and the Senate 16. In addition, it reversed the figures for the number of days each Congress met. In the First Congress the House met 377 days and the Senate 366 days. For the 99th Congress, the House met 281 days and the Senate 313 days.

185-> THE REGION; A Cuomo Budget For Good Times
Governor Cuomo, portraying a state in a happy condition, proposed a budget last week that would increase spending and reduce tax rates. But Democrats and Republicans alike complained, insisting that greater prosperity called for greater tax cuts. The total budget of $40.9 billion, which includes Federal aid, represents an increase of 9.3 percent over the current fiscal year, which ends March 31. State spending, accounting for about two-thirds of the budget, would rise 7 percent; the increase since Mr. Cuomo took office four years ago would be about 50 percent. The Senate Democratic leader, Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, who complained uncharacteristically that the Governor was infringing on legislative power, said, ''We believe there is room in the budget to accommodate additional tax cuts.'' The Republican leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, said that without further tax reductions the budget was ''simply not acceptable.'' New York City officials protested that the 11.5 percent increase in aid to the city would not offset cuts in Federal aid. And for the second time in a month Brooklyn Democrat Mel Miller, the new Assembly Speaker, denounced the Governor's call for a spending cap. Mr. Cuomo said his main concern was education, and he proposed building two more prisons, increasing aid to the homeless and welfare recipients and spending more on AIDS research. The Governor's budget message referred several times to ''the New York idea,'' which Mr. Cuomo described as a balance of compassion and fiscal restraint. It was restraint that he stressed, however. ''We must resist being deceived by a dramatic-sounding tax cut now,'' he said, ''that will next year produce the need for a tax increase or draconian spending.''

186-> DANCE: ROSE AND EPSTEIN PRESENT COMIC WORKS
IMAGINE a choreographer calling for seven volunteers from the audience to come onstage and be the instruments of a not-so-creative process. Imagine that each volunteer plugs in the headphones of a Walkman and then performs simple movements he or she is instructed to do by the tape. Imagine an audience doubling over with laughter as each ''dancer'' interacts with the others while gesturing as stipulated and some Herbie Hancock music is added. Presto, choreography hits the boards. Mitchell Rose and Diane Epstein, who opened the second week of the Joyce Sampler series Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, 19th Street and Eighth Avenue, are responsible for this hilarity. As comic relief, they have come none too soon to drive away the dance season's winter blues. Mr. Rose has been specializing in humor - rare on the dance scene -for some 10 years. Judging by the rush to volunteer for the ''Walkpeople'' piece and the whoops at the curtain calls, Mr. Rose is the cult equivalent of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'' Inside jokes - about dance and show business - are shared by performers and public. The atmosphere is partylike - and there is an occasional amateurishness to the proceedings as well. You don't have to be a professional to play charades. So all right, Mr. Rose and Miss Epstein are not great choreographers. But they have been watching the great and not-so-great and they know the difference. Thus, they are best at parodying style. ''Mime With Props'' is very funny - a reversal of the illusionistic mime that Marcel Marceau and his imitators have made classic. If Mr. Marceau came up against an invisible wall, Mr. Rose comes up against a brick panel marked ''wall.'' The table he leans on is not imaginary. He eats a real banana. There is no denying reality. And yet there is - in Mr. Rose's punch line, as he is pulled upward by tiny balloons. The opening number, ''Slalom Tap,'' is fine - Miss Epstein and Mr. Rose each place two feet in one big saddle shoe and clomp around to ''Tea for Two.'' ''Thirteen Beginnings,'' a satire that is right on target, offers the same number of putative moments that might have opened a range of modern-dance works. Dave Feldman's atmospheric lighting helps define each style. Among the new pieces, ''Stand-Up'' has Mr. Rose reclining - somewhat less than inspired in a spoken monologue - as a comedian. ''Opera Nuova,'' with both performers in homemade Wagnerian gear while mouthing Italian lyrics (Verdi's), wears a bit thin. ''Vaudeville,'' another premiere, is more to the point - its pratfall imagery coming straight out of the movement humor. ''Almozt Art'' the only choreography by Miss Epstein, showed her off as a strong dancer, isolating enough parts of her body to make shaking to Mozart worth looking at. ''A Little Leeway,'' to Peggy Lee recordings, had Miss Epstein ecstatically dancing for joy at the sight of her ''Big Spender.'' The program, to be repeated Saturday at 2 P.M., is fun, suggesting that fantasies can be fulfilled. Mr. Rose was the first dance major at Tufts University: he started as an engineering student.

187-> THE BIG EAST CONFERENCE; STRONG FOUNDATION AT ST. JOHN'S
WHEN Walter Berry decided last spring to skip his final year at St. John's, there was talk about the Redmen having to wear hard hats in practice this season as protection against a roof that was about to cave in. The fears seemed well founded in October. St. John's had not only lost the college player of the year and his 23-points-per-game average, they had also lost Ron Rowan, the 6-foot-3-inch guard who had given St. John's consistent outside scoring. This would also be the first time in four seasons that Lou Carnesecca would not have a consensus all-American in his lineup. Three months later, there are no signs of falling plaster at Alumni Hall. In fact, Carnesecca, who celebrates his 62d birthday today, finds himself reasonably secure under a reinforced roof with new shingles. Picked to finish fifth this season by Big East coaches, St. John's entered conference play at 9-0. While the record was padded by the usual preseason stuffing, St. John's defeated U.C.L.A. several weeks ago and turned heads last week with victories over Virginia and Georgia Tech to win the Holiday Festival. Yesterday the Redmen suffered their first loss of the season, a 62-54 defeat at Villanova that dropped their record to 9-1. ''Right now I feel like a surgeon going into an operation,'' said Carnesecca. ''You never know what you're going to find. You have an idea but you never really know.'' This year's team is not as awesome as the Chris Mullin-Walter Berry-Bill Wennington squad that reached the Final Four in 1985. It is not as explosive as last season's 31-5 team, which shared the regular-season championship with Syracuse and won the Big East tournament. It is, however, more of a team in the traditional sense than any Carnesecca has coached in the last four seasons. Last season's team relied on five players averaging nearly 40 minutes per game. This year, Carnesecca, never known to rely on his bench, is relying on eight, sometimes nine players. He has three ''core'' players in a one-guard, two-forward offense, and relies on contributions from a different substitute each night. He calls it ''playing the hunches.'' The heart of the team is a trio of experienced players - Mark Jackson, the 6-3 senior guard; Willie Glass, the 6-6 senior forward, and Shelton Jones, the 6-9 junior forward. For the last three seasons Jackson, Glass and Jones have been like golden-voiced background singers, embellishing the lead of Mullin and Berry. This season Jackson, Jones and Glass have become lead singers with three distinct styles and peculiar gifts. In 1984-85, Jackson, then a sophomore, was the spark off the bench, while Glass, a starter since his freshman year, concentrated on rebounding and defense. Jones joined the trio last season on a full-time basis and served primarily as a handyman. He rebounded a little, played a little defense and helped break the press. Despite the new elevation, however, the threesome's unusual trademark has been an ability to perform as stars but still function as servants to the greater cause of winning. ''The thing that's impressive about St. John's is that they play within themselves,'' said Terry Holland, the Virginia coach. ''They don't try to do what they can't do. They don't make a lot of mistakes, and they're playing very well together.'' Jackson averaged 11.3 points and 9.1 assists per game last season. This season, he is averaging 15.9 points and 8.1 assists per game. Glass, who averaged 13.3 points last season, is up to 19.9. The most dramatic increase has been Jones, who has gone from 8.5 points per game to 17.8. ''Shelton,'' said Carnesecca, ''can propel you to a different level.'' Unlike the last two seasons, when these three played off Berry or Mullin, there is a greater sense of adventure this season. The ball does not automatically go to the middle, but rather to an opening. For that reason, and by nature of his position, Jackson is the most important player. ''We put a lot of responsibility in Mark's hands,'' said Brian Mahoney, the Redmen's assistant coach. ''He handles the ball 90 percent of the time, and he has to read the defense. Especially this year, when teams are giving him a lot of box-and-ones. Fortunately for Mark, he saw how Chris and Walter handled the different types of defenses. He can handle it. He's proven he's a tough kid.'' Jackson led the nation in assists last season, but this season he's been called on to score. ''Basically, I do whatever has to be done on a given night,'' Jackson said. ''One night it might mean getting 23 points, other nights it might mean passing off for 20 points.'' Glass is the metronome of the group. He says very little, works hard and has sacrificed more than any player to make Carnesecca's system work. ''Willie knows Lou's system better than anyone,'' said Ron Rutledge, another assistant who calls Glass The Quiet Storm. ''He could score 30 points if he wanted to, but that's not always what we need from him. The thing about Willie is that he knows what he has to do for St. John's to win. He doesn't say a lot, he just does.'' Jones is Glass's opposite. Extroverted and volatile with a scorer's disposition, Jones is thriving this season in a system that depends on him to score. ''Last year, I had a job,'' Jones said. ''This year, I have jobs. Last year, I was happy that we won, but I really didn't feel that I was that much a part of it. This year, every game I'm a part of it.'' Said Rutledge: ''Shelton could be the most important player we have because he gives us something we can't get from anybody else. He gives us a weapon like we had in Walter.'' With its former role-players now playing starring roles, St. John's has had to find a new supporting cast. This season, it features Matt Brust, the 6-5 sophomore guard; Marco Baldi, the 6-11 sophomore center; John Hempel, the 6-7 senior forward, and Steve Shurina, the 6-3 junior guard. So far they are contributing 18.1 points a game combined. Terry Bross, a 6-9 junior who is starting at center, has given St. John's the type of unobtrusive but above average performances that complement Jackson, Glass and Jones. Baldi still lacks the mobility and quick reflexes to play in fast-paced games, but he is valuable in physical, half-court slugfests. ''The success of this team is not going to come from Mark, Willie and Shelton,'' said Mahoney. ''The success will come from the play of Terry, Marco, Matt, Shurina and Lewis. That's going to be the chemistry of the team.'' The mystery for St. John's has been the the shooting-guard position. Three players - Brust, Shurina and Elander Lewis - have manned the position and no one has signed his name to it. Lewis, the freshman from Albany, currently starts and has become more aggressive and sure of himself. ''I'll have to play that by ear, but it doesn't really bother me,'' Carnesecca said. ''Even when you're set, you have to make changes, so why give yourself a false sense of security? So far, St. John's has dealt with the situation very well. But as Carnesecca said: ''Really, our season's just beginning.'' MORE EVERY YEAR How the three key members of this year's team have improved and increased their contributions at St. John's.

188-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
Secretary of State George P. Shultz's plan to meet Wednesday with Oliver Tambo, leader of the African National Congress, a militant anti-apartheid organization banned by South Africa, has stirred consternation among conservative Republicans. Their sharp reaction has created a ticklish political situation for Mr. Shultz. If he accedes to the demand that he cancel the meeting, he can expect a firestorm of criticism from black leaders and others in this country and abroad who oppose South Africa's system of race laws. If he goes through with the meeting, as expected, he risks alienating some of President Reagan's important anti-Communist supporters at a time when Mr. Reagan needs their help in the Iran-contra affair. Mr. Tambo is scheduled to arrive in Washington today for a four-day visit. His scheduled meeting with Mr. Shultz impelled 14 members of the House, led by Dan Burton of Indiana, a member of the Foreign Affairs Commitee, to sign a petition urging Mr. Shultz to cancel the meeting. They said, in part, ''We do not understand, in light of your own strong oppostion to terrorism, and President Reagan's clear condemnation of 'calculated terror' by the A.N.C., why you would consider a meeting with Oliver Tambo any more than you would a meeting with Yasir Arafat.'' Jesse Helms of North Carolina, ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, joined Mr. Burton to form the Coalition Against A.N.C. Terrorism, a group designed to press Mr. Shultz to cancel the meeting. The coaltion plans a protest rallly at the State Department at the time of the Wednesday afternoon meeting.

189-> 2 TOP SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS DISMISSED IN STUDENT'S DEATH
President Chun Doo Hwan, acting to defuse a political crisis, dismissed his Interior Minister and his National Police Chief today after the Government's admission that the police had tortured a student to death. Mr. Chun had earlier made a public apology for what he called the ''shocking incident'' last week in which the student, Park Chong Chol, 21 years old, died of suffocation during interrogation by two officers of the country's special anti-Communist police squad. The Interior Minister, Kim Chong Hoh, and the National Police Chief, Kang Min Chang, formally resigned today, accepting responsibility for Mr. Park's death. President Chun quickly named a new Interior Minister, Chung Ho Yong, a former general who, as commander of the South Korean Special Forces, helped stage the 1979 coup that brought Mr. Chun to power. He also promoted the Seoul police commander, Lee Yong Chang, to replace Mr. Kang. Head Plunged Into Water The moves today came after an outburst of public anger over the death of Mr. Park, a linguistics student at Seoul National University who was picked up last Wednesday, accused of anti-Government agitation. Police Chief Kang told reporters on Monday that Mr. Park was suspected of having sheltered a fugitive leftist radical. Mr. Kang said the two officers twice plunged Mr. Park's head into a bath filled with water in an attempt to make him reveal the fugitive's whereabouts. On the second occasion, he said, they crushed his throat against the bath rim, suffocating him. The two officers were said to have been arrested. News of the death stirred public outrage, with opposition leaders and dissidents claiming it was just ''the tip of the iceberg'' of widespread, institutionalized torture of political offenders. Officials of the opposition New Korea Democratic Party said the death illustrated common police practices in trying to make Government critics admit to pro-Communist sympathies. Killing Called Isolated Case The Seoul Government, which has been trying to forge a better image in advance of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games to be held in Seoul, has called the Park incident an isolated case. It has also denied consistently that the country holds political prisoners.

190-> COMPANY NEWS; Goodyear's Shares Top Tender Offer
Shareholders of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company tendered more than 85.2 million shares under the company's offer to buy back up to 40 million common shares at $50 each, Goodyear said. The tender offer expired at midnight Friday, and because the number of shares tendered exceeded the buyback offer, some shares will not be accepted. Goodyear said it would determine a prorating factor for returning those shares. Goodyear's stock closed today at $44 a share, up $1, on the New York Stock Exchange. Goodyear also may have a slightly stronger balance sheet than expected as a result of its restructuring to thwart a takeover attempt by the financier Sir James M. Goldsmith. In remarks made Friday at a plant in Oklahoma, Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company hoped to raise $3 billion from the sale of assets. That is at least $500 million more than analysts had been estimating.

192-> THE CASE FOR BAKING PASTRY SHELLS 'BLIND,' AT LOW HEAT
NANCY SILVERTON didn't realize that it was unusual to bake tart shells ''blind'' (unfilled) at a moderate-to-low oven temperature. But that is precisely what Ms. Silverton, a pastry chef and consultant in California, recommends in her new book, ''Desserts'' (Harper & Row, $22.50). So do Wolfgang Puck, chef-owner of Spago in Los Angeles, in the ''Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'' (Random House, $19.95), David Liederman of David's Cookies and Chez Louis, and Nicholas Malgieri, who teaches pastry-making at Peter Kump's New York Cooking School. In almost all cookbooks, the recommended temperature for baking a pie or tart pastry blind is 425 to 450 degrees. Pamela A. Asquith's ''The Fruit Tart Cookbook'' (Harmon Books, 1982) even tells readers that baking a crust at too low a temperature might make it tough. Flo Braker's book, ''The Simple Art of Perfect Baking'' (Morrow, 1985) says pastries should not be baked at 350 degrees because the dough ''would not form steam quickly for flaky expansion - its texture would not be at its best.'' High-temperature baking of pastry crust is necessary, bakers such as these insist, so that the dough is ''seized'' in the hot oven, which quickly sets the blended fat and flour and prevents the dough from becoming tough or shrinking. It also insures that the butter doesn't ooze out. But Ms. Silverton's pastry recipes prove otherwise. Her sweet pastry has a high butter content. Yet, baked at a low temperature, it emerged perfectly crisped, not at all tough, and held up beautifully even after moist fillings were added. Not a drop of butter oozed. Weighted during baking, it did not shrink. In another departure from accepted practice, Ms. Silverton recommends baking the pastry completely, not partly, before adding fillings that require further baking. Again, tradition is confounded: An additional 25 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees, filled, did not cause the finished crust to overbake. ''In writing my book I simply adapted the method I have been using in the restaurant to home equipment,'' Ms. Silverton explained. She had been pastry chef at Wolfgang Puck's Spago in Los Angeles, where she baked pastry at 325 degrees in a convection oven. (A convection oven tends to bake faster than conventional kitchen equipment.) ''I found that most home ovens baked too hot and had hot spots,'' she said. ''And 350 degrees was the temperature that seemed to produce results in the home kitchen that were closest to the restaurant.'' In the ''Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'' just published by Random House ($19.95), pastry for a creme brulee tart, similar to a recipe in Ms. Silverton's book, is baked blind at 350 degrees. Ms. Silverton's method is uncommon, but it is not unique. While she was developing her recipes on the West Coast, in New York David Liederman, owner of David's Cookies, accidentally began baking pie pastry at low temperatures for his restaurant, Chez Louis. ''One morning the day baker was supposed to have baked the crusts completely,'' Mr. Liederman recalled, ''but the oven was too slow and they were still nearly raw after 10 minutes. I put them back in at a low temperature to continue baking.'' After another 20 minutes or so, he said, the fully-baked crusts were uniform and flaky. He now bakes all his pie pastry at 300 degrees. Moreover in finishing pies, even fruit pies with baked fillings, Mr. Liederman uses completely baked crusts. Mr. Liederman said he knew this was an unconventional method and wondered about the logic of it. ''If I want my cookies to have a chewy inside I bake them at high temperature for a short time,'' he said. ''But I don't want pie pastry like that.'' In finishing the pies, even fruit pies with baked fillings, Mr. Liederman uses completely baked crusts. Flo Braker agreed: ''For crisp cookies I use a lower temperature for a longer time, so why wouldn't it work for a pie? Besides, at a lower temperature for a longer time, you have more tolerance, more control, so it might make it easier for people to learn and have less to worry about.'' She plans to try it. Peter Kump, owner of Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, said he has never tried the low-heat method and was skeptical of its success. ''I'm happy with my crusts the way they are,'' Mr. Kump said, ''and I'm willing to match them against anybody's.'' But Mr. Malgieri, a pastry teacher at the school, said he bakes pastry at 375 degrees because the results are more uniform. And he, too, fully bakes his pastry, even when it is going to be rebaked with a filling. ''There are a number of points you see in cookbook after cookbook that are never questioned but might not be entirely accurate,'' Ms. Silverton said. ''It always bothered me, for example, that books say to cream butter, then add the sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy. In my experience the butter is light and fluffy until you add the sugar, but not afterward.'' All the bakers who use the low-heat method caution that it is suitable only for sweet or flaky tart or pie crusts, not for puff pastry. NANCY SILVERTON'S SWEET PASTRY 2 3/4 cups flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 8 ounces unsalted butter 2 egg yolks 1/4 cup heavy cream. 1. Sift flour into a large bowl or the work bowl of a food processor. Stir in the sugar. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and toss with the flour mixture until the cubes are coated. 2. By hand, crumble the butter into the flour by working it with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse meal, or process it by pulsing in a food processor until the corn meal consistency is achieved. 3. Whisk together the egg yolks and cream. If using a food processor, add the egg yolk and cream mixture through the feed tube, processing only until the dough comes together to form a ball. Otherwise, dribble the egg-cream liquid onto the flour mixture and mix lightly until the dough can be gathered into a ball. You may have to add another tablespoon or two of cream. 4. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and, with the heel of your hand, lightly push the dough away from you little by little on the surface. This technique, known as fraisage, is not necessary if the dough has been mixed in a food processor. 5. Divide the dough into two flat balls, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate two hours before using. 6. Roll out dough to a circle 2 inches larger than your pan, making it 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. Line pan, carefully pressing the dough into the corners and trim the edge. Chill for one hour. 7. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 8. Completely line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper, aluminum foil or flat coffee filters and weight with dry beans or pastry weights. Make sure the pan is completely covered with the weights and that they are pressed into the corners. 9. Bake for 25 minutes. If the pastry is not completely golden brown, remove paper and weights, return pastry to oven and continue baking another 5 to 10 minutes. Cool, then add filling of your choice and continue baking, or use with an unbaked filling. Yield: Two 9-inch or 10-inch pie or tart shells. NOTE: To make lemon or orange pastry, first scald 6 tablespoons of the heavy cream with 1/4 cup finely chopped orange or lemon zest, remove from heat, cover and stand for 30 minutes. Strain the cream, adding enough additonal cream to make the 1/4 cup listed among the ingredients above. Return 1 tablespoon of the zest to the cream, chill the cream, then proceed with the recipe. NANCY SILVERTON'S GINGER PASTRY 2 ounces fresh ginger root 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon molasses 2 cups flour 2 tablespoons ground ginger 5 ounces unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks) 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar, packed. 1. Peel ginger root, slice into 1/4-inch-thick rounds, place in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and boil 30 seconds. Drain. 2. In a small saucepan scald the blanched ginger root and cream. Remove from heat, cover and let stand 30 minutes. Strain, discarding the ginger. Chill. 3. Whisk the egg yolk and molasses into the cream. Sift the flour and ground ginger together. Now, follow the directions in the Sweet Pastry recipe, above, using the brown sugar in place of the granulated sugar. Yield: pastry for a 10-inch or 12-inch tart. DAVID LIEDERMAN'S CHOCOLATE-CHUNK WALNUT PIE The pastry: 1 1/3 cups unsifted flour 3 tablespoons sugar Pinch of salt 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced 3 tablespoons ice water (approximately) The filling: 1 1/2 sticks soft butter 1/2 cup sugar 4 eggs 2 tablespoons flour 1 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 6 cups coarsely chopped walnuts 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably Cailler or Lindt, chopped. 1. To make pastry, combine flour, sugar and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Add butter, then process, pulsing, until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add water slowly through the feed tube, with the machine running, and process just until the dough comes together. Chilling the dough is not necessary but may make it easier for inexperienced bakers to handle. 2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Roll out pastry on a lightly floured board to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Fit into a 10-inch pie or tart pan. Line with foil, weight with pastry weights or dry beans and bake 20 minutes. Remove foil and weights and continue baking 10 to 15 minutes longer, until the pastry is golden. 3. Cream butter and sugar together. Beat in eggs. Add flour, maple syrup, salt, vanilla extract, nuts and chocolate. Pour into prepared pastry shell. Bake for 40 minutes, until filling is fairly firm to the touch. Allow to cool before cutting. Yield: One 10-inch pie or tart.

193-> PERES ASSERTS ISRAEL WARNED OF 1-IN-4 ODDS IN IRAN DEAL
When Israel recommended to the United States in January 1986 that it engage in an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran, Israel cautioned the Reagan Administration that there was at best a 25 percent chance of success, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres was quoted as saying today. This assessment contradicts the Jan. 17, 1986, memorandum made public by the White House last week, in which Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser, quoted Israeli officials as saying that all the remaining American hostages in Lebanon would be released once the United States began shipping weapons to Iran. This reported Israeli advice was apparently used by the national security adviser to persuade the President to resume the arms shipments to Iran that had begun in August 1985, but which the President later halted because they failed to bring the release of more than one hostage. [ In Washington, a senior White House official familiar with classified documents concerning the secret policy toward Iran, challenged the Israeli view, saying he ''had seen nothing'' to suggest any qualification in terms of the possibility for success. ''There was no kind of calibration by the Israelis,'' he said. However, the official said he based that view only on the documents that he had seen. ] Mr. Peres testified today in closed session before the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of Parliament on the Iran affair. U.S. Informed of Difficulties According to officials who heard his testimony, Mr. Peres stated that Amiram Nir, the Prime Minister's adviser on terrorism and the principle liaison between the United States and Israel in the Iran deal last January, told him that when he discussed the arms-for-hostages proposal with Admiral Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North he made it clear that the chances of it resulting in the release of all the hostages was ''at best 25 percent.'' Mr. Peres also stated today that Israel kept United States representatives fully informed about the difficulties of negotiating with the Iranians, said officials who heard his testimony. Israeli officials said the Jan. 17 Poindexter memorandum to President Reagan did not reflect the totality of Israel's advice. The memorandum cited a plan put forward by Mr. Nir on behalf of Mr. Peres, who was then Prime Minister, to sell arms to Iran as part of a broad effort to establish ties with purportedly moderate elements in Teheran while also gaining the release of the remaining American hostages in Lebanon. The Israeli advice, these officials said, was that while Israel supported the concept of using arms to open a channel to Teheran, Israel was much more cautious about its chances of success. For some reason, said the Israeli officials, Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North, decided not to include the Israeli caveats. 'We Warned Them of Difficulties' ''How can anyone say we pushed them into it when we warned them all the time of the difficulties,'' Mr. Peres reportedly testified today, regarding the Israeli discussions with the Americans. ''It is ridiculous to claim that the United States was urged into this by us and I assume that nobody is making such a claim seriously.'' Mr. Nir has refused to answer reporters' questions on this subject, and at this time there is no way of independently corraborating the statements attributed to him by Mr. Peres and other Israeli officials. Mr. Nir became close to Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North during the Iran operation. Israeli officials said he accompanid Colonel North and Robert C. McFarlane, Admiral Poindexter's predecessor as national security adviser, to Teheran in May 1986, and also joined Colonel North in at least one meeting in Europe with a senior Iranian cabinet minister and a senior Ayatollah last winter. In both the meeting in Europe and the visit to Teheran Mr. Nir was presented to the Iranians as an American, the Israeli officials said. No Tie to Money for Contras Speaking to reporters after his appearance before Parliament, Mr. Peres again asserted that ''Israel was not involved in any way in passing money to the Nicaraguan contras and also was not aware this was going on; Israel did what she did as a loyal friend and we have no regrets.'' Asked if he believed that there were some elements in Washington who were trying to make Israel the scapegoat, Mr. Peres responded: ''It could be that there are such factions, but I am not familiar with them. Yesterday the President sent a message to the Prime Minister and myself which said that no accusations are being made toward Israel. There is virtually no Senator who has visited Israel, or even in the United States, who has not declared that Israel is not being accused of anything.'' Addressing his questioner, Mr. Peres said, ''Why do you always pull the foreign fire towards us?''

194-> The Right Minimum Wage: $0.00
The Federal minimum wage has been frozen at $3.35 an hour for six years. In some states, it now compares unfavorably even with welfare benefits available without working. It's no wonder then that Edward Kennedy, the new chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, is being pressed by organized labor to battle for an increase. No wonder, but still a mistake. Anyone working in America surely deserves a better living standard than can be managed on $3.35 an hour. But there's a virtual consensus among economists that the minimum wage is an idea whose time has passed. Raising the minimum wage by a substantial amount would price working poor people out of the job market. A far better way to help them would be to subsidize their wages or - better yet - help them acquire the skills needed to earn more on their own. An increase in the minimum wage to, say, $4.35 would restore the purchasing power of bottom-tier wages. It would also permit a minimum-wage breadwinner to earn almost enough to keep a family of three above the official poverty line. There are catches, however. It would increase employers' incentives to evade the law, expanding the underground economy. More important, it would increase unemployment: Raise the legal minimum price of labor above the productivity of the least skilled workers and fewer will be hired. If a higher minimum means fewer jobs, why does it remain on the agenda of some liberals? A higher minimum would undoubtedly raise the living standard of the majority of low-wage workers who could keep their jobs. That gain, it is argued, would justify the sacrifice of the minority who became unemployable. The argument isn't convincing. Those at greatest risk from a higher minimum would be young, poor workers, who already face formidable barriers to getting and keeping jobs. Indeed, President Reagan has proposed a lower minimum wage just to improve their chances of finding work. Perhaps the mistake here is to accept the limited terms of the debate. The working poor obviously deserve a better shake. But it should not surpass our ingenuity or generosity to help some of them without hurting others. Here are two means toward that end: Wage supplements. Government might subsidize low wages with cash or payments for medical insurance, pensions or Social Security taxes. Alternatively, Washington could enlarge the existing earned income tax credit, a ''negative'' income tax paying up to $800 a year to working poor families. This would permit better targeting, since minimum-wage workers in affluent families would not be eligible. Training and education. The alternative to supplementing income for the least skilled workers is to raise their earning power in a free labor market. In the last two decades, dozens of programs to do that have produced mixed results at a very high cost. But the concept isn't necessarily at fault; nurturing the potential of individuals raised in poverty is very difficult. A humane society would learn from its mistakes and keep trying. The idea of using a minimum wage to overcome poverty is old, honorable - and fundamentally flawed. It's time to put this hoary debate behind us, and find a better way to improve the lives of people who work very hard for very little.

195-> Ford Expected To Top G.M.
The Ford Motor Company will top the industry leader, the General Motors Corporation, in profits in 1986 and in the next two years, analysts interviewed by an industry trade journal predicted. Ford has been expected for months to show a higher profit than G.M. when its 1986 results are reported in mid-February, with $3.1 billion expected for Ford compared with $2.6 billion predicted for GM. But in Monday's edition of the weekly trade journal Automotive News, analysts predicted Ford would repeat the performance in 1987 and 1988.

196-> LLOYD AND WIGGINS OF ROCKETS BANNED FOR DRUG USE
Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins of the Houston Rockets were banned from the National Basketball Rockets were banned from the National Basketball Association yesterday after having tested positive for cocaine. David Stern, the league's commissioner, announced the suspenions, which were made under provisions of an agreement on drug testing reached in 1983 by the league and its players association, at a hurriedly called news conference at the Sheraton Centre. The 27-year-old Lloyd, one of Houston's starting guards, and Wiggins, also 27, a backup guard, may apply for reinstatement in two years. According to Stern, the N.B.A. learned of the players' drug use from a tip, which the commissioner said ''would be adequate to cause a magistrate to issue a search warrant.'' Stern refused to divulge the nature of the information, saying only that the league has security personnel in every league city and throughout the nation. When evidence of drug use reaches the league or the players' union, they are required under the provisions of the drug agreement to submit the information to R. Harcourt Dodds, a former assistant United States Attorney and former Deputy New York City Police Commissioner, who is charged with the responsibility of evaluating the information. If he finds sufficient evidence of drug use, he orders the player tested. Both Ordered to Take Tests The N.B.A. presented Dodd with the information about Lloyd and Wiggins last Friday and he ordered both players to submit to testing. The tests were administered in Houston on Saturday morning and the positive results were returned Monday night by the Pola Laboratory of South Plainfield, N.J. Lloyd and Wiggins were notified of the league's ban in Houston by Horace Balmer, the league's director of security. They then met with Charles Grantham, the vice president of the players association, and two drug counselors. Both players agreed to an offer from the N.B.A. of drug rehabilitation at league expense and were flown immediately to the Adult Substance Abuse Program Drug Rehabilitation Center in Van Nuys, Calif. Lloyd and Wiggins are the third and fourth players banned under the drug agreement. Micheal Ray Richardson, the former Nets' playmaker, and John Drew, the former Atlanta Hawk and Utah Jazz star, are the others. However, the circumstances of the bans differ. Under the terms of the agreement, a player who comes forward and admits to the use of drugs is given three opportunities for rehabilitation. The first time, he remains on the payroll and receives treatment at league expense. The second time, he is removed from the payroll but is treated, also at league expense. The third time, he is banned. Richardson, who was dropped from the league last February, had been given his three chances before he was banned. Drew was banned last January. He had not played in the N.B.A. since December 1984, when he was waived by the Utah Jazz because of repeated drug abuse. In an effort to rejoin the league he appealed the ban, but the league ruling was upheld. Players Didn't Come Forward Lloyd and Wiggins failed to come forward on their own, and thus there were no second chances. ''They had plenty of chances to come forward,'' said Stern. ''The underpinnings of the N.B.A.'s anti-drug program are forceful and clearly stated. Any player voluntarily coming forward and seeking help is entitled to receive, without penalty or loss of salary, the finest rehabilitation treatment that the N.B.A. and its players can secure. Our anti-drug program is not passive. We are constantly counseling our players about the treatment.'' The expulsion of Lloyd and Wiggins put the Rockets under the salary cap. They will be able to replace the players at comparable salaries. In Houston, Bill Fitch, the Rockets' coach, said: ''You can't measure what happened in terms of wins and losses. I met with the club right after we got the news and it's the type of thing that should not happen to any club, but I suspect we will react in positive ways.'' Coach Was Fooled In response to a question on whether he had suspected the use of drugs by Lloyd and Wiggins, Fitch said that this had ''taught me a lot about lying.'' ''They'll look you straight in the eye every time and deny it and that's frustrating,'' he said. ''Now you can go back and second-guess just like replaying a basketball game and see things you might have overlooked. No one ever came up to me and said, 'I know this for sure.' '' The announcement was taken with dismay and surprise by Rockets players as they arrived for a home game last night against Phoenix. ''There was no indication of anything like this, they acted just like they had since I've known them,'' said Rodney McCray, a forward. ''We lost a lot of our club. It affects me personally because they are my teammates and friends. It hit us where it hurts.'' No Extra Pressure Dirk Minniefield, a guard, said he felt no extra pressure because the Rockets' guard ranks had been depleted. ''We've just got to chalk this up as one more bitter pill and hope that it makes us stronger,'' Minniefield said. ''It's unfortunate it happened at a time when we were just getting over some other problems.'' John Lucas, who was dropped by the Rockets for the second time March 14, 1986 after tests showed he had been using drugs, said: ''I hope we as a society are finally learning to deal with this problem. I also hope these guys can take a negative and turn it into a positive.'' Lucas has been undergoing drug rehabilitation in Houston and works with other drug patients at Houston International Hospital.

197-> TALK FALTER IN L.I.R.R. WALKOUT; SERIOUS COMMUTER TIE-UPS FEARED
Negotiators for the Long Island Rail Road and 11 unions met yesterday for the first time since the line was struck, but any optimism about an early end to the walkout soon faded. The strike, the fifth in 15 years for the nation's busiest commuter railroad, had little effect on highway traffic because of the Federal holiday. But officials, fearing serious problems this morning, urged commuters to use express bus services or car pools to ease tie-ups on roads leading to Manhattan. Union leaders seemed rested and hopeful when they arrived at the J.F.K. Airport Hilton Inn for meetings called by the railroad's president, Bruce C. McIver. But after a midafternoon session with negotiators for the line, Robert A. Waidler, general chairman of Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, said his union would join the strike begun Sunday by the Long Island's engineers and police officers. Talks Called 'Regressive' ''Negotiations, as they stand now, are regressive, unacceptable,'' Mr. Waidler said. ''We came here prepared to negotiate in good faith, but they pulled off the table items that had already been agreed to.'' Expressing similar sentiments last night, John A. Caggiano, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and chief bargainer for a coalition of five shop craft unions, said his group had also joined the strike. All the railroad's unions had pledged to honor the walkout, but the strike declarations indicated a hardening of positions and a deteriorating atmosphere in the two-year-old labor dispute. Mr. McIver said he intended to keep talking with the union leaders. But he, too, said he was not optimistic. ''I can't say that we are making very much progress,'' he said. ''We seem unable to get over the basic obstacles.'' Brain Dolan, a spokesman for the railroad, said late last night that no further talks were scheduled, but that negotiators were exploring the possibility of resuming the talks this morning. Highway traffic moved relatively smoothly yesterday through Suffolk and Nassau Counties. Many commuters appeared to be staying home, either because of the holiday marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or because of fears of strike-related tie-ups. Longer delays than usual were reported where the Long Island Expressway crosses the Grand Central Parkway in Queens and at the toll booths to the Queens Midtown Tunnel. There were also long lines to enter a special park-and-ride lot at Shea Stadium early in the day, although additional entrances were opened later. New York City's Bureau of Traffic said traffic was unusually heavy in the city during the evening rush, complicated by icy roads. An hour-and-a-half tie-up was reported at the Manhattan side of the Midtown Tunnel, and some motorists said it took two hours to cross the borough. Traffic Jams Feared Today Officials say far more serious traffic jams are likely today if commuters do not use public transportation or share cars. ''There is no way that the roads of Manhattan can accommodate the over 100,000 Long Island Rail Road riders if they all drive in,'' said Ross Sandler, the city's Transportation Commissioner. ''The entire length of the Long Island Expressway could be a problem -bumper-to-bumper traffic backed up all through Queens - if people don't heed our warning,'' he said. A railroad strike creates special traffic problems because of the city's relatively limited access from Queens and Brooklyn. There are only 26 lanes for vehicles into Manhattan: 3 at the Midtown Tunnel, 7 at the 59th Street Bridge, 4 at the Triborough Bridge, 6 at the Williamsburg Bridge, 3 at the Manhattan Bridge and 3 at the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. Drivers Face Double Trouble Officials say they expect the Queens crossings to bear the brunt of the traffic, with the Williamsburg Bridge serving as a release valve. And, they add, drivers who do make it into Manhattan may also be confronted with a shortage of parking spaces. The railroad labor dispute dates to December 1984, when the line's previous contract with workers expired. Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, two Presidential panels were appointed to attempt to resolve the dispute and two 120-day cooling-off periods elapsed. In the last few months, five of the line's unions - representing conductors, clerks, ticket sellers, yard masters and supervisors - accepted a new contract that provides for a wage increase of about 20 percent over 4 1/2 years, retroactive to 1985. The contract also includes measures to contain the cost of health coverage, and it establishes a new, less costly pension plan for new employees. Unions representing 60 percent of the line's 6,600 organized workers have rejected the offer. They include engineers, machinists, carmen, boilermakers, laborers, electricians, sheet-metal workers, track workers, signalmen, police officers and supervisors. Railroad Cautions Unions Mr. McIver cautioned those unions yesterday that the railroad had limited resources. ''We have reached what I consider to be reasonable agreements with two of our largest unions,'' he said, urging restraint by ''our employees, who for many years have enjoyed benefits and wages and pensions beyond anything else in the industry.'' The railroad says the base salary of the average employee is $31,190 a year. Several union leaders said yesterday that they could accept the railroad's wage offer, provided it could be restructured to meet their groups' individual needs. They said railroad negotiators were not cooperating. Engineers Seek Extra Pay Even if other unions come to terms, the negotiators would still have to satisfy the engineers' demand for wage superiority, which was eliminated after the United Transportation Union, representing conductors, achieved parity. Although that union has already accepted a contract, it has a letter obligating the railroad to match any better deal negotiated by another union. Governor Cuomo's labor adviser, Thomas F. Hartnett, who was at yesterday's talks, asked the engineers and several other unions to submit to binding arbitration. Under the plan, striking workers would return to their jobs and negotiations would continue during a 28-day cooling off period. After that, any remaining disputes would be submitted to an impartial panel.

198-> A FAULTY OFFENSE HAMPERS REDMEN
It will be interesting to see how Coach Lou Carnesecca responds to his team's third Big East loss of the season. For the first time in three seasons, St. John's, which rallied from 17 points behind only to drop a 64-63 decision at Syracuse on Saturday, finds itself in something of a life-or-death situation. A loss to Villanova at Alumni Hall on Tuesday would seriously jeopardize the Redmen's hopes of catching or even tying Syracuse for the Big East regular-season championship. The Orangemen are 17-1 over all, 6-0 in the conference, with victories over Villanova and St. John's. St. John's (13-3, 4-3) lost to Villanova earlier this month, then lost to Georgetown. Saturday's loss to Syracuse put St. John's in the position of having to sweep its return matches with those teams and not falter against any other conference teams. The larger concern for St. John's, and the question being raised by fans, is whether the Redmen have what it takes to beat the nation's top teams in post-season competition. Five weeks ago, when the Redmen were 9-0 - and even as late as last Monday's victory at Pittsburgh - the answer seemed obvious. Offense Is Weak But despite Saturday's comeback at Syracuse, and even the victory over blunder-prone Pitt, one wonders if St. John's can survive on defense alone. The Redmen have limited Big East opponents to 44.2 percent shooting, but have managed to shoot only 44.4 percent themselves. When the Redmen's defense breaks down, as it did in the first half against the Orange, the results can be disastrous. ''Down the road, this team will be tough to beat,'' said Mark Jackson. ''We have a talented group of players. This was just a tough game; Syracuse is a good team. But we'll be right back. ''Coach said that Syracuse is a Final Four team. We were down by 17, we scratched and clawed our way back into it. We feel that we can play with anyone in the country.'' Freshmen Share Key Position The problem has been at shooting guard, a position held last year by Ron Rowan, who now plays in the Continental Basketball Association, and for the three years before that by Chris Mullin. Elander Lewis began the season at shooting guard, then gave way to Matt Brust on Jan. 17. Now Lewis and Horace Broadnax, another freshman, share time as Brust's replacement. The three have accounted for 48 points in St. John's seven Big East games, though Brust has come through with defense and rebounding. ''We've got to do the best with what we have,'' Carnesecca said. Reminded that the team was 4-3 in the Big East, Carnesecca bristled. ''So what do we do, throw in the chips?'' he asked. ''We gotta play. Sunday and Monday we prepare for Villanova. We'll prepare the same way, and hope we play harder. That's all you can do. It's a long way yet.''

199-> MATTINGLY SEEKING $1.97 MILLION PACT
Don Mattingly, generally recognized by baseball people as the best player in the game, surprised a lot of baseball people yesterday by submitting a figure of less than $2 million for salary arbitration. Dwight Gooden surprised the Mets by handing in a salary nearly $500,000 greater than their figure. Mattingly's $1,975,000 was the highest figure ever submitted by a playerfor salary arbitration. The Yankees' $1.7 million was the highest ever filed by a team. However, the Yankees' first baseman had been expected to try for $2 million or more, and he was given an excellent chance of winning, especially in light of the Yankees' $1.7 million figure. Jim Rice of Boston and Eddie Murray of Baltimore, who play in the Yankees' division, will earn more than $2 million next season, and Mattingly's performance last season and over the past three seasons compared favorably with theirs. ''It's just something we went through and reviewed and discussed and that's what we ended up with,'' Jim Krivacs, Mattingly's agent, said. ''We'll continue negotiating with the Yankees and see what happens.'' 8 Seek at Least $1 Million Mattingly, who last season earned a $1,375,000 salary that was negotiated on the eve of his arbitration hearing, was one of eight players who submitted figures greater than $1 million. Jack Morris of Detroit and Wade Boggs of Boston were at $1.85 million, Gooden at $1.8 million, Jesse Barfield and George Bell of Toronto at $1.35 million and $1,325,000, respectively, Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles at $1.1 million and Ron Darling of the Mets at $1.05 million. The Mets went in at $1.32 million for Gooden, the salary he earned last season, and $800,000 for Darling, who earned $440,000 last year after losing a bid for $615,000 in arbitration. Because Gooden asked for such a hefty raise after his 17-6 season, the Mets very likely could have won easily if they had submitted even a small raise. They still could win, but they probably made their case more difficult by only matching the pitcher's 1986 salary. ''I'm surprised at the difference,'' Al Harazin, a Mets vice president, told reporters on a telephone conference call. ''I thought I had convinced them we were not thinking of a large increase. This is the one that startled me. It came out of left field. We expected them to come in at 1.5 or 1.6 tops.'' Harazin said he hoped to be able to settle all seven of the Mets' cases before they reach hearings but indicated Gooden, Darling and Kevin McReynolds would be the most difficult to resolve. The Mets went in at $625,000 for McReynolds, who asked $825,000. Other Mets and their figures, the club's first: Wally Backman, $500,000-$600,000; Doug Sisk, $300,000-$368,000; Howard Johnson, $265,000-$320,000 and Tim Teufel $240,000 and $315,000. Backman, who may reach agreement with the Mets on a three-year contract, and Teufel joined Darling in losing in arbitration last year. Talks on Mattingly 2-Year Pact Krivacs, Mattingly's agent, said he and George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, have discussed various proposals on a two-year contract and planned to meet later this week to continue their negotiations. Wherever they end up, though, Steinbrenner will have made his point. He said earlier in the offseason that Mattingly would not be a $2 million player, and Mattingly insured the accuracy of that statement with his figure yesterday. Other Yankees who filed: Cecilio Guante, $380,000-$455,000; Ron Kittle, $400,000-$450,000 and Charlie Hudson, $265,000 and $350,000. The Yankees' figure for Hudson represents a cut from his $277,500 salary last year, Several players saw their clubs submit cuts for 1987, including Hershiser, who gained a $1 million salary in arbitration a year ago. Hershiser, who had a 19-3 record in 1985, was 14-14 last season, and the Dodgers put in at $800,000, which represents the maximum 20 percent cut. Hershiser sought a $100,000 raise. The most unusual numbers of the day were those submitted by the Atlanta Braves and David Palmer, one of their pitchers. They each put in $725,000, which means they don't have to do anything else. The Braves' figure surprised Palmer because it was $225,000 greater than their last offer in negotiations.

200-> Sailing a Boat Can Be Heavenly
To the Sports Editor: About once every three years, usually about the time of the America's Cup extravaganza, we read that ''yacht racing involves a little more excitement than watching grass grow.'' At least Red Smith, who made the original comment, was referring to ''watching'' races as opposed to racing. Racing a sailboat is a participant sport that rarely attracts more than a handful of spectators, which keeps the press at a welcome distance. It is as exciting, as brutal, and as exhausting as any sporting event. The smaller the boat, the greater the challenge, which is why you find that most America's Cup crews learned their skill on boats under 30 feet and frequently on a centerboard 11-foot dinghy. The vast majority of sailors would not waste their time watching others race a boat. Ninety-nine percent of the crowds at Newport have been present for the social events, the television interviews, and the photo opportunities and would not know the difference between an outhaul and a cam cleat. Sports fans will ultimately join their Maker; if they were bad, they end up watching an endless hockey game. If they have been real good, they are forced to watch a tie football game in Green Bay, with the temperature hovering at minus 20 degrees. Racing sailors go to heaven; I was there once when I won a race. GERALD M. BRANOWER New York

202-> POLICE SEEK NEW WITNESSES TO HOWARD BEACH ATTACK
The investigation of the Howard Beach racial attack has narrowed to a continuing search for witnesses other than the victims, including an effort to find 8 of the 24 people who placed calls to the police 911 emergency number, the police said yesterday. None of those who phoned the police have come forward to tell what they know about the attack by a group of whites on three black men. One of the black men, Michael Griffith, was struck and killed by a car as he fled from the assailants onto a highway at about 1 A.M. on Dec. 20, the police said. The police had not previously said there were as many as 24 calls the night of the attack. A police spokesman, Lieut. Edwin LeSchack, said 22 of the calls were made by motorists along the Shore Parkway a few blocks west of Cross Bay Boulevard, where Mr. Griffith was killed. The eight calls the police are concentrating on came from people who gave some identification to the 911 operator. The 16 other calls were made anonymously. One person who gave a name called from a telephone booth near a pizzeria where the attack began. The police said they had not been able to trace this caller, even though they have the caller's name. Victim Declines to Testify The search for additional witnesses arose after the state's key witness, Cedric Sandiford, one of the men who was attacked, refused to cooperate in the prosecution of three white youths charged in the case. Murder and other serious charges were dropped last week when Mr. Sandiford refused to testify at a preliminary hearing. Only reckless endangerment charges remain against the suspects, Jon L. Lester, 17, Scott Kern, 17, and Jason Ladone, 16. All have been released on bail. Lawyers for Mr. Sandiford - the only person other than the accused youths and their friends known to have seen Mr. Griffith run through a hole in a fence to the parkway where he was killed - have said he will not testify unless the driver of the car who killed Mr. Griffith was charged in the case. Lawyers Charge a Cover-Up The lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, have said Mr. Sandiford saw Mr. Griffith hit and killed by the car of Dominick Blum, 24, a court officer, who left the scene. Mr. Blum returned an hour later and was not charged after he said he thought he had hit a tire or an animal. The lawyers contend that Mr. Blum was an accomplice of the youths and have accused the authorities of a cover-up. They have demanded that Governor Cuomo appoint a special prosecutor to supersede the Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci. But they have declined to cooperate with Charles J. Hynes, a special state prosecutor who has said he wants to examine their allegations that the authorities mishandled the case. Prosecutor Weighs Options The police have said their investigation has shown that Mr. Blum was not an accomplice and that his striking of Mr. Griffith was an apparent accident. They said Mr. Sandiford told them in the early stages of the inquiry that he had heard, but had not seen, the fatal collision. With the prosecution apparently unable to go forward without Mr. Sandiford's help, Mr. Santucci yesterday was still considering whether to turn the case over to Federal prosecutors as a possible civil-rights violation. Mr. Santucci, in an effort to obtain a witness, also was considering an offer of immunity to one of the white youths accused of involvement in the attack. The risk in this course was that a ''least culpable'' suspect, once given immunity, could not be prosecuted even if it was established later that he was egregiously culpable. The police said yesterday for the first time that Mr. Sandiford also had not told them he actually saw the whites beating Mr. Griffith, only that he saw them chasing the victim. Mr. Sandiford also said he had seen Mr. Griffith go through the fence to flee the assailants, according to the police. Key Witness Needed The authorities thus appeared to have no witnesses who say they saw Mr. Griffith attacked by white youths. The head and body injuries suffered by Mr. Griffith on the highway - and the police say he might have been hit by more than one car - left it unclear what injuries, if any, he may have sustained at the hands of the assailants. While the complex case has been under intense scrutiny by the police and the Queens District Attorney's office for more than two weeks, the main portion of the investigation was completed in the days immediately following the attack. ''We believe the three people who are under arrest committed this assault,'' said Alice T. McGillion, the Deputy Police Commissioner in charge of public information. ''The investigation is open in that the case against them can be strengthened by finding additional witnesses, but there are no major elements of the case still open.''

203-> THE WORLD; A Violent Reprisal In South Africa
Leaders of the United Democratic Front, the big anti-apartheid coalition in South Africa, have long accused Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, of cooperating with the white Government. Last week, the Front blamed the Chief's followers for an attack on the home of one of its prominent members in which seven children and five adults were killed. The police said the assailants broke into the home in the black township of Kwa-Makhuta, 15 miles from Durban, and opened fire with automatic weapons. Chief Buthelezi, who heads KwaZulu, a state for blacks established by South Africa, said he was ''shocked.'' But the Chief, who also has criticized apartheid, said two members of his Zulu movement, Inkatha, had been killed this year. ''Inkatha members,'' he insisted, ''have been involved only in self-defense and retaliation,'' when attacked by ''the U.D.F.-A.N.C. alliance,'' the Front and African National Congress, the black nationalist group. Among those killed last week was Willie Ntuli, the father of Vincent Ntuli, a leader of the Kwa-Makhuta Youth League, an affiliate of the United Democratic Front. Vincent Ntuli was absent, in hiding. When he returned after the attack, journalists said, he was arrested. The leader of the African National Congress, Oliver R. Tambo, is in the United States as part of his group's campaign to gain respectability among Western Governments. He is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz this Wednesday, the highest-level meeting between a congress representative and the United States Government. The State Department has stressed that the meeting does not represent approval of the group but rather a recognition that it is an important player in South Africa. In another development last week, Alan Hendrickse, the leader of the largest party in the segregated chamber of Parliament for people of mixed race, apologized to President P. W. Botha. Mr. Hendrickse said he meant no offense to Mr. Botha or the President's office when he led 30 followers in a protest swim Jan. 4 at a Port Elizabeth beach reserved for whites. Mr. Botha had warned that unless Mr. Hendrickse apologized or resigned he would dissolve Parliament.

204-> Buyer for Popsicle
Gold Bond Ice Cream Inc., a maker of ice cream novelties, said it had agreed to buy the American operations of Popsicle Industries from the Sara Lee Corporation. Terms were not disclosed. Gold Bond, of Green Bay, Wis., is one of the nation's largest private-label producers of ice cream. Through licensing agreements, the closely held company markets novelties under the Eskimo Pie and Heath Bar labels. A Sara Lee spokesman said the company was still seeking a buyer for its Canadian-based Popsicle Industries operation. In the fiscal year 1986, Popsicle reported sales ofabout $70 million.

205-> The Editorial Notebook; Super-Costly Supercarriers
In his new budget, the President asks Congress to give the Navy two new nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, costing $3.4 billion apiece, and that's just the down payment. With supporting planes and ships, a carrier battle group costs $18 billion. For each one on station the Navy likes to have two in refitting. What does that huge investment buy? Like any other surface ships, carriers are vulnerable to torpedoes and missiles. Most of their support is defensive, like the $1 billion Aegis cruiser, whose task is to shoot down missiles aimed at the carrier. There are anti-submarine planes, mini-Awacs planes to give early warning of attack and F-14 fighters to blast attacking bombers with million-dollar Phoenix missiles. Of a carrier's 85 aircraft, only 34 are attack bombers. Given 70 percent readiness, 24 may be available for battle. Thus investment in three carriers is needed to buy the effective striking power of as few as 24 bombers. In emergency, the backup carriers too could put to sea. Still, why sink so many bucks into such little bang? In peacetime, carriers are undeniably effective as symbols of power when dispatched to unruly regions. But in war, against the Soviet Navy with its 300 attack submarines and 1,500 land-based aircraft, the risks look huge. Air Force bases too are vulnerable to attack, because, as Navy Secretary John Lehman wryly notes, they don't move very fast. But then, unlike carriers, their defenses against Soviet submarines are rock-solid. Control of the sea is vital for America but of little importance to a land-based power like the Soviet Union. In this light, carriers would make little difference if their attacks prevail, but invite disaster if defeated. That looks like a no-win game. What about adversaries other than the Soviet Union? When planes from two carriers attacked targets in Lebanon in 1983, the daytime raid was thoroughly botched and 2 out of 28 bombers were shot down. Several errors are cited by George Wilson, a Washington Post reporter who was on the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy: design of the bombers, mistaken tactics and a cumbersome chain of command. But the Navy has learned too few lessons from the disaster because it undertook no inquiry. The admirals' club, Mr. Wilson notes in his recent book, ''Supercarrier,'' is ''perhaps the world's most effective protective society.'' The carriers proved more effective in last year's raid on Libya. But the admirals got help from the Air Force and, having understood the danger of daylight raids, opted for night bombing, which is often less precise. The Navy's attachment to carriers transcends military reasons. No visitor can fail to wonder at the grace and danger of a carrier's operations, and the dedication of its crew. When a pilot makes a night landing on a pitching deck, his heart may beat faster than when under fire. But bravery and romance are poor guides to design of force structure. In asking for two more carriers, the Navy will assure Congress that these expensive ships are the only answer. Until the next naval battle, there's no way to prove or disprove that thesis. So Congress might ask instead what else the same money might buy, like diesel submarines, cheap nuclear attack submarines and minesweepers. When Congress sees how little interest there is in such vital workhorse ships, it may fairly wonder if the Navy is ruled by its head or its heart.

206-> U.S. NAVY COPTER IS FIRED ON BY A SHIP IN THE PERSIAN GULF
A United States Navy helicopter was fired on today by a merchant ship in the southern Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said. The helicopter took evasive action and was not hit. The incident, which officials said was the first time in memory that American forces had been fired on in the region, occurred as the helicopter, based on the destroyer O'Bannon, was conducting routine operations. The identity and country of registry of the merchant ship, which fired a surface-to-air missile at the helicopter, are not known, according to a Pentagon statement. The Defense Department said it was investigating the incident. Misses by 500 Yards The helicopter, an SH-2 used for antisubmarine warfare, saw the missile coming and moved out of the way, the Pentagon said. The missile missed by about 500 yards. The helicopter was three miles from the merchant ship when the missile was fired and was about 38 miles from its mother ship. A Pentagon official said the helicopter did not identify itself to the merchant ship, either before or after the shooting. After the shooting, the O'Bannon tried unsuccessfully to hail the ship and to pursue her. It is not uncommon for merchant ships in transit to and from Iran or Iraq to be attacked in the Persian Gulf, including by helicopters, the official said. The merchant ship may have thought she was being attacked, he said. Although the Navy helicopter was armed with torpedos, it would not have responded to the attack by shooting back under these circumstances, the official said. The O'Bannon is one of five Navy ships assigned to the Middle East Force, which has the Persian Gulf region as one of its operating areas. The ships often watch over American merchant ships in the gulf. In one episode last May, one of the Navy ships warned off an Iranian vessel that was approaching an American merchant ship, fearing the Iranians were planning to come alongside and inspect the American vessel.

207-> SUNGLASSES MADE TO BE SEEN
Sunglasses aren't just for summer anymore. Nor are they always functional, as these eye-accessory eyefuls prove. Victoria Falls (451 West Broadway, near Prince Street) offers Artwork's arty $45 glare guards with lenses in topless frames. Alain Mikli's sunglasses for Claude Montana have etched, angular frames that make any face look fiercely fashionable. They are about $200 at Gruen Optika (1225 Lexington Avenue, near 83d Street), My Optics (82 Christopher Street, near Bleecker Street) and Morgenthal/Frederics Opticians (685 Madison Avenue, near 62d Street). And the most inventive sunglass statements are by Issey Miyake, available at the Dianne B. boutiques in Manhattan. Tilting windshield visors from his winter collection are $95. And Miyake's spring collection, available next month, includes folding glasses with eight lenses ($400) and a pair that looks as if they are made of metal bubbles ($300). So if winter is making seeing a sore subject, just pull down those shades.

208-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; The Rumsfeld Rumor
A new candidate has emerged in speculation around town concerning a possible successor to William J. Casey as Director of Central Intelligence. He is Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former Congressman, Secretary of Defense and corporate executive. Mr. Casey, who had brain surgery last month, is in Georgetown University Hospital, and officials have expressed doubt that he will be able to resume his duties. Although Mr. Rumsfeld has not held public office since 1976, he has an imposing resume. In addition to winning five terms as a Republican Representative from Illinois, he was director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Ambassador to NATO and White House chief of staff before moving to the Pentagon. From 1977 to 1985 he was chief executive officer of G. D. Searle & Company, a pharmaceutical concern. Mr. Rumsfeld's name is also appearing these days on longer lists of 1988 Republican Presidential contenders. His principal rival for depth and variety of experience is Vice President Bush, another former House member who served as Ambassador to the United Nations, Republican national chairman, liaison officer to China and Director of Central Intelligence. As today's news is running, familiarity with intelligence issues could prove useful to almost any 1988 aspirant.

209-> JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS
Prison sentences of 40 to 100 years were imposed yesterday on eight men convicted as top leaders and key associates of the ''commission'' that ruled the Mafia in the United States. In imposing the stringent sentences in a crowded courtroom of Federal District Court in Manhattan, Judge Richard Owen castigated the defendants as ruthless racketeers who operated the Mafia's ''board of directors.'' Judge Owen gave 100-year sentences to seven defendants convicted of numerous charges and a 40-year sentence to the other defendant, who was convicted of two charges that carried a maximum of 20 years each. 'Prejudiced From the First Day' Among those receiving 100-year sentences were three men convicted as the bosses of major Mafia families - Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, 75 years old, of the Genovese group, Anthony (Tony Ducks) Corallo, 73, of the Lucchese group and Carmine (Junior) Persico, 53, of the Colombo group. Mr. Persico, who served as his own lawyer, told the judge that the defendants had been deprived of a fair trial because of ''this Mafia mania that was flying around.'' ''This case was prejudiced from the first day,'' Mr. Persico said, complaining about publicity the case received. He urged the judge to focus on a defense accusation of prosecutorial misconduct instead of trying to ''satisfy the public that he's sending Mafia people to jail for 100 years.'' Murder, Extortion and Payoffs Judge Owen, who also imposed maximum fines of $50,000 to $250,000, noted that the defendants would be eligible for parole after 10 years under Federal law, but he recommended that they be denied parole. The defendants were convicted Nov. 19 of conducting the affairs of ''the commission of La Cosa Nostra'' in a racketeering pattern that included murders, loan-sharking, labor payoffs and extortion in the concrete industry in New York City. The one defendant sentenced to 40 years was Anthony (Bruno) Indelicato, 39, a member of the Bonanno family. He was convicted of taking part in the 1979 murder of the family's boss, Carmine Galante, and two associates. A Light Moment Another defendant, Gennaro (Gerry Lang) Langella, 48, was convicted as Mr. Persico's second-in-command in the Colombo family. Last November, both men were sentenced in a different racketeering case, with prison terms of 39 years for Mr. Persico and 65 years for Mr. Langella. In one of the few light moments at the sentencing yesterday, a defense lawyer, Frank A. Lopez, told the judge that Mr. Langella was already serving such a long sentence that he could not give much more time to his country. The comment drew a smile from Judge Owen, who said Mr. Persico and Mr. Langella could serve the sentences concurrently. Another defendant sentenced as a member of the Colombo family in the commission case was Ralph Scopo, 58, a former president of the District Council of Cement and Concrete Workers. Two others, Salvatore (Tom Mix) Santoro, 72, and Christopher (Christie Tick) Furnari, 62, were sentenced as the Lucchese underboss and counselor, respectively. 'You're Doing a Good Job' Directing sarcastic remarks at the judge, Mr. Santoro said as he was being sentenced, ''You're in the driver's seat, Your Honor.'' When the judge said he was just doing his job, Mr. Santoro retorted bitterly, ''And you're doing a good job.'' For the most part, however, the defendants displayed little emotion as the judge announced the sentences in the hushed courtroom. Defense lawyers said they would appeal the convictions. Each of the main charges carried a maximum 20-year sentence, which could have amounted to 300 years for most of the defendants. The judge imposed the maximum for most of the charges, but he made some of the terms concurrent. Addressing Mr. Salerno as the sentencing began, the judge said, ''You have essentially spent a lifetime terrorizing this community to your financial advantage.'' Mr. Indelicato and Mr. Scopo were convicted of carrying out orders of the commission leaders. Mr. Indelicato was the only one named in murders authorized by the commission. According to a 58-page sentencing memorandum by the prosecutors, Michael Chertoff, John F. Savarese and John Gilmore Childers, the trial showed that the commission was ''the national ruling body of La Cosa Nostra, or the Mafia, in the United States.'' The prosecutors said the commission coordinated criminal activities, resolved disputes and sometimes ordered ''the execution of family bosses.'' Team Effort Praised After the sentencing, United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani conducted a news conference at his Manhattan office with Federal, state and local law-enforcement officials who praised the team effort in the case. Mr. Giuliani said the defendants ''richly deserved'' long sentences. Some bosses, including Mr. Persico, have previously run Mafia families from prison by using trusted aides and couriers, according to the authorities. They said the convicted commission leaders had already appointed acting bosses and were unlikely to retain power, particularly in light of their long sentences. The commission case and other recent convictions have been described by the authorities as devastating blows that could create turmoil in the Mafia and make it more dangerous for new leaders to run the organization. Besides the men convicted in the trial, two other bosses were originally charged in the case. They were Paul Castellano of the Gambino group, who was killed in 1985, and Philip Rastelli of the Bonanno group, who was convicted in a separate case last year. John Gotti, accused of being the new Gambino boss, is a defendant in a racketeering trial in Brooklyn.

210-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Elway Expects to Start
Although he was limping around the Broncos' training center today on a sprained left ankle, John Elway was left off the Denver injury list for Sunday's playoff game against the Browns in Cleveland. Nevertheless Coach Dan Reeves said he would check Elway carefully when practice resumes tomorrow. ''I'll be out in full gear and take all the snaps, so I'll start, '' Elway said. . . . Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys' coach, and his son, Tom Jr., both underwent successful knee surgery yesterday in Dallas for old football injuries. Dr. Walter Knight, assisted by his father, Marvin, performed an arthroscopic surgery on the left knee of the coach for bone spurs caused when he played football for the Giants in the 1950's. He is expected to be released today. Landry's son, 36, had major surgery for a left knee injury suffered when he played at Duke. He is expected to be hospitalized for a week.

211-> TV VIEW; Jumping the Gun on 'Amerika'
Whatever else ''Amerika'' is - at 14 1/2 hours, it is, if nothing else, a very large piece of prime time - it is now the source of great controversy. ''Amerika'' bashes the Soviet Union; it doesn't bash it enough. It slanders the United Nations and threatens world peace; no, it is a fictive work about totalitarianism. At the moment, liberal to left sentiment is running most strongly against the ABC mini-series, although moderate to right-wing criticism is coming up fast. Battlements are raised. The sound of apocalypse is heard. Somewhere an enemy is lurking. Still unclear, however, is the direction of the enemy attack. Will ''Amerika'' be a rightward thrust, plunging us into cold-war paranoia? Or will it turn left, lose its nerve and excuse an imperialistic Soviet Union? In fact, nobody knows, including the most prominent of the critics. Nobody actually has seen ''Amerika.'' It's the idea they don't like. The mini-series, which is to begin on Feb. 15 and conclude on Feb. 22, is set in the United States 10 years after the Soviet Union has taken over in an apparently bloodless coup. There are food lines, political prisoners and, according to a 52-minute ABC promotional videotape, a shortage of tomatoes. Approximately half the videotape is made up of interviews with the stars of ''Amerika'' and with Donald Wrye, its producer, writer and director. The rest of the tape contains scenes from the mini-series. Early on, someone mentions the tomatoes. A moment later, Mr. Wrye says that ''the intent of the mini-series and the way the mini-series functions is not anti-Soviet and, indeed, has virtually no foreign-policy implications.'' It's unlikely this is entirely true. It's hard to imagine a mini-series about a Soviet occupation without foreign-policy implications. On this, the critics agree. At least 40 peace groups are campaigning against ''Amerika.'' They will distribute educational materials to schools and churches, and hold vigils at ABC. Meanwhile, three former Secretaries of State - Alexander M. Haig Jr., Edmund Muskie and Dean Rusk - along with Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former chief United States delegate to the United Nations, have protested to ABC about the way ''Amerika'' portrays U.N. troops. And so on, and on and on. Georgi A. Arbatov, who is a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and a prominent spokesman for his government, says ''Amerika'' is ''very offending because it portrays the Soviets in a very, very bad light.'' Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party's newspaper, calls it ''a deliberate act of psychological warfare.'' George Kennan, once the principal author of the policy to contain Soviet expansionism, says the mini-series is a great mistake. ''What good purpose,'' he asks in a letter to The New York Times, ''could be served by feeding this unreal nightmare hour after hour into the minds and imagination of a considerable portion of the viewing public?'' In a way, Reed Irvine, the chairman of Accuracy in Media, a conservative group, agrees with Mr. Kennan; he thinks ''Amerika'' is unreal, too. ''It's a totally unrealistic picture of what life in the United States would be under Soviet occupation,'' Mr. Irvine said in an interview on the ''MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.'' ''There is no evidence that there has ever been a blood bath, that there has ever been a Soviet reign of terror.'' So take that, ABC. No one, or at least no one who has publicly raised his or her voice, likes ''Amerika.'' It is a threat to the social and political order. The United Nations itself is acting. It wants an attractive portrayal of U.N. soldiers, and it has hired Theodore C. Sorensen, once special counsel to President John F. Kennedy, to negotiate changes in the production. Mr. Sorensen says he hasn't ''ruled out legal action.'' At the same time, there is a fog over all this. ABC is still editing ''Amerika.'' There is no finished production. What have the critics seen? Earlier this month, Brandon Stoddard, the head of ABC's entertainment division, said the mini-series was ''not remotely ready.'' Newspaper people and others who gathered in Hollywood to screen the 14 1/2 hours were able to see only four hours. Mr. Stoddard said 30 editors were still paring down some 1.25 million feet of film. The critics, if they have seen ''Amerika'' at all, have seen only small pieces. One could suspect ABC of orchestrating the controversy; controversy, of course, generates publicity. It seems unlikely, though, that ABC could ever be this cunning. ABC, for example, no matter how imaginative, would not plant an article in Tikkun, the new Jewish quarterly, under the headline ''ABC's 'Amerika': The Right Wing Paranoid's Dream.'' The article begins: ''Looking for stupidity on American television is like prospecting for depth in the ocean.'' But ''Amerika,'' it says, ''bids fair to establish a new low.'' The author hadn't seen the mini-series, either. In a footnote, he explains that he had looked at a script dated Dec. 3, 1985. Critics of all persuasions aren't arguing about a television production; they are arguing their moral and political positions. One hears the voice of the late Francis Cardinal Spellman, when he ascended the pulpit at St. Patrick's Cathedral to denounce the movie ''Baby Doll.'' The Cardinal never saw the movie. He never found it necessary. He only knew what he disliked. Similarly, the ''Amerika'' critics are certain about what they dislike. Most objections thus far have centered on the idea that the mini-series shows the Soviet Union as an occupying power. As a subject for television fiction, this is supposed to be out of bounds. It is not entirely clear why it should be out of bounds, any more than, say, using a barnyard as a metaphor for the Bolshevik Revolution, with Trotsky and Stalin as pigs, should be out of bounds. The assumption, though, seems to be that ''Amerika'' will inspire us into dropping a few nukes on the Kremlin. Viewers, apparently, will be so blinded by rage that they will call for a first strike. In the real world, however, this doesn't seem like a strong possibility. Much of the criticism of ''Amerika'' is based on the notion that viewers are entirely dense, unable to make judgments, swayed to great passion by everything they see. Much of the criticism, in fact, is elitist and patronizing: Viewers, which means most of us, are simply too dumb to know we're only watching television; we'll take ''Amerika'' for gospel. If we don't call for nukes, we'll at least lynch a red. This is also unlikely. ''Amerika'' may turn out to be silly, far-fetched or even, God forbid, utterly boring. Whatever it is, though, it is not going to provoke much direct action by viewers. Television doesn't work that way. Indeed, there are signs now that ''Amerika'' will have its biggest impact not among ordinary viewers but among the impassioned critics. Bootlegged copies of the ABC promotional videotape - the one citing the shortage of tomatoes - are being shown at protest meetings. ABC is under attack for dangerous behavior. The assumption is that ''Amerika,'' one way or another, will once and forever shape our picture of the world. This is not true; more likely, it is the critics who have been once and forever shaped. They might have waited until they had seen the 14 1/2 hours.

212-> ADVERTISING; Creative Seminar Sets Heavyweight Debates
Seven of the most important creative people in the advertising business will discuss three of the most important questions facing them at a Creative Seminar for Senior Management sponsored by the New York Council of the American Association of Advertising Agencies on Feb. 11 at the Helmsley Hotel of New York, on East 42d Street. Thomas R. Miller, president of Ketchum Advertising, New York, part of the planning committee, credits John E. O'Toole, executive vice president and head of the Washington office of the Four-A's, with pulling together the heavyweights that will make up the panel. Listen to this: Amil Gargano, chairman of Ally & Gargano/MCA Advertising of New York, will debate Hal Riney, chairman of Hal Riney & Partners of San Francisco, on whether New York is the creative capital. Jay Chiat, chairman of Chiat/Day of Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, will be up against Len Sugarman, vice chairman of Foote, Cone & Belding/Europe, on the subject of United States vs. European advertising creativity. And, finally, Allen Rosenshine, president of the Omnicom Group, second only to Saatchi & Saatchi as the world's largest advertising company, will shoot it out with Burton Manning, former chairman of J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. and now chairman of the executive committee of Jordan, Manning, Taylor, Case & McGrath, on the effect of mega-mergers on advertising creativity. About an hour will be given to each topic, which will be properly introduced by Mr. O'Toole, who will also be the master of ceremonies of the dais discussion during lunch. The morning - it will last from 8:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. - is an attempt by the New York Council to get management-level creative people involved in its professional development program, which has attracted people from the ad agency fields of media, research and account service but has been notably unsuccessful with creative people. But, then, there has never been a panel like this one.

213-> COMPANY NEWS; K-Car Package Set by Chrysler
The Chrysler Corporation has an America version of its K-cars waiting in case the American Motors Corporation does not reach an agreement with labor that would let it build Chrysler's Omni and Horizon models, the Automotive News has reported. Members of the United Automobile Workers at A.M.C.'s Kenosha, Wis., plant on Saturday refused to reopen their contract to negotiate changes that A.M.C. says it needs to get the Chrysler contract to build the Omni and Horizon. However, the trade journal said Chrysler was ready to introduce a $6,995 America version of its four-door Aries and Reliant before March 31, in case the A.M.C. arrangement falls through. The Omni and Horizon will go out of production in March if no other home is found for them. Chrysler had planned to drop the models, but decided to try to save them when the America series proved to be a success.

214-> KOHL ASSURES PUBLIC OF NO SHIFT TO RIGHT IF HE WINS ELECTION
Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought today to reassure the West German electorate that a victory for his center-right coalition in parliamentary elections this month would not mean a rightward shift in foreign policy. At a news conference here, Mr. Kohl said that despite partisan disputes, his Government ''owes our friends, allies and all our neighbors a clear, constant and calculable policy.'' The Chancellor said that, anchored in the Atlantic alliance, Bonn sought ''dialogue and cooperation'' with Communist Europe. Mr. Kohl's suddenly scheduled news conference was motivated, according to senior Government sources, by nervousness that a series of hard-line statements by members of his Christian Democratic Party had unsettled a number of voters. ''We were concerned,'' a top adviser to the Chancellor said, ''that certain things said in the heat of the campaign might have clouded our policies. We didn't want there to be any doubt about this outside the country either.'' The toughest language has come from the Christian Democrats' highly conservative Bavarian sister party, which is headed by Franz Josef Strauss. Theo Waigel, the Bavarians' parliamentary floor leader in Bonn, recently demanded that a victory for the coalition on Jan. 25 should signal ''a retreat from the detente policies of the 1970's.'' Much of the Bavarians' oratory has been aimed at Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the leading figure in the small Free Democratic Party. Mr. Strauss's partisans have hinted strongly that they would like to see him succeed Mr. Genscher as Foreign Minister.

215-> ART: 20TH-CENTURY WORKS IN ROYAL ACADEMY SHOW
With ''British Art in the 20th Century,'' which opens in London Jan. 15 and can be seen through April 5, the Royal Academy of Arts continues the provocative and controversial investigation of our century's art that was first mooted in ''The New Spirit in Painting'' in 1981 and carried a stage further in ''German Art in the 20th Century'' in 1985. A lively, radical, well-researched, not seldom dismissive and passionately presented anthology, it functions as a revisionist survey not only of British 20th-century art but also of the present role of the Royal Academy itself. During the presidency (1976-1984) of Sir Hugh Casson, and since the appointment in 1977 of Norman Rosenthal as exhibitions officer, a galvanic change has come over the academy, which had previously been somewhat in the doldrums. One after another, the best British artists of the day are coming aboard. Full and profitable use is being made of the potential for hospitality of its great rooms. Private and corporate support has been solicited with great success. (British Petroleum picked up the tab in the present case.) Exhibitions have often been both daring and spectacular, as was the case with the recent ''New Architecture,'' which put the case for current British architecture - as exemplified by James Stirling, Richard Rogers and Norman Foster - with memorable panache. ''British Art in the 20th Century'' is full of surprises. Major works long known only by name have been brought back and reactivated. Major undertakings long forgotten - most notably the decorations made in 1912 for the Cabaret Theater Club in London - are evoked in vivid and convincing style. Hierarchies long accepted are overthrown. Omissions are many and (to some) outrageous. Old scores are leveled, and new ones opened up. It is not - how could it be? - a dull affair. Veteran students of the British scene will find, for instance, that the image on the cover of the monumental catalogue is not by any of the standard heroes of British art, but by Edward Wadsworth (1889-1949), a painter best known for his studies of dazzle camouflage during World War I. He is here shown primarily in terms of the wit and finesse with which he adapted his memories of maritime life to the pictorial idiom of Giorgio de Chirico, the Italian master of metaphysical painting, with whom he had been in correspondence. Throughout the show, the emphasis tends to fall either upon painters who have somewhat fallen from the public view or upon forms of art that were initially derided and have never been taken quite seriously since. The late work of Walter Richard Sickert (1860-1942) was discredited at the time because he was believed to have worked from photographs - a practice that in the moral canons of the day ranked roughly level with cannibalism. The present show represents him primarily with five of the paintings in question, and very fresh, free and fearless they look, too. In the matter of representation, it may further astonish the veteran observer that the only artist who is allowed three separate appearances is Paul Nash (1889-1946). Nash excelled as a war artist in 1914-18, as a fringe member of the international Surrealist group in the 1920's and 1930's, as a book illustrator (notably of Sir Thomas Browne's ''Urne Buriall'') and as a painter of English landscape. But, in recent years, with Expressionist painting in high favor, the art of Paul Nash has often been regarded as juiceless and cerebral. In this context, as in many others, the academy show brushes fashion aside and sets the record straight. An injustice of quite another kind is righted by the place of honor that is assigned to two monumental sculptures by Jacob Epstein (1880-1959), the American-born sculptor who was subjected throughout much of his life in London to sustained and vindictive obloquy of a kind that few artists have had to endure. In particular his outsized and elemental renderings of the human figure in extreme situations were treated as obscenities fit only for the amusement park to which at least one of them eventually found its way. The first piece that greets the visitor to the exhibition is Epstein's ''Jacob and the Angel,'' and at a later stage we come face to face with his celebrated white marble figure of a woman in the last stage of pregnancy. Time has effaced whatever power to affront they may once have had, and they come across as touching period pieces remarkable above all for purity and simplicity of feeling. The first half of the show is characterized throughout by a driving and evangelical urgency, as group after group is encouraged to put its best foot forward. (The choices were made by a five-person committee that included several leading specialists in the period.) In the case of artists still living or recently dead, on the other hand, there is a tendency to choose the work with which they first made an indelible impression. Though defensible on historical grounds, this might suggest to the layman that the artists in question petered out very early in life. Understandably, it irks many of those who are still in full activity that they should be represented only by work done 40 or even 50 years ago. A final phase that includes massive groups of work by Henry Moore and Francis Bacon cannot, in the nature of things, have the crusading air that attaches to the earlier galleries. Nor does the choice of living artists have quite the cogency that marks the first half of the show. But there are major, and previously unseen, paintings by Howard Hodgkin and Malcolm Morley to add weight at the end, and this is on every count a show to see, and to argue about.

216-> FOOD NOTES
Kosher Sausages Kosher Italian-style sausages, kosher smoked sausages and a kosher version of Polish kielbasa, are made by the Best Kosher Sausage Company in Chicago and are available at certain supermarkets in the New York area. The sausages are beef, but their textures and seasonings make them closely resemble traditional sausages to add zest and variety to pasta sauces, soups, casseroles, eggs and grain dishes. Each sausage weighs four ounces and is fully cooked. Packages of three are sold at Dan's Supreme markets for $1.99. Pathmark carries a three-pack of Polish sausages for $2.19 and a package of 10 for $7.49. The 10-pack of Italian sausages is $6.99 at Pathmark. The Best Kosher Sausage Company also makes a spicy chorizo-style sausage, called Hot Links, and an excellent lightly peppered bratwurst, as yet unavailable in this area. National Pizza Week Tomorrow at noon a pizza party held at the Department of Agriculture Administration Building in Washington will officially inaugurate National Pizza Week, running from Jan. 18 to 24. A proclamation signed by Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng declares pizza a popular food that is ''nutritionally sound and made up of fresh, American-grown-and-processed ingredients.'' On average, Americans consume seven pies a year per person. It is an $11 billion industry, about 10 percent of which involves frozen pizzas. For those put off by all that richly tempting cheese because they think this pie is especially fattening, a slice of plain cheese pizza contains about 150 calories. Foods-to-Go Something's Cooking, a sliver of a shop with white-washed brick walls and blue trim, opened just before Christmas at 210 West 10th Street. It offers a number of savory foods-to-go such as breast of veal stuffed with a well-textured pate for $15 a pound, mixed grilled vegetables spiced with Argentine chimichurri green sauce for $9 a pound, unpeeled new potato slices dusted with fresh dill in a delicate vinaigrette for $5.50 a pound and temptingly flaky meat-filled turnovers for $1.75 each. Two preparations that can be reheated with excellent results are eggplant Parmesan richly layered with cheese and tomato for $7.50 a pound and a casserole of sausages with red and white kidney beans, $9 a pound. Crisp freshly fried lattice-cut potato chips, $8 a pound, might not last the trip home - even if you live around the corner. The shop is open every day from 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. The telephone number is 212-741-7355. Not the Usual For those with deep pockets who are interested in some precious foods, Jefferson Market, 455 Avenue of the Americas, between 10th and 11th Streets, has white strawberries from Chile for $5.99 a half pint. These albinos, barely tinged with pink, are disconcerting because the color suggests that they will be tasteless. However, they are highly perfumed and luscious. At Balducci's, across the street at 424 Avenue of the Americas, at 9th Street, different kinds of edible flowers raised by herb farmers in Santa Barbara, Calif., are sold in clear plastic boxes, $2.99 for five flowers. The varieties - garnishes for salads and other cooking purposes -include rosebuds, pansies, pineapple sage, arugula, nasturtiums, daisies, chrysanthemums, lavender and marigolds. Not all of the flowers are available at all times. Tasting Scotch Whiskies Keen's, at 72 West 36th Street, has one of the largest collections of single-malt Scotch whiskies of any bar in the city. Periodically, Daniel Beck, bar manager, holds single-malt tastings open to the public. The next one is scheduled for Tuesday, Jan. 27, two days after the birthday of Robert Burns. The tasting starts at 7 P.M. with a bagpiper's fanfare and covers history, tasting techniques, a comparative tasting of four types and then an open sampling of approximately 25 single-malt Scotch whiskies accompanied by Scottish appetizers such as Scottish meat pies, Scottish cheeses and Scotch eggs. The price is $40. Call 212-947-3636 for information and reservations. Joycean Cuisine It had to happen. There is now a cookbook called ''The Joyce of Cooking'' by Alison Armstrong (Station Hill, $18.95), subtitled ''Food and Drink From James Joyce's Dublin.'' In a foreword, Anthony Burgess assures readers that Joyce was polyphagous - had varied tastes in food - and that ''every dish chez Joyce can be prepared in the simplest of kitchens, and nothing will turn the stomach.'' And in case you wondered what the lemon platt sold by Betty Byrne on the first page of ''Portrait of the Artist'' might be, according to this volume it's hard candy. Certain recipes hew fairly close to passages in ''Ulysses'' and other writings. Others, like mackerel Bloom - based on the line from ''Ulysses,'' '' 'mackerel they call me,' recalls Bloom,'' - and made with mushrooms, almonds, cream and fennel, are more inventive.

217-> DANCE: FROM CITY BALLET, BALANCHINE'S 'EPISODES'
THE New York City Ballet offered George Balanchine's ''Episodes'' for the first time this season Sunday night at the New York State Theater. ''Episodes'' is just what its name implies: a series of choreographic sketches to brief orchestral pieces by the 20th-century composer Anton von Webern. Yet, though none of the ballet's scenes last long, all are rich in implication. To Webern's Symphony (Op. 21), Balanchine created a study in poise and control for four couples. Indeed, at the outset, the dancers scarcely strayed from the places in which they were standing. Nevertheless, the cast, led by Stephanie Saland and Victor Castelli, moved with the utmost lucidity. Balanchine's pas de deux to the Five Pieces (Op. 10) shows a man and a woman constantly attempting to get together and either failing to do so or getting entangled in grotesque poses. Are their attempts comic? Or pathetic? Or both? Balanchine lets viewers decide for themselves. So did Helene Alexopoulos and Leonid Kozlov, who danced the duet without excesses of gesture or facial expression. At first, the choreography for the Concerto (Op. 24) seemed a study in patterning. Yet it, too, became implicitly dramatic. As Bart Cook kept manipulating the limbs of Heather Watts, one realized that he was treating her as if she were only a doll. Later, women surrounded him, as if enclosing him in a trap from which he could not escape. The ballet's highlight was Peter Frame's interpretation of the Variations (Op. 30), which Balanchine originally choreographed for the modern dancer Paul Taylor. As performed by Mr. Frame, the solo appeared to concern a man's futile struggle to achieve balance and stand tall. The way Mr. Frame constantly hunched himself up, pulled himself inward and scrambled on the floor combined grim comedy with pathos. After these depictions of bodily distortion, Balanchine returned to harmonious order in his choreography to Webern's orchestration of a Ricercata by Bach. Just as the music suggested that Webern, for all his musical experimentation, was nevertheless part of a great tradition, so this final choreographic episode, led by Maria Calegari and Adam Luders, suggested that classical ballet could incorporate many types of movement without endangering its own traditions. The program, conducted by Hugo Fiorato, also included a repeat performance of ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue,'' the debut of Ib Andersen in Jerome Robbins's ''Quiet City'' and a scintillating performance of Balanchine's ''Tarantella'' by Katrina Killian and Gen Horiuchi. Ms. Killian wittily slowed down and accelerated steps in this divertissement without making any of these changes of movement quality look corny. Mr. Horiuchi bounded away, and all his leaps were skyward. Jerry Zimmerman was the piano soloist. In ''Quiet City,'' Mr. Andersen portrayed a mysterious stranger, dancing Mr. Robbins's somewhat acrobatic steps with a smoothness that made him resemble a supernatural being and with a conviction that made one imagine he was guided by destiny.

218-> High-School Drama Teachers Await Their Call
To the Editor: New York City high-school teachers in some high-priority subject areas are allowed to begin teaching with minimal qualifications. In the lowest-priority area of drama, however, the opposite holds true. To date, the Board of Education has appointed not one of the highly qualified and licensed drama teachers who are available. In the early 1980's the board acted on the recognition that drama is a way of reaching adolescents -through acting classes to develop artistic, social and even academic skills. Acting can spur interest in literature, speech and writing, as well as in past eras and faraway places. A rigorous license exam was held in June 1983, one seemingly (and understandably) designed to exclude. Of the 186 who took it, only 45 passed - less than one-fourth. In July 1984, these 45 were issued high school licenses in performing arts (drama). The licensing demands were extraordinary. Besides a written examination, applicants had to pass a three-part audition and verify at least three years of full-time professional, nonteaching experience. Many had academic credits far exceeding the Master of Arts degree (the Master of Fine Arts degree is halfway between an M.A. and a doctorate). Yet as of December 1986, not one of these drama teachers has been appointed. Teachers have been told this is because no principal has declared a vacancy! Unless money is allotted, however, to open new drama positions, some principals who may wish to hire drama teachers will not be able to do so. Other principals may not be familiar with this new license; it has not been highly publicized. In two years, this list will automatically expire - unless the New York State Legislature grants an extension. If it expires, with few or no appointments made from it, the children will be the losers. The city will have lost the services of talented, qualified specialists committed to sharing their expertise with New York youngsters. Most high schools have several art and music teachers. Forty-five drama teachers would mean not quite one teacher for every two high schools, a modest number. If, at worst, 45 positions cannot be created within the city's high schools, then rules should be waived; these teachers should be allowed to teach creative drama in the elementary schools as appointed ''cluster'' teachers. The city cannot afford to waste this talent pool.

219-> Paribas Stock Sold in France
More than 14.7 million shares of Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, the state-owned financial and banking group, went on sale in France today. It is the biggest offering ever on the Paris stock market. The sale of Paribas is the second stage in the French Government's ambitious five-year program to privatize 65 state companies, including 24 major groups. Compagnie Saint Gobain, a glass and construction materials maker, was sold in November. The stockbrokers Nivard, Flornoy et Compagnie, specialists in Paribas securities, reported heavy demand from small private investors for the Paribas offering, which is priced at 405 francs, or $65, a share. Another 6.3 million Paribas shares were offered to foreigners, while 8.5 million were placed with corporate and institutional shareholders and 3.5 million were offered to Paribas employees at a 50 percent discount. While investors flocked to buy, opposition Socialist politicians criticized the sale, accusing the conservative Government of giving away public assets. Paribas, a financial services giant that was nationalized in 1982 by the Socialists, was valued last week at 17.5 billion francs, or $2.9 billion, by an independent commission established by the Government. Before the announcement, analysts had estimated its value at 20 billion francs, or $3.3 billion, and suggested a likely price of 430 francs, equivalent to $69, a share.

221-> 19TH-CENTURY GLASS, IN ALL ITS GLORY
Walking into the new exhibition of stained glass at the National Building Museum is a bit like walking into the middle of a rainbow. The creative achievements of American glass craftsmen of the latter 19th century are celebrated in a glowing array of 40 pieces of antique architectural glass in the show, titled ''American Decorative Window Glass, 1860-1890: The Home as a Heaven Below.'' ''We came up with that subtitle because decorative glass was part of that whole desire to decorate the home,'' said Bates Lowry, director of the museum. In the exhibit, which runs through July 19, jewel-like windows, skylights, side-door panels, transoms and fire screens are set in stair landings, entry halls and porches re-created from Victorian pattern books. ''We wanted to place the glass in the context of the role it played in architecture and in buildings,'' Dr. Lowry said. ''Otherwise they begin to look like beautiful paintings.'' Unlike the work of such great master artisans as Louis Comfort Tiffany, these pieces were created by anonymous craftsmen for middle-class homes. But the quality of the beautifully wrought work is impressive. It includes these examples: * Windows of ornate floral motifs, of complex geometric designs, of shell and arabesque forms. * Figural windows; a fan-shaped work with a border of richly colored jewels, and windows of opalescent glass, grainy glass, flashed glass, crackle glass and ripple glass. * Roundels and faceted, chunk and molded jewels meant to imitate precious gems. And there is color: tangerine and ruby reds; lemon yellow and milky pinks; a palette of blues and turquoise; an array of greens, lime, Kelly, pistachio. Time seems to have been a fascination. In one window the artisan placed three medallions representing morning, noon and night, with the sun in stages and a morning glory, the moon and a bat to illustrate his theme. The pieces come from the collection of H. Weber Wilson, who owns an architectural antiques business in Frederick, Md. Mr. Wilson's book ''Great Glass in American Architecture,'' published last fall by E. P. Dutton, is the first comprehensive survey of American decorative glass art from 1840 to 1920. In preparing for the exhibition, Dr. Lowry was unable to find other decorative window collections. ''We normally like to include work from a number of collections,'' he said. ''But examples of this work are rare. I think it is a field that simply hasn't been looked at before, particularly domestic glass, and Wilson has made himself an expert.'' It is debatable whether these early American craftsmen considered themselves artists, Mr. Wilson said. ''Stained glass,'' he said with no hint of a smile, ''has always been between the cracks.'' ''People don't want to call it art,'' he continued, ''but a lot of skill and imagination is required. It is kind of an anomaly in the history of American art.'' American decorative glass departed from Europe's long tradition of religious glass, with its tradition, symbolism and emphasis on paint and stain, Mr. Wilson said. The colored glass introduced in American buildings in the 1840's was of the Gothic and romantic styles. By the 1880's it had shifted into eclectic forms, Mr. Wilson said, ''such as Renaissance revival, Queen Anne and the American stick style.'' A process introduced in 1886 by the Belcher Mosaic Glass Company of Newark was the mercury mosaic window. In it, hundreds of tiny triangular glass fragments appear to flow into each other without being separated by heavy lines of metal. Used for only a few years, the manufacturing process remains a mystery. An example can be seen in the exhibition. As labor became more expensive and as tastes changed, the use of stained glass fell into a decline in the early 1900's. However, the use of decorative glass has undergone a renaissance of sorts in recent years. ''There is a tremendous variety of glass available today,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''In terms of texture and high quality, there is probably as much glass available as 100 years ago.''

222-> METRO DATELINES; Jersey Considering Changes in Primary
A bipartisan committee, seeking to give New Jersey voters a greater voice in selecting Presidential candidates, recommended yesterday that the state hold its 1988 Presidential primary election earlier than usual. The committee suggested that the primary be held a week or two earlier than the traditional date, the first Tuesday in June, one of the latest primary dates in the nation. The recommendation was contained in letters sent to Governor Kean and legislative leaders. Mr. Kean, who supports an earlier primary, had asked the state chairmen of the Republican and Democratic parties to appoint the 10-member committee. The New Jersey primary has often been overshadowed by primaries in California and Ohio, which were held the same day. Ohio has decided to change its primary election to March, along with several other states. The commission rejected holding the Presidential primary in March because that would have forced a split primary with other contests still being decided in June, and would have added $5 million to election costs. If the change is approved, as expected, the 1988 primary for all party nominations would probably be held on May 24, two weeks earlier, because a one-week change would conflict with the Memorial Day holiday.

223-> STATE'S DIVISION OF MOTOR VEHICLES SEEKS NEW IMAGE
THE state has 5.2 million licensed drivers who must deal with the Division of Motor Vehicles at least twice a year, and recently the experience has been anything but pleasant. The division has been unable to keep up with registering and inspecting motor vehicles and issuing driver's licenses without subjecting the public to long lines, inordinate delays and computer errors. W. Cary Edwards, the state Attorney General, is overseeing a program to improve the system. The program includes a public-relations campaign designed to enlist the public's sympathy and understanding while changes are made. With each license or renewal form is a card containing a cartoon logo showing the letters ''DMV'' surrounded by scaffolding and work cranes and the sign ''DMV under repair.'' ''It took 20 or 30 years for Motor Vehicles to become an inefficient, ineffective operation, and it's not going to be fixed overnight,'' Mr. Edwards said at a recent news conference. He also reported the type of problem the division must wrestle with. A mistake on the computer records of drivers whose licenses must be renewed in February prevented the division's new computer system from automatically printing out the renewal forms. ''There was a font missing from the bottom of the cards,'' he explained, ''and the computer's optical scanner couldn't read the cards.'' As a result, division personnel have been working since September to pull by hand the cards of 150,000 motorists and mail out the notices. ''That is a horrendous example,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''but when it gets around, it becomes a prototype for the system and not an isolated case. I hope people will not judge us by our mistakes, but by how we address them.'' Mr. Edwards said that it would take two to three years to make over the system. Even if the error rate were reduced to 1 percent, he said, with 24 million transactions a year that would still mean 240,000 mistakes. The transactions include not only the issuing of licenses and registrations, but also titles of ownership, vehicle inspections, driver testing, the licensing of auto-body shops, junkyards and driver schools, maintaining violation records and collecting insurance surcharges. But if the Attorney General had hoped the division would be able to steer clear of controversy this year, those hopes were dashed last week. The Assembly minority leader, Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of the 19th District (part of Middlesex County), called the Division of Motor Vehicles ''the Chernobyl of state government,'' in a reference to the disaster at the Russian nuclear-power plant, and said the pace of improvements promised by the Kean administration had been much too slow. He said he could not understand why the state had failed to take Price Waterhouse to court over the problems with the computer system that the New York-based accounting concern installed in 1985 under a no-bid state contract. The program selected by the company was not equal to the task, and division employees had to work nights and weekends putting information into the slow-responding system while falling further and further behind the workload. Mr. Karcher said that the state should sue Price Waterhouse to recover for the overtime costs and the public inconvenience. Mr. Edwards said that the state had withheld about $1 million still owed Price Waterhouse under its contract and was still negotiating a final settlement with the company, which has had to revamp the system. The state's motor-vehicle agencies, which have traditionally been patronage plums, are another focus of the changes announced by the Kean administration. The state has taken over 26 agencies and is monitoring 29 more operated by private entrepreneurs while a decision is made about running all of them with state employees or continuing with a bifurcated system. When the state took over the local agencies, it hired the people employed there as temporary state workers, pending a final decision. Last week, the Communications Workers of America, a union that represents some 35,000 state employees, filed suit in State Superior Court here to force the Division of Motor Vehicles to give the new workers permanent status. Bob Pursell, the union's area director, said that state law required the temporary employees to be given permanent status, and the job protection and benefits that go with it, after six months, and that many of the workers had been ''temporaries'' for longer periods. He said that the state's Department of Personnel, at the urging of the union, had told the Division of Motor Vehicles the positions must be changed from temporary to permanent but that nothing had been done. The state is not ready to make a decision on how it wants to run the agencies and has been delaying a change in the employees' status. Some of the other changes envisioned by the administration include: * The construction of a new division headquarters at one of several sites under study in Trenton, Lawrence Township, Woodbridge or Washington Township. * An upgrading of the division's telephone system. * The creation of new programs to handle customer complaints. But although the division found itself under fire last week, it also found something positive to talk about. It announced that it had begun to offer driver's license tests in Japanese ''in response to a need expressed by the Japanese-American community.'' It is estimated that there are about 13,000 Japanese-American residents in New Jersey. The state now offers the test in 11 foreign languages: Japanese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Spanish and Vietnamese. But with the Democrats in the Legislature taking aim at the division in an election year and the unions crying foul, the division's real test in the months ahead will be how well it communicates in English.

224-> SCANDAL IMPERILS MULRONEY'S HOLD
In the House of Commons this week, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, half-moon spectacles perched on his nose, spent several hours fending off attacks by opposition members aroused by a sense that his 28-month-old administration has suffered an irrecoverable blow. During the daily question period, shouts of ''You're lying, Brian!'' were directed across the floor at Mr. Mulroney, the political newcomer who swept to power in 1984 on a groundswell of public repudiation of the Liberal Party of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The 47-year-old Mr. Mulroney, his bass voice lowered, faltered occasionally, seemingly uncertain whether to reply in kind or to stick with the posture of sobered disappointment he had adopted since appearing at a news conference last Sunday to confirm what is being called the biggest political scandal here in years. Already, the affair has members of the governing Conservative Party worrying that the party is doomed in the next election, which must be held sometime before September 1989. Land Deal at Issue The case began with disclosures in The Gazette of Montreal about a $1.6 million profit on land being sold to a military contractor in St. Jean-sur-Richelieu, near the Vermont border. As a result, Mr. Mulroney announced that he had dismissed a junior transport minister, Andre Bissonnette, and ordered an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Mr. Bissonnette was the seventh Mulroney Cabinet member to be dismissed, several on issues involving political propriety. A senior minister from Toronto, Sinclair Stevens, fell to accusations of mixing government and personal business, and others went for miscellaneous embarrassments - a Defense Minister, Robert Coates, for going to a striptease club while visiting Canadian forces in West Germany; a Fisheries Minister, John Fraser, for approving the sale of tainted tuna, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Erik Nielsen, for overly antagonistic behavior toward opposition members in the Commons. But none of the previous cases provided such a stark example of seeming skulduggery in high places, nor of inexperience in making Cabinet appointments, as the way in which associates of Mr. Bissonnette and, according to some reports, his wife, Anita Laflamme, profited from the sale of land to a Swiss company, Oerlikon Aerospace Inc. Plot Is Sold 3 Times What is known about the affair so far is that the 100-acre plot in the Quebec town changed hands three times in 11 days in January 1986, three months before Oerlikon obtained a contract valued at $440 million - and possibly twice that much, depending on purchases - for providing Canadian troops in West Germany with a missile defense system against tanks and low-flying aircraft. The land deals increased the value of the plot from $590,000 to $2.2 million, the profit going to local speculators, at least some of them known to Mr. Bissonnette. The Canadian Press news agency, quoting ''an insider'' in Mr. Mulroney's office, reported that Ms. Laflamme received $400,000 in Canadian money -more than $290,000 - from the deal. Other reports said that Oerlikon lawyers have determined that $710,000 profit went to Normand Ouellette, who resigned as Conservative Party president in the St. Jean constituency represented by Mr. Bissonnette in Parliament when the affair became public. The company has demanded the money back. The 41-year-old Mr. Bissonnette, who ran a successful chicken business before being recruited by the Mulroney party in 1984, has denied any wrongdoing. But an Ottawa newspaper, The Citizen, reported he was actively involved in the land deal, lobbying for a local zoning change that made it possible. Other reports have said that a cheaper plot in a St. Jean industrial park was passed up by Oerlikon in closing the deal. The implication is that the Swiss company knew it was dealing with people with influence in Ottawa. One link was through Jean Bazin, a Montreal lawyer and close friend of Mr. Mulroney, whose law firm was involved in negotiating the land purchase for Oerlikon and who is now a director of the aerospace company's Canadian subsidiary. Mr. Bazin was recently appointed by Mr. Mulroney to the Canadian Senate. Charges Are Denied Charges in Parliament that the Conservatives have allowed cronyism and corruption to run rampant, particularly in Mr. Mulroney's native Quebec, where the party won its first majority ever in 1984, have been vigorously denied. But the Prime Minister has acknowledged the seriousness of the affair, calling it ''odious and completely unacceptable'' and promising that criminal charges will be laid if the police investigation justifies them. But Mr. Mulroney, who was scheduled to leave on an African tour over the weekend, has risked further blows to his prestige by rejecting calls for a judicial inquiry. ''You don't want the facts, you want a circus,'' he told opposition questioners. Privately one Mulroney associate reported that morale among the party's 208 parliamentary members - out of 282 - was at a low ebb. ''There are a lot of us who think that we may have passed the point of no return,'' he said. Message of the Polls A Gallup poll taken last month, before the land case broke, showed the Conservatives with only 30 percent support among decided voters, compared with 45 percent for the Liberals - enough to bring Mr. Trudeau's successor as Liberal leader, John Turner, into power with a landslide if an election were held. Other polls have shown that public doubts about Mr. Mulroney's personal credibility have played a major role in undermining the party's support. For the Conservatives, who took power from the Liberals only twice in nearly 50 years before Mr. Mulroney, once for nine months in 1979-80, the prospects seem bleak. But Joe Clark, Prime Minister in the previous Conservative administration and currently Foreign Minister in the Mulroney Cabinet, says much can change before the next vote. ''It's a tough time, no doubt about it,'' the 47-year-old Mr. Clark said in an interview. ''But governments go in and out of these things, and we will too, I'm sure of it.''

225-> GENTLE METHOD PROVES BETTER FOR PREMATURE BABIES' LUNGS
A GENTLE hand has outperformed the traumatic technology commonly used to treat breathing problems of premature babies. A less intrusive method of treating respiratory distress in premature babies' first hours and days, developed at a New York hospital, often prevents development of a serious breathing disorder in the months that follow, according to a new study. The findings imply that the tracheal tubes, mechanical breathers, high oxygen levels and paralyzing drugs normally used to save underweight babies are sometimes causing the subsequent disorder, experts said. The breathing disorder, known as chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary displasia, afflicts perhaps one-third of extremely premature babies, who often require administration of extra oxygen for months. It extends the need for costly intensive care in a hospital, impedes infant feeding and growth and means more lung infections in the first year or two of life. 'Godsend' to Pediatricians ''Anything that means less'' chronic lung disease ''would be a godsend to pediatricians working in nurseries,'' said Dr. Jerold Lucey, editor of the journal Pediatrics, which published the new report yesterday. The study compared the health of 1,625 extremely premature infants at eight hospitals specializing in the care of premature babies. The infants ranged in birthweight from 700 grams to 1,500 grams, or about one and a half pounds to three and a half pounds. Mature babies weigh from 3,000 grams to 4,000 grams. Breathing difficulties arising from undeveloped lungs are a major threat to premature babies. In standard practice, as severe problems become apparent doctors insert a tube through the nose or mouth to the trachea and apply oxygen-rich air with a mechanical ventilator. To prevent a struggle against the tubes and machine, the baby is paralyzed with muscle-relaxing drugs. But one hospital in the study, the Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, has developed a markedly different approach that involves less harsh intervention. Warm, Humid Air At Presbyterian, doctors take measures at the first sign of breathing difficulty, often right in the delivery room. But instead of inserting tracheal tubes and using a ventilator, they insert short plastic prongs in the nostrils and blow in warm, humid air at a steady mild pressure. Extra oxygen is applied only to the sickest infants, far less often and for shorter periods than at most hospitals. Another key difference at Presbyterian is that a single doctor, Dr. Jen-Tien Wung, supervises the breathing treatment of all premature babies, allowing for greater continuity of care than is commonplace. The new report, by a panel of 17 experts, found that Presbyterian Hospital's approach was as good or better at keeping newborns alive and was associated with fewer cases of chronic lung disease, defined as the need for supplementary oxygen at the age of 28 days. At that age, only 21 percent of infants at Presbyterian needed extra oxygen, as against 29 to 42 percent of infants at the seven other hospitals. Differences in sex and race, associated with different disease rates, were taken into account. Dr. L. Stanley James, director of perinatology at Presbyterian, said doctors there had originally developed the new method ''because it seemed to be less traumatic to the infants.'' The evidence of health benefits, he said, suggests that more intrusive techniques increase the risks of injury and infection and may impede the natural ability of the lungs to mature. ''We think we are avoiding damage,'' Dr. James said. ''If we can keep the lungs open, they seem able to recover on their own.'' The senior author of the new study, Dr. Mary Ellen Avery of Harvard University, called the findings ''terribly important.'' While drawing attention to the major differences in practice between Presbyterian and other hospitals, the report did not recommend their wholesale adoption nationwide and called for further research. Movement Toward Gentleness The study could not specify what accounted for the reduced lung disease, Dr. Lucey said. Is it the steady air pressure applied through nasal prongs, the avoidance of paralyzing drugs or tracheal tubes, or is it mainly the skill of Dr. Wung, practicing what is as much an art as a science? Still, Dr. Lucey said, ''I think there will be a movement toward gentleness of care, and a reexamination of the use of paralysis.'' Lung disease is only one of several complications of prematurity, and the study did not evaluate the effect of different therapies on other problems such as intracranial hemorrhage, eye damage, heart murmurs and abnormal behavioralevevelopment. The journal Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 30,000 doctors in North, Central and South America.

227-> WASHINGTON RAIDERS: Herbert and Robert Haft; The Dynasty Behind Dart's Expanding Empire
''MY father always has to be building something,'' says Robert Haft. The 34-year-old Mr. Haft is a member of the Washington family that controls the Dart Group Corporation's retailing empire, but the comment concerns his father's new house. Right now, on a shady, quiet street off Massachusetts Avenue, a crew of workmen is building a mansion for Herbert H. Haft. In June 1985, the senior Mr. Haft paid $1.7 million for a 60-year-old English Tudor mansion set on the site - a half-acre lot near the Canadian ambassador's residence and the sprawling Saudi Arabian embassy. A month later, he tore it down and began plans for a home that may cost $4 million before it is completed. It isn't the first time that the 66-year-old Mr. Haft has built something new and more valuable atop an old foundation. After selling the family's original business, the discount Dart Drug chain in 1984, Mr. Haft and his son Robert took the $160 million in proceeds and $250 million more raised through junk bonds and went looking for other retail operations to run. In the process, Herbie and Bobbie Haft, as they are known in Washington, are starting to build a nationwide reputation as a couple of much-feared corporate raiders. ''The Hafts are perhaps the shrewdest and most exciting players within the Beltway,'' said one local businessman. ''They've taken a run at some of the largest companies, proved they are serious players, and have made it plain they aim at owning a major corporation someday.'' Plain indeed. Less than a year ago, in a speech to a group of alumni from George Washington University, the usually secretive Herbert Haft advised that ''we really want to replace our drugstore business with a large business.'' The Haft family - which also includes son Ronald, 28, daughter Linda, 36, and Herbert's wife, Gloria Haft - already has a controlling interest in three other businesses together worth at least $200 million -Crown Books Corporation, a discount bookstore chain, Trak Auto Corporation, a discount auto-parts chain and Combined Properties Limited Partnership, a real-estate holding company run by son Ronald that owns more than two dozen Washington-area shopping centers. But friends and business associates say they seem somewhat bored and are eager to apply some of their cost-cutting techniques and discount-marketing strategy to a much larger organization. Over the past two years, the Hafts' investment vehicle, the Dart Group has taken aim at five multibillion-dollar companies, all of which - for a price - got away. In 1985, the Hafts went after the Beatrice Companies, May Department Stores Company and Jack Eckerd Corporation, the nation's second-biggest drug chain. Last summer, they were locked in a bitter, three-month struggle to acquire Safeway Stores. Next, reports surfaced that they had agreed to drop a takeover attempt of Federated Department Stores. Just two months ago, they were rumored to be accumulating shares of Stop and Shop Companies, a New England grocery chain. Some analysts question whether the Haft organization's Washington experience has prepared them to run a national company many times bigger than Dart, but no one disputes the organization's ability to come up with the purchase price. According to Washington-area banking and business sources, the family is sitting on top of a war chest of almost $700 million in cash and has the bank credits to leverage that into billions of dollars. Though the Hafts will not release the exact figures, they do not dispute the estimates. SENTIMENT about the Hafts runs strong in Washington's business community, which is dominated by real estate developers, retailers and some publishers. ''People who know the Hafts personally invariable say that the entire family - from Herbie, to Gloria, to Linda, to Robert, to Ronald - is the most intensely competitive they know,'' said Bill Regardie, publisher of Regardie's, a Washington business publication. ''And you have to remember, Washington has never been known for its businessmen. The bright people here generally go into law or politics.'' Herbert Haft has built a reputation as a shrewd businessman who is a relentless and tough negotiator. ''It got to the point where Herbie would drive such a hard bargain that he was the only one in a deal that would come out with a profit,'' said one prominent banker. And because the family's failed efforts to buy a big company have paid off handsomely - it has generally sold its shares back to the target company at a hefty premium - some critics are yelling greenmail. What's more, analysts at brokerage houses in and around Washington are frustrated by the family's retreat into secrecy and silence over the past 20 years. Though three of the companies controlled by the Hafts are traded in the over-the-counter market - the Dart Group holding company, Trak Auto and Crown Books - the family runs its operations as privately as possible and communicates little with analysts. Eliot H. Benson, research director of the Washington brokerage firm of Ferris & Company, traces the retreat back to the late 1960's, when ''the Hafts had developed a pretty good relationship with the brokerage community.'' At the time, says Mr. Benson, there were problems with the opening of a new warehouse and with Dart Drug earnings, which ''began falling apart - and that was when communications broke down.'' Analysts and investment bankers also attribute the lack of disclosure to unpleasant publicity the Hafts have received. They cite, for example, the 1972 initial public offering by the Hafts of their real estate arm, Combined Properties Limited Partnership. According to a local brokerage firm, Combined Properties was brought public at about $20 a share, but dropped to about $10 in 1973 and 1974, when the real-estate market plunged. The Haft family then bought back the stock at a price considerably below the initial offering price, a transaction that soured many in the brokerage community, according to Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., a retail analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond. Another bout of negative publicity followed in 1981 - the result of a complex and bitter legal battle involving the Hafts and a former officer of Combined Properties. Whatever the reasons, the family's desire for secrecy has reached the point where Dart seems to discourage the public from attending their annual meetings. Not much of Dart's stock finds its way into public hands. Under its current corporate structure, the Dart Group owns 66 percent of Trak Auto and 34 percent of Crown Books. Dart itself has two classifications of stock. Its Class A common, with no voting rights, is traded publicly, while the Class B stock, with voting rights, is controlled by the Haft family. Public shareholders who manage to gain access to the annual meetings are no doubt disappointed, anyway. At the 1985 Trak Auto event, Herbert Haft refused to answer any questions from the public and adjourned the meeting after only six minutes. The secrecy extends to the press, too. The Hafts rarely grant interviews and shun publicity. Mr. Regardie recalls that in the mid-1970's, when Herbert allowed him to distribute a sister publication of Regardie's, the New Homes Guide, in his drugstores, ''he said the one thing I could do for him in return was never to have him appear in my magazine.'' Robert agreed to be interviewed for this article, but he generally follows his father's tight-lipped style. ''We have never felt,in our retailing business or our other activities, that it is wise to let competitors know what you're doing,'' he said. Still, despite the complaints about this secrecy, the cries of greenmail and the criticism about the family's tough business tactics, the Hafts have their loyal fans. ''They do all their homework, do extensive market research, run the numbers out and recognize when value is there and when it is not,'' said Daniel Goode, an investment banker, now with Shearson Lehman Brothers, who worked with the Hafts when they were considering a bid for Beatrice. In fact, even critics of the Hafts say they are some of the most astute businessmen in Washington. ''We may all be talking out of sheer envy,'' said Mr. Gassman of Wheat First. That business acumen began to surface years ago, when Herbert Haft was working as an Army supply officer during World War II. Young Herbert learned the art of dealing with large volume shipments and took back those skills when he returned to his family's Washington home after the war. Inheriting a penchant for drug stores from his father, who worked as an assistant pharmacist in the Washington area, Herbert Haft became a full-fledged pharmacist and in 1954 opened his first Dart Drug Store on Columbia Road and 18th Street. Discounting had not yet become a widely acceptable form of business, but Mr. Haft began cutting prices on toothpaste, cosmetics and other products. ''While everyone else was selling vitamins that cost them $4 a bottle for $10 a bottle, my father was selling them for $4.99 a bottle,'' said Robert Haft. The marketing approach didn't sit well with the two other major Washington drugstore chains, Peoples Drug and Drug Fair, nor with Mr. Haft's major suppliers - Parke-Davis, Squibb, Max Factor and Revlon. They brought dozens of lawsuits against the little company to stop the practice. Herbie Haft fought back, eventually joining a Justice Department price-fixing lawsuit that won the right to discount drugstore products. Friends and business associates say, however, that it is the scars from these battles that are partly responsible for Mr. Haft's rough-and-tough business style today. AFTER winning the war against his suppliers, Mr. Haft expanded his Dart Drug stores to 10 locations and took his company public in 1960. At the same time, he began to buy real estate, more as a way to find locations for his Dart Drug stores than as an investment. He also started selling other products in his pharmacies - shoes, athletic equipment, auto parts - always using the same strategy of being a low-cost operator who sold name-brand products at a discount. By 1979, recalls Mr. Regardie, the Hafts found that ''auto parts were so successful - often more successful than their pharmaceuticals - that they decided to spin off the operations into Trak Auto.'' The Hafts took the company public in 1983. As for the drugstore chain, though customers sometimes complained that the Dart stores were understaffed, less than clean, weak on prescriptions and poorly stocked, the discounting strategy worked well. Dart grew and was profitable, finally expanding into 73 locations. By the late 1970's both Crown Books and Trak Auto were part of the Dart empire, and by 1984, when the Hafts sold the drugstore chain to a management group in a leveraged buyout, Mr. Haft had taken his place among Washington's tight circle of business successes. A windfall for the entire Haft family, the Dart Drug sell-off meant salaries and bonuses of $5.1 million for Mr. Haft and $5.5 million for son Robert for the year ended Jan. 31, 1985. Both men also scooped up another $5 million in profits from exercising their options on Dart Drug stock. The total compensation made Herbert and Robert the fifth- and seventh-highest paid executives in the country for 1984. Chrysler chief Lee A. Iaccoca was No. 6. Herbert still takes time off from wheeling and dealing to run Trak Auto, which today has sales of $100 million and more than 200 outlets in and around Washington, Richmond, Chicago and Los Angeles. CROWN Books, though, is run by Robert, who founded the bookstore chain. Crown traces its origins to 1976, when Robert, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, was studying at both the Harvard Business School and Harvard's school of design. On his daily walks through Harvard Square, he passed more than a dozen bookstores. One day, as he sat in a classroom at the Business School, listening to a top executive from the Dayton Hudson Corporation lecture on discount retailing, he asked why no major corporation had ever set up a discount bookstore chain. ''He got pretty angry at me and told me that was a dumb question because it would never work.'' said Mr. Haft. Undaunted, Robert took his idea on the road after he graduated in 1977, traveling around the country for five months to study the book business. Then, with some hefty financial and marketing help from the senior Mr. Haft - he started Crown Books. ''At first, I encountered the same kinds of opposition that my father did in the 1950's,'' he said. ''The major publishing houses would not sell to me and I had to buy from book wholesalers. That's all changed now.'' Crown, which went public in 1982 and which had revenues of $137.2 million and profits of $6.7 million in the latest fiscal year, currently has 200 stores to its name. It is the third-largest book retailer in the country, after Barnes & Noble and Walden Books. And in four of Crown's five primary locations - Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco - it is the No. 1 book retailer. Apparently, this empire does not keep the Hafts busy enough. Robert still talks of wanting to run another retail business. He wanted to run Safeway, he claims, even though his family netted some $140 million on the stock and options they sold back to Safeway management after their $3.9 billion cash bid was rejected. He discusses the supermarket chain's strengths and weaknesses, pointing out that there is clear room for improvement (''The average Safeway store in the Washington area has revenues of about $9 million a year, compared with an industry average of $12 million to $13 million.''). All this energy will find expression in a bid for another company, analysts say. But it may not come right away. ''I think the Hafts clearly want to own and operate a major company, but they are not going to make a quick purchase,'' said Mr. Goode of Shearson Lehman. Close business associates say the stock market's recent surge has made some potential targets more expensive and thus less attractive. ''You can always find bargains in a down market or even a steady market,'' said one associate, reflecting the Haft's ever-present discounting strategy.''But in such a strong market, it's much harder.''

228-> Burmese Sentenced to Hang
A 63-year-old woman has been sentenced to hang for trafficking in heroin, the official News Agency of Burma said today. It said the woman, Daw Kyi, was arrested in Mandalay in June 1985 with 7.7 pounds of heroin. Executions for drug offenses are rare in Burma and the woman can appeal against the sentence to a higher court.

229-> THEY'RE NEW YORK GIANTS, AND THE CITY SHOULD PAY FOR THE PARADE; What an Extravagance!
To the Editor: American Express offers to underwrite a ticker-tape parade that might cost $700,000 if the New York Giants win the Super Bowl. I paid $80 to see the Mets play in the World Series, and nobody wants to see the New York Giants win more than I. But, disregarding the fact that neither the New York Giants nor the New York Jets plays in New York anymore, I think it is outlandish and outrageous that $700,000 should be spent for something like littering the streets of New York and, incidentally, inviting untold quantities of pickpockets and thieves to a juicy day of work. Suppose we take that same $700,000 and fix up the subway, or donate $100,000 to seven charities. Then if the Giants win the Super Bowl, the poor and homeless of New York benefit. They will remember that it was because of these very Giants that they were maybe a little better off. One does not need a useless, dirty and potentially hazardous, albeit rip-roaring, ticker-tape parade to show genuine happiness over the hoped-for victory of the New York Giants. What a useless and wasteful way of spending $700,000. RICHARD ROSENBERG New York, Jan. 11, 1987

231-> A CRIME RISE SPURS BRAZIL LYNCH MOBS
During the wake for a taxi driver killed in late December in the western town of Amambai, word reached mourners that a murder suspect had been found. A few hours later, his bullet-riddled and mutilated body was dumped beside an outlying road. He was the victim of a lynch mob. Days earlier, in the southern town of Umuarama, three young men who were arrested on charges of murdering a local photographer and raping his fiancee were pulled out of jail and beaten to death in front of several hundred people. Their bodies were then tied to a car and dragged through the town before being burned. A few days later, on Dec. 27, five men in the eastern town of Ipiau who had been accused of assaulting and wounding a local taxi driver were also pulled from their cells and murdered, to the applause of a crowd estimated at around 1,000. ''I saw hate in the eyes of those people,'' one local official later told reporters. With small variations, these scenes have been repeated on scores of occasions in recent years as communities in both large cities and small towns have reacted angrily to Brazil's rising crime rate. ''A lynching is a grave symptom,'' Justice Minister Paulo Brossard said. ''It reflects dissatisfaction with the police and with delays in the application of justice.'' A Victim Who Was Not Guilty The latest incidence of mob justice -four others have occurred since late November - won headlines here for one macabre reason: In the case of Amambai, just hours after the 25-year-old former policeman, Josa Nestor, was killed by colleagues of the slain taxi driver, it became apparent that he was not guilty. Witnesses said that while being beaten and tortured, Mr. Nestor insisted that he had been some 40 miles away with a friend and her mother at the time of the murder. And although three taxi drivers were dispatched to verify the alibi, Mr. Nestor was shot to death before they returned to Amambai with confirmation of his story. As with previous lynchings, however, there was little expectation that those responsible for Mr. Nestor's death would themselves be brought to trial. In some cases, in fact, such has been the anger of communities besieged by crime that hundreds of people have come forward to say they took part in lynchings. In other cases, small police units have simply preferred to prolong investigations until the incidents have been forgotten. Nonetheless, the frequency of lynchings reflects the extent to which violent crime has come to dominate the urban way of life here. In polls published before nationwide elections here in November, a lack of security was identified as Rio de Janeiro's most serious problem, while 60 percent of those questioned in Sao Paulo favored the death penalty. A radio commentator who regularly calls for the death penalty won the most votes in an election in Sao Paulo. Crime Tied to Recession Sociologists here have linked the sharp rise in crime to a four-year recession that began in 1981 and left millions of people out of work. But they also blamed the neglect of education and other social priorities that marked the economic strategy adopted by the military regime that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985. At the same time, the police in most cities lack either the resources or the experience to deal with the situation. As a result, Brazilians have grown accustomed to hearing hair-raising stories of assaults or even witnessing crime in action. Sunbathers outside the Sheraton Hotel here recently heard a gun battle between the police and criminals, and then saw dozens of heavily armed police officers combing an adjacent slum while a submachine gun was fired into nearby undergrowth from a helicopter flying overhead. In Brazil's largest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, ways of life have also changed to adjust to the insecurity. Women, for example, avoid wearing jewelry on the street, and at night drivers rarely stop for traffic lights for fear of assault. In addition, the number of people carrying firearms is said to have grown, and in the last five years the price of buying or renting houses has fallen in relative terms because apartment buildings are considered safer.

232-> BANKAMERICA BOARD REJECTS MERGER
Directors of the BankAmerica Corporation today unanimously rejected a merger proposal from the First Interstate Bancorp and vowed to fight for BankAmerica's independence. ''We're going to come out fighting with everything we have,'' said A. W. Clausen, the bank's chairman and chief executive officer. BankAmerica also said that it would soon file a registration statement for raising additional capital and that it may issue equity securities. It did not say how much it hoped to raise or how it would market the shares. First Interstate, in a statement late today, said it was ''disappointed'' by BankAmerica's rejection. It also said it was ''regrettable'' that the board had made the decision without first discussing the matter with First Interstate. The Los Angeles banking company said it would ''continue to study the situation and review its options.'' First Interstate is considered likely to keep pressing its offer. BankAmerica's rejection had been expected. The board had previously asked First Interstate to withdraw its bid. At a news conference after the board's meeting here, Mr. Clausen called the First Interstate proposal ''wholly inadequate, highly conditional, of questionable marketability and clearly not in the best interests'' of shareholders or customers. Stock Below Book Value As for raising capital, the bank has been reluctant to initiate a common stock offering because the price of its stock is depressed, and a new offering would further dilute the value. Mr. Clausen said that it was too soon to talk about specifics and that it might be premature to talk about new common stock, hinting that the bank might issue preferred shares instead. The common closed today at $15, up 12.5 cents. Bank officials said they might sell shares either to a big institutional investor, such as another financial institution, or through a public offering. Mr. Clausen, who was making his first comments to the press since October, said that BankAmerica would return to operating profitability in 1987, meaning that the bank would be profitable even without nonrecurring gains from the sale of assets. He said it was unlikely, however, that the bank would restore its common stock dividend in 1987. It was eliminated last January because of the bank's huge losses. He would not say whether the dividend would be restored in 1988. Silent on Details BankAmerica officals did not say how they would fight the proposal from First Interstate. First Interstate has indicated that, pending regulatory approval, it plans to go ahead with its hostile bid, in which it is offering to buy each BankAmerica common share for $21 in securities. Industry sources said BankAmerica had already complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission about what it sees as deficiencies in First Interstate's registration statement. It is also thought that BankAmerica might sue First Interstate or adopt a ''poison pill'' defense to fight a takeover. BankAmerica has also sought Congressional hearings to put pressure on First Interstate to drop the offer. Bank officials have met with Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, who subsequently asked for hearings by the Senate Banking Committee on the merger. Mr. Clausen and other bank officials gave several reasons for rejecting the offer. Offer Called Inadequate Bank officials said the bank's financial adviser, Salomon Brothers, had found the offer to be financially inadequate. Also, BankAmerica officials said, the offer is worth less than $21 a share because the combination of securities being offered by First Interstate is of questionable value. ''If shareholders could get $17 in cash for them, I think they'd be lucky,'' said Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer. ''Those securities are a joke.'' BankAmerica also said that the merged bank would be undercapitalized and that First Interstate's management had no experience running a bank as big as the merged institution would be. BankAmerica also said that the merger would have difficulty obtaining regulatory approval and that BankAmerica's board thought management would be better off trying to restore the bank to profitability than in trying to negotiate a merger that would not be consummated. BankAmerica's Recovery Plan BankAmerica said its own recovery plan would create more value for shareholders than First Interstate's plan. Mr. Clausen said First Interstate's proposal would allow First Interstate shareholders to obtain 60 percent of the benefit of BankAmerica's coming turnaround. Referring to the fact that many of First Interstate's executives, including its chairman, Joseph J. Pinola, had formally worked at BankAmerica, Mr. Clausen said, ''In a way, we taught them everything they know, but we didn't teach them everything we know.'' Senator Cranston has called on the Banking Committee's chairman to hold hearings ''very early in the new Congress'' to take a ''hard look'' at the proposed transaction. In a letter to the chairman, Senator William Proxmire, Mr. Cranston said, ''I am particularly concerned about the implications that a merger between these banks would have on the concentration of assets and on competition in the banking industry.''

234-> 2 WITNESSES IN RACE ATTACK ARE FOUND
Two people sought as witnesses in the assault of three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, have been found but say they are unable to identify any members of the gang of white assailants, law-enforcement officials said yesterday. One of the witnesses, they said, is a woman who anonymously called the 911 emergency number at 12:55 A.M. on Dec. 20 to report that whites were beating a black man at the edge of the Shore Parkway. One of the three victims of the assault, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man, was killed by a car as he tried to cross the parkway while fleeing the assailants. The other person found, the officials said, is a man who had called the police earlier, at 12:39 A.M., to report that three ''suspicious'' black men were in a pizzeria at 157th Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard, eight blocks from the site of the beating near the parkway. Chased to Edge of Highway It was while leaving the pizza parlor that the black men were first confronted by their assailants, who then chased two of them to the edge of the highway, the police said. According to Alice T. McGillion, deputy police commissioner for public information, the woman told the police she ''cannot identify faces'' because she was too far from the site of the beating. Nor did this witness see anybody scramble through a hole in a fence next to the parkway, as Mr. Griffith reportedly did in trying to escape from the gang, Ms. McGillion said. She said the woman, a Howard Beach resident in her 50's whom she declined to identify, had called the police from her home. Ms. McGillion said the police discovered Monday night, in doing another canvass of the neighborhood, that the woman was the anonymous 12:55 A.M. caller. The woman had been interviewed before, but the detectives in the earlier interview did not learn she had been that caller, Ms. McGillion said. The police spokesman said the man who called about suspicious blacks in the pizza parlor ''says he didn't see the confrontation at the pizzeria.'' It occurred after police officers responded to his call and then left when told by a counterman that the blacks were not causing any problem. ''He just confirms essentially the story as we know it, but he can't add anything,'' Ms. McGillion said of the man, who was found by detectives Monday night. She described him as a 23-year-old resident of nearby Ozone Park who, when he called the police from a phone booth near the pizza parlor, gave his mother's maiden name and her phone number as well as the number in the booth. The man told the police he had considered the three black men suspicious because, before they went into the pizzeria, they had been walking behind him in the street in Howard Beach and ''he felt he would be a victim of a crime'' committed by them, Ms. McGillion said. The police have said the black men had gone into Howard Beach on foot after their car had broken down nearby. The search for additional witnesses has taken on added importance since the man prosecutors described as their key witness, Cedric Sandiford, one of the attack victims, refused to cooperate in the prosecution of three white teen-agers accused in the assault. Murder, manslaughter and assault charges against the youths were dropped last week after Mr. Sandiford refused to testify at a court hearing because, he later contended, the police and the Queens District Attorney's office were conducting a ''masquerade investigation.'' Among other things, his lawyer has said, the authorities were seeking to ''cover up'' that the driver of the car that killed Mr. Griffith, Dominick Blum, was an accomplice of the assailants. A Passing Motorist Law-enforcement officials say their investigation has shown that Mr. Blum, a court officer from Brooklyn whose father is a city police officer, was not involved in the assault but was just a passing motorist. Mr. Blum left the scene after his car struck Mr. Griffith but returned an hour later and was not charged with any crimes. He told the police that he had thought he hit a tire or an animal. Police officials yesterday revised earlier figures they had given for the number of calls the 911 emergency number had received regarding the assault and its aftermath. The number was 22, they said, rather than 24, as they had reported earlier. They said 20 of the 22, most anonymous, had been made by people, probably motorists from the Shore Parkway, who reported someone walking on the parkway or a body lying there. Three of the 20 callers have been identified and interviewed but could not supply information about the assault, the police said. As the police pressed their hunt for more witnesses, District Attorney John J. Santucci of Queens said that despite his office being hampered by Mr. Sandiford's refusal to cooperate with it, his staff was taking the steps needed to present the case before a Queens grand jury. These steps, he said, include interviewing potential witnesses before the grand jury to determine whether, if called, ''they would have anything worthwhile to contribute.'' Ready to Move Quickly He said he had not yet decided whether he would present the case to a Queens grand jury or ask Federal authorities to prosecute the case as a civil-rights violation. But he said he had asked his staff to proceed with the preliminary steps for a presentation to a local grand jury so that, should he decide to pursue that course, his office would be ready to move quickly.

235-> Sherlock Holmes and His Maker
To the Editor: In his essay on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (''The Sainted Sleuth, Still on the Case,'' Jan. 4), Anthony Burgess says that Doyle was ''knighted for services to literature.'' This might give the impression that Doyle was knighted for his Sherlock Holmes stories and his historical novels. Doyle, however, was knighted for his services in the Boer War: he managed a voluntary hospital in Bloemfontein, and he wrote two books on the conflict, namely ''The Great Boer War'' and ''War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct.'' Doyle accepted the knighthood with reluctance, and Sherlock Holmes, of course, in ''The Adventure of the Three Garridebs'' refused a knighthood. BERNARD JOHNSTON Brooklyn

236-> WHAT'S NEW IN HOTEL SAFETY
THE scene following the New Year's eve fire that killed 96 people at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was a familiar one: officials parading before the television cameras, calling for tougher fire prevention laws. Similar appeals were heard after fatal fires in 1980 at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and at a Stouffer's Inn in Harrison, N.Y. ''Just like those earlier fires, we needed a disaster before anyone called for changes in the laws,'' said Larry Chervenak, president of a New York consulting firm, Chervenak, Keane & Company, which advises hotels on fire-safety technology. Typically, however, the spirit of reform is extinguished not long after the last embers. Instead of one uniform fire code, the United States has as many different codes as there are municipalities, and changing a local code may achieve the unwanted result of driving away hotel business. Thus, once the furor over a major fire subsides, local officials often lose interest in revising the codes. What fire codes fail to accomplish, however, publicity and the threat of legal action may. After each hotel disaster, more guests and business customers inquire about their hotel's fire safety before they make reservations. Businesses that plan conferences or conventions make hotel fire safety a top item on their check lists. And insurance companies, which pay the millions of dollars in liability lawsuits, are raising premiums or requiring that hotels install fire safety devices before they can receive coverage. The technologies and products to minimize and even eliminate most hotel blazes are available today, fire-safety specialists say. A review of new fire prevention products suggests that simply applying existing technology could help to drastically reduce the number of deaths from hotel fires. What is needed, the specialists say, is the political will to require the lodging industry to install basic fire prevention products, such as smoke detectors, sprinklers and flame retardant materials. A number of hotel chains - including Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton, Radisson and Americana - have responded to these pressures by requiring their hotels to install basic fire safety devices. At the same time, companies making fire protection devices have introduced a wave of new products that resist, retard, stop or detect fires. Underwriters Laboratories, a Northbrook, Ill.-based nonprofit organization that tests products for safety, including fire resistance, tested some 76,800 products in 1985, 52 percent more than it tested five years ago. ''I don't know if it is because companies increasingly see the need to have their products' safety tested or if it is all because of an increase in new products, but there has been a steady increase,'' said Sharon Dalton, a spokesman for Underwriters Laboratories.

237-> SCOUTING; Faust Got I-A, Huggins Got Zip
Largely overlooked amid the national publicity given Akron University's hiring of Gerry Faust to head the football program last year was the damaging effect that it might have on the Zips' successful basketball program. The chickens are now coming home to roost, and the school's administration has one unmistakably dismayed coach on its hands. Part of the deal in Faust's agreeing to take the Akron job was that the Zips were committed to moving the football team up to Division I-A in the fall of 1987. That meant they couldn't remain in the I-AA Ohio Valley Conference. Since O.V.C. rules require members to compete in the league in both sports, it also meant the departure of the basketball team, a circumstance that is wreaking havoc with Coach Bob Huggins's program. The 33-year-old Huggins took the Zips to the O.V.C. championship last season, a crown that gave them an automatic berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament, but they won't have that route available next year unless they can latch on with another conference. And, having been turned down previously by the Mid-American and Metro Conferences, Akron basketball took another blow last week when its application was denied by the Association of Mid-Continent Universities. Now, the team will almost certainly have to compete next year as an independent, and it must somehow fill the 14 holes on its schedule where O.V.C. games used to be. Huggins has taken pains to avoid pointed criticism of the administration, but he does say that in the rush to upgrade football, his team was all but forgotten, and he acknowledges, ''I'm not very happy.'' He plans to meet in the next few days with William Muse, the university's president, and Athletic Director Dave Adams ''to discuss the future of the program.'' ''The basketball situation,'' says Adams, ''is an unfortunate byproduct of the football situation. We're exploring every possibility.''

239-> POSTINGS: 122 Semidetached; Midway Positioning in Lawrenceville
Tiffany Woods, a new home development in Lawrenceville, N.J., is hoping to attract to its wooded 30-acre site buyers who will appreciate its placement eight miles from the halls of academe at Princeton and 58 miles from the glitter of New York City. And, if matters constitutional or gambling are more to the buyer's taste, Philadelphia is 29 miles away, Atlantic City 77 miles. Eventually, the site, which is off Spruce Street in Lawrence Township, will have 225 houses. At present, construction is under way on 122 two-story homes, each linked to one other in semidetached fashion, with occupancy scheduled for this summer, according to the developer, Michael P. Blumenfeld. The plot sizes will range from 3,000 to 9,000 square feet. The size and shape of the remaining houses has not yet been determined. In the first phase, four models are available, about 60 percent of them three-bedroom homes and the remainder two-bedrooms. The smallest two-bedroom will have one-and-a-half baths and 1,054 square feet of living space. The largest three-bedroom home will have two-and-a-half baths and 1,475 square feet of space. The price range will be from $101,000 to $128,000, which Mr. Blumenfeld said is slightly below the prevailing market rate in the area. Among the options available, the developer added, will be ground-floor box windows, fireplaces and a stone facade instead of a brick front the ground floors of all models. In addition, bay windows may be added in the three-bedroom models.

240-> ABOUT EDUCATION; SPENDING: ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK
Are we spending too much on education? The question was asked in the cover story of Forbes Magazine's year-end issue by Peter Brimelow, a senior editor and a former aide to Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah. Mr. Brimlow asked further: ''Why is it that people who complain about $600 toilet seats for the military don't become indignant when someone points out equally flagrant waste in the schools?'' The questions come at a time when spending on education and other public services is under attack. In Mr. Brimelow's view, ''the education business'' stonewalls in the face of criticism or financial threats. He charges, for example, that John Brademas, the president of New York University and a former Indiana Congressman, replied ''with something less than academic calm'' when Education Secretary William J. Bennett asserted that thousands of college students from families with annual incomes over $100,000 benefitted from Federally subsidized loans. Asked about this assertion, Mr. Brademas replied that ''this claim was, and remains, false'' and that Mr. Bennett had not produced any evidence to support it. Mr. Brademas, who sponsored or supported many education programs while he was in Congress, said the more important charge at the core of the Forbes report - that too much money is spent on public education and that the expenditure has produced massive failure - is equally false. Magazine's Key Charges Although Mr. Brimelow considers such a response ''stonewalling,'' it is probably not very different from that of the medical profession, the automobile industry or other groups threatened by cutbacks in support. Still, leaving aside what is merely normal human or institutional behavior, the issues raised by the Forbes article deserve some analysis. The key charges and observations are: * The number of pupils per teacher was 37 in 1900 and 27 in 1955; today it is 18. * The United States spends 6.7 percent of its gross national product on education, exceeded only by Sweden with 8.5 percent. The Soviet Union is about even with the United States, but other industrial contries spend less, from 5.7 percent for Japan to 4.6 percent for West Germany. * Despite increased spending on education, achievement has declined: Scholastic Aptitude Test scores fell from an average of 969 in 1961 to 890 in 1981, and have since stabilized at 906. (The maximum possible score is 1,600.) * The Department of Education reports that in 1983-84, 16 percent of college freshmen needed remedial reading instruction, and more than 60 percent of the colleges said they offer more remedial courses now than in 1978. * Finally, the Forbes article questions the widely held belief that college is a sound personal investment. The article suggests that college students are a self-selected group who would probably earn more than the average high-school graduate anyway. Conservative Views The Forbes article reflects conservative views, particularly those of the Reagan Administration toward public education. Yet, many of its claims are misleading, starting with its statistics about class size. Teachers in any inner-city school might hail it as a miracle if they could find a class of only 18 students. The statistics the magazine cited include supervisors, administrators and others who are not actually in the classrooms, where one teacher is still likely to have 30 or more students. The Forbes article rightly criticizes the increase in supervisory and administrative costs which has led to a steady decline in the proportion of school funds used to pay teachers, to 40.5 percent of school budgets in 1985 from 55.4 percent in 1955. But the problem is not, as Mr. Brimelow charges, that we are spending too much for education. Rather, we are not spending it in the most productive way. Other figures simply ignore major changes in school and society. No money had to be spent on remedial instruction in high school or college at the turn of the century when only about 4 percent of the age group went to college. There is no point in comparing the achievements of high school graduates today, when approximately 75 percent of students graduate, to the time, about 50 years ago, when about 70 percent left school before graduation for jobs which required little education or even basic literacy. Most of those jobs no longer exist. Many factors account for the decline in S.A.T. scores, which many observers consider flawed even as predictors of a student's performance in the first year of college. The number of students taking the test increased dramatically during those years that scores declined, including the number of girls who, for as yet unexplained reasons, score substantially lower on the test than their male classmates but outperform them in college. Experts dispute Mr. Brimelow's and Secretary Bennett's assertion that the infusion of money into the schools through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 has achieved little. For one thing, the gap between the achievements of black and white students has been substantially narrowed; that was one of the legislation's primary goals. As for percentages of the gross national product spent on education, comparisons can be deceptive. Japan, which spends only slightly less than the United States, has a homogeneous population, which is much easier to educate. Moreover, the figures for Japan do not include some $4 billion spent annually by parents for their children's after-school cram courses. In West Germany, many children are educated in non-public religious schools. College-Bound Students Perhaps most important, none of the other industrial countries approach the United States' percentage of young people going to college. The increase of remedial instruction in college coincides with the opening of access to greater numbers of students, including many who come from non-English-speaking families. All this points to underlying difference between those who would side with Mr. Brimelow and those who would stand with Mr. Brademas, a difference in the view of the role education should play in shaping a society. Mr. Brimelow is clearly justified in criticizing some of the schools' weaknesses, such as neglect of teachers and over-emphasis on administration. In education, as in many industries, much of what is wrong and wasteful is the fault of management. Mr. Brimelow cites the growth of private school enrollment and the fact that about 50,000 children are being educated by their parents at home as ''evidence of consumer distress with public education.'' He endorses a Reagan Administration proposal that parents be given $3,677, the average annual expenditure on a public school pupil, and allowed to choose which school their child will attend. In fact, however, the growth of private school enrollment is largely due to the establishment of fundamentalist schools, a religious rather than educational trend. And if 50,000 children are being educated at home, they are a small faction of the nearly 40 million children enrolled in school. Further, the proposal seems to overlook the fact that the annual tuition at good private schools approaches $6,000. And even this amount must be augmented by funds raised from parents and alumni. This in turn raises the question whether we are spending too little rather than too much on public education.

241-> France Raises Rates in Bid to Aid Franc
France raised interest rates again today in an effort to stave off a devaluation of the franc. The currency has come under speculative pressure caused by a crippling 19-day rail strike and the threat of wider industrial unrest later this week. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's conservative economic policies are facing their toughest political challenge since he took office last March, Today he broke his public silence for the first time since the rail stoppage began to rule out pay concessions to the strikers. ''It is not the intention of the Government to take risks through a loss of control over wages,'' he said. Such a step would ''spread through the whole of the public sector and into private industry,'' he added. Spur to Inflation Seen Mr. Chirac said wage increases above the Government's norm of 2 to 3 percent for state-owned industries would imperil France's current low 2 percent inflation rate and lead to slower economic growth and more job losses later. The Government devalued the franc by 3 percent eight months ago, soon after it come to power, and it is not eager to do so again. The franc's weakness has forced France's right-wing Government to raise interest rates higher than they were under the Socialists. This threatens its hopes of spurring industrial investment and lowering unemployment. But many bankers now believe the Government may soon be forced to devalue the franc against the strong West German mark or seek a face-saving upward revaluation of the mark instead, if the strikes continue and the dollar weakens further. 'We Could Get a Respite' ''Rates could go higher if our social problems persist and European currency values may require adjustment,'' said Sabian Rullier, chief foreign exchange dealer at Credit Commercial de France, a major state-owned bank. ''But if the strikes fade we could get a respite,'' he added. The Prime Minister's pledge, combined with a rise of half a percentage point in the central bank's seven-day money rate, to 8.75 percent, and a slightly stronger dollar - the American currency rose to 6.3900 francs from 6.3550 - led to a firming of the battered franc. The mark, which traded at 3.3120 francs previously, weakened to 3.3069 francs today. In West Germany, an influential newspaper, Die Welt, reported today that many currency traders in Frankfurt now believed the Bonn Government might be forced to accept a 3 to 4 percent upward revaluation of the mark against the franc in advance of the Jan. 25 elections there. Previously, the conventional wisdom at European currency exchanges was that Bonn would postpone any adjustment of European Monetary System exchange rates until the elections were safely out of the way. Attack by Union Leader Meanwhile, Henri Krasucki, the leader of France's largest union, the Communist-dominated Confederation Generale du Travail, stepped up his attack on the Chirac Government today with a call for more ''stoppages and demonstrations'' throughout the nationalized industrial sector, starting on Tuesday. Communist and Socialist trade unions also renewed strike action on the Paris subway system, which had been running normally for several days after earlier stoppages. Speculative pressure first started building up against the franc in late November, when students forced the Chirac Government to abandon planned university changes and the central bank was forced to raise interest rates to defend the currency. As the challenge to the Government's authority widened with trade unions calling strikes in the public transport sector, pressure on the franc increased and the central bank was again forced to push up the short-term money market rates it now mainly relies on to control money supply growth and manage the exchange rate. But bankers believe the central bank also spent around $1 billion out of its reserves, intervening directly to support the franc on currency markets. As a result, the central bank's day-to-day money rate now stands at 9 percent, compared with 8.80 percent a year ago, when the Socialists were in power, and a low of 7.05 percent last August. Government loans are now yielding 9 to 9.25 percent, also back where they were a year ago, after slipping to around 7.50 percent last June.

242-> CABARET: TODD STOCKMAN
WHILE ventriloquism remains a popular art form associated in the public mind with children's entertainment, a handful of performers are nudging ventriloquism into territory where hand puppets and dummies become adult alter egos. Todd Stockman, the 28-year-old ventriloquist who is appearing at Panache (149 East 57th Street) on Monday evenings through January and on Tuesdays thereafter through Feb. 24, creates one-man musical comedy using several characters who sing, tell jokes and do celebrity impressions. Mr. Stockman's characters, all hand puppets, include a mop-topped redhead named Buster, a sassy black derelict named Grady, Miss Coco, a female impressionist who spoofs Carol Channing, Joan Rivers and other stars, and Mr. Turtle, a floppy green puppet who confesses that he would rather watch adult movies at home on his video-cassette player than appear at children's birthday parties. ''In Concert,'' Mr. Stockman's show, is an amiable, sweet-natured entertainment that only rarely takes off into the realm of the truly goofy. The show's most inspired moment is a make-believe ad for a ''talking Bible,'' a book-shaped puppet with attachable eyes that flaps its cavernous mouth as it delivers the scriptures.

246-> 'Star Wars' Guarantees Research Sinecures
To the Editor: Thomas G. Moore of High Frontier characterizes scientists who oppose the Strategic Defense Initiative (popularly known as ''Star Wars'') as having ''careers and reputations vested in maintaining the status quo'' (letter, Dec. 11). Doesn't the shoe belong on the other foot? It seems to me that the combination of intensive research funding and appeals to patriotism has created a vested interest in S.D.I. among many scientists. Those who labor in the foxholes of scientific discovery find this combination hard to resist, particularly at a time of cutbacks in funds for basic research. Those scientists who oppose S.D.I. would appear to have the most to lose by expressing their views. If such critics as Jerome Wiesner and Kosta Tsipis have any vested interest in their opposition (apart from consistent adherence to the methods of scientific inquiry), it is not very evident. JAY H. BEDER Milwaukee, Dec. 29, 1986

247-> TV REVIEW; 'THE VISA WAR' AND FREE SPEECH
IN a way, the McCarran-Walter Act is a sitting duck; outspoken critics outnumber outspoken supporters. McCarran-Walter allows the State Department to bar any foreigner deemed ''prejudical to the public interest'' from entering the United States. Critics say this stifles free speech; supporters say it protects the Republic. ''Do Not Enter: The Visa War Against Ideas'' takes the side of the critics without dismissing the supporters. The documentary, on Channel 13 at 11 o'clock tonight, is a responsible piece of work. At the same time, the documentary makes its case too easily. McCarran-Walter may indeed be a blot on free speech and an embarrassment to the nation; we're unsure, however, where the controversy is symbolic and where it is real. Has McCarran-Walter really impeded the flow of ideas? This seems unlikely. ''Do Not Enter'' indicates as much when it interviews foreign writers and political figures who have been denied visas. ''I will not be defeated by those who would not have me speak,'' says Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican author, in a ringing denunciation of visa policy. In fact, Mr. Fuentes lectures at American universities. His visa application, once denied, was granted when he reapplied. Meanwhile, as the documentary notes, nobody's books, plays or thoughts are excluded, only, from time to time, the physical presence of the authors. ''Physical presence,'' says William F. Buckley Jr., who defends McCarran-Walter, ''has a more convulsive effect.'' Is there something to that? ''Do Not Enter'' presents Tomas Borge, Interior Minister of Nicaragua, who says 14 universities in the United States have invited him to their campuses. ''If I could go, I would tell the truth to the North American people,'' he insists. ''President Reagan personally ordered my visa to be denied.'' Mr. Borge live on campus undoubtedly would have a more convulsive effect than Mr. Borge live on television. The question is, so what? ''Do Not Enter,'' produced by Robert Richter, a distinguished documentary maker, argues that it doesn't matter. Ideological censorship, it says, has no place in a democracy. The documentary - which was co-produced by Catherine Warnow - is persuasive about this; democracies are supposed to allow all views to be heard. But a problem with most public discussions of McCarran-Walter - and ''Do Not Enter'' is no exception - is that many participants who call for a free traffic of views are more adamant about the right to hear some views than others. Mr. Borge, for example, is unlikely to want Patrick J. Buchanan, the White House Director of Communications, to speak at National University in Managua. The playwright Arthur Miller, who attacks United States visa policy with great relish in ''Do Not Enter,'' is unlikely to try to persuade Mr. Borge to change his mind. Grant now that those are extreme examples. There still wasn't much public outrage when the Carter Administration used McCarran-Walter to exclude Ian D. Smith, the Prime Minister of Rhodesia. Rhodesia, now named Zimbabwe, was at the time coming under majority rule. When the Reagan Administration excluded Roberto d'Aubuisson, the leader of the far right in El Salvador, only Senator Jesse Helms seemed upset. Consequently, one does get the feeling that many critics of United States visa regulations are grinding foreign-policy and not civil-liberties axes. ''Do Not Enter'' would be a stronger documentary if it presented some conservative opponents of visa policy - there are some - rather than the liberal-to-left opponents we have come to expect. It also would be stronger if it gave figures on how many foreigners are actually excluded. ''The Paper Curtain,'' a first-rate documentary that argued last year for the amendment of McCarran-Walter, noted that in 1984 only seven people were excluded from the United States for ideological reasons; over a 20-year period in which 70 million nonimmigrant visas were granted, only 500 were denied as ''prejudicial to the public interest.'' These included the denials to suspected spies. ''Do Not Enter: The Visa War Against Ideas'' doesn't give us this perspective. It's so intent on making its argument that shadings are lost. Watch it anyway. It does have something to say.

249-> BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTICS; Quick, Simple Testing for Drugs, Illness
SIMPLE, fast and reliable new tests that detect everything from drug abuse to strep throat to acquired immune deficiency syndrome are being developed for use in doctors' offices, outpatient clinics, corporations, and possibly even in the home. The tests, which produce accurate results in minutes instead of the hours required by current tests, are also simpler, less expensive and more sensitive than most diagnostics currently on the market, according to industry experts. As more large corporations adopt mandatory tests for drug abuse, and as cases of sexually transmitted diseases continue to rise, analysts expect the new tests to have a significant impact on the diagnostics market, which had more than $2 billion in sales last year. Under current screening methods, tests are sent to private laboratories where they are evaluated by specially trained technicians using costly instruments. The new tests are portable, require no instrumentation and can be completed in a doctor's office or company medical department, significantly cutting the cost of mass testing, such as screening employees and insurance applicants. Analysts also foresee widespread use of fast, accurate diagnostics as a means of stemming the spread of infectious diseases. Most of the new tests employ a diagnostic procedure known as the lock and key effect, in which bodily fluids, either blood or urine, are mixed with reagents - antibodies that seek out specific antigens found only in the anticipated drug or virus. The antibodies fit the antigens like a key into a lock, and if there is a match, the solution or test paper changes color. The more specific the antibody, the faster and more accurate the test. The first on-site test for drug abuse was introduced last month by Medical Diagnostics Inc., a subsidiary of the Keystone Medical Corporation, based in Columbia, Md. The test, called KDI Quik Test, takes only minutes to screen for the use of cocaine, crack, morphine, PCP, amphetamines, methadone and codeine. A drop of urine is placed on a sheet of chemically treated paper that develops a ring if one or more drugs are present. This product enables large companies to determine inexpensively which employees require further testing, according to Mariola B. Haggar, who follows the diagnostics industry for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. KDI Quik Test sells for $7.50 a unit. Shipping, handling and laboratory costs for current screening tests run between $15 and $25 a test. But Ms. Haggar warned that KDI was only a screening test, and could not be used as a legal basis for action against employees who test positive for drug abuse. Those employees must undergo more comprehensive confirmatory tests, such as gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry, which breaks the sample down into individual ions, providing absolute proof of drug use. Other diagnostics companies, such as Abbott Laboratories and Hoffmann-La Roche, are developing on-site tests for drug abuse. The Diagnostic Products Corporation of Los Angeles is developing a drug-abuse test that works with saliva. For proprietary reasons, Sigi Ziering, Diagnostic's president, would not elaborate on the test, but said it would eliminate the possibility of employees tampering with urine samples or substituting someone else's urine. ''Most of us would consider someone watching us give a urine sample totally unacceptable, but saliva appears to be a way out,'' Ms. Haggar said. Redington Inc., a Canadian biomedical company, plans to introduce in the second quarter a second-generation test for detecting AIDS. Unlike the first-generation AIDS tests, Redington's test screens for specific proteins that are found in all AIDS cases, instead of the AIDS antibody, which can be present without the virus, company officials said. The test, which renders results in 10 minutes, as against two to four hours for similar procedures, is portable and requires no special training. Blood serum is placed in a cartridge along with the reagents. If the subject is positive, the three small holes at the bottom of the cartridge turn blue. If negative, no color change occurs. Analysts said that such a test would be particularly valuable in third world nations, where more elaborate tests are often unavailable. Other companies with on-site AIDS test are Abbott Labs, Electro-Nucleonics and Litton Industries. Diagnostic companies report that a wide variety of fast, on-site tests -including those for colon cancer, strep throat, ovulation, blood glucose for diabetics, herpes and arthritis -are under development. Analysts said that many of these tests are expected to become so simple to use that they could be performed at home.

253-> FUND MANAGERS EXPECT FURTHER GAIN FOR STOCKS
After two days of surging stock prices, Wall Street professionals said yesterday that they remained optimistic about yet-higher prices in 1987. But they repeatedly stressed the prospect of a trading environment marked by wide price swings. ''We remain bullish and we continue to look for lower interest rates in order for the equity market to sustain its momentum,'' said William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates, which manages $4.5 billion for institutional clients. In looking to the bond market for leadership, Mr. Harnisch cited the need for yields on long-term Treasury bonds to drop below 7 percent. Yesterday, these bellwether bonds finished at levels to yield 7.34 percent. Martin D. Sass, who heads M.D. Sass Investors, described yesterday's performance as ''a snapback rally in stocks but not a sustainable explosion.'' ''The big surprise of this year could be that the economy and the stock market will be stronger than expected by the present consensus on Wall Street,'' said Mr. Sass, whose firm manages $2.7 billion. ''I think you are going to see a very volatile market, possibly ranging as high as 2,300 and as low as 1,700 on the Dow during the year.'' Yesterday's close was a record 1,971.32. According to Mark Tavel, president of Value Line Asset Management, which tends $1.5 billion in assets, ''the stock market continues to be driven by the huge amount of money - or liquidity - that is available for investment.'' Value Line's own forecast for 1987 is for the Dow industrials to average about 2,035. ''Clearly, this means that there is room for the Dow to get above that figure during the course of the year,'' Mr. Tavel said. In early December, Byron Wien, domestic equity strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, said that his target for the Dow industrials was 2,100 ''over the next several months,'' and yesterday he held to this forecast. He also thinks that the market might well surprise portfolio managers with its strength in the early part of 1987. 'No Reason for Euphoria' Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy committee at Paine Webber, said he remained ''positive'' on the market outlook. ''There is not much risk in prices at this level, but there is also no reason for euphoria,'' he added. ''A Dow at 2,000 or 2,100 would not shock me. But, by and large, 1987 could turn out to be a year with a trading range of plus or minus 10 percent in the broad market averages.'' In Providence, R.I., Henry M. Greenleaf said he saw the Dow possibly moving as high as 2,200 or even 2,300 during 1987. Mr. Greenleaf is president of HT Investors, a subsidiary of the RIHT Financial Corporation, which manages $1.1 billion. ''We expect group rotation in the market to place greater emphasis on sectors that are more sensitive to changes in the economy,'' he said. ''Here the most secure cyclical plays are the paper and chemical stocks, although the airlines, too, should perform well. ''We expect to see a considerable pickup in domestic production in 1987,'' Mr. Greenleaf added, in outlining the case for economically sensitive stocks.

254-> WHO ARE THE POWERS BEHIND OFF BROADWAY?
When Alan J. Schuster learned that Tina Howe's ''Coastal Disturbances,'' one of the most acclaimed plays of the fall season, had completed its limited run uptown without being picked up by a commercial producer, he put in an urgent call for the script. Mr. Schuster is managing director of M Square Entertainment, owner of the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village. ''Angry Housewives'' had just closed at the Minetta Lane, and Mr. Schuster thought that ''Coastal Disturbances'' might be the perfect show to keep the theater from going dark. He also figured it would cost about $250,000 to bring ''Coastal Disturbances'' downtown, and didn't think that would present too much of a problem. Yesterday, the playwright's agent, Flora Roberts, said that, barring any design problems, ''Coastal Disturbances'' would reopen at the Minetta Lane in a few weeks. M Square - whose other principals are Marvin R. Meit, chairman, and Mitchell Maxwell, president - is one of several small fiefdoms that have emerged in the lucrative Off Broadway of the 1970's and 80's. Five years ago, when M Square owned only the Orpheum Theater, the company bought a deserted tin-can factory in Greenwich Village and converted it into the Minetta Lane. The 415-seat theater opened in August 1984 and today is worth between $4 million and $5 million - more than double the $2 million investment, according to Mr. Schuster. Recently, the company took a longterm lease on the Second Avenue Theater, where, Mr. Schuster said, M Square will produce a $2 million dollar musical adaptation of ''The Chosen'' by Chaim Potok, which it hopes to move to Broadway. Meanwhile, at the Orpheum, on Second Avenue at Eighth Street, ''Little Shop of Horrors'' continues, a longtime musical hit. Not Often Empty The three M Square theaters aren't dark often. Nor are the Lucille Lortel and the Promenade, two Off Broadway theaters run by Ben Sprecher, who also is a part owner of the latter. And if Jack Ross and Charles Timm have had less consistent luck with Playhouse 91, the 299-seat theater they opened on the Upper East Side in 1983, their Actors Playhouse, in Greenwich Village, is nearly always occupied. For better and for worse, the commercial Off Broadway today bears a closer resemblance to Broadway than to the loose-knit confederation of single-theater owners, owner-managers and noncommercial groups of the past. ''I started as a theater landlord in 1978, when I took over the Orpheum,'' the 37-year-old Mr. Schuster said in a recent telephone interview. ''My grandfather had always talked about the theaters on Second Avenue. But the neighborhood was entirely boarded up. I had no money, so I talked people into donating 90 hours of work. I was using my unemployment checks to buy materials.'' Things have changed. When Mr. Schuster now says, ''We use theater ownership as a means to get product,'' he sounds remarkably like his Broadway counterparts. As with Broadway, commercial Off Broadway theater owners have been contending with ever-increasing production costs matched by ever-increasing ticket prices. Unlike Broadway, however, Off Broadway remains - at least for the moment - a place where the financial risks are less astronomical and the rewards can be attractive. ''It's tougher than when we began,'' said Mr. Ross, of Playhouse 91 and the Actors Playhouse. ''Off Broadway is facing the same problems as Broadway, though it's not as desperate. Years ago, nobody expected to earn a living Off Broadway. Now they do.'' A Bonanza of Offers Indeed, when the director and choreographer Michael Bennett sold his building at 890 Broadway last fall, the new ownership was in the comfortable position of being able to choose from at least three proposals by outside producers to operate the building's 299-seat theater, while a number of Off Broadway theater owners expressed disappointment that they hadn't been approached about it. Theaters tend to be going up rather than dark. At the Second Avenue Theater, once a 1,100-seat house haunted by the ghosts of the Yiddish theater and vaudeville, M Square plans to follow that trend. ''We are seeking means,'' Mr. Schuster said, ''that would allow us to have a legitimate theater and a film theater at the Second Avenue.'' Translation: Off Broadway can be profitable, but not for a Broadway-size house. Another striking similarity between the Off Broadway and Broadway theater owners is the realization, voiced in nearly every conversation, that an owner has to produce to survive. ''What we have discovered is that you can't just depend on rentals,'' Mr. Ross said. ''You need them to pay the bills; some we've had to take purely for financial reasons. But I'm trying to get a selection of plays and produce them myself. We've optioned two plays by Paul Zindel and we're going to spend more time traveling around the country, looking for plays.'' Knowledgeable People Needed ''You need to give people something worth the ticket price,'' said Mr. Ross, a former teacher, director and administrator at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, ''and you need knowledgeable people.'' Many shows Off Broadway today -whether ''The Common Pursuit,'' the literary Simon Gray play at the Promenade; ''Groucho,'' the biographical revue at the Lortel, or ''Little Shop'' at the Orpheum - look, sound and cost like Broadway. Mr. Schuster's proposed budget for the transfer of the intimate ''Coastal Disturbances'' is nearly the same amount it cost to move ''The House of Blue Leaves'' from Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater to Broadway's Plymouth. ''Coastal Disturbances'' failed to win a Broadway producer during its brief run. But Mr. Schuster found himself in competition with other Off Broadway theater owners for the play, and that situation didn't particularly faze him. ''I don't perceive other Off Broadway owners as competitors,'' Mr. Schuster said, sounding again a lot like at least one of his uptown counterparts. ''There's enough product that we all could stay filled. Broadway is boom or bust; you can't be moderately successful. Off Broadway, you can.''

255-> They Love a Parade
There is no denying that New Yorkers love their hometown sports teams. I am writing this letter to point out the feelings of local pride and excitement we experienced as a result of the success of the Mets last fall, and now the Giants. These feelings seem to transcend the differences that exist here. Not even the disinterested would deny the emotional high experienced from the play of the Giants or the Mets. I enjoy sports, and I am disappointed by the recent remarks concerning the possibility of a parade in Manhattan. I don't really care if there is one, or where, or if they are the New York or New Jersey Giants, or traitors or patriots. As a New Yorker, I refuse to deny the great excitement and pride that they have provided for us. This fall, when the Mets played in and won the World Series, the lights on the Empire State Building were orange and blue. Even though I am a Yankee fan, I thought this was the perfect tribute, symbolizing the loyalty and excitement we all shared. Isn't it appropriate that we can look up at the building that is the symbol of this great city and see the Giants' colors -blue and red - symbolizing our feelings and honoring the achievements of a home team on the verge of a championship.

256-> ABOUT REAL ESTATE; FIRST 30 TENANTS ARE SET AT RETAIL CENTER IN JERSEY
As the steel framing for the peaked-roofed, village-style retail complex in Plainsboro Township, N.J., takes shape, the first 30 tenants have signed deals to take more than 25 percent of the retail space in Princeton Forrestal Village. The new development, the retail component in Princeton Forrestal Center, the sprawling 2.5-square-mile office and research park owned by Princeton University, is under construction at the intersection of Route 1 and College Road. It is being developed and managed by the Toombs Development Company of New Canaan, Conn., and will have 125 shops and restaurants as well as office space and a 300-room Marriott Hotel. The retail complex has been a part of the overall outline for the center since the plans were drawn more than a decade ago. But it was only last fall that construction began on a $130 million retail center across the road from an office park. The retailers will be mostly clothing, gift, houseware and furniture stores. Among the retailers that have signed leases for space in the ''village'' is Esprit, the San Francisco-based women's and children's apparel concern. Others are Roots, a New Jersey-based men's shop; LaVake, a Princeton jewelry store; Caswell-Massey, an international chain of shops that sells fancy toiletries; Rodier, a Paris-based women's boutique with a store on Madison Avenue; Country Kids, and Scandinavian Design. The eating places will range from sandwich shops and coffee and danish stalls to full-service restaurants. ''The goal was to serve several populations at once,'' said W. Scott Toombs, the principal of Toombs Development. First among them are the 2,500 employees in the Forrestal Center who work for such companies as American Cyanamid, Xerox, Wang Laboratories and General Foods. Then there are 725,200 residents within 15 miles of the complex whose average age is about 33 years and who live in households with annual incomes of $43,600 a year. ''We want to create a retail mix that will not just bring people in every few weeks like the regional malls do,'' Mr. Toombs said. ''But we also want the kinds of shops, services and restaurants that draw people every day, like the main street of a village or small town would.'' In pursuit of that goal, Mr. Toombs has also signed leases for a barbershop, a tailor and custom shirt shop, a shoe repair establishment, an express mail operation and a video rental store. Mr. Toombs said that the restaurants and shops would also depend on patronage by guests at the hotel, which will have about 12,000 square feet of meeting space for conferences, conventions and parties. There will be no anchor store in the complex and most of the retailers will operate in spaces of about 1,200 square feet. The cost of space in the new complex ranges from about $25 to $29 a square foot. Mr. Toombs said that the rents were the same as in other regional malls selling high-priced goods in the Princeton area. For the design of Princeton Forrestal Village, the developer bypassed the standard style for suburban retail complexes: the strip center and the enclosed mall. Instead, the complex, as its name imples, will have a layout similar to a village, with a main street with a central square and pedestrian pathways with trees and benches. Designed by Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass., and Bower Lewis Thrower/Architects of Philadelphia, the buildings will have brick facades and such traditional elements as bay windows, slate roofs and balconies. Facing the central square, the Marriott Hotel will be the centerpiece at one end of Main Street. At the other end of the main throughfare will be Market Hall, a three-story building featuring indoor restaurants, sidewalk cafes and gourmet food and cookware shops. The other ''village'' buildings will have shop space on the ground floor and 190,000 square feet of office space on the second and third levels. In addition to these main commercial buildings, the complex will have an athletic club and day care center, each in its own structure. Parking for the complex will be on the periphery of the 125-acre site. In anticipation of heavy traffic, a privately financed interchange will be created at the intersection of College Road and Route 1 at the entrance to the Forrestal Center. Vast as the complex now is, it will get even larger. Last month, the Princeton Forrestal Center closed on a deal to buy almost 500 additonal acres of land across from the commercial complex, west of Route 1 and north of College Road West. According to Eugene D. Biddle Jr., director of marketing for the Princeton Forrestal Center, the newly acquired parcel, which was purchased from the Princeton Nursery, will bring the center's total acreage to 2,250.

257-> TWO SIDES OF A WAR: A CEMETERY AND A BESIEGED CITY; Mourning in Iran
On the arid flatlands south of this capital, a cemetery is growing quickly. Gravediggers with shovels rush from one site to another on bicycles. With several burials going on at once, funeral orators compete to make themselves heard. They have to use bullhorns to overcome the roar of a bulldozer preparing new ground. This is Behesht Zahra, a cemetery created for war dead. A fountain near the main gate gushes water tinted blood-red like some horrendous wound. Photographs on Display Thousands of graves are adorned with little metal shrines that display photos of young men and boys. Many others are simple furrows marked by a cardboard sign instead of a headstone. A carpet of leaves or an Iranian flag covers the freshly turned earth. Simple coffins and broad plastic sheets are scattered about. The official casualty counts on both sides in the Iran-Iraq war appear subject to distortions, but there is little doubt that many tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed in recent months. On the highway to Behesht Zahra buses decorated with funeral wreaths follow one after the other, carrying mourners to new funerals. A Central Fact of Life Perhaps more than ever before, the war is a central, inescapable fact of life in Iran. Having dragged on for more than six years, the war has had a decisive influence on the development of Iran's Islamic revolution, its economy and its foreign policy. Now it may be reaching a turning point that could decisively change the history of this country and of the Middle East. Several months ago Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, promised that the war would end in victory by the end of the Iranian year, now just eight weeks away. Since Jan. 9 Iran's soldiers have taken important steps toward achieveing that goal with an offensive that broke through several Iraqi defensive lines near the city of Basra. Although formidable obstacles remain between the Iranians and Basra, Iraq's second largest city, Iranian officials insist they have every intention of carrying on the fight. A clear sense of expectation has built up here. A rug merchant in the Teheran baazar said, ''Everyone knows that something is going to happen, but no one knows for sure what it will be.'' 'A Very Important Moment' A Western diplomat here expressed something of the same feeling. ''The war has gone through a lot of ups and downs without very many decisive engagements, but this is a very important moment,'' he said. ''Events could go a lot of different ways, but whatever happens on the battlefield will have a big impact in Iran.'' One reason for the uncertainty is that the war produces a stream of paradoxes. This is particularly evident in Iranian attitudes toward the United States. At the begining of the revolution America was declared the Great Satan because of its intimate ties to the Shah. Less is made of that association now that it has been eight years since the Shah was desposed. Propaganda posters and street murals routinely depict Uncle Sam or President Reagan or some other representation of the United States as giving bombs or other weapons to Iraq and particularly to its President, Saddam Hussein. Usually a Star of David is prominently placed to show that Israel is also involved. This message has got through because in random conversations with residents here an American reporter is frequently asked, sometimes angrily, why the United States supports Iraq. Knowledge of Arms Deal Even so, most Iranians seem to know that their Government has said that the Reagan Administration approached Iran with an offer of arms, an offer that the Government says was rejected. And more sophisticated Iranians know that their country's war machine has been kept running partly with weapons bought one way or another from the United States and Israel. Pronouncing a kind of abstract hatred for the United States has been a continuing theme of Iranian life, but that sentiment has now been largely transferred from the context of Iran's internal revolution to the war against Iraq. Measuring Iranian public opinion is no easy task, as several Administrations in the United States have discovered unhappily. Determining the war's impact is no easier because complex and not necessarily coherent feelings are expressed. One trend that seems discernible was described by a diplomat. ''Revolutionary inertia is down and it has been replaced with war fever,'' he said. ''Iranians all have deep feelings about the war, feelings that Iraq has caused great suffering and should be punished.'' Other Sentiments Evident The Islamic regime certainly stokes that war fever with such things as television broadcasts of combat footage introduced with the ''Star Wars'' theme and with collection boxes around Teheran University when thousands gather for Friday prayers there. Donations to the war cause are rewarded with little coupons bearing a picture of Ayatollah Khomeini and the inscription, ''If you help the war, you help Islam.'' But other sentiments are also evident when Iranians talk about the war. A grizzled man who denounced America's supposed support for Iraq then paused, looked to the sky and said plaintively: ''Oh, God! Let this war finally end. We pray that we will soon finish with this Saddam.'' Desperation mixed with anger was evident in a woman in black Islamic garb who approached a group of American reporters on the street. ''Tell the truth to all nations,'' she said. ''If our men die in the war, we women will go to the front. You must tell them we will stop Saddam from bombing our babies.'' The war has demanded all kinds of sacrifices from the Iranian people, but the human toll now seems to have the greatest impact. The rug merchant in his one-room store deep in the dark alleyways of the Teheran bazzar said: ''What kind of life is this? It is anything but life when you come to work and your friend says he lost his brother, or when you go home and your neighbor is weeping because they have told him he lost all three of his sons in the battle for Basra, but that they are martyrs so they will get a place in Behesht Zahra.''

258-> TROOPER-CASE DEFENDANT CALLED A LIAR
The defendant Thomas W. Manning lied when he testified about the slaying of a state trooper five years ago on Interstate 80, Deputy Attorney General Anthony G. Simonetti said today in summarizing the two-month murder trial. He said the three days of testimony by the 40-year-old avowed revolutionary was a ''contrived tale'' concocted to convince the jury that he fired in self-defense at the trooper, Philip J. Lamonaco, and that his co-defendant, Richard C. Williams, 39, was not there. Rather, the prosecutor said, the evidence showed that Mr. Williams did shoot the trooper with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic Browning pistol while Mr. Manning, the driver of the 1977 Chevrolet Nova that was stopped in Warren County on Dec. 21, 1981, aided and abetted in the murder. Mr. Williams's lawyer, Lynne Stewart, said in her summary that the state presented no direct evidence from any witness to place her client at the scene. The two made their summations a day after Mr. Manning's lawyer, William M. Kunstler, made his. Jury deliberations are to begin Wednesday. 'Tortured Theory' In her summation, Ms. Stewart said the state's ''tortured theory'' that Mr. Williams was there was illogical because the pistol used in the slaying was later found in a footlocker owned by Mr. Manning. Also, she said, witnesses supported Mr. Manning's testimony that his passengers were a Hispanic couple who were hitch-hiking, not Mr. Williams. Testimony by witnesses fit a ''pattern'' in which several people saw either two passengers or identified the occupants of the car as ''Hispanics'' or ''Puerto Ricans,'' she said. Ms. Stewart also noted that a driver who followed the car leave the scene saw a passenger with ''flowing'' hair that seemed to be that of a woman. Three Sets of Tracks She reminded the jury that Michael Flora, a handler of bloodhounds who was working with the authorities, said he and his dog followed three sets of tracks from the car after it was abandoned minutes after the shooting. Ms. Stewart concluded that her client was named as a defendant in the case only because the authorities disliked his revolutionary political views. But Mr. Simonetti said the flowing hair was caused by the wind after Trooper Lamonaco had shot out a window in returning fire from Mr. Williams. The wind, he said, made the occupant's hair look longer. And he said the Puerto Ricans do not exist. The prosecutor said the testimony of several witnesses could be pieced together to show that Trooper Lamonaco took a gun from Mr. Manning and that Mr. Manning retrieved it after his passenger killed the trooper. Mr. Simonetti said a ''slip'' in Mr. Manning's testimony confirmed that the trooper took such a gun from him. Mr. Manning had testified that before driving off after the shooting, he ran to the trooper's body to look for ''my gun.'' Asked about this, Mr. Manning later testified that he meant to say he was looking for the driver's license he had shown when his car was stopped.

259-> COMPANY NEWS; Owens to Talk With Its Suitor
Owens-Illinois Inc. said yesterday that it would hold discussions with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the New York investment firm that last week raised its bid for the glass container concern to $3.6 billion. The proposed offer by Kohlberg, Kravis would take Owens private in a leveraged buyout, a takeover strategy that uses a company's cash flow to repay the debt needed to finance its purchase. Owens's stock climbed $3.50 yesterday on the news, closing at $59 on the New York Stock Exchange. Owens also said it intended to hold discussions with other parties who might have an interest in acquiring the company. The Henley Group has been a rumored suitor for Owens, which is based in Toledo, Ohio, but a Henley spokesman said, ''We don't comment on rumors.'' Last Monday, Owens rejected a $55-a-share leveraged buyout offer from Kohlberg, Kravis. Several hours later, the firm raised its offer to $60 a share in cash and securities. The offer has produced a sharp split on Owens's 15-member board, with some outside board members opposing any move that would change Owens's status as an independent public company.

261-> RUSSIANS FIND MISSING POLAR POST
Soviet scientists examining satellite photographs have found an Antarctic research station that disappeared last fall when a piece of ice shelf with the outpost broke away. According to reports in the Soviet press, the missing station was spotted on satellite photographs as being on an iceberg in the Weddell Sea. The loss of the station, Druzhnaya 1, which served for seasonal surveys and was unoccupied when it vanished, was discovered in October as another annual expedition was about to set out. The original space imagery showed that a piece of ice, 60 by 120 miles, had broken off from the Filchner Ice Shelf, on which the station had been established more than 10 years ago. At the time it was not clear whether the station had been swallowed up by the sea or carried away on an iceberg. A Soviet Antarctic research official said in an interview with Pravda, published Jan. 7, that an effort would be made to salvage some of the equipment and supplies for use in a new seasonal station, Druzhnaya 3. The Soviet official, Artur N. Chilingarov, said scientists would try to determine whether the original station on the floating iceberg could be used temporarily pending construction of the new outpost.

262-> BENNETT ASSAILED ON EDUCATION CUTS
Education Secretary William J. Bennett sparred with Republicans and Democrats today in testimony before two Senate committees as he defended his support for cutting the education budget. Senators accused Mr. Bennett of allowing his loyalty to President Reagan's priorities to overshadow his responsibilities as an advocate for education. But the Education Secretary, clearly angered, insisted that the Federal role in education was by design more limited than, say, in national defense. He used that argument in rebutting several Senators who accused the Administration of attempting to underwrite increases in military spending through huge cuts in education. Specifically, the Administration's budget for the 1988 fiscal year would cut $5.5 billion from the department's current spending level of $19.5 billion. He Notes Size of U.S. Share ''Total national spending for education has climbed steadily,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''This department's share is less than 7 percent of that total.'' He said the cut would be more than offset by $14 billion in increases from other sources. ''Although education is primarily a state and local responsibility, this Administration has been at the forefront of the reform movement,'' Mr. Bennett said. His irritation, however, flared at several points as he insisted, ''American education has improved on this Administration's watch.'' In Mr. Bennett's first appearance of the day, before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, a Republican, told him that Congressional rejection of Administration budgets was responsible for any recent improvement in education. Mr. Weicker also objected to Mr. Bennett's citing the budget-balancing law of 1985, sponsored by Senators Phil Gramm, Warren B. Rudman and Ernest F. Hollings, as the motivation for the Administration's efforts to cut education financing. ''Don't blame Gramm-Rudman-Hollings for your budget,'' Mr. Weicker said. ''It's a question of the Administration's priorities.'' A Question of Party Mr. Bennett reminded Mr. Weicker, ''You are a Republican, Senator.'' And Mr. Weicker prompted laughter in the crowded hearing room when he retorted that he had been a Republican for longer than Mr. Bennett, who last year switched from being a Democrat. ''On the longevity meter, you've got me,'' Mr. Bennett replied. ''On other meters, maybe I've got you.'' In his appearance before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Bennett was acid when Senator J. James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, charged that he put his responsibilities as a Republican before his advocacy for education. ''My notion of being Secretary of Education is not yours,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''I'm not obligated to accept your notion.'' He also told Mr. Exon that the difference between the Federal role in education and its role in defense was a matter of ''Civics 1, Senator.'' One Says They'll Be Rejected Mr. Exon predicted, ''Your cuts in education will never be accepted by this Congress.'' And Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, seemed to express a similar view, describing it as ''inconceivable'' that Mr. Bennett believed that, of a total of almost $19 billion in cuts, $5.5 billion should come from education. Mr. Domenici later questioned whether Mr. Bennett, who has prided himself on meeting the target set by the Office of Management and Budget, had not objected to the proposal that his budget be cut so deeply. Mr. Bennett replied that to object was ''not my style.'' ''They set a mark,'' he said. ''We met it. We are not underinvesting in education. We are inefficient.'' He Wins Some Praise Mr. Domenici praised Mr. Bennett for focusing attention on education, as did Steven D. Symms, Republican of Idaho. But members of both parties deplored Mr. Bennett's support for budget cuts. The major topic was proposals to cut student aid for higher education. ''Financial assistance to college students cut 45 percent,'' said Senator Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida, who heads the Budget Committee. ''That will make it harder for the low-income to get a higher education.'' The Administration's proposals would cut grants to needy students by over $1 billion. Other aid programs would also be cut by more than $1 billion, and interest subsidies on student loans would end. In exchange, the Administration is seeking to expand to $600 million an experimental loan program now put at $5 million. Under its plan, the Administration would permit students to borrow more money than now permitted and would set repayment rates after graduation on the basis of income. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who heads the Labor Committee, opposed expanding the program before the experimental version had begun. And John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said Mr. Bennett's position on aid to higher education was ''absolutely wrong.'' He said the program would force students to choose professions in which they would make a lot of money. It tells them, he said, ''Use Ivan Boesky as your model.''

263-> Music Noted in Brief; New Repertory By Alexa Still, Flutist
Alexa Still is a young New Zealander who has had a busy professional life as a flutist in Auckland and now studies in the United States. She and several of her friends came to Merkin Concert Hall Sunday night, playing a program of largely American music from our time. Miss Still has, among other attractive qualities, an ear for pieces that are not only new but also substantially interesting. This listener found himself so involved in the music at hand that the artist's technical sureness and musical intensity were noticed only in retrospect. This is meant as a compliment. She had some troubles sustaining the spare, exposed lines of Aaron Copland's Duo for Flute and Piano, but one could only admire her easy shifting of stylistic gears from Arthur Weisberg's flowing Sonatine for Solo Flute to the neon-lighted explorations of piano and flute sonority in Steven Mackey's ''Crystal Shadows.'' There were more timbral adventures - and some lovely moments -in Elizabeth Vercoe's birdsong-inspired piece, ''Fantavia'' for flute and percussion. Elsewhere, Jeremy Beck's Sonata featured gentle parallel chords in its first movement and a gracefully animated use of triplets in all three. There was also Barber's gentle ''Canzone'' to begin and the altogether darker, starker ''Two Last Poems (Maybe . . . )'' of Ernest Bloch. The other performers were Frank Corliss, pianist, and Rick Glascock, percussionist.

264-> MUSIC: DEAK'S 'OWL IN LOVE'
THE least familiar music on the program the New York Philharmonic Chamber Ensembles played at Merkin Concert Hall Monday night was a set of three scenes from Jon Deak's ''Owl in Love.'' For the last several years, Mr. Deak has been experimenting with a musical syntax built around a wide variety of sound effects and actual, out-and-out instrumental imitation of human speech. ''Owl in Love'' is the latest in a series of quasi-theatrical works by Mr. Deak, and it proved a defiantly silly narrative, scored for soprano, flute, string quartet and double bass; at times it reminded one of ''Pierrot Lunaire'' as it might have been fashioned by Maurice Sendak. Sound effects aside, the score was a compote of cabaret song, film music and a wide variety of avant-garde stylings. Like most of the similar works this listener has heard from Mr. Deak, ''Owl in Love'' was more gratifying as theater than as music; still, I suspect that when Mr. Deak finally evolves his idiom the results may be startling, possibly even revolutionary. Lucy Shelton sang the soprano role with skill and humor; Mr. Deak played bass. The program opened with a fleet, mellifluous interpretation of a Telemann Quartet for Flute, Oboe, Bassoon and Continuo and concluded with a performance of Cesar Franck's Quintet for Piano and Strings. Jorge Bolet was the pianist, and his playing caused one to reflect anew upon the amount of sheer sensory pleasure the sound of a piano can provide. The performance, which also featured the violinists Kenneth Gordon and Oscar Ravina, the violist Dorian Rence and the cellist Nathan Stutch, was, by turn, tender, songful and glitteringly brilliant.

265-> TALES OF CHAOS: TUMBLING MOONS AND UNSTABLE ASTEROIDS
Bad news for those who thought they could at least rely on the stable clockwork predictability of heavenly bodies: the solar system has some surprises in store. A new picture of celestial motion suggests that the earth's neighbors include erratically tumbling moons and unstably orbiting asteroids, a chaotic menagerie that seems to provide, among other things, a solution to the longtime mystery of where meteorites come from. ''We have a strong prejudice that the solar system is dull - perhaps pretty, but not very interesting dynamically,'' Jack Wisdom of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told an audience of physicists, mathematicians, chemists and biologists here this week. In fact, he said, the solar system's spins and orbits are neither so simple or so regular as Newton's descendants might expect. New computer calculations, based on observations from the Voyager satellites and ground-based telescopes, show that just about every moon - except the earth's - has experienced millions of years chaotic tumbling, Dr. Wisdom reported. As he showed with a computer-generated movie, ''tumbling'' is a kind of motion utterly unlike the familiar spin of a body around an axis. A tumbling moon falls end over end, twists sidewise, speeds up, slows down, all the time obeying Newton's completely deterministic laws of motion, yet defy prediction in a way that scientists used to consider impossible. One of Saturn's moons, a 250-mile-long football-shaped body called Hyperion, appears to be tumbling now, and its unpredictability is such that even if Voyager I had measured Hyperion's position and speed to 10-digit accuracy, God's own computer would not have been able to calculate where it would be when Voyager II came by a year later. Hyperion is not alone, according to Dr. Wisdom's latest work. The moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, went through tumbling episodes on the order of tens of millions of years, and the propensity to tumble is the rule, not the exception. Strangely, tumbling results from precisely the same gravitational laws and tidal forces that cause moons to lock into a stable orbital ''resonance'' with their planets. The earth's moon spins once for every orbit, thus always showing the same face. Nor must the ratio be one to one. Mercury, for example, was long thought to keep the same face pointed to the sun; in fact it rotates exactly three times in every two of its ''years.'' Such resonances are not permanent, because energy drains away, lost to tidal friction. And when a moon breaks out of a locked mode, tumbling can ensue. The lesson for science - and it has been a hard lesson even for physicists to grasp - is that chaotic behavior is just the flip side of a simple Newtonian coin. ''Here is a departure from everything you've expected,'' said James Yorke, a mathematician from the University of Maryland. ''You have no special perturbation or complexity. It's just basic physics - yet it's doing something that nobody thought about.'' This was Chaos '87, a conference subtitled ''The Physics of Chaos and Systems Far From Equilibrium'' and attended by theorists and experimenters from 14 countries, including China and India. ''We're the revolutionaries plotting to bring order into chaos,'' David Campbell of Los Alamos National Laboratory told his colleagues. The scientists belong to a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field devoted to complex dynamical behavior in systems from astronomy to biology. They presented new results on the fantastic structures that arise in crystal growth and on the bizarre palm tree-like formations of intense shock waves. They described highly sensitive experiments designed to tackle the problem of tumult in fluid flows. One biologist promised a chaos approach to the problem of sexual reproduction, but ran out of time. As some saw it, the latest results suggest progress in moving beyond ''simple chaos'' to more complex systems - for example, in one version of the jargon, beyond ''wimpy turbulence'' to ''macho turbulence.'' At any rate, they argued, the era of simple, linear mathematics is over. ''Ideal problems are just in the textbooks, for the joy or desperation of students,'' said F. Tito Arrechi, a laser physicist from Instituto Nazionale di Ottica in Florence. A new theoretical approach to fluid turbulence came from Steven A. Orszag of Princeton University who also showed his audience a slide depicting a newspaper advertisement for the Off Broadway play ''A Girl's Guide to Chaos,'' described as a belly full of laughs and a glorious gigglefest. ''I hope these views of chaos don't apply here,'' Dr. Orszag said. He need not have worried. As is customary at high-level conferences, speakers did not always pitch their talks to the broadest possible segment of their hundreds of listeners. Mitchell J. Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University, whose theoretical breakthroughs in the 1970's gave strong impetus to the study of chaos, was one of several speakers who presented dazzling exercises in mathematical physics, greeted by a presumably respectful silence. Did Dr. Feigenbaum feel that his presentation was understood? ''Certainly,'' he said. ''I'm sure Yves Pomeau understood it,'' he said, referring to a theorist from Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. ''And I know Tito Arrechi understood it, because he's heard part of it before.'' A key to the progress in chaos -both cause and consequence - is the ubiquity of computers. James Glimm, a mathematician from New York University's Courant Institute, studying a variety of ''things that wrap around and get mixed up and entangled with one another,'' went so far as to say that there are now three ways of doing science. ''There used to be two: theory and experiment,'' he said. ''Now we have computing as well.'' And it was computing that enabled Dr. Wisdom of M.I.T. to solve the meteorite mystery. Astronomers have long suspected that meteorites striking the earth were stragglers from the asteroid belt, the vast region between Mars and Jupiter filled with flotsam and jetsam. Other sources were proposed - comets, for example - but the asteroid belt has the most obvious abundance of suitable material. The problem is, if meteorites are wayward asteroids, how do they get from there to here? Some scientists proposed asteroid collisions as a mechanism. But to change an asteroid's orbit enough to send it all the way to earth, a collision would have to cause a change in speed of well over 10,000 miles an hour. Any collision capable of imparting that much energy would smash an asteroid into oblivion. ''It just doesn't work,'' said George Weatherill of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, an authority on the solar system who suggested the problem to Dr. Wisdom. ''You need a gentle gravitational mechanism.'' Dr. Wisdom, meanwhile, was thinking about a different problem, the ''Kirkwood gaps'' in the asteroid belts. Astronomers have known for a century that asteroids with certain orbital periods were strangely sparse. It happens that the missing asteroids are the ones that would have certain resonanaces with the orbiter of Jupiter, such as 3 to 1, 5 to 2 and 7 to 3. So some theorists speculated that the periodic gravitational kick of Jupiter might account for the missing asteroids, but calculations failed to demonstrate this idea. On the contrary - in the long run, it seemed, asteroid orbits should remain stable. But Dr. Wisdom, using new mathematical techniques and a special-purpose celestial mechanics computer, built for him by an M.I.T. colleague, has solved both problems at once. Over very long time scales, when the perturbing influences of both Jupiter and Saturn are taken into account, the seemingly regular orbits of asteroids that stray into the Kirkwood gaps turn chaotic. For millions of years, he found, such an orbit seems predictable. Then the path grows increasingly eccentric until it begins to cross the orbit of Mars and then the Earth. Collisions or close encounters with those planets are inevitable. To many astronomers, such chaotic ''bursts'' of eccentricity seemed implausible. ''When Wisdom showed you could get this chaotic effect, it was met with considerable skepticism,'' Dr. Wetherill said. ''There was a tendency among almost everybody to say, 'well, he just doesn't know how to integrate yet, wait till he gets a little older, he'll understand these things.' '' But most are now convinced. Among other things, his trajectories correspond to a quirky piece of meteorite lore known as the afternoon effect: the tendency of meteorites to fall most heavily in the afternoon. As it happens, afternoon is when any part of the earth is facing the right way to capture misguided asteroids. ''It's sort of fun to see the true harmonies of the spheres here,'' Dr. Wisdom says. His next project is Saturn's rings, and he is also carrying out intensive calculations to check whether the solar system as a whole is stable or whether the planets will eventually go chaotic themselves. It is an open question, but so far, he said, the solar system seems stable.

267-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; TEN GIANT STEPS TO SUPERDOM
BEFORE the National Football League season began in early September, a Super Bowl crystal bowl contest was conducted among sportswriters. Select the teams that will get to Super Bowl XXI, and the score of the game. In a rare moment of clairvoyance, this entry read: Giants 28, Broncos 17. Now that this matchup has materialized, it would be foolish to consider another result, or even another score. But to anyone who might be tempted to wager his house on that prediction, or even his doghouse, remember that it comes with the same no-money-back guarantee that accompanied the belief here that George Foreman would knock out Muhammad Ali in the first round in Zaire. One difference, of course, is that the Giants have a better defense than Foreman had. But to appreciate the heights these Giants have attained, consider the depths to which they had fallen eight years ago. Early in 1979, the Giants had no general manager, no coach and no quarterback. The co-owners' feud had flared publicly. And the fans were in mutiny. But one by one, this franchise has taken 10 Giant steps to Super Bowl XXI, one backward and nine forward. On what looms as the most memorable day in Giants history, it's time for a reminder of how the Giants got here, beginning with that backward step during the 1978 season: 1. The Fumble. On what John McVay, then the coach, has called the ''most horrifying play in Giants history,'' Joe Pisarcik fumbled a handoff to Larry Csonka while trying to run out the clock. Herman Edwards of the Eagles scooped up the ball and ran 28 yards for a 19-17 victory. With that play symbolizing the ineptitude of the organization, three weeks later some fans decided not to take it anymore. 2. The Mutiny. At a meeting in a motel before that season's last home game, the Giants Fans Committee was formed. While the box office was counting 24,374 no-shows, a small plane flew over Giants Stadium, pulling a sign that read, ''15 Yrs. of Lousy Football We've Had Enough.'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' president, was hanged in effigy. On parking-lot grills, other fans barbecued tickets. Asked later if he had seen the plane, Wellington Mara said, ''No.'' But he must have heard about it? ''Yes,'' he acknowledged he had heard about it. And what did he think about it? ''I didn't think,'' he said. Wellington Mara perhaps was too busy thinking of the silence that had split the family. 3. The Feud. Knowing the fans were behind him, Tim Mara, the co-owner, challenged Wellington Mara's right to hire a new coach. Tim Mara demanded that a general manager first be chosen to succeed Andy Robustelli, who had returned to private business. But the Maras couldn't agree on a general manager. They asked Commissioner Pete Rozelle to find a candidate. Wellington insists that the Giants would be ''the same today'' if Tim had not insisted on a general manager first. But without their feud, the Maras would not have stumbled upon the sculptor of their Super Bowl squad and coaching staff. 4. The Choice of George Young. In his first move as the compromise general manager, he selected the coach who would recommend the new quarterback. 5. The Hiring of Ray Perkins. His icy stare alerted the Giants players that losing would no longer be tolerated. 6. The Drafting of Phil Simms. With the seventh choice in the 1979 draft, the Giants named a little-known quarterback from Morehead (Ky.) State. When the selection was announced, the draftniks hooted. The draftniks had been hoping for Jack Thompson, the Throwin' Samoan from the University of Washington who had been taken by Cincinnati with the second choice. But for all the criticism over the choice of Simms, Young and Perkins never flinched. ''When your fans know who the quarterback is,'' Young has said, ''they sleep better.'' So did the general manager, the coach and the co-owners, who still don't talk to each other. 7. The Drafting of Lawrence Taylor. With the second choice in the 1981 draft, the Giants wanted the North Carolina linebacker. But the weekend before, the New Orleans Saints, who had the first choice, inspected Taylor. ''I thought the Saints defensive staff had convinced Bum Phillips to take Lawrence,'' Young says now. ''But late the night before the draft, we learned the Saints were committed to taking George Rogers.'' The next morning, the Giants took Taylor, the anchor of the defensive unit developed by an assistant coach who had joined Perkins's staff that season and would succeed Perkins as head coach a year later. 8. The Hiring of Bill Parcells. Even before Perkins announced his sudden decision to depart to the University of Alabama after the 1982 season, Young promoted Parcells in order to maintain coaching continuity. Of all of Young's decisions, this one turned out to be the most important. And the best. 9. The Emergence of Joe Morris. Drafted behind Butch Woolfolk, he had three uninspiring seasons before he developed into an All-Pro running back. Since the start of the 1985 season, he has rushed for more than 3,000 yards. 10. The 66-3 Sweep. In routing the 49ers, 49-3, and dominating the Redskins, 17-0, in a wintry wind, the Giants lifted themselves to where they appear to be too strong to let the dangerous but sometimes scatter-armed John Elway prevent them from taking that 11th step, the one that will take them through the gates of Super Bowl history. One small step for the team, one Giant step for the franchise.

268-> SUPER BOWL XXI; EXPERTS SEE GIANT VICTORY
The Giants. In a low-scoring, close game. That's how several experts see Super Bowl XXI Sunday, in which the Giants are a 9 or 9 1/2-point favorite to defeat the Denver Broncos. To a man, they agreed that the Giants' defense, especially their front seven, and Joe Morris, the sure-handed running back, give the Giants distinct advantages and would likely lead them to victory. But they hedged slightly because of John Elway, the Broncos' explosive quarterback. He's the key figure in the game, most agreed. With the strength of his arm, he could throw a pass right through the Giants' bubble for a winning touchdown. ''The Giants have a better team, no question about it,'' said Steve Ortmayer, an assistant coach and director of football operations for the Los Angeles Raiders, who lost to the Broncos twice and to the Giants once this season. ''But the biggest factor for Denver is their quarterback. He has been playing in big games since he was 10 years old. With the exception of a couple of playoff games, Phil Simms hasn't played in that many big games. Elway thrives in big games. The bigger they are, the more fun he has. That's why I think Denver is in it.'' 'Up in the Air' The Giants should win, Ortmayer said, but he called the game ''up in the air'' because of Elway. A. J. Smith, an advance scout for the San Diego Chargers, who split with the Broncos and lost to the Giants, picked the Giants to win. But he noted another difference between Simms and Elway. Elway, he said, has the sort of temperament that if he throws a couple of interceptions early ''it doesn't faze him at all, and his teammates respond similarly.'' ''If Simms is struggling a little bit early, that could be a concern,'' he added. ''Over-throwing his receivers or a quick interception might make him a little jittery.'' Landry Favors Giants The Giants got another vote from Tom Landry, the coach of the Dallas Cowboys, who split with the Giants and lost to the Broncos. But Landry also mentioned Elway as the chief reason Denver could win. He needed no more proof than the 98-yard touchdown drive that set up the overtime period in Denver's 23-20 victory over the Browns in the American Conference championship game. ''He can do that against anybody if he gets cooking,'' Landry said. ''From that standpoint, you don't know how to predict what they might do.'' One thing Elway and the Broncos might do, Ortmayer said, is ''jump on Patterson early.'' Elvis Patterson is the Giants' left cornerback. If they do and it results in a quick touchdown, ''then the Broncos will be in it to the end.'' Both Ortmayer and Landry also wondered how the Giants might react to having the lead. Ortmayer said that a coach in his first Super Bowl, as Bill Parcells of the Giants is, may ''do everything he can just to win.'' Danger of Conservatism ''The first Super Bowl for a coach is a tough one,'' he added. ''They often turn conservative, and that's when you have a chance to lose.'' Landry said the same thing and offered the Giants' 17-0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the National Conference championship game as evidence. ''Bill is conservative,'' he said. ''In the wind, with a 17-point lead, he sat on it for nearly three quarters. When you're playing in a championship game, and you sit on something, it can be awful tough. Teams come back; then it becomes hard to get your team back up. If Washington had scored, there might have been a swing in momentum, and New York would have had to re-gear themselves. Once you sit on a lead, it's hard to get going again.'' Coach Dan Reeves of Denver, on the other hand, participated in five Super Bowls as a player and assistant coach with the Cowboys. ''So he knows what it's like,'' Landry said. The largest question, of course, is can the Giants' defense contain Elway, who is most effective rolling out of the pocket to his right and throwing on the run. Coach Chuck Knox of the Seattle Seahawks, the only team to beat the Giants and the Broncos in 1986, declined to pick a winner but called Elway ''the best at throwing on the run and finding people.'' ''And you can't design coverage for that,'' he added. Alan Webb, the director of pro scouting for the San Francisco 49ers, needed to remember only as far back as three weeks ago, when the Giants beat the 49ers, 49-3, in the playoffs to know how the Giants' defense can handle a rolling quarterback. No wonder he picks the Giants to win. ''Our guy can do a lot more things off the run,'' he said, comparing the 49ers' quarterback, Joe Montana, to Elway, ''and look what they did to us. They blitz so well with their front seven. We didn't pass protect as well as we should have, and we're a veteran offensive line. You compare ours to Denver's and they're not even in the same league.'' All agreed that the Giants would try to control the tempo of the game - and would probably win it - on the strength of their run defense, which has allowed 100 yards rushing just five times in 18 games. ''It's not a good matchup,'' said Dick Steinberg, the New England Patriots' director of pro personnel. ''The Giants are way more physical; Denver is more a finesse defense.'' ''They're just not as good as the Giants on defense,'' said Webb. ''The only guys they've got is the defensive lineman, Rulon Jones, and the linebackers, Karl Mecklenburg and Tom Jackson. Their system seems to present problems but if you look at enough film, it won't.''

269-> Stewart Family Lawyer Hails Counsel's Report
The attorney for Michael Stewart's family said yesterday he was pleased with a new report that indicated transit officers used excessive restraint in the 1983 arrest of Mr. Stewart, who lapsed into a coma and subsequently died. The attorney, James I. Meyerson, said the report would aid the Stewart family in a Federal civil rights suit it filed last September. The report, written by a special counsel to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, concluded that the Transit Authority Police Chief, James B. Meehan, did not investigate the incident or see to it that someone else did. Its only recommendation was that disciplinary proceedings be started against the arresting officer, John Kostick. It said he lied in testifying that he saw Mr. Stewart breathing on the ride in a van to the hospital and was also derelict in his duty in failing to monitor Mr. Stewart's condition. The transit police union, whose counsel represented Officer Kostick during the trial, declined to make him available for comment on the report. But the head of the union, William McKechnie, said: ''The charges against Officer Kostick are outrageous. John Kostick is not a doctor; he is a policeman. Stewart was constantly in his vision, and Stewart appeared to be all right.''

270-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Spencer Charged With Murder
Brian Spencer, who played for the Islanders in the 1970's, was arrested in West Palm Beach, Fla., yesterday and charged with murder and kidnapping in the death of a man five years ago. Spencer, 37 years old, was charged with the murder of Michael James Dalfo, who was found on a roadway on Feb. 4, 1982. The victim had been shot through the head, according to the police in West Palm Beach.

271-> CONCERT: THE VIENNA OCTET
COLLECTORS will remember the original Vienna Octet, an ensemble that made several splendid disks for London in the 1950's. A younger group assumed the name in 1973, and the new Vienna Octet's recital on Sunday afternoon at Town Hall offered eloquent proof that the tradition lives on. The program included Hugo Wolf's ''Italian Serenade,'' Weber's Quintet in B-flat for Clarinet and Strings (Op. 34) and Schubert's Octet in F for Strings and Winds (D. 803). I do not know who was responsible for adding parts for double bass, clarinet, bassoon and horn to the string quartet for which Wolf wrote his Serenade (possibly somebody in the Schoenberg circle; the instrumentation strongly recalled the myriad transcriptions played by the Society for Private Musical Performances). In any event, it was skillfully arranged and played, making for a graceful, frolicsome prelude. The Weber and Schubert performances were exemplary - chamber music at its very best, blended, musical, without ostentation or display. The Schubert is a work of near-symphonic scope (indeed, it is rather longer than most symphonies) and the members of the Vienna Octet played with appropriate breadth, allowing the composer to speak his leisurely piece without any undue propulsion.

272-> Technique Produces Leaner Hogs
Scientists are using a growth hormone to produce slimmer, faster-growing hogs with leaner meat. Some of the work, under way at Cornell University, involves daily injections of porcine somatotropin, a growth hormone. R. Dean Boyd, an associate professor of animal science and a swine specialist at Cornell, said 100-pound pigs treated with somatotropin, a protein, grow 15 percent to 18 percent faster than untreated pigs, and reach market weights of 220 to 230 pounds a week to 10 days sooner. Mr. Boyd said the actual overall savings in feed costs were about 24 percent because of the gain in feed efficiency. At the same time, the pigs' meat improved markedly, with a reduction of as much as 55 percent in the total amount of fat. Even the amount of fat within the red meat or muscle tissue dropped by 44 percent. ''The total yield of lean muscle increase by 15 to 18 percent per carcass,'' he said. Mr. Boyd concluded that lower doses were effective in increasing growth rates and feed efficiency but that as the dosage increased, somatotropin was more effective in reducing fat accumulation. It will be several years before the pig hormones will be available commercially. The study involved the use of natural somatotropin, which is produced by the hog's pituitary gland. But Mr. Boyd said that in a follow-up study two forms of genetically engineered porcine somatotropin showed promise of being as effective as the natural substance. ''To be effective, the substance must be in the bloodstream,'' he said. ''If it's eaten, it has no effect, because it is digested like any other protein. Thus, pork from hormone-treated hogs should be safe for human consumption.''

273-> WINE TALK
THESE are hard times in the wine world. Not for many years has the future for wine been so uncertain. First of all, fewer Americans are drinking it. Understand, I'm talking about wine and not about the highly popular drinks made from it. The popularity of wine coolers is a remarkable phenomenon and a great boon to the companies that make them. So was the apple wine of the early 70's. Americans have always had an affinity for this kind of drink and, over the years, one has succeeded another with regularity. But no one bothers to claim any longer that these pop wines are a sign that we are on our way to becoming a wine-drinking nation. While there are no figures to prove it, I suspect that wine consumption continues to decline because most of the curious and the trend-setters have moved on. Does anyone doubt that there were thousands of people, a few years back, who drank wine because it was fashionable without ever enjoying it? Certainly the current interest in physical fitness, coupled with mounting concern over the problem of drunken driving, has diminished many people's interest in drinking anything alcoholic. One bright spot in the wine picture is the small but steady increase in the sales of expensive wines, wines in the $7-a-bottle-and-up category. A remarkable example of this was reported to me recently: It seems that the Raymond Winery in the Napa Valley, which not incidentally is run by a family of hard-nosed wine pros, virtually doubled its sales last year. Which would seem to indicate that there is still some interest out there. Certainly, there is a solid base of wine enthusiasts around the country. They will continue to buy and drink good wine, but these numbers are nowhere near what the industry and its followers were predicting five or six years ago. With the imminent sale of Paul Masson and the Taylor wine interests by Seagram, the big companies, once hailed for the marketing skills and capital infusions they were going to bring to what was essentially a cottage industry, have all but fled the scene. The disappearance of Renfield Importers Ltd. into Schenley clouds the future of Sonoma Vineyards, which Renfield owned, and of Piper Sonoma, the prominent sparkling-wine producer, whose ownership Renfield shared with Piper-Heidsieck of France. The weaker dollar has raised the price of imports, which is good for the national deficit but devastating for sales of imported wines, particularly expensive French wines. And now, spreading protectionist fever is seeking to raise the price of even the cheapest imports, starting with generic white wines from the countries of the European Community. Whether it's permanent or temporary can't be determined yet, but the wine industry seems to have missed its chance to put wine across. There was a time, back in the 1970's, when wine seemed on the verge of a great popular breakthrough. It was the drink of moderation, the family beverage. It was healthful, it was fashionable, it was fun. It was, in short, a marketing man's dream. Particularly since, even then, hard liquor, especially whisky, was falling out of favor. Certainly, the Seagram campaign showing that wine was just as alcoholic as distilled spirits in normal intake didn't help wine's image. But, beyond that, there was never any concerted effort to position wine properly, in a family setting. But the wine makers are not the only ones to blame. The restaurant industry, which oversees most Americans' initial experience with wine, has always insisted that it was just another form of liquor, a profit center to be exploited in the same fashion as liquor - with huge markups. The world is awash in good, cheap wine, and most of us would be more than happy to drink inexpensive stuff with our meals most of the time. I think it's safe to say that high restaurant prices for wine have turned more people away from wine than anything else. But there is another problem, and its existence is something of an irony, considering the current parlous state of the wine business. It's overabundance. There is nothing more intimidating - and not just for amateurs -than a solid wall of California cabernets or Bordeaux or any other wine in a wine shop. For serious consumers, there are the wine newsletters and magazines, but even there, the conflicting tasting notes and the endless medals and awards that every winery wins serve mostly to confuse. To the casual consumer, the enormous choice available is worse than no choice at all. Particularly in California, the small and medium-size wineries have uniformly failed to project any sort of individuality. Each contends, probably with justification, that its wines are unique. All together, though, they merge into a clamorous group, each begging for attention and, again, serving mostly to confuse. Quick, if you are reasonably knowledgeable in these things, name five Calfornia wineries whose product you might be able to recognize in a blind tasting: Ridge? Beaulieu? Heitz? Mondavi? Diamond Creek? How many California - and Oregon and Washington and New York - wineries are there whose names you don't even recognize? The existence of 700 wineries in California says much for self-expression but little for sound economics. The nation's laws don't help much either. There are hundreds and hundreds of small wineries in Europe, especially in France, that are just as obscure as some of the little California operations. They don't bother to fight for shelf space in already overcrowded wine shops. They do a modest mail-order business. But I can't order a couple of cases of wine from a California winery. It's against the law. I get ''samples,'' which are supposed to be for testing purposes. Shades of the old ''sacramental'' wine days. And, oh yes, I can order wine by air freight from a few wineries, presumably on the theory that crossing state lines at 35,000 feet is, if you'll excuse the expression, above the law. The freight cost: $35 a case. Not for Everyman, is it? Wine enthusiasts have nothing to fear. There will always be plenty of good wine around, regardless of the hucksters' cries about this or that vintage being in short supply. But anyone who enjoys wine and the kind of good life it implies can't help feeling sad about the current state of the business and about wine's loss of esteem. SPECIAL BOTTLE POSSIBLE FOR NEW YORK WINES New York State wine makers are thinking of using a special bottle that will distinguish their wines from those of their European and West Coast competitors. One suggestion was to use a bottle shaped like the Statue of Liberty. ''That's all it was -a suggestion,'' said James Trezise, president of the New York State Wine Council. ''But a lot of people liked the idea.'' Of some 80 wineries polled, more than 50 percent approved the idea of a special bottle, though not necessarily that of a Statue of Liberty, Mr. Trezise said. The idea, he added, came from the old straw-covered, round bottle that will forever be connected with Italian Chianti. ''The logistical problems of coming up with a standard bottle would be horrendous,'' said Mr. Trezise. ''We've already explored the idea of group buying of standard bottles, because the cost of glass for a small winery is very high. But it didn't work. No one could get together on size or color or style.'' Mr. Trezise said the New York wineries were cooperating on a campaign to promote their wines, using the slogan ''Uncork New York.'' ''We're going to do things such as T-shirts and glasses with the slogan on them,'' he said. ''Wineries can buy them at cost, put their own logo on the other side and sell them to tourists.''

274-> BREAKING ROUTINE: VOICE OF THE SUBWAY
Habitues of the No. 1 line recognize Harry Nugent's voice, with its hint of raspiness and lilting, almost Anglicized intonation. The 26 stations along the conductor's route are not mere subway stops but opportunities to reflect on the diversions above ground and the efficiency with which his train will reach them. Who else but Mr. Nugent, winner of accolades from passengers and a scroll from the Transit Authority, would begin a routine afternoon run, ''Welcome to the uptown local, the IRT is at your service''? But if he and some loquacious colleagues have mastered the art of subway announcements, there are still many conductors who are tight-lipped to a fault. Passengers in the Dark Long criticized for keeping subway riders in the dark in more ways than one, the Transit Authority acknowledges that it has so far failed to meet its goal of keeping passengers informed of stops and delays 90 percent of the time. Its latest statistics indicate a 79 percent announcement rate. However, a survey last year by the Straphangers Campaign found that stops were announced only about 70 percent of the time. And while conductors are supposed to explain all delays lasting two minutes or more, the riders' group found that more than two-thirds of such delays were met with silence or relatively meaningless announcements -''this train is being held by supervision'' or ''we have a holding light.'' The survey also found that riders were told less than 40 percent of the time why, for example, their local had turned into an express or why they were heading for Queens instead of Brooklyn. A Voice Among the Screeches Announcements are vital to the blind and to tourists and anyone unfamiliar with New York's underground labyrinths. But even for those who know the system by heart, messages help humanize a screechy and sometimes scary world. A 1982 City Hall report added that the ''shortage of information is a significant source of public antagonism toward the T.A.'' In October the agency appointed Paul Oversier as chief transportation officer for rapid transit operations, a move seen as a signal that the authority was bearing down on announcements. He insists they are ''as much a part of a conducter's job as opening doors.'' ''If we let people sit in a dark tunnel for 10 minutes without telling them what's going on,'' he said ''it's going to seem even worse.'' Mr. Oversier believes new and rebuilt cars, which now account for a third of the fleet, are encouraging a more talkative attitude. Even so, it takes a peculiar kind of choreography for a conductor to keep the passengers in the know. The Nugent Routine Traveling uptown the other day, Mr. Nugent stood on his toes, leaned toward the wall-mounted microphone and informed riders they were nearing the Rector Street station (''well positioned in the financial district''). He checked to see that the entire train was in the station, inserted his key in the panel to open the doors, announced that the train was in the Rector Street station and said Cortlandt Street was next, pushed down his window to survey the platform, pushed the button to close the doors and warned riders that they were closing, checked that no one was stuck in the doors, and turned the key and removed it, giving the train operator the signal that the doors were locked. As the train started up he stuck his head out the window to make sure no would-be passengers were being dragged across the platform; pulled his head in and the window up (''you get a better sound with the window up'') and prepared to repeat the entire process just seconds later. After Cortlandt Street he crossed the train to open the express-side doors and announce the Chambers Street stop. And so it went as the train passed Houston Street (''which finds us in SoHo''), Christopher Street-Sheridan Square (''in other words, we're in Greenwich Village'') and on to Times Square - with the myriad opportunities for transfer all described - 59th Street (''just a little bit to right of Carnegie Hall''), 79th Street (''Is 79th Street your stop? It's ours, too'') and 137th Street, the end of the run, where he thanked his audience ''for riding the IRT.'' ''If there is someone who is not quite aware of your surroundings,'' Mr. Nugent said periodically, ''you're on the Broadway Local.'' As the trip progressed and Mr. Nugent digressed, passengers traded quizzical looks and even smiles. ''He tells you everything when you're on his train,'' one said. ''People actually say they feel cared for,'' said Mr. Nugent, who has been a conductor for 14 years, adding that passengers should ''feel they haven't left civilization when they enter the subway.'' His soliloquies are more elaborate than the terse speeches called for in the Transit Authority's training manual, and Mr. Nugent is unsure how higher-ups would feel if his style was widely emulated. The dangers are apparent. After listening to another conductor recently make a complicated announcement lasting from Times Square to 34th Street on an R train, one rider asked another: ''Is this train going downtown or up?'' 'The Score Is . . .' Mr. Oversier said he does not mind some improvising at the microphone. He had no objection with the World Series updates some conducters provided, he said, but he drew the line when he heard what sounded like a rap routine one Saturday morning on an A train. Announcements are part of the passenger-relations course conductors take at the authority's training school. As homework, they must formulate a message explaining a delay. But, of course, conductors need to know about a delay before they can explain it. When a train has trouble, its operator reports the problem to the command center in downtown Brooklyn and is supposed to tell the riders. The command center, in turn, is supposed to spread the word to dispatchers in the towers near the crippled train (who may have overheard the initial report anyway) so they can decide whether to reroute traffic and to tell operators of nearby trains (assuming they have not already overheard the command center). If it looks like a long disruption, the command center can talk directly to passengers on the affected trains or play a taped message at the 202 stations with speakers. Another 69 stations will get the speakers eventually. The dispatchers in the affected area can spread the word to the platforms at their stops and other stations nearby. There is also a line the authority can use to alert token clerks, who can make platform announcements in some stations and fill in messages boards in their booths. Mr. Oversier says he has made this kind of reporting a priority up and down the line. Some transit-watchers suspect conductors requesting news are sometimes brushed off while a harried train master in the command center tries to untangle a rush hour. Other conductors are thwarted by malfunctioning public-address systems. But even critics note that at some important stops such as Times Square, dispatchers now announce the progress of express and local trains, giving some riders enough confidence to pass up a local in the station for an express on the way - a great boon to the many passengers who spend more time waiting for trains than riding them.

275-> CLASSES DISRUPTED AS EMPLOYEES STRIKE AT 3 RUTGERS CAMPUSES
About 2,800 nonteaching employees at Rutgers University walked off the job today, disrupting the first day of spring classes for about 48,500 students on three campuses. The strike, by members of two locals of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, disrupted cafeteria services and late registration for many students. In some departments, such as the registrar's office, most of the desks were empty and little work was going on. There are usually about 40 clerical workers in the office. Students reported that some professors were honoring the strike by merely handing out course outlines and then dismissing their classes. In general, the students said, professors were teaching their classes without commenting on the strike. No New Talks Scheduled Negotiations with the two locals broke down about 1 A.M. yesterday after the two sides reached an impasse on benefits and working conditions. There were no new talks scheduled. The striking workers belonged to Local 1761, which represents 1,600 clerical, technical and laboratory workers and Local 888, which represents service, maintenance and cafeteria workers. The university had offered salary increases of 6 percent in the first year of a three-year contract and 5 percent in each of the remaining two years. Union leaders said they were agreeable to the increases but were upset that the university wanted to make annual increments for longevity a matter of negotiation rather than automatic, as they have been. They also said they wanted a $460-a-year uniform allowance that had been given to other state employees. Another issue involved whether work beyond 40 hours a week should be paid at time-and-a-half or in compensatory time. The union wanted the employees to be able to decide how the time would be used, while the university wanted supervisors to decide, union leaders said. Edward J. Bloustein, president of the university, which has campus complexes here, in Camden and in Newark, issued a statement that he was disheartened by the first universitywide strike in the state university's history. ''The university made every conceivable and reasonable effort to be responsive to the concerns of the two locals,'' Dr. Bloustein said. ''I am very disappointed we were unable to arrive at a resolution.'' According to university officials, the average salary of the striking employees is $16,500 and range from $10,896 for beginning employees to $25,110 for those at the top of the line. At the Newark campus, evening classes were canceled because of the weather but here and in Camden there was little to show that there was a strike going on. 'I Know We Hurt Them' By midafternoon, at the 14 colleges and graduate divisions here, there were no pickets in sight but union leaders vowed to have them back in the early hours of the morning. ''I know we hurt them today,'' said Mattie Gillus, president of Local 888, Clerical and Service Employees. ''We tried to make an impact and we did. I sent the pickets home because of the sleet and rain. I didn't want them to get sick and not to be able to come back tomorrow.'' Rick Shuster, a junior, said that two of his professors taught their classes and another one did not teach, while Gina Cerami, another junior, said that she had one class today and that the professor was there and taught the full class. A spokesman for the American Association of University Professors, Christopher Berzinski, said ''virtually no tenured faculty had crossed the picket line.'' There are 2,600 members of the faculty at the three locations. ''Up to 90 percent of the classes were not taught,'' Mr. Berzinski said. ''We told non-tenured faculty to protect themselves, to go to their classes and then explain why they would not teach while the strike was on.''

278-> COLUMN ONE: ABOUT NEW YORK; Honors for a Town Of 'Decent Folks'
TO hear them tell it, they were just doing what comes naturally. ''Just doing what any decent folks would do,'' said Ray Stone, Mayor of Coeur d'Alene, a town in northern Idaho, who was flown to New York to receive a human rights award at City Hall this morning amid much hoopla. ''We're a little taken aback,'' he said about being feted and paraded before the press. ''I never got too excited about what we did.'' What this virtually white town in a virtually white state has done is to stand in strong opposition to a neo-Nazi group named Aryan Nations, which preaches racial and religious prejudice, in the face of threats and bombings. Accompanying Mayor Stone are the Rev. William Wassmuth, whose home was bombed, and Undersheriff Larry Broadbent, who was the target of an assassination plot for which a member of Aryan Nations was convicted. They have resisted the neo-Nazis even while trying to protect the rights of the neo-Nazis. Local officials have fended off those who would run the group out of town or worse, and have tried to reason with the few who did not mind the group's idea of establishing a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant ''nation.'' The Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States will present its Civic Award today to Coeur d'Alene, population 22,000, accompanied by speeches denouncing bigotry and discrimination delivered by Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President; Major Owens, the Brooklyn Congressman; David Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, and religious leaders and experts who have studied discrimination. ''We were just tending to a problem in our own backyard,'' said Mr. Broadbent, adding he hoped these Eastern intellectuals did not expect too much of them. He said he wasn't really ''up on'' the subject of eradicating global discrimination. ''We just did what we felt was right, what was American.'' ''Bigotry is not something peculiar to Kootenai County,'' Mayor Stone said. ''It's everywhere I guess, even in New York City.'' He was assured that is true, and was asked if he was aware of the recent Howard Beach incident. He said he had seen something about it on television. ''I hope we aren't asked any questions about that.'' he said. Mr. Stone said he had been asked to say a few words, but to keep it short, about two minutes, because there would be a lot of longer speeches by New Yorkers. ''Fine,'' he said, ''we're not much for speeches.'' Father Wassmuth explained that among other things, an ad hoc Kootenai County Human Rights Task Force was formed to assist some black children complaining of harrassment by Aryan Nations. The task force went on to lobby successfully for a state law making racial and religious harassment a felony, to establish an annual Martin Luther King birthday celebration and a vast ''counter congress'' celebration each year on the same day that Aryan Nations holds its nationwide congress of like-minded groups. ''We will make a good thing out of something bad,'' he said, ''and when it's all over we will be a better community because of all this. Our message is to say 'yes' to the rights and dignity of all people. That's all, nothing profound.'' ''I couldn't believe it,'' Mayor Stone said of the media attention. ''Time magazine, BBC, London Times. Eastern reporters would say: 'So, what's it like out there in Iowa.' All the same to them, I guess.'' ''We had a press conference at home,'' he said. ''Someone asked if we weren't just a bunch of liberals making a racket,'' he said, laughing. ''There are only a few of us liberals in those parts. An Idaho liberal is about like a Southern Democrat.'' Mr. Broadbent said he is asked to conduct seminars on racist groups. ''Sometimes,'' he said, ''you wish all the attention would go away. But some of it's nice. The local V.F.W. voted me officer of the year.'' ''Many people,'' Mr. Stone explained, ''said if the do-gooders would ignore these people everything would be fine. They thought speaking out on the problem was giving the city a bad name.'' The officials prevailed upon some residents for support with the economic argument that storm troopers on the streets could discourage tourism. The men will return home today. Mr. Stone said he already saw the Statue of Liberty and other sights when he returned home to Idaho from World War II. He plays in a swing band and he's booked for a dance tonight. ''I was in the 82d Airborne,'' he said, ''and was one of the first ones in to liberate a Jewish concentration camp in Wobbelin, Germany, where half the people had died of starvation. ''It made an impact on me,'' he said, ''something I took back to Idaho and told to thousands of students in 35 years of teaching. ''That sounds idealistic as hell,'' said the 63-year old Mayor, ''but when you're a kid, you are idealistic. ''You shouldn't give that up.''

279-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; PITT EDGES SETON HALL ON SMITH'S BASKET
Charles Smith, touted with the ability to develop into one of the nation's best big men, scored only 11 points tonight. But his last 2 represented the game-winning basket in Pitt's 87-85 Big East Conference victory over Seton Hall. South Carolina, led by Tony Shaw's 20 points, overwhelmed Iona, 75-50, in the first game of the doubleheader at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. South Carolina is now 8-6, Iona 7-8. Limited to only 9 minutes of playing time in the second half because of foul trouble, Smith, a 6-foot-10-inch junior took Martin Salley, the 6-4 starting Seton Hall forward, to the basket on a power move with 1 minute 12 seconds remaining. He hit a layup put the Panthers ahead to stay, 83-81. Smith was fouled on the play but missed the free throw. After John Morton missed a chance to tie the score two seconds later by missing the second of a one-and-one free throw situation, Rod Brookin his a 7-foot spinning jumper from the right lane to help insure the victory. Pitt, ranked 18th in both news-agency polls, got its 12th victory in 15 games and is 2-1 in the conference. Seton Hall, which fell to 9-4 over all and 1-4 in the conference, had several chances to tie the score at the free-throw line but failed each time. With 19 seconds remaining and Pitt ahead, 85-83, Morton went to the line with a chance to tie. He made the first foul shot but missed the second one. Five seconds later, Demetreus Gore made two free throws to give the Panthers a 3-point edge. Seton Hall's James Major, who had a career-high 30 points despite playing with the flu, missed a 3-point shot with 2 seconds remaining but was fouled. He made the first foul shot and deliberately missed the second, but Curtis Aiken rebounded for Pitt. ''The temptation is to say that if we made our free throws, we would have won, but that wouldn't be fair to Pitt,'' said P. J. Carlesimo, the Seton Hall coach. ''As you miss free throws, situations change.'' Seton Hall was 26 of 43 from the free-throw line. With the zone defenses the rival coaches employed bottling up the big men, who were also in foul trouble in the physical game, the little men, Major and Pitt's Mike Goodson, took over the offense. With the 3-point field goal their major weapons, neither team could muster leads of greater than 7 points. The 6-foot Major hit five baskets past the 19-foot-9-inch range, and Goodson had three that enabled him to finish with 19. Long-range shooting is something you might expect from Major, who is from Bishop Loughlin High in Brooklyn. He leads the Pirates in scoring and 3-point attempts. He has taken 79 of their 90 long-range shots. That kind of shooting was unusual for Goodson, who played high school ball in Elizabeth, N.J. Goodson, the 6-3 playmaker, had entered the game shooting 39 percent from the field and averaging 4.3 points. He had not scored a field goal in Big East play. But he made his first six tonight and missed just once in eight attempts. ''Coach did a great job of handling the situation tonight,'' Goodson said of Paul Evans, the new Pitt coach. ''Coach told me to run the offense and when the shot came, take it.'' Iowa 91, Illinois 88 CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - B. J. Armstrong hit a 15-footer with 20 seconds left as Iowa overcame a 22-point second-half deficit and won in overtime. Iowa, 16-0 over all and 4-0 in the Big Ten, was led by Brad Lohaus, the center, who scored 23 points, and Armstrong, a guard, who had 14. The leading scorer for Illinois (12-3, 4-1) was Tony Wysinger, a guard who had a career-high 34 points. Illinois led by 52-35 at halftime and increased the lead to 61-39 with 16 minutes left. But the Hawkeyes, playing a full-court defense, chipped away at the lead and finally tied at 79-79 with two minutes to go. In overtime, Armstrong's basket put the Hawkeyes ahead by 89-88 and Lohaus hit two free throws. Purdue 86, Minnesota 59 WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -Jeff Arnold, starting in place of the injured Melvin McCants, scored a career-high 13 points and Doug Lee had 13 of his 19 points in the first half as Purdue remained undefeated in Big Ten play. The Boilermakers (13-1, 5-0) won their sixth consecutive game. Purdue scored the game's first 8 points and was never caught, taking command with a 19-4 spurt late in the first half. Kim Zurcher topped Minnesota (9-5, 2-2) with 16 points. Duke 85, Maryland 61 COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -Danny Ferry scored 20 points, Kevin Strickland 18 and Tommy Amaker 17 as Duke opened each half with a strong scoring burst in the Atlantic Coast Conference game. Duke is 12-2 and 2-1 in the A.C.C. The Terps are 3-5, 0-4. Steve Hood, a freshman, scored a 22 for the Terps. Navy 75, Lafayette 71 EASTON, Pa. (AP) - David Robinson scored 30 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead Navy (10-3). Doug Wojcik hit two free throws with five minutes left to give Navy a 65-63 lead and the Midshipmen led the the rest of the way. Lafayette (5-8) trailed 73-71 and had possession in the final seconds, but Matt Roberts's 18-foot jump shot from the left wing fell short and Navy rebounded. N. Carolina 95, Virginia 80 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -Kenny Smith led four North Carolina players in double figures with 19 points as the Tar Heels won the Atlantic Coast Conference game. North Carolina, winning its 12th straight game, moved to 14-1 over all and 3-0 in the A.C.C. Virginia, getting a game-high 21 points from Andrew Kennedy, dropped to 9-4 and 1-2. Auburn 66, Tennessee 56 AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Jeff Moore, a junior center, scored 14 points, including the go-ahead basket, while the Tigers outscored the Volunteers 12-0 down the stretch in a Southeastern Conference game. Auburn improved to 10-2 over all and 3-1 in the conference, while Tennessee fell to 8-5 and 2-2. A Tennessee guard, Tony White, who led the Volunteers with 16 points, suffered a leg injury in the second half and was forced to sit out more than four minutes but the senior returned for the final minutes. Southern Mississippi 76 Louisville 69 HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -Randolph Keys scored 24 points and Southern Mississippi cashed in on six 3-point field goals in the Metro Conference game. Winning its 15th straight game at home, Southern Mississippi improved to 11-3 over all and 2-1 in the Metro. Defending national champion Louisville, coming off four straight victories, fell to 8-7 over all and 1-1 in the conference. Herbert Crook and Pervis Ellison led Louisville with 12 points each.

284-> WASHINGTON TALK: THE WHITE HOUSE; Learning to Live With the Iran Cloud
Before Christmas, some White House officials and Republican lawmakers were talking confidently about getting the Iran arms scandal ''behind us'' early in the new year. Now, the Reagan Administration and its supporters concede that there is no ''big bang'' solution that will bring the problem to a quick end, and that it will continue to cloud life in the capital indefinitely. ''Nobody believes we can get it be-hind us,'' said one senior Administration adviser. ''It will be alongside us for months.'' Another said, with an air of resignation, that the White House had to show some patience. ''Sometimes,'' he said, ''time is on your side.'' The Democrats, however, think time is on their side. One aide to House Democratic leaders acknowledged that the party's interest was ''to drag Iran out as long as possible'' in the hope that it would increase Democratic chances for recapturing the White House in 1988. With this in mind, the Administration has now developed a long-term strategy for containing the damage. Among its goals are projecting an image of an open White House with nothing to hide, isolating President Reagan from the political fallout generated by the affair and shifting the public's attention to other matters. A Rocky Start But the new strategy is off to a rocky start. The Administration tried, with little success, to press the Senate intelligence committee to release a preliminary report on the arms deal last week. When that did not work, White House officials talked about getting a Republican lawmaker to leak the document. The reason for their eagerness was the hope that the report would demonstrate Mr. Reagan's ignorance about the diverting of profits from the arms deal to the Nicaraguan rebels. But many committee members were reluctant to draw such a firm conclusion from the limited evidence available to the panel. Moreover, when parts of the report did dribble out, they reinforced the public impression that the Administration had intended all along to trade arms for hostages held in Lebanon. The White House was so alarmed that it started calling journalists and reading them parts of the secret document that looked good for the Administration. ''I can't believe it played the way they intended it to,'' one Senate Democratic aide said with undisguised glee. Despite all this continuing turmoil, White House officials voice the hope that the worst is over and that they can now start refurbishing the President's reputation and begin ''getting on with the business of government.'' ''Unless there is another shoe to drop somewhere, most of the stuff is out,'' a senior adviser said hopefully. ''Other things will start taking over the limelight.'' Another aide argued that in private polls, the President's approval rating is starting to climb back up after taking a nosedive last month. ''Iran is in a manageable state,'' the aide said. ''The President has done the right things. If we had hunkered down, it would have been like tightening down the lid and turning up the heat. At some point, there would have been an explosive conclusion to the process. We didn't do that. We turned the heat down and took the lid off.'' But Republicans and Democrats alike wonder whether Mr. Reagan will ever regain the pinnacle of public confidence he enjoyed in the early years of his Presidency. ''I think the President will come back strong,'' said one Republican party strategist, ''but not to his pre-Iranian heights. I just don't think he can get there in light of the questions that have been raised about his credibility, judgment and management. It appears to the American public that nobody is in charge.'' In devising a strategy for handling the Iran affair, White House officials have tried to follow the lesson of Watergate: that the appearance of covering up a crime is often worse than the crime itself. The Administration has provided written evidence and oral testimony requested by Congressiopnal investigators, and even Democrats on Capitol Hill give the White House good marks for cooperation. ''They don't appear to be obstructing the investigation in any way,'' said the House Democratic assistant. Working at Cross-Purposes Yet the White House sometimes appears to be working at cross-purposes with itself. Many critics say Mr. Reagan missed an opportunity to squelch the scandal at the outset by not disclosing all the facts immediately and by not taking full responsibility for the affair. David M. Abshire, a former diplomat who was appointed special White House counselor to coordinate responses to the various Iran investigations, was one of the first people the President saw after returning to work this week. But as one former Administration official said, Mr. Abshire has been consigned to work out of an office in ''Siberia,'' the fourth floor of the Old Executive Office Building across the street from the White House. ''You can't be much farther away from the President,'' the former official said. Moreover, although the Administration has provided Congress with reams of documents, it has made few of them public. And although the White House urged release of the intelligence committee's report after it was completed, it had sent more than a dozen officials to Capitol Hill to edit out key sections of the document while it was being drafted. To many lawmakers, these actions have cast doubt on the Administration's avowed intentions to ''get to the bottom'' of the affair as quickly as possible. So far, the President's aides have successfully insulated him from direct involvement in the Iran incident, but at a high price. As Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican, noted, this tactic has ''confirmed for many people that Ronald Reagan is not really in control, that maybe he's not running the shop.'' In the weeks ahead, as the White House tries to focus attention away from the Iran deal, it will concentrate on such legislative proposals as a new catastrophic health care plan. But the President's uncertain health and reduced schedule have frustrated plans for a flurry of diverting activities right after the holidays. The Administration's strategy appears to have had some success. ''They're trying to make the best of a bad situation,'' said a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, ''and it could be worse than it is.'' But that success has been tempered, others say, by the failure of the White House to deal with the underlying problem - the original policy decision to trade arms for hostages. ''They've missed the central point,'' said the Republican strategist. ''The American people cannot yet swallow the idea of trading with those nasty Iranians, the same people who burned an American flag.''

285-> Why Not a Presidential Honors List?
To the Editor: President Reagan conferred the Presidential Citizen's Medal on Richard Rutan and Jeana Yager, pilots of the ultralight plane Voyager, on Dec. 29 (Science Times, Dec. 30). It is unfortunate that few Americans seem aware of the hierarchy of national civilian honors, and their award on random occasions diminishes public awareness of the honors bestowed. (Most members of the services and their immediate families appear to have a clearer understanding of the relative status of military medals and decorations.) The British system (peerage, knighthood, membership of orders) has something to recommend it, though the divisions (up to five in some of the orders) tend to create a hierarchy that only the cognoscenti truly appreciate. But the announcements of awards on New Year's Day and the Queen's birthday assure widespread acquaintance with them. Perhaps the President could announce civil awards on New Year's Day (appropriate before the end of a term) and on the Fourth of July. If only three were used, they would soon be recognized, and their status would be understood. Perhaps they could be the Congressional Medal of Honor (Civil), the Presidential Medal of Freedom (extended to civilians through President Kennedy's amendment in 1963 of the 1945 regulations) and the Presidential Citizen's Medal. The use of the appropriate abbreviations wherever academic and similar honors are listed would enhance the national recognition of distinguished Americans. A. L. MCLEOD Trenton, Jan. 6, 1987

286-> FOUR GOOD BUDGET IDEAS; The Passenger Railroad Worth Selling
Sell Amtrak? Few government enterprises have as loyal a following as the passenger rail system, and the proposal to privatize it is likely to get short shrift from Congress. Yet the idea has considerable merit. Amtrak has done reasonably well in restoring limited national passenger service. But the service is very expensive. It has eaten up more than $10 billion in tax dollars since 1971. Subsidies have been trimmed in recent years, but it still absorbs $600 million annually. Rail buffs, and more important, rail unions, contend the money is well spent. But Amtrak carries only one-half of 1 percent of all intercity traffic, at a public cost of $27 per passenger. Airlines, buses and private cars, by contrast, virtually pay their own way with fuel and ticket taxes. The one place Amtrak is helping to solve a significant transportation problem is in the Boston-Washington corridor, where service like the Metroliner provides welcome traffic diversions from congested highways and airways. This corridor is the one place that Amtrak has a chance of covering current operating costs without Federal aid. The Administration would sell the corridor lines and the equipment to maintain high service standards for an estimated $1 billion. Other routes would only be operated if state governments chose to take over the subsidy. The Amtrak sale is an idea, not a fleshed-out proposal. The Administration has not, for example, said who would bear the huge severance obligation mandated by Congress at the behest of the rail unions. There's good reason for the Amtrak lobby to restrain its outrage long enough to let the Administration make its case.

287-> MARKET PLACE; MARKET LURING SMALL BUYERS
The small investor is coming back. Tempted by a bull market streak that is verging on a new record, Wall Street's retail customers are stepping out on their own to buy stocks at a faster clip than they have for several years. The growing enthusiasm is nowhere near the frenzied activity of the go-go days of past decades. In fact, so far the rise of the Dow Jones industrial average in all 12 trading days this year, thus tying the record for consecutive gains in the average, has been fueled by institutional investors who have long dominated the market. Individual investor buying has clearly given the market an extra boost, however. And a number of stockbrokers have described retail investors as nibbling at low-priced stocks while continuing to pour more money into stock mutual funds. 'Nowhere Near the Boiling Point' ''We see speculative activity heating up a bit, but it certainly is nowhere near the boiling point,'' said Leslie Quick 3d, president of Quick & Reilly, a leading discount brokerage firm. December was the firm's biggest month ever. And so far in January, Mr. Quick said, volume is running 20 percent higher. ''Our gross revenues in over the counter are running more than double last year's rate,'' said Peter DaPuzzo, director of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''Our volume - 60 percent retail and 40 percent institutional - is far above normal. But we are not yet in the wild-and-woolly stage in over-the-counter activity.'' The over-the-counter market, where small investors have traditionally looked for fast gains, was a relatively poor performer in 1986, when blue-chip stocks captured the fancy of investors. But in January, this sector has rebounded sharply as investors began searching for relatively low-priced stocks. Early this year, Shearson Lehman assembled a list of ''fallen angels,'' including such counter issues as Cronus Industries, Apogee Enterprises and Bay View Federal Savings and Loan, as suggested trading stocks. ''We had a tremendous response from retail investors,'' Mr. DaPuzzo said. Retail investors' greater interest in purchases of individual stocks is not curbing the boom in equity mutual funds, either. Net sales of the eight equity mutual funds of T. Rowe Price Associates this month are 23 percent ahead of the comparable December period, in part due to the inflow of Individual Retirement Account funds. At the same time, mutual fund investors are switching out of safer money market funds into their equity counterparts. ''Our shareowners have switched out of money market funds to the tune of $113 million this month, and $111 million of this sum has been exchanged for shares of our equity funds,'' said Steven E. Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price. ''Nearly half of that money went into the New Horizons Fund, which invests in small growth companies.'' Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, reported that both its cash-account and margin-account customers bought more shares than they sold during the first week of 1987. These investors were buying approximately 100 shares for every 70 shares they sold. But since that opening week, clients have switched to the sell side, disposing of about 100 shares for every 70 shares purchased. To some market watchers, this lack of clear commitment indicates that the public remains skeptical that stock prices will continue to climb without at least a temporary setback. ''People like what they are seeing in the stock market, but they also feel a lot of uncertainty,'' said John DeLong, manager of Merrill Lynch's branch office in Sacramento, Calif. ''Our volume in January is up 15 or 20 percent over last year, but the buying and selling is pretty evenly balanced. Some customers are still taking their capital gains. But others are asking, 'How long should I hold on?' '' ''We have seen some buying of low-priced stocks but, as a general rule, clients are staying with quality,'' said Charles Cameron, who manages a Portland, Ore., office for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''There exists a certain excitement about the market, but you have to realize that people in Oregon are more the show-me type.'' And what are retail customers buying? ''The public is buying big-name stocks like General Electric and Coca-Cola, and some people are picking up low-priced over-the-counter issues like Laser Precision and Mechanical Technology,'' Mr. Quick said. ''We also find a lot of selling in electric utility stocks and some buying in the South African golds.'' Ralph Presutti, a broker with Advest Inc. in Hartford, finds that ''smaller investors are becoming more active.'' He also detects some ''rolling down to lower-quality issues'' on the part of the public. ''Individuals like the technology sector and some of their favorites -stocks like Seagate Technology, Tandem Computer and Intel - are the same ones the institutions are buying,'' Mr. DaPuzzo of Shearson Lehman said. ''Also, we have seen good activity in New England banking stocks and Dime Savings Bank of New York.'' ''A lot of my clients have participated in this rally,'' said Alan K. Jusko, a broker in the 441 Lexington Avenue office of Prudential-Bache Securities. ''The bulk of this increased activity has come not from new accounts but from accounts that already had been invested in the market.'' ''My guess is that, down the road, you're going to find the public speculating in this market, but it hasn't happened yet,'' he added. ''In my own accounts, I've seen basically investment-type buying - stocks like Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch.'' Mr. Jusko, who has two secretaries and some 1,500 clients, said he receives 50 to 75 telephone calls daily in a dull market. ''Lately,'' he said, ''I've been getting several hundred calls a day. I also find at social gatherings that people are much more friendly to a stockbroker these days.''

288-> DEFENSE IN 'BELL JAR' TRIAL MAKES OPENING POINTS
In writing a novel or a screenplay, an author has great latitude in using and disguising autobiographical and biographical material, defense attorneys argued today in Federal District Court here in the libel trial that centers on a film of the late Sylvia Plath's novel, ''The Bell Jar.'' The defense attorneys, presenting their opening arguments, said the nature of fiction inevitably allowed authors to draw upon their own lives and those of family and friends, and to alter events. They said a film adaptation might also require additions and omissions to turn scenes into a coherent movie. The attorneys, armed with copies of the novel, critical works and a biographical chart, are tracing the relationship between the author and a character in the book and movie - a character the plaintiff in the case contends is based on herself. The jury of four men and four women will have to distinguish between what is permissible fiction and what may be character defamation and professional embarrassment. Details of a Life It was evident in the opening statements by both sides that the jury would be presented with intimate details of the life of the plaintiff in the case, Dr. Jane V. Anderson, a psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. The attorney representing the film, television and video-cassette defendants, Alexander H. Pratt Jr., said evidence would be presented that would show the plaintiff had engaged in homosexual practices. Dr. Anderson's lawyer, Harry L. Manion 3d, objected, and after a conference at the bench, the judge in the case, Robert Keeton, told the jurors to disregard Mr. Pratt's statement. ''It is not going to be pleasant to present testimony and hospital and professional records of the last 30 years of Dr. Anderson's life,'' Mr. Pratt told the jurors. ''Shouting and blaming Hollywood for commercializing the novel just will not do. The evidence will have to be heard in full.'' Dr. Anderson, sitting with her attorney at the plaintiff's table in the courtroom, showed no emotion as her personal life was discussed. Hollywood and television are the main defendants in the $6 million civil action brought by Dr. Anderson. The defendants include Avco Embassy Pictures, which produced the 1979 film derived from the novel; CBS Inc., which broadcast it; Time-Life Films, owner of Home Box Office, which broadcast the film; Vestron Inc., which made and distributed a video cassette, and the director and screenwriter of the film. Poet Laureate a Defendant Ted Hughes, the poet laureate of England, is also a defendant in the case; he sold the film rights to the movie producers. Mr. Hughes was Miss Plath's husband and is the administrator of her estate on behalf of their two children. Miss Plath killed herself in February 1963, shortly after the publication of ''The Bell Jar'' in England. A separate presentation to the jury on behalf of Mr. Hughes was made by his attorney, Victor A. Kovner. He told the jury that Mr. Hughes was not being sued personally but rather as administrator of the estate. ''No one can contend that Ted Hughes had anything to do with the movie,'' Mr. Kovner said. ''He granted motion picture rights, but at no time did he ever have any control over the director, screenplay or any of the characters including the one supposedly based on Dr. Anderson. Nor did he have anything to say about the distribution of the film.'' Parallels Are Traced Mr. Kovner pointed to a detail chart that showed the high points of Miss Plath's real and creative life and where it paralleled that of Dr. Anderson, who was a Smith College classmate and acquaintance of Miss Plath's. He noted those scenes where the first-person narrator in the autobiographical novel experienced certain true-life incidents and where other events were invented. Some important scenes in the novel were omitted in the film and some fictional scenes, he said, were clearly added. Mr. Kovner emphasized that Mr. Hughes exercised no control over the film and said he was not negligent in conveying rights to the movie makers. Both defense attorneys declared that Dr. Anderson had not complained about the book when it was first published in the United States in 1971 by Harper & Row. Eleven years had elapsed before she decided to bring suit in 1982 against the movie companies and television and video-cassette distributors.

290-> AROUND QUEENS BOROUGH HALL, MANES MYSTERY LINGERS
What Donald R. Manes did in the seven hours before he was found after his first suicide attempt a year ago is still a mystery. But for many people in Queens, an even greater mystery continues to be Mr. Manes himself. As the corruption scandal has widened, a focal point has been Queens, where a dozen of Mr. Manes's associates and acquaintances have been implicated, indicted or convicted. Even now, Mr. Manes's political associates and former constituents find it difficult to square the bluff, affable politician they thought they knew with the greedy, bribe-taking figure portrayed in testimony at the Federal corruption trial in New Haven of the former Bronx Democratic leader, Stanley M. Friedman, and three others convicted of racketeering. They wonder why a popular man, with a political gift for achieving consensus, who enjoyed being in the public eye and wanted to be Mayor, would jeopardize everything. 'Only Remember the Good' ''I can't remember him as a dark, shady character; I can only remember the good,'' said Councilman Peter F. Vallone of Astoria, Queens, who was elected the Council's majority leader through the efforts of Mr. Manes and Mr. Friedman. ''He never suggested that I do anything wrong.'' John J. Santucci, the Queens District Attorney, whose office has indicted five of Mr. Manes's acquaintances and is investigating projects he was involved in, recalled: ''One man said to me, 'I never thought he did what they're saying now, but I have to say he did more for this community than any other borough president.'' Such is the atmosphere of suspicion arising from the corruption scandal that even as people recall Mr. Manes, many are quick to point out that their relationship was professional and that they never were close to him. There is also some anxiety on the three-block stretch of Queens Boulevard across from the Kew Gardens Courthouse and Borough Hall, where many lawyers have offices above drugstores and restaurants. Some who paid bribes or handled them had offices in this little world. 'Waiting for the Other Shoe' ''The majority of the lawyers that I know are being put in the position that when they appear in courts in other counties, they almost feel embarrassed to give their office address as Queens Boulevard,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer and longtime boulevardier. ''There are some people here who are still waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' he added, alluding to possible future indictments. Mr. Manes, who killed himself last March, has been replaced as Borough President by Claire Shulman, a 60-year-old former nurse and civic leader. At her inauguration this week, she said her primary goal was to restore public confidence in government. Although her Republican opponent in the election tried to link her to Mr. Manes because she was his deputy for six years, she maintained that she never knew of any wrongdoing. Mrs. Shulman rose to power with community board work and is given good grades as an administrator. Of the 40 people in borough policy posts who served under Mr. Manes, 10 have resigned or been eased out, mostly replaced by leading civic -rather than political - figures. Their credentials, and those of existing staff members, were reviewed by an advisory panel of prominent Queens residents organized by Mrs. Shulman. Unlike Mr. Manes, Mrs. Shulman is not involved in party policy making. Sam Samuels, her press secretary, said she involves more staff people in decision making and actively seeks community groups' views. ''Claire doesn't do things to get her name in the paper,'' said John Sabini, who briefly was the Queens Democratic leader last year. He removed the Queens party's secretary, Richard L. Rubin, a powerful Manes ally who was later indicted on charges of inducing two Assembly members from Queens to put secretaries working for his law firm on their payrolls. Mr. Sabini named a panel to review Civil Court judgeship candidates and then opened the selection to a vote by the party's executive committee. Representative Thomas J. Manton, the new Queens Democratic leader, said he planned to create an ethics committee to consider framing conflict-of-interest and financial-disclosure rules to apply to party officials as they now do to elected officials. Mr. Manton sees no conflict in being an elected official while holding a party office, as Mr. Manes did. ''We want to change the image of the party as being a sinister backroom operation interested only in making deals,'' he said, ''to an image of a political party that has in mind the welfare of the working person that the Democratic Party has always catered to and built its principles on.''

291-> DAVIS INDICTED ON 9 COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER
Larry Davis, already awaiting trial in four Bronx killings, was indicted yesterday on nine counts of attempted murder of a police officer and 16 related counts, Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola said. Mr. Davis, 21 years old, a Bronx high-school dropout with an arrest record spanning the past four years, and aspirations of becoming a rap musician, became the subject of a 17-day, 48-state manhunt after a Nov. 19 shootout with the police. He reportedly opened fire on several officers who tried to arrest him at his sister's Bronx apartment in connection with the four murders. Six officers were wounded and Mr. Davis shot at other officers as he fled. Mr. Davis surrendered Dec. 6 in a Bronx housing project after holding a mother and her two children hostage for several hours. He was being held yesterday at Rikers Island infirmary, where the population is smaller and more easily controlled, said Tom Antenen, a correction department spokesman. Mr. Davis was also indicted yesterday on six counts of aggravated assault on a police officer, two counts of criminal use of a firearm and eight counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Should Mr. Davis be convicted on all nine counts of attempted murder of a police officer, he faces a sentence of 225 years to life in prison. Under New York state law, attempted murder of a police officer carries the same penalty as murder - 25 years to life. Mr. Davis will come up for further indictments Jan. 22 in connection with the hostage-taking, said Edward McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr. Merola.

292-> ART: 2 LOOKS AT CLEVE GRAY'S WORKS
CLEVE GRAY has had anything but a black and white career. As a student at Princeton, he studied Chinese art with the noted scholar George Rowley. In Paris after World War II, he studied painting with Andre Lhote and Jacques Villon, two painters passionate about structure whose work reflects the glory and decline of the School of Paris. In the United States in the 50's, when Abstract Expressionism seemed to have stolen the creative fire from Europe, Gray shifted from composition to gesture, and from figuration to abstraction. In the 1960's he was a contributing editor of Art in America. Between 1968 and 1971 he edited books on David Smith, Hans Richter and John Marin. He has traveled extensively in Asia, North Africa and Europe. The small retrospective of paintings at the Armstrong Gallery, 50 West 57th Street, through Feb. 3, and ''Cleve Gray: Works on Paper 1940-1986,'' at the Brooklyn Museum through Feb. 23, reveal a passionate, uneven artist whose still evolving work is defined in part by homelessness and movement. Gray has always worked in series. Like other artists of his generation, the 68-year-old painter would rather allow an idea to develop in independent stages than build a concentrated statement in which the shapes and stages of an idea can come together and create a sense of place. His shapes and figures tend to float alone. In his constant exploration of figure and ground, he has shifted back and forth, emphasizing first one, then the other. One of the problems of the work is that Gray has the Chinese feeling for opposites, and swings from one extreme to the other, but he does not allow the dynamic or explosive interaction between them that helped Abstract Expressionism take off. Figure and ground, clashing colors, do not fight; the discretion of Chinese art and the impulsiveness of Abstract Expressionism exist in an uneasy truce. Gray's gestural work may be in some way about touch, but there is in fact little touching within it. Because of this, there are important issues in the work but rarely a sense of something important at stake. The Armstrong show is a bit of a mess. It contains 45 works from 1934 to the present. The show is too crowded, too ambitious for the space, and not sequential enough. But a sense of the artist does emerge. There are realistic self-portraits from the 30's and 40's; in a self-portrait from 1980, the head looks like a skull and for the first time Gray moves toward Edvard Munch. One of the surprises of the show is ''Refuse,'' a 1947 painting of a naked, featureless, sexless heap of bodies inspired by the artist's tour of duty in World War II. There are studies for ''Threnody,'' Gray's grand statement about mourning and rebirth commissioned in 1972 by the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y. This series, with its S-shaped forms, sometimes still, sometimes wriggling like a beached fish trying to shake free of death, seems to have liberated something: afterward, Gray's work is less resistant to composition, and it increases in confidence and depth. The show also includes small paintings from the ''Conjugation'' series, in which lines dance and play. And it includes the large 1980 ''Underwood,'' where gestures forming the outline of a hat are pinned to a red ground. Gray is an abstract artist who has insisted on the importance of redemptive content. Few painters would have even considered searching for an equivalent in abstract painting for the self-immolation of the Buddhist monk Quan Duc. In Gray's 1963 painting called ''Reverend Quan Duc,'' a cross rises out of the ashen knot or ball of black and red fire. Gray's visit to the Jewish cemetery in Prague in the early 80's inspired a series of paintings in which tombstones become steles of light. In the ''Holocaust'' series of 1985, piles of disembodied figures are transformed into communities of lost souls. The exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum was carefully chosen and installed by Linda Konheim Kramer, the museum's curator of prints and drawings. Here the artistic development is clear, from the representational works of the 40's, to the experimentation with different media in the 50's and 60's, to the crucial shift from oil to acrylic in the 60's, to the increasing freedom of the 70's and 80's. The 1980 ''Roman Walls'' drawings are among the best works Gray has done. His diagonal lines can seem to cut the dense ground like Lucio Fontana's knife cut canvas; they can also make us feel as if we are looking inside time. It is a shame the two exhibitions are in different boroughs. There are 1944 drawings of ''London Ruins'' at the museum, and a painting based on a drawing of London ruins at the gallery. The Jacques Villon-like planes in the drawing of Mont St. Michel at the museum show up in a painting of the Palazzo Vecchio at the gallery. After Gray's work became abstract, the drawings still look like the paintings, but they feel very different. Given the restlessness and rootlessness that are almost endemic to this work, it would be helpful if the differences between the two media were clearly defined. Also of interest this week: Kris Ruhs - Untitled Theater (Richard Green Gallery, 152 Wooster Street): This installation brings together work very different from the abstract paintings and sculptures for which Kris Ruhs is known. His ''Untitled Theater'' includes drawings, puppets and paintings featuring an everyman, with a jerky body and one eye, who can do anything. The show is too crowded, but it has inspired moments, particularly in the work on paper. For the largest series in the show, called ''Dancing Men,'' Ruhs took 49 magazine pages, mostly from fashion publications, rubbed out the images and applied a layer of paint. Then in each rectangle he painted a figure in black outline in a vague, mosaic-dotted space. The procession of figures, like a pedimental frieze or like the rapid succesion of images forming a cartoon, bridges fashion with high art. The figures show off, wave, yell and bow. Everything they do suggests a fashion pose. Every now and then, however, a figure takes on a pose that is reminiscent of an image by Picasso, or Degas or Michelangelo. The link between fashion and high art is theatricality and performance. ''Untitled Theater'' gives an even clearer picture of Ruhs's feeling for the relation of figure to frame. In these nine works, organized in three rows of three, like tiles, figures are rightside up and upside down, flying through space or trapped like bugs in a web. Because of his feeling for architecture and design, even simple drawings like these can seem as hypnotic as the movements of a clock. (Through Jan. 31.) Susan Shatter (Fischbach Gallery, 24 West 57th Street): Susan Shatter's work continues to grow deeper and more intense. Her current exhibition includes panoramic paintings of Hawaii and the Grand Canyon and watercolors of Hawaii, the Grand Canyon and Greece. In all the paintings, nature is wild. There are no traces of human life. In each one, there is evidence of Shatter's increasing ability to put brush to canvas and feel earth and water swell. In the warmly lighted, soothingly painted landscapes, there is no solid ground anywhere. The longer we look at ''Canyon Rose,'' the more the canyon seems to be splitting and cracking before our eyes. In ''Haleakala (House of the Sun),'' the earth seem to be sliding. In ''Above the Clouds,'' there is a sense of being at the edge of the earth. In ''Winged Shadow, Wainea Canyon, Kauai,'' clouds roll in, shadows deepen and the earth turns cold. In this existential vision the experience of the landscape and the experience of painting - and perhaps even the experience of living - seem very much the same. The artist has painted a seductive, untamed world that is raw, expansive and luminous, but in which there is no foothold and no refuge, and ultimately no help. In the nature Shatter paints, and in the way she paints it, beauty and risk go together. (Through Jan. 28.) New Visions (SoHo 20 Gallery, 469 Broome Street): In ''New Visions,'' Kellie Jones, the visual arts director of the Jamaica Arts Center, has selected work by four unaffiliated artists: Candida Alvarez, Serena Bocchino, Yong Soon Min and Lorna Simpson. Although each artist is very different, everything in the show is about identity, absence and questions. Lorna Simpson juxtaposes four sequential written cliches, including ''Is She Pretty as a Picture,'' ''Or Black as Coal,'' against a photographic portrait of a young black woman seen not face on, but from the back; in the process words are drained of meaning and the image seems full and unknown. In her paintings, Candida Alvarez weaves traces of leaves and mesh and ''naive'' images of people into works that seem at the same time festive and wistful. In Serena Bocchino's paintings, musical instruments, such as bells, cellos and drums, hover behind a pictorial film like mementos of a paradise lost. The most involved and moving work in the show is Yong Soon Min's ''Half Home.'' Min uses words, images and objects to communicate what it means to have been raised in a divided Korea and then moved to the United States. The work includes tracing paper that hangs over words and images like banners. In order to read the words and see the images, the paper has to be pressed down. Making our way over the work is therefore like groping over a personal Wailing Wall. The only trace of the artist's hand is red calligraphy on the tracing paper: the effect is not only to dramatize the artist's sense of anger, difference and displacement, but also to turn the tables on us by placing us in the position of being unable to understand. (Through Jan. 17.) Ernest Shaw (Althea Viafora Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street): Although Ernest Shaw is 44 years old, he has been making sculpture for only 12 years, and he is still a young artist. His totemic bronze and steel sculptures reflect both his scientific career - he is an M.D. - and his fascination with ritual. The works in the show, from either his ''Votive,'' ''Guardian'' or ''Sumo'' series, can seem heavy at first, but there is a lot in them, including a light touch. One way Shaw combats the decorative verticality of his pieces is to identify each one not only with the human figure and tribal art, but also with machines. At the same time as these sculptures stand and sit, they seem to saw, drill, pump up and down, and eat coal. Shaw also combines a problem-solving approach with a varied treatment of textures, and he looks for the unexpected detail - such as ramming steel into a head and making it look like the feathers of an Indian headdress. ''Sumo 6'' is a grunting, laughing work. This huge piece of Cor-ten steel looks like a machine. But it has the heavy legs of a sumo wrestler, and it seems to squat so low that its rump almost touches the floor. The basket shape in the center, made of strips of steel, seems squeezed within the work like someone in a sumo wrestler's grip - about to become a basket case. But the basket is also held within the vise of the work like a carefully protected object that is in the process of being delicately and meticulously crafted. (Through Jan. 29.)

294-> BROADWAY
ALMOST anyone would be grateful to have his life saved but, depending on who does the saving, the gratefulness can wear pretty thin. Take, for instance, if the savior is an absolute nerd and if this nerd turns the saved life into a complete shambles. That's the situation in ''The Nerd,'' a comedy set in Terre Haute, Ind., which has already entertained audiences in Milwaukee, in Manchester, England, and in London's West End, where it was one of the more successful American imports. Finally, five years after its debut, it's coming to Broadway -with previews beginning March 9 at the Helen Hayes Theater. The show, directed by Charles Nelson Reilly, will have Mark Hamill and Robert Joy in the lead roles with Mr. Hamill playing the part originated by Larry Shue. Mr. Shue, who was killed in a plane crash in 1985, not only wrote the play but, in its first production, also took the role of the beleaguered architect who had his life saved. The actor-playwright, who also wrote ''The Foreigner,'' played, in his last New York stage role, the Rev. Mr. Crisparkle in the mystery ''Drood.'' Mr. Hamill's stage credits include ''The Elephant Man'' and the more recent Off Broadway ''Room Service,'' and Mr. Joy's shows include Noel Coward's ''Hay Fever'' on Broadway and ''Life and Limb'' at Playwrights Horizons. Just to prove that theater has nothing to do with reality, Mr. Joy, who was a Rhodes scholar, plays the nerd. It's not yet the time of year when fancies supposedly turn to love. But it is the time of year when fancies turn to thoughts of getting away from it all, whatever it all may be. The getting away may be to sun and sea but if time and money preclude that sort of thing, consider a weekend of activity at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven. Between now and Feb. 7, there are four new plays in progress - ''Apocalyptic Butterflies'' by Wendy MacLeod, ''The Cemetery Club'' by Ivan Menchell, ''Exact Change'' by David Epstein, and ''The Memento'' by Wakako Yamauchi. There's also a seminar series with such speakers as Linda Hunt, Andre Gregory and Elizabeth Swados, and for a lagniappe, the reading of two new plays. It's possible, they say, to see the four plays, attend a seminar and play reading, all in two days. Call (203) 432-1234 for what's what when. The script calls for 40 actors in speaking roles, which could account for why ''Between Time and Timbuktu'' hasn't seen stage lights before now. The comedy, subtitled ''A Space Fantasy,'' is by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and back in 1972, it was a television play starring William Hickey. Now, it's going to be presented at the Courtyard Theater by the Actors Collective. Needless to say, considering space and budget, the production, which begins Thursday, has several actors playing several roles. The theater is at 39 Grove Street, one block west of Sheridan Square (279-4200). Ask Ossie Davis what he is and, despite his distinguished career on the stage, he'll say ''a writer.'' He has, in fact, written a number of things since his Broadway debut 40 years ago, including ''Purlie Victorious,'' which was produced in 1961. But, said the 69-year-old actor-writer, ''I'm way behind in my commitment - writing is more than a matter of strong conviction with me.'' Now co-starring in ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' Mr. Davis became interested in the play, he said, because ''there was writing!'' ''One of the greatest joys of my childhood was listening to my dad and mama telling stories, and I felt the urge to put them in written form,'' he said. When he got to Howard University, Mr. Davis said, he influenced by Dr. Alain Locke, the first black Rhodes scholar. ''I told him I wanted to write plays, but he could tell by my small-town Georgia accent that plays weren't my daily fare,'' he recalled. ''He was astonished when he heard that I had never even seen a play - he advised me to go to New York, to the New Little Theater in Harlem.'' Mr. Davis saved $30, hopped on a train before he finished college, found the Harlem theater, started acting almost accidentally and never looked back. He credits Ruby Dee, his wife of 38 years, for the fact that he ultimately took acting seriously: ''She always said, 'If you're on the stage, you can't say you're not an actor, you're really a writer,' and eventually I learned to respect the craft and its demands.'' Gerard Alessandrini's ''Forbidden Broadway'' celebrates its fifth anniversary this week, which makes its longevity 4 years and 11 months longer than some of the Broadway shows it roasts and toasts. It is performed at Palsson's, 158 West 72d Street (595-7400). What's one-upsmanship if it's not knowing or hearing something before others? One way of getting a tiny preview of ''Les Miserables,'' which isn't opening until March, and ''Chess,'' whose opening isn't even scheduled yet, is by saving Monday evening for ''A Musical Celebration of Broadway,'' the black-tie gala of the Drama League at the Pierre Hotel. Not to throw around names - but Robert Lindsay, Hal Linden, Donna McKechnie, Leilani Jones, Marvin Hamlisch, Madeline Kahn and others will be performing the old and the new, or, at the very least, lending stardust to the place. Not to mention good causes, but this is one of them. Tickets range from $100 to $300, and the reservation number is 302-2100. ''A Comedy of Errors'' will be going into Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater in May, replacing the previously scheduled ''Anything Goes,'' which has been postponed at least until fall. The production, which comes from Chicago's Goodman Theater and features Avner the Eccentric and the Flying Karamazov Brothers, will begin performances May 8. They're rehearsing right now for ''The Maderati,'' the new play by Richard Greenberg, which begins performances Jan. 30 at Playwrights Horizons' Mainstage Theater, 406 West 42d Street. It's described as a 1987 comedy of manners about young would-be artists and writers. Tickets can be reserved by calling 279-4200.

Robitaille scored his 24th goal at 2:50 of the first period, banging the third rebound behind the goaltender, Andy Moog. Dave Taylor and Grant Ledyard scored before the first period ended, chasing Moog to the bench. Roland Melanson stopped 28 shots in the Los Angeles net.(AP) Golf O'Grady Ties for Lead: Mark Calcavecchia played his last seven holes in seven under par and tied Mac O'Grady for the first-round lead yesterday in the $500,000 Tournament of Champions golf tournament at Carlsbad, Calif. The two first-time players in this event that brings together only the winners of PGA Tour titles from the last 12 months, had a seven-under-par 65 each on the soggy La Costa Country Club course, drenched by two days of rain. ''I'm surprised to be able to score as well as I did,'' said O'Grady, who was fined and suspended last year by the commissioner, Deane Beman, for his criticism of the tour. Calcavecchia one-putted 12 times, including the last 7 holes. But he also three-putted twice, once from 4 feet, on the 11th hole. On the 12th, he started his big drive with a 20-foot putt for an eagle-3. Corey Pavin and Rick Fehr were tied at 68.(AP) America's Cup Australian Yachts Collide: The two top Australian 12-Meters sailed one last race yesterday at Fremantle before their meeting in a four-of-seven-race series beginning next Wednesday to decide which will defend the America's Cup. The two boats collided in the third leg of the race, leaving Kookaburra III with a small hole in her bow, and Australia IV, which won the race by 24 seconds. with a dented stern and a bent aerial. Iain Murray, skipper of Kookaburra III, said his crew had to bail the boat for the rest of the race to keep it from sinking. Both teams said they would be able to repair the boats overnight. Protests were lodged on each side, but the outcome of the race does not affect either boat's place in the finals. Horse Racing Actor's Colt Wins: Synastry, a 4-year-old colt owned by Albert Finney, the actor, won by a neck in the $45,000 allowance feature for 4-year-olds and up at Aqueduct yesterday. With Chris Antley aboard, Synastry, a son of Seattle Slew and Municipal Bond, went a mile and sixteenth carrying 117 pounds on the fast track in 1:44 3/5. The colt held on gamely to hold off the late bid of Grand Rivulet. Synastry, the favorite, earned $27,000 with his fifth victory in 12 career starts and returned $4.80 for $2 to win.

296-> WINE TALK
MANFRED ROMMEL, the Mayor of Stuttgart, tells the story of a wine-loving student named Hegel, who became a philosopher of some repute. Hegel once turned up so drunk in the university town of Tubingen that his comrades hid him from his teachers. A prefect supposedly warned him, ''Hegel, you'll drink away that little bit of sense you've got left.'' Wine, they say, is the elixir of life -but it has its limits. So even Hegel (1770-1831) could not attend the German Wine Information Bureau's presentation of 104 whites from the 1985 vintage in Manhattan last week. But given the many tasty rieslings present, Hegel could have proved the prefect's prediction right. A fair number of the 85's, which are steadily flowing into New York City and suburban wine shops, were appealing. With six months' more aging, that appeal may heighten. They are light-bodied, medium in fruitiness and refreshingly acidic. They are low in alcohol and high in extract, such as minerals - or what Johannes Selbach, a Mosel wine maker who is a trade consultant at the Information Bureau, describes as ''the seasonings in the dish.'' (Some of his wines were shown.) Clearly, the 85's play second fiddle to many ripe, spicy, flowery 83's, the most celebrated West German wines since the excellent '76 vintage. A caveat about the 83's: At birth, they were highly touted, justly so, but an unduly large number proved disappointing last year. The sweeter 83's, Mr. Selbach said, are starting to show their potential now. For consumers who want to compare the 85's and 83's, lots of 83's remain on store shelves. The strength of the 1985 vintage lies in the kabinett (off-dry) and spatlese (late-harvest) categories. Their commercial weakness lies in some prices: Since June 1984, when the 83's were turning up here, the dollar has dropped against the mark by about 30 percent. However, many estates and shippers and, according to Mr. Selbach, ''to a large extent, American importers and wholesalers'' have lowered their prices or kept them stable to help offset the dollar's drop. The wines displayed on Thursday came from the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, a region named for its principal river, the Mosel, and tributaries; the Rheingau, a region just north of the Rhine River; and the Rhinehessen and Rhinepfalz, just south of the Rhine. Lamar Elmore, executive director of the German Wine Information Bureau (79 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y., 10016), said there was little auslese (and, except for one eiswein, no even-sweeter wines) because ''the weather during the growing season was not as consistently hot as in 1983.'' The harvest was the third smallest in two decades, primarily because of bad weather early in 1985. In West Germany, Europe's northernmost wine-producing country, the vineyards are particularly vulnerable to variations in climate, especially frost, too little sunshine, low temperatures and unseasonable rain and hail. Most face south to sponge up every last beam of sugar-generating sun during the long growing season. Kabinett, spatlese and auslese wines occupy the first three rungs in a hierarchical classification that is based on escalating degrees of sweetness and is called Qualitatswein mit Pradikat. This title, in a Gothic typeface on wine labels, usually translates (a bit foggily) as ''Quality Wine With Special Attributes.'' Under West Germany's 1971 wine law, it denotes the best wines. Of course, it cannot guarantee that customers will like them. Virtually any bottle of wine bought blind, German or otherwise, entails risk. At the tasting, there were only two wines from Nahe (pronounced NAH-heh), one of the smallest of West Germany's 11 wine regions. One was a pleasing Niederhauser Hermannshohle riesling spatlese, sold at about $7.99. (The other was a Liebfraumilch, a lesser wine.) The scarcity was not surprising; these nuanced, often earthy wines are difficult to find in the New York area, leaving consumers pretty much in the dark when it comes to these fascinating German whites. Perhaps one reason for their absence is that people buy popular labels, says Frank E. Johnson, executive vice president of Bonsal Seggerman & Company, importers based in Roslyn, L.I. ''The Nahe wines come in brown bottles like Rhine wine and look like Rhine wine, so they lack an identity,'' he said. Also, the volume is small. Less than half of Nahe's average 4.01 million cases produced each year are exported. Of these, only a fraction are sent to the United States. Bonsal Seggerman carries a small assortment of eye-openers from the Weingut Hohn-Zimmermann and Weingut am Katharinenstift (Korrell), in the Bereich (or district) Kreuznach, that are easily available through retailers. In a tasting in November with Mr. Johnson, whites from both estates, especially those made from grapes almost unknown here - Muller-Thurgau, bacchus and Scheurebe -washed away the conventional wisdom that riesling is the only German grape worth attention. At about $7, his Nahe wines are no gamble. For the whites to show their stuff best, serve them at 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Their direct appeal, especially the mingled complexity of fruit and acid, makes them ideal for the entry-level wine drinker. Delicate kabinetts, especially, invite a lingering sip, then another and another. As for reds, they are only a bit more plentiful than palm trees in south Jersey, constituting just 12 percent of West Germany's annual production. Nary a red was sighted at the tasting - a shame. A blauer spatburgunder (pinot noir) from Assmannshausen, on the Rhine (yes, the Rhine) can be warming on a January afternoon. Among the most agreeable bottles tasted at the German Wine Information Bureau were a number from the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region. They come in green bottles. The suggested prices below represent retailers' standard 50 percent markup; some wines may be found at discount. All of the wines are rieslings unless otherwise noted.

297-> KEY SENATOR DOUBTS ARMS-HOSTAGE DEAL WAS REAGAN'S GOAL
Senator David Boren, the new Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said here today that he believed President Reagan did not intend to trade arms to Iran for hostages. But he said that, because of ''political pressure,'' the Administration had become obsessed with obtaining the hostages' release. And this, he added, resulted in serious damage to the nation's policy on terrorism. He spoke at a conference on terrorism, sponsored by Time magazine. The question of whether the Iranian arms deal was in fact a straight trade of arms for hostages or was part of a broader foreign policy initiative, as President Reagan has said, remains one of the central unanswered questions in the affair. Senator Boren, who is from Oklahoma, said he based his evaluation on secret testimony and evidence given to the Intelligence Committee in its investigation of the sale of arms to Iran and the apparent diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. He said the principal lesson was that the Government should resist elevating terrorist incidents such as hostage-taking into a major national concern. ''If we blow terrorist acts out of proportion, if we allow every terrorist act to divert our attention, then the terrorists will have won,'' he said. ''As a result of building a national crisis atmosphere, the major policy interests of this country and the long-range policy interests of the fight against terrorism have been severely damaged.'' Mr. Boren also said that, because the policies on terrorism had been damaged, more hostages could be seized.

299-> MUSIC: 'FOCUS!' FESTIVAL AT JUILLIARD AND TULLY
THE Juilliard School has long presented public new-music concerts, primarily as part of its students' education but also as an admission-free offering to the New York audience. The concerts used to be rather randomly programmed, but since Joseph W. Polisi became Juilliard's president, and since Joel Sachs took over the concerts, there has been an annual attempt to focus them into a festival entitled ''Focus!,'' and to provide each installment with a theme. The third annual ''Focus!'' festival began Friday night at Alice Tully Hall and will continue for four more performances this week (tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at the Juilliard Theater and Friday back in Tully Hall). The theme for 1987 is ''Music in the Melting Pot: Immigration and Interaction.'' Mr. Sachs, here and with his own group, Continuum, can be counted on for extensive but never verbose program notes. Both in the regular Stagebill program and in a separately printed ''Focus!'' program book, Mr. Sachs concedes that the theme is a broad one. Indeed, an examination of the five concerts suggests that most anything could be included, since we are all immigrants of some sort. Still, this century has offered some particularly charged examples of immigration, especially that from Nazi Germany, to which Mr. Sachs might more coherently have confined his repertory selections. And within each program, he has been able to set up some fascinating internal connections. Friday's opening orchestral concert, for instance, offered music by four Jewish composers, three refugees from Hitler - Milhaud, Schoenberg and Weill - and the fourth, Aaron Copland, a second-generation refugee from Russia who was influenced by Schoenberg. The evening began with half of Milhaud's ''Frenchman in New York'' (too bad not to hear the whole thing, but the program went on for 2 hours and 20 minutes as it was). This set up an unheard evocation of George Gershwin, who studied with Schoenberg during the latter's Los Angeles period (Milhaud was up north in Oakland, Calif.). Mr. Sachs followed the Milhaud with Schoenberg's Piano Concerto, composed in 1942 originally on a request from another Schoenberg pupil, Oscar Levant. The second half began with Mr. Copland's ''Connotations'' (1962), ostensibly to show Schoenberg's influence in America. It ended with excerpts from the Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin score provided for Moss Hart's play ''Lady in the Dark'' (1941). Weill, a Berlin colleague of Schoenberg's during the 1920's, wound up in America challenging the Gershwins on their Broadway turf. The Milhaud has its charms, but sounds altogether more heavy-handed than Gershwin's ''American in Paris.'' The Schoenberg is one of that composer's more consonant, lyrical pieces, but is still, for better and worse, recognizably from that rather dogged and crabbed master's workshop. The second half offered the more solid and fascinating musical rewards. ''Connotations'' holds up very well indeed - a genuinely powerful piece that once again reveals Mr. Copland's exploration of Serialism to have been an extension, not a denial, of his musical personality. Weill's American musicals, excoriated by Brecht and his Frankfurt School leftist allies, remain under a cloud of disdain in some quarters, and indeed are still so little known that few can make an educated judgment of their worth. The half hour of ''Lady in the Dark,'' which is about a woman who sorts out her life through psychoanalysis, included two musical dream sequences when the heroine was on her analyst's couch. On Friday, the music sounded extremely convincing, surely placed within the Broadway idiom (which inherently devalues it in the ears of many hard-line modernists) but full of sophistication, melody and wit. Friday's performances did Juilliard proud. Sixten Ehrling led the Juilliard Orchestra in the first three pieces, solid throughout and impassioned in the Copland, with an eloquent statement of the Schoenberg piano part from Elena Bai. Don Jennings took over stylishly for the Weill, with five singers, a narrator and a chorus, from which bit-part singers emerged. Lauren Flanigan handled Gertrude Lawrence's original heroine role with a winning confidence. The others were less sure, some needing amplification to overcome the large orchestra right up there with them on stage, but fully adequate to convey the merits of Weill's music.

300-> REAGAN CALL FOR CUT IN DRUG FIGHT IGNITES THE ANGER OF BOTH PARTIES
Six months after President Reagan called for ''a national crusade against drugs,'' he has proposed sharp cuts in funds for drug enforcement, and today Republicans and Democrats in Congress denounced the reductions. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said the Administration's reductions in funds to counter drug abuse ''seriously calls into question the depth of their commitment to an effective drug abuse strategy.'' Other legislators on the panel, including Republicans, attacked the Administration's proposals for drug abuse programs in the budget for the fiscal year 1988 as ''appalling,'' ''ill-advised,'' ''short-sighted,'' ''a major retreat'' and ''cutting the guts'' out of anti-narcotics efforts. $225 Million Elimination The legislators said the new budget would eliminate $225 million to state and local governments for drug enforcement in 1988 that was stipulated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act that was hailed and signed by Mr. Reagan last Oct. 27. The drug law envisioned that the states would also receive $225 million in 1989. The Administration also proposed a sharp reduction in drug-education efforts. Although the drug bill proposed $200 million for 1987, and $250 million for 1988 and another $250 million 1989 for such programs, Mr. Reagan proposed only $100 million in 1988. Earlier this year, Mr. Reagan said education involving the dangers of drug abuse would serve as the tr nst.2focus of his campaign against narcotics. In the budget, the Administration said that a ''one-time infusion'' of $225 million for 1987, already appropriated by Congress, ''will provide significant assistance to local drug enforcement efforts, so such grant funds will no longer be needed for 1988.'' Edwin L. Dale, Jr., spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said, ''The education grant program was reduced because the higher level, the $200 million level, was needed for start-up activities such as planning, purchase of materials and other purchases, and this money does not have to be provided in later years.'' The House committee's members said their news conference in the Capitol was designed in essence to offer bipartisan condemnation of the proposed reduction in anti-narcotics financing and to urge Mr. Reagan to seek the restoration of funds for the measures. 'Just Appalling' ''These cutbacks are just appalling,'' said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of upstate New York, the ranking minority member of the House panel. ''Rather than expanding our drug law enforcement, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs, the budget for fiscal year 1988 cuts funding levels that the Congress has authorized and it represents an attitude that waging war on drugs is a short-term project,'' Mr. Gilman said. Because Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, have sought to turn prevention of drug abuse into a dominant item on the national agenda, the criticism left some White House officials on the defensive. To Congressional critics of the President, it called into question the commitment of the Reagans to a full-fledged anti-narcotics drive. Criticism of the Administration's anti-drug proposal were also expressed elsewhere today. Mayors' Representative Critical ''We are all supporting the antidrug program of 'Just Say No,' but to state and local government efforts to fight drugs, this budget just says no,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., of Charleston, S.C., the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, an organization representing major cities across the nation. Senator Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida, the chairman of the Budget Committee, told James C. Miller 3d, the White House budget director, that he deplored the proposed cuts in grants to states for narcotics education and treatement. ''We just claimed to pass a major drug bill last year,'' said Senator Chiles. ''How can we take away this important assistance?'' Mr. Miller said, ''No one in this Administration is in favor of drug abuse.'' He said that ''there are very large sums in this budget'' for narcotics programs. Comments by Rangel and Gilman But Mr. Rangel said, ''Congress envisioned this progam to grow, not to be cut.'' Mr. Gilman said, ''I find that the Administration's funding approach to the drug problem is both shocking and counter-productive to the effort of educating our citizens, especially our youth, as to the dangers of drug abuse.'' In addition, Mr. Rangel and Mr. Gilman said, no new funds were requested in the budget for drug abuse treatment services. The money provided for 1987 will, in essence, be stretched over a two year period to cover 1988 as well, according to the Administration's proposal. The Administration's overall proposal calls for a $3 billion anti-drug effort in 1988, which is slightly less than in the current fiscal year, 1987, but considerably more than the $2.3 billion for 1986. The overall funds include money in various departments that was not part of the anti-narcotics bill. Lower Than Current Levels The levels of spending proposed by the President under the anti-drug bill for 1988 are lower than the levels Congress set for the 1987 fiscal year in the omnibus drug bill and in a seperate appropriations measure for 1987. When he signed the comprehensive anti-drug measure, Mr. Reagan said, ''The American people want their government to get tough and go on the offensive and that's what we intend with more ferocity than ever before.'' He said his goal was a ''drug-free generation,'' and the passage of the legislation ''reflects the total commitment of the American people and their government to fight the evils of drugs.'' Two months earlier, Mr. Reagan said in a White House speech that his ''anti-drug strategy is not another short-term government offensive.'' Instead, he said, the Administration sought ''a national crusade against drugs, a sustained, relentless effort to rid America of this scourge by mobilizing every segment of our society against drug abuse.'' Heated Criticism From Panel Rae K. Nelson, a spokesman for the White House office of drug abuse policy, said that the office had not yet analyzed the budget to assess how much money was provided overall to the more than 30 agencies involved in anti-narcotics efforts. Members of the House panel on Narcotics Abuse and Control spoke heatedly about the Administration's proposals. ''All of us are appalled that the President and the Administration are telling us to tell Americans to say no to drugs, when they're also telling us that they're saying no to drug funding,'' said Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of Queens. A Republican, Representative Lawrence Coughlin of Pennsylvania, called the cuts ''ill-advised,'' and expressed hope that Mr. Reagan would quickly realize that his proposals were ''short-sighted.''

301-> AIDS RISE SPURS DEBATE ON TESTING OF VICTIM'S SEX PARTNERS
The epidemic spread of AIDS, now estimated to infect more than one million Americans, is raising a public policy debate on whether to embark on large-scale testing and tracing of sexual and drug contacts. ''Right now there is an ongoing groping for the best way of controlling what is one of the worst epidemics of the 20th century,'' said a member of the New York City Board of Health, Dr. Kevin M. Cahill. ''No one has a monopoly on wisdom.'' New York, with almost a third of the nation's AIDS victims, is a dramatic case. But despite the relentless spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome here, neither the state Public Health Council nor the city health board has ever officially designated the disease as communicable. Intense Emotions This was not an oversight. Because of the intense emotions evoked by the fatal disease, which attacks the body's immune system, a deliberate decision was made to avoid traditional medical tactics against communicable diseases such as tracing and quarantine. As the issue has arisen across the nation, advocates of homosexual rights have said they fear that testing would be used to discriminate. Colorado state officials have imposed strict regulations to record the names of those who test positive for the AIDS virus, while California voters in November defeated a proposition directed at people infected with the disease. New York State regulations shield health department medical records of AIDS victims even from court subpoenas. The city's Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, said that local AIDS files are so secret that ''case names are kept confidentially, locked up in a safe in the health department.'' But the initial decision not to declare AIDS a communicable disease did not end the controversy. ''Over the next few months,'' Dr. Joseph says, ''the whole issue of notification and tracing will become a major theme.'' Medically, there is no dispute that AIDS, which can be passed through intimate sexual contact and blood transfusions, is communicable. Since the first few mysterious cases appeared here in 1981, the disease has spread to almost 9,000 people in the city, claiming about 5,000 lives. The caseload is projected to rise to 40,000 by 1991, with up to 150,000 AIDS-related illnesses and 30,000 deaths. National projections are 270,000 cases by 1991, with 170,000 deaths. Even more disturbing, authorities estimate that another 1.5 million Americans -500,000 in New York alone - have the AIDS virus. Most have no symptoms and many may not get sick. But all are presumed to be infectious to others. Such life-and-death concerns pose challenges to basic American freedoms. Can society protect personal privacy while safeguarding public health? A Hastings Center report said AIDS raises a ''conflict between the community's interest in stopping the spread of a devastating disease, and in preserving indvidual liberty.'' Contact tracing for venereal diseases starts with a diagnosis reported confidentially by a physician, hospital or clinic. A health department worker then asks the patient to identify any sexual partners. Without revealing the patient's name, the worker privately informs those partners that they may be infected and urges testing. Officials are re-evaluating the legal, ethical and medical issues of AIDS. The State Health Commissioner, David Axelrod, said, ''Our policy is open to modification.'' Critics assert that the existing policy is a misguided reaction to pressure from civil libertarians and homosexual advocates, with the tragic result of spreading the disease. Most victims of the disease or virus are either homosexual or bisexual men, intravenous drug users, the heterosexual partners of drug users, the sexual partners of bisexual men and babies infected during pregnancy or birth. The chairman of the City Council's AIDS Subcommittee, Joseph F. Lisa, has sponsored bills for declaring AIDS a communicable disease and supports widespread but voluntary testing. He attributes current policy to ''the political ramifications of the fact that, unfortunately, AIDS manifested itself here first and foremost in the male homosexual community.'' Benefits of Testing Many experts acknowledge that testing and tracing offer benefits. ''Our feeling is that in certain situations, contact notification clearly would be beneficial,'' said the chief AIDS epidemiologist at the Federal Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Harold W. Jaffe. ''People who become infected may become sick themselves or transmit to other people. We need to reach these people.'' But he said there ''is no consensus'' on tracking the disease. People who have been exposed to the virus can be tested. If free from infection, they can stop the dangerous contacts. If infected, they can curtail their activities to prevent further spread. ''I'm for contact tracing, in a limited way, especially for heterosexuals ignorant they're placing someone at risk,'' said the president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, who was once San Francisco's health director. ''Take a housewife going gleefully along, unaware that because of a bisexual partner she is carrying the virus and might infect her unborn child.'' Some Testing Already People informed of their infection can be on alert for early signs of illness. They can adopt proper diet, rest and exercise to ward off diseases that prey on AIDS-damaged immune systems. They can also help researchers and might qualify for experimental drugs that may extend life when prescribed early. Testing and notification is already done in blood banks, said Mr. Lisa, of the City Council, ''and I don't see what the difference is.'' To delay testing and tracking ''is to delay the inevitable and cause many more innocent people to be infected.'' But strong arguments are raised in opposition - often by the same experts. They contend mandatory testing and tracing may not help and may even do more harm than good. Dr. Joseph, the city Health Commissioner, said there are no cures or vaccines to offer. He added that the policy on tracing ''would change rapidly'' if medicine becomes available. An AIDS specialist at Harvard, Dr. Martin Hirsch, said tests with new drugs ''are not very far down the road.'' Further, existing tests only show antibodies, indicating infection by the AIDS virus, but do not predict whether a person will get sick. Misuse of Information ''Many people who test positive will never get AIDS,'' said the state AIDS Advisory Council chairman, the Rev. Paul Moore, who is an Episcopal prelate. ''With a test as ambiguous as that, it's not worth the chance of persecution and witch hunting.'' Contact tracing can ''destroy peoples' lives in the process,'' warned Dr. Cahill, of the city Board of Health. Despite counseling about the test's uncertainty, ''there are patients who have jumped off the balcony that night.'' Discrimination in jobs and housing and social ostracism against AIDS victims have been documented. Homosexual rights groups have been disturbed that the Federal Government has moved to test Job Corps members, overseas diplomatic employees and members of the military for the AIDS virus. ''I'm just too worried about how information can be used in this world -it's just too scary right now to get on lists,'' said Dr. Silverman, of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. The American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS specialist, Nan D. Hunter, said: ''We oppose compulsory contact tracing. The state should not maintain any list of names. You're worried about losing your job or your insurance.'' At Lambda Legal Defense Fund, Abby R. Rubenfeld, said: ''There's a reason people aren't taking the test. It's no wonder people don't want to have their antibody status known.'' Tight Confidentiality Because of such fears, opponents say tracing would be self-defeating, discouraging people from seeking the very testing and counseling they need. ''In theory, tracing may make sense, but in practice it does not work,'' said Timothy Sweeney of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS service group. ''The fear and loathing and discrimination surrounding AIDS would drive people underground.'' History offers some guidance. For decades health officials have traced sexually transmitted diseases. ''This is not a completely new problem,'' said Dr. Jaffe, of the Federal disease center. A State Health Department spokesman, Frances E. Tarlton, said, ''The confidentiality of S.T.D. records is very tight.'' Privacy is not total, however. Once notified by a health worker about exposure to the AIDS virus, a person with limited sexual or drug partners might surmise the identity of the infected person who suggested they be contacted. ''I don't mind disrupting some intimate relationships if it means warning someone they may have been infected with a potentially fatal disease,'' said Dr. Silverman. A partial answer is testing with anonymity. The city and state are opening sites for testing without names. Ms. Tarlton said, ''We strongly urge people who test positive to notify their sexual contacts, and we offer to help them do it, or to do it for them.'' That does not go as far as mandatory tracing in which a diagnosis must be reported to the health department and followed up by a caseworker sent to learn, find and notify the patient's sexual contacts. But even mandatory tracing cannot compel infected persons to reveal their contacts if they balk at doing so.

Karsten Mahlmann does not fit the stereotypical image of a commodities broker, in spite of his nickname, ''Cash.'' In fact, Mr. Mahlmann, a soft-spoken and reserved German immigrant, more resembles a corporate chief executive than some of the more boisterous denizens of Chicago's exchanges. As the incoming chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, Mr. Mahlmann, 49, has more on his mind than just appearance, though he is a meticulous dresser. The explosive growth in financial futures and options trading in Singapore, Tokyo and London has put pressure on the Chicago Board to find ways to take advantage of a growing use of those markets. He is overseeing a $10 million renovation in the financial futures trading room. The job of chairman, which typically is held for one year, is a nonpaying but busy job that a prominent broker holds while keeping his current position at a member trading firm. ''The Board of Trade is on the path I'd would like it to go on, but that does not mean some strong commitments and some innovative steps won't have to be taken to continue that growth,'' Mr. Mahlmann said. One step that the board is taking involves after-hours trading. The C.B.O.T.'s directors voted Tuesday in favor of instituting night trading. The proposal must now go to the 2,100 voting floor members. The plan to offer exchange-based Treasury bond futures and options from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M., central standard time, has drawn early support from brokers and traders in the Treasury bond market. Regulatory approval is also needed; however, exchange officials do not foresee any problems. Mr. Mahlmann, currently the exchange's vice chairman, will assume the chairmanship Monday. He replaces the outgoing chairman, John F. Gilmore. Mr. Mahlman is a managing partner of Stotler & Company, a Chicago-based futures brokerage firm. Armed with a letter of introduction from his father, a grain trader in Hamburg, Mr. Mahlman landed a job in 1957 as a runner for Daniel F. Rice & Company, a Chicago grain trading company. At Rice & Company, Mr. Mahlmann earned the nickname ''Cash'' from working in the cash grain departments and because it was easier for fellow employees to pronounce than Karsten. He became a full member in 1963, a year after he and several associates formed Stotler & Company. Since then, he has managed Stotler and worked his way up the the Chicago Board's committee structure. He became vice chairman in January 1986 after serving the exchange as a director since 1983.

305-> EXCERPT FROM THE REPORT TO MEESE
Following is the conclusion of an internal Justice Department report urging that the Reagan Administration challenge the Supreme Court's 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, which requires the police to inform criminal suspects of their legal rights before questioning them: Miranda v. Arizona was a decision without a past. Its rules had no basis in history or precedent but reflected, rather, a willful disregard of the authoritative sources of law. Miranda v. Arizona is a decision without a future. The current majority of the Supreme Court has rejected the doctrinal basis of Miranda , and has no personal stake in perpetuating its particular system of rules. The persistence of Miranda appears to rest on nothing more than the current Court's reluctance to unsettle the law, and the fact that it has not yet encountered a case that has forced the issue of Miranda's validity. While a reluctance to rock the boat is, up to a point, understandable, it cannot be accorded controlling weight in supporting a decision that not only flies in the face of the principles of constitutional government but also impairs the ability of government to safeguard ''the first right of the individual, the right to be protected from criminal attack in his home, in his work, and in the streets.'' Derelict on the Waters of Law The tragedy of Miranda is compounded by its shortcomings in relation to its own objective of insuring fair treatment of persons suspected of crime. It is difficult to conceive of a legislature enacting so peculiar a set of rules, or keeping them in effect after their deficiencies had been discerned and their rationale discredited. Yet despite the repudiation of its underlying permises by the Supreme Court, Miranda drifts on 20 years later, a derelict on the waters of the law. There is every reason to believe that an effort to correct this situation would be successful. We have at our disposal a uniquely favorable set of circumstances - several recent decisions by the Supreme Court holding, in effect, that Miranda is unsound in principle, and a statute that is specifically designed to overrule it. It is difficult to see how we could fail in making our case. Symbolic of Warren Court The potential benefits from success in this effort are very great. A wide range of fundamental issues that have been foreclosed by Miranda would once again become amenable to study, debate, negotiation and resolution through the democratic process, resorting ''the initiative in criminal law reform to those forums where it truly belongs.'' Beyond the correction of the specific evils that have resulted from Miranda's system, an abrogation of Miranda would be of broader import because of its symbolic status as the epitome of Warren Court activism in the criminal law area. We accordingly regard a challenge to Miranda as essential, not only in overcoming the detrimental impact caused directly by this decision, but also as a critical step in moving to repudiate a discredited criminal jurisprudence. Overturning Miranda would, accordingly, be among the most important achievements of this Administration - indeed, of any Administration - in restoring the power of self-government to the people of the United States in the suppression of crime.

306-> BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: PRINTOUTS; Computer Crime Is 'Big Business'
In computers, at least, crime appears to pay. August Bequai, a Washington lawyer writing in ''Techno-Crimes'' (Lexington Books), estimates that the annual take of computer criminals could reach $5 billion a year. The greatest potential for high-technology thievery with minimal risk is in electronic fund transfering, Mr. Bequai says, where the average theft is measured in tens of thousands of dollars - dispelling the image of the computer criminal as a socially retarded teen-ager creating mischief from a suburban bedroom. The chances of being caught, on the other hand, are slim because local, state and even Federal law enforcement agencies lack the expertise, resources and jurisdiction to combat these sophisticated and shadowy criminals. The problem is fueled by an apparent lack of interest in computer security at many corporations, he concludes.

308-> WASHINGTON TALK; All About Niches
Following are excerpts from ''Setting Course: A Congressional Management Guide,'' from Chapter Three, ''Niches in the System'': The contemporary House offers a wide range of possibilities for new members. We seek here to dscribe these ''niches'' that a new member can occupy, and to provide some comments on the tradeoffs involved with different courses of action. Most of the niches in the House come from one of four major sources: (1) the committees and subommittees, (2) the party leadership, (3) the informal, ad hoc caucuses and (4) one's class, at least initially. Know Thy District Assuming all first-term members of Congress want to become second-term members, the choice of a niche must involve some district considertions. As one south Florida freshman argued, ''We know what's important for our district: crime and immigration. That's why we went after Judiciary and Foreign Affairs. We've got heavy Cuban and Jewish population and needed to represent their interests.'' The House clearly rewards members who specialize. ''You must specialize for two reasons,'' a member said. ''First, it's the only way that you can have influence in Congress, and second, it's the only way other members will take you seriously.'' Part of this niche-seeking involves knowing what's going on elsewhere and trying to influence the process. It is clearly a time-consuming process, requiring endless contacts and meetings. For members who hope to take a quick vacation after the election, this process suggests a delay until Christmas. Getting to Washington, meeting the leaders and making early forays may be the best way to win a preferred committee assignment. Other niches are also taken by storm. Whether the freshman class presidency makes much difference, it requires at least some organization and campaigning. Active participation within the regional caucuses is often easy; recruitment into the social caucuses is not. Regardless of the niche, the House does reward at least two freshman activities: (1) specialization in some policy areas and (2) hard work. Generalists who shoot from the hip are likely to remain outside the mainstream of Congressional activity.

310-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; An Abortion Anniversary
Both sides of the abortion debate are preparing activities for tomorrow to mark the 14th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion. The anti-abortion forces are planning a mass march on the Capitol, while supporters of legalized abortion, including the National Organization for Women, plan to highlight their positions in a round of briefings and news conferences. Eleanor Smeal, president of NOW, led several marches last year in defense of abortion rights, but a spokesman said the group had shifted its tactics. Last year Ms. Smeal was eager to prove her group could get its supporters ''back to the streets.'' NOW and its allies feel they made that point and demonstrated broad public support; this year they will be concentrating on legislative efforts in such areas as financing for family planning, the spokesman said. Organizers of the March for Life, the anti-abortion effort, said each member of Congress and each Justice of the Supreme Court would receive red roses tomorrow morning. The abortion protesters will rally on the Ellipse at noon, then march to the Capitol and Supreme Court. That evening, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York will be honored at a March for Life Dinner.

311-> WASHINGTON WATCH; White House Classifieds
The White House is in the market for two people who are conversant with economic policy. Alfred H. Kingon, the Cabinet secretary who is also Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan's No. 1 man on economic issues, is leaving to become ambassador to the European Community in Brussels once the Senate approves him for the post. Then there is the job of domestic policy adviser. It was a font of ideas for the ''Reagan Revolution'' during the President's first year, when Martin Anderson, now at the Hoover Institution, was there. But the job atrophied for several years and has been empty since John V. Svahn left some months ago. Mr. Regan, according to aides, wants to fill both jobs, but has not had an easy time of it. John Cogan, deputy director of the Hoover Institution and previously an associate director of the Budget Office under David Stockman, has turned down the position on economics adviser to Mr. Regan. Other possibilities for one or both of the jobs include Charles D. Hobbs, Mr. Svahn's deputy and now acting policy adviser; Frederick N. Khedouri, Vice President Bush's top policy aide and former agricultural specialist at the Budget Office, and Eugene J. McAllister, secretary to Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d's Economic Policy Council.

313-> TAI CHI EXERCISES: FAD UNSETTLES INDONESIA
China has stirred a debate in Indonesia, but not because of leadership changes in Beijing. The problem is the Chinese exercises known as tai chi. These fitness programs, based on breathing and muscle control, have become a craze in Indonesia, and this has made some people nervous. Last week, a Jakarta city councilman representing the military suggested that Chinese gymnastics was subversive and should be banned. He had heard, according to news reports, that the exercise sessions were followed by lectures - in Chinese. Relations with China are a sensitive subject in Indonesia. Beijing has been accused by the Government of having had a hand in fomenting Communist subversion in the 1960's. The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1967, although trade was resumed in 1985. The use of Chinese characters is forbidden in Indonesia, even in Chinese restaurants or in advertisements placed by Asian companies in international newspapers and magazines. Censors last year rolled black ink over most of a full-page advertisement in The International Herald Tribune in which an airline used the languages of countries it serves to illustrate its regional appeal. Indonesian commentators have quickly taken sides over what The Jakarta Post described in an editorial on Saturday as ''the tempest in a tennis shoe.'' The issue has gone all the way, mostly but not entirely in jest, to the Indonesian Foreign Minister. Defenders of the Chinese-style exercises list the names of Government officials and military officers who have joined the ranks of those working out in parks and private gardens. Lieut. Col. Parwandono, the city councilman who raised the issue, was taken to task on Saturday by Koki, a columnist for The Indonesia Times. ''If the councilor is consistent in his thinking,'' Mr. Koki wrote, ''he should also warn people against eating Chinese food and watching Chinese Kung Fu films. What has a more direct effect than consuming fried frogs legs or pu yong hai, a Chinese omelette?'' Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, known for his quick wit and his relish for this kind of diplomatic game, was asked Friday at his weekly news conference where he stood on tai chi. ''Just another ordinary pastime,'' he said. ''You can go for golf, but that is very expensive, This one is cheaper.''

315-> O'CONNOR REPORTS TO THE POPE
John Cardinal O'Connor had a private lunch with Pope John Paul II today after the New York Archbishop's churchman's visit to Jordan and Israel. The Cardinal told journalists Tuesday that he expected to give the Pope a full report on the trip when they met. In accordance with Vatican protocol, no accounts of what was said at the 90-minute meeting were made public by either the Vatican or the Cardinal. Although the trip produced a diplomatic dispute over the Cardinal's schedule in Israel, a senior Vatican official said today that the Holy See did not believe any real damage had been done to its relations with Israel. The official, reflecting the thinking of Vatican diplomats, also said Cardinal O'Connor was believed to have acted in good faith, although he was initially uninformed about some elements of Vatican diplomatic practice. The Cardinal has said that he was at fault in initially scheduling official meetings with senior Israeli leaders in Jerusalem, and that he did not realize the Vatican would object to such encounters because it does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israelis and American Jewish spokesmen protested the Cardinal's decision to cancel the official meetings. Later, in what the Vatican termed ''acts of courtesy,'' the Cardinal met two senior Israeli officials at their residences. The senior Vatican official noted that a statement about the Cardinal's trip issued by the Vatican press office Sunday included the first explicit statement that the Holy See recognized the existence and sovereignty of Israel.

321-> CASEY SAID TO HAVE HAD PROSTATE CANCER FOR YEAR
William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, was under treatment for cancer of the prostate for nearly a year before his brain tumor was discovered last month, an Administration official said tonight. The official, who asked not to be identified, said the White House was aware that Mr. Casey was receiving radiation treatment for the prostate disease. On Dec. 18, Mr. Casey, who is 73 years old, had surgery for the removal of a brain tumor, and he has remained hospitalized. Reports that he would probably not be able to return to work had already fueled speculation over a possible successor. Administration officials said that President Reagan had personally involved himself in the search for a successor to Mr. Casey and had spoken by telephone with one candidate, former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., in recent days. Among others who have been mentioned for the post is William H. Webster, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Denial of a Search Publicly, the Reagan Administration continued to deny that a search for a new Director of Central Intelligence was under way. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that Mr. Reagan hoped the Director recovers and that his return to the C.I.A., would be a medical decision by the Casey family. ABC News reported tonight that the prostate cancer had spread to the bones, causing Mr. Casey's condition to sharply worsen in the past three months. Medical specialists who have treated patients with similar conditions said tonight it was fairly common in older men for prostate cancer to spread to bones. The specialists said it was uncommon for prostate cancer to spread to the brain. It is probable, they said, that the tumor found in Mr. Casey's brain was an independent and separate malignancy. The tumor was discovered after Mr. Casey suffered seizures hours before he was to testify before a Senate panel investigating arms sales to Iran. On Dec. 19, a day after Mr. Casey underwent surgery to remove the malignant tumor from his brain, a woman who identified herself as a patient at Georgetown University Hospital called The New York Times. She said she was being treated in the hospital's nuclear medicine division and had been told by a nurse that Mr. Casey had been receiving radiation treatments in the division for more than a year. Nuclear medicine specialists at the hospital said they could neither confirm nor deny the report. Moreover, several spokesmen with the hospital said they could not comment because doing so would violate Mr. Casey's rights as a patient. The hospital spokesman again declined to comment tonight. Casey Testimony in November The disclosure about Mr. Casey's illness over the last year raises further questions about whether he is to handle the heavy physical and mental demands of his post as the senior official coordinating all of the nation's intelligence agencies while under treatment for cancer. In a draft report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, pointed out several omissions and inconsistencies in Mr. Casey's testimony on Nov. 21, a month before he collapsed and was operated on for a brain tumor. A draft of the report concluded that Mr. Casey had not been candid in his statements before the committee. That was rewritten after Senate aides raised questions about whether his errors in testimony were caused by his illness. Last week as speculation about a successor grew, Mr. Baker, according to associates of his, was approached by Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan and sounded out about the post last week. Mr. Baker was said to have replied that while he was not interested, he could be persuaded by a personal request by the President. The next day, for reasons that are not yet clear, the associates said Mr. Reagan telephoned Mr. Baker and expressed disappointment that he had declined the job. It could not be learned whether Mr. Regan told Mr. Reagan that Mr. Baker was ready to take the job if he were asked. Administration officials said today that William H. Webster, the Director of the F.B.I. was a serious candidate for the C.I.A. job. It was unclear if Mr. Webster had been formally approached for the job, but F.B.I. spokesmen have been unwilling to deny reports that Mr. Webster was under consideration by the White House. A 'Mr. Clean' Image One Justice Department official said that Mr. Webster, who is scheduled to complete his 10-year term at the F.B.I. next year, had a ''Mr. Clean'' image that might help clear up some of the suspicion about the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Iran arms case. The official also noted that Mr. Webster had developed an extensive background in intelligence matters through his involvement in recent espionage cases. Another Reagan Administration official said he understood that Mr. Webster, a former Federal judge, wanted to remain in public life and would seriously consider the C.I.A. appointment. Others said they were not so certain, noting that Mr. Webster would have extensive, and lucrative, opportunities in private industry. Law-enforcement officials said they had heard recent reports that if Mr. Webster left the F.B.I., he would be replaced as director by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan. But through a spokesman, Mr. Giuliani said the reports had ''no foundation'' and that he had not been approached for the F.B.I. post.

323-> Authors, Artists, Amateurs and Women
Several years ago, members of the 139-year-old Century Association in New York City conducted a correspondence so felicitously phrased that it would have done credit to the young Henry James. On one side were those who would admit women. ''It is our belief,'' they said, ''that the fundamental pleasures of the Century as a gathering place for cultivated people will not change if we acknowledge an important fact, that the worlds of 'authors, artists and amateurs' include women as well as men.'' On the other side were those who would rather not. ''A club like the Century,'' they protested, ''should surely be unaffected by fashionable whims - such as those directed towards eliminating all the delightful differences of the sexes.'' In October 1984, however, the City Council enacted Public Law 63, legislation that may have rendered such deliberations academic, not only at the Century but at the University Club and the Union League Club. Like the Century, they're all-male preserves - preserves that many women and some members believe to be less extensions of the living room than of the board room. In contrast to existing Federal and state laws, Public Law 63 regards as public accommodations, and thus liable to anti-discrimination statutes, clubs that are not ''distinctly private'' - those that have more than 400 members, serve meals and regularly receive payment for food or drinks served to non-members in connection with any business activity. Because the Century meets all three criteria, its Board of Management worked out a deal with the city. If the law, which is now before the New York Court of Appeals, is found unconstitutional, it won't have any effect on the Century. If it is upheld, the club will start to admit women. That's not good enough for a group led by Dr. E.H. Ahrens Jr. To them, the board's decision is analogous to Dunkirk; their response is akin to Churchill's ''We shall defend our island, whatever the cost . . . we shall never surrender.'' To defend their island, they seek distinctly private sources of income, like selling the air rights over its headquarters, for instance, or jettisoning the art collection. Women, then, are so horrendous a threat to what one Centurion calls ''a haven for pleasant, if not always cosmic, communion'' that some members would rather strip it of amenities than allow them fellowship. As for the University Club, a majority of its voting members would rather face a trial. This week they voted not to comply with Public Law 63, leaving the city's Human Rights Commission no choice but to enforce the law. The Century Association and its brother, the University Club, may be gathering places for ''cultivated people.'' What some of them seem mainly to be cultivating at the moment is a dead end.

325-> MAIN CONTRA FACTION UNVEILS STRATEGY FOR WAR
The largest faction of the Nicaraguan rebels unveiled a strategy today for the coming year aimed at putting the Sandinista forces on the defensive with widespread hit-and-run raids in central Nicaragua. The strategy represents the thinking of the rebel faction headed by Adolfo Calero and is not the official policy of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, called UNO, according to both UNO and State Department officials. In a newly released document, the Calero faction of the rebels sets forth a two-phase strategy. However, the strategy does not call for an immediate ''24-hour march on Managua'' nor is its goal to occupy fixed positions or territory in the near future, according to a rebel spokesman. In the past there have been reports in Washington that the Administration was pressing the contras to undertake dramatic military action, such as seizing and holding a Nicaraguan town, to show early results from the renewed military aid authorized by Congress last year. The Calero faction's strategy paper rules this out as militarily unfeasible. According to the document, in the first phase, the contras hope to use attacks on military-related targets in the mountainous central portion of Nicaragua to force the Sandinistas to overextend themselves. The targets the document identified include garrisons, supply convoys, power plants, communications towers, fuel depots and bridges. Some military analysts, and some contra leaders themselves, question the ability of the rebels to carry out the strategy because of the major improvements that have taken place in the Sandinistas' army over the last two years. In particular they cite the advantages in firepower and mobility the Sandinistas enjoy with their attack and transport helicopters. The strategy also calls for attacks on farm cooperatives that are defended by Sandinista militiamen. The contras have been criticized in the past for killing peasants in rural cooperatives. The strategy makes it clear that it considers defended cooperatives legitimate targets. After the first phase is accomplished, the concept calls for the contras advance into the populated west coast of Nicaragua. The document was released by its author, Bosco Matamoros, who says he is the official representative in Washington for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, or F.D.N., which is headed by Mr. Calero, a former Nicaraguan businessman who was an opponent of the Somoza Government, which was overthrown by the Sandinistas. The F.D.N. is the largest of three contra factions that make up UNO, the contras' umbrella organization. Mr. Matamoros said that the strategy paper represents the F.D.N.'s concept and not UNO's. Spokesmen both at the State Department and UNO offices in Washington confirmed that the strategy does not represent UNO policy. Mr. Matamoros says that the success of the first phase is largely dependent upon the continuation of American military aid, particularly the delivery by air of supplies to the contras in the interior of Nicaragua. When the Sandinistas have been forced onto the defensive, the F.D.N. official said, the contras will begin the second phase of their strategy by moving out of the mountains with larger units and carrying the war into the more populated portion of Nicaragua along the Pacific coast. This phase is not expected in the coming year. Xavier Arguello, a spokesman for UNO here, said the paper is ''a little too optimistic.'' UNO's position, he said, is that ''the struggle is not just military, it is political. We still have a bad image. We are losing the political, ideological propaganda war to the Sandinistas. And that is just as important as the military side.'' A State Department official, Robert Kagan, said he had seen the document and said it should not be considered an official UNO policy statement. ''UNO is the political representative of the movement and this is not an official UNO document,'' he said.

326-> COMPANY NEWS; Progressive Bar To Greenfield Plan
The Progressive Savings and Loan Association said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board had given it permission to withdraw its conditional approval of Greenfield Partners' application to take over the association. Progressive Savings, based in Alhambra, Calif., which has assets of $500 million and 10 branch offices in southern California, was put under the conservatorship of the bank board last summer. Greenfield Partners, a New York investment firm, is Progressive's largest shareholder. Charles G. Berg, a lawyer for Greenfield, said the board had not given any detailed explanation for the possible withdrawal. He said the partnership planned to pursue the acquisition by meeting with officials in Washington. A spokesman for the board declined to comment. Separately, Progressive announced that Raymond Rodeno had been appointed acting president, chief executive and a director of Progressive. James Condie, Progressive's president and chief executive since March 1985, will remain on the board and will serve as executive vice president.

327-> SUPER BOWL XXI; DAY BY DAY: BUILDING TO INTENSITY
Brad Benson, the Giants' offensive left tackle, is in his ninth year with the club, longer than all but two of his teammates. This was his best season individually. He was selected as the National Conference player of the week after his performance against Washington Dec. 7 - an uncommon honor for an offensive lineman - and soon afterward was named to his first Pro Bowl. Here, with the assistance of Frank Litsky of The Times, Benson recounts his feelings about and reaction to the Giants' first Super Bowl, beginning with the flight from New Jersey last Sunday and ending on the eve of the game. Sunday, Jan. 18 You knew the plane trip from Newark to California was something special because everybody on the plane had Betamaxes or VHS's. The guys were interviewing one another on their thoughts on the Super Bowl. Bill Parcells had our pilot flown from California to New York to fly us to California because he had flown two previous Super Bowl winners. There were a lot of fans at the airport when we left, and even the policemen were getting autographs. And when we landed in California, a lot of fans were waiting for us. It's nice to get support like that. We're not oblivious to it. Monday, Jan. 19 Our first practice in California was tough, with a lot of intensity. And that was on top of the time change, the trip and all the other things that tend to distract you a bit. With all those calls I was getting about plane reservations and Super Bowl tickets, it was actually nice getting away from my house. I feel a little guilty saying that because now my wife, Lisa, is stuck with that and has enough to do taking care of our new baby, Tyler. You don't want to be rude to anybody, but if I returned every phone call I wouldn't have time to go to practice, or else I wouldn't have time to sleep at night. For example, I got a call from a guy I met once, a friend of a girl I went to high school with. There were 3,000 people in high school, and I didn't know her that well. This guy lives in California, and he wanted to have me over for dinner. You can't be angry with someone who extends himself like that, but there are so many people. The people in Tuxedo, N.Y., where I live, are excited about all this. The Tuxedo police told me if it snows Thursday, when Lisa is supposed to fly here, don't worry because they'll get her out. And they said they'd keep a 24-hour watch on the house while we're away. So there are distractions and there are sweet things. Those policemen won't get their names in the paper. They won't be here to celebrate. But they're nice people. Tuesday, Jan. 20 The photo and media session in the morning was pretty hectic. The question of the day for me came from a woman who asked, ''Are you crazy?'' I said, ''No, I'm sorry I'm not.'' I think she was disappointed. We had the rest of the day off, and we went fishing in the Pacific - Chris Godfrey, Bart Oates, Brian Johnston, Jim Burt, Tim Burke and I. Tim is Bill Parcells's friend. He's a boat captain in Jersey. It's funny. Jim Burt is always the adventurous one, and he slept below most of the trip. We woke him up when we started catching bonito. I rigged a line for him and handed him a rod. He threw his bait in the water and a sea gull grabbed it. Jim didn't see the sea gull and thought it was a fish, so he set the hook and caught a sea gull. Then the lines got tangled, and we cut them and let the sea gull go. That's all Jim caught all day. The rest of us got three or four fish apiece. Wednesday, Jan. 21 In the morning, we had another media session. The only difference from yesterday is that we were sitting down. Someone asked if, when I was cut by the Patriots and teaching elementary school for $15 a day before the Giants signed me, I ever thought I would be playing in the Super Bowl. I said it was the last thing on my mind, that I just wanted to make a football team. I think some of the press is having trouble with us because we don't have a lot of characters. We have a lot of family men. I think the team has assumed Bill Parcells's personality. We're just a basic, fundamental football team with a goal, guys who like their hometowns and where they live. There's an old guy in my town I want to go fishing with this year. How do you make headlines out of that? I'm looking forward to seeing Lisa and Tyler tomorrow. When you have a child a month old, you hate to miss three or four days in a row without seeing him. Lisa said he graduated from a bassinet to a crib, and I wasn't there to see it. Thursday, Jan. 22 Another hour with the media this morning. It went smoothly. Actually, it was easier on me than when we played the Redskins because everyone then wanted to know about Dexter Manley. Now I can blend in and be one of the other linemen again. That singling-out stuff played on my nerves a little. Practice was good. The offense has been sharp the last two days. We were hitting so hard that I split my nose open again, so there was some intensity there. It has been pretty easy to motivate us. Every day, I'm thinking a little more about the game. When I watch film, I start playing the game in my mind. Today, I watched films of the Broncos against the Browns. I watched what the Browns' tackle did and thought, what would I have done in that situation? Why would he step with his inside foot when the end rushed from the outside? Our families arrived at night after a terrible day because of the snow at home. They sat in the plane in Newark for four hours. They kept de-icing the wings, ran out of de-icing fluid and got more. Then someone smoked in the bathroom, an alarm went off and Federal officials had to come on board to find out why. The airport was closed, but they cleared a runway for that one plane and it took off. With all that, it was almost a 12-hour trip. It was great seeing Lisa and Tyler. I talked with Lisa and we watched Tyler sleep. He's 6 weeks old and Lisa said he didn't cry once on the plane. Friday, Jan. 23 The offensive line watched films at Rams Park and discovered a few things about the Broncos. But mostly we saw reminders of what we have to be prepared for. I could be lined up against a lot of people, so I have to be ready for different looks. And they have more looks than most teams. The danger is not reacting properly to what they're doing. And you can get so caught up in what they're doing that you don't come off the ball and play aggressively. The first game we played against them, I don't think we played as well as we could. Sometimes there is no special reason for that. You just have games like that. I don't think we blocked as poorly in that game as we did in the regular-season game against the 49ers. After we watched films, we had a light practice, really a polishing job. Then we took buses to our new hotel in North Hollywood. At home, we always stay at the Woodcliff Lakes Hilton the night before a game. Here, our hotel in Costa Mesa has been such a madhouse that Bill Parcells decided to move us to another place for the two nights before the game. It's much better, because everything is calm and we can keep our minds on work. After we settled in, Billy Ard and I had dinner at an Italian restaurant with singing waiters in North Hollywood. It was good food and a chance to relax. Saturday, Jan. 24 We were supposed to have a walk-through today at the Rose Bowl. Then Bill changed his mind and was going to have us just walk around the field. Then he changed his mind again, and we didn't do anything. Well, not quite. We had morning meetings at the hotel, about an hour and a half. Mostly, we hung around, stayed off our feet and got ready mentally. We're on our regular away-game schedule. So at night, we had a team meeting, then broke up into offensive and defensive meetings. We had our last look at films. Ron Erhardt talked to the offense. Then we broke up into units, and the offensive line met with our coach, Fred Hoaglin. With him, it was no more films, just talk. There isn't much to talk about anymore. The intensity has been building all day. This is the Super Bowl. Sunday, Jan. 25 I got up this morning, got dressed and went to mass. Father Moore cut mass short because we seemed too fidgety. We had our pre-game meal at the hotel and then Phil, Chris Godfrey and I shared a taxi to the stadium. Phil kept saying ''I feel real good. I'm throwing fastballs today, guys. I'm telling you I feel great.'' And he was right. Things happened so fast out there on the field that you don't even realize it. Everytime a play happens, it's an incredible swing of emotions. On McConkey's touchdown I didn't even see what happened. I was on my back and I heard the crowd cheering and I started clapping, laying on my back. Now I'm glad it's over. But I'm so happy about what has happened to me. I can't believe anybody has ever had a better year. I've got a new baby, I'm going to the Pro Bowl and now this. I don't know what made God do so many great things for me this year.

329-> TOLL IS 18 IN MANILA SHOOTING; LEFTIST CHIEF EASES CRITICISM
The confirmed death toll in last Thursday's clash between leftist demonstrators and security forces rose to 18 today. At the same time, a leader of a major leftist organization softened its criticism of President Corazon C. Aquino. Since the shootings, when Government troopers opened fire on a farmers' rally, the left has harshly criticized the Aquino Government. Bayan, the leftist umbrella group, compared the Government unfavorably to ''its fascist predecessor,'' the regime of Ferdinand E. Marcos, and leftist organizers announced plans for a large rally Monday at the site of the killings. But a Bayan leader, Leandro Alejandro, said today that the group was withdrawing its criticism of the President because ''we do not believe she was directly responsible'' for the killings. However, he said, ''If one more rallyist or bystander is killed tomorrow, then you can expect more decisive action from our end.'' ''One more killing will be enough to convince us that this Government is totally insensitive to the plight of the poor,'' he said. The armed forces Chief of Staff, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, admitted on Friday that his troops had overreacted when the protesters tried to force their way through a military cordon around the presidential palace. General Ramos, reiterating Government policy, said today that his troops would attempt to show restraint at the rally Monday. ''We want to let everyone know that the policy of the military is maximum tolerance,'' he said, ''especially now that we have a democracy.'' The organizers of the new rally said they hoped to meet with Mrs. Aquino first and to keep their demonstration peaceful. The toll in the Thursday shooting rose when several leftist organizations compared their tallies and issued a new list of the dead, which includes two still-unidentified bodies. Several other people remain critically wounded. Most of the victims were men and women in their 20's and 30's from farming and fishing villages a few hours from Manila. The rally was called to agitate for better conditions for farmers and other rural workers. Mournful Scene at Church Farmers continued to arrive at Manila from their villages today to identify their relatives. Their destination is Mount Carmel Church, where leftist groups have been bringing the bodies of the dead after claiming them from local hospitals and morgues. The family of Roberto Caylao, a 28-year-old farmer, arrived at the church from Bataan after hearing on the radio that he was among the dead. ''His face was very sad when he left us,'' said his mother, Alicia, a vegetable farmer. ''His wife asked him not to go, and his brother too,'' she said. ''I'm not sure why they did.'' Miguel Aribe, sitting by the coffin of his 19-year-old daughter Adelfa, said he had not known that she had left her work on a coconut plantation to travel to Manila. He said it was only when he saw a photograph of her body in a newspaper two days after the incident that he learned of her death. ''I recognized her right away,'' he said.

330-> COMPANY NEWS; Brookehill Filing On Holly Sugar
The New York brokerage Brookehill Partners Inc. became the third concern to express an interest in seeking control of the Holly Sugar Corporation. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Brookehill said that it was considering a higher offer than that by the company's management. Arcanum 1 Partners and a group of senior Holly officials have offered $35 in cash and one share of preferred stock for each share of the Colorado Springs-based beet sugar producer. On Wednesday, the California investment concern Shamrock Holdings of California Inc. also said it was interested in acquiring Holly Sugar. Between Dec. 11 and Jan. 14, Brookehill bought 5,500 Holly Sugar shares for prices ranging from $97.62 to $104 a share, raising its stake in Holly Sugar to 11.8 percent.

331-> PRO BASKETBALL; KNICKS FIND TROUBLE IN TEXAS
Just one week ago, the Knicks were brimming with the confidence borne of 8 victories in 12 games and were buoyed by their surprising defeat of the Celtics. Anything was possible. Even the playoffs. Patrick Ewing was playing the best basketball of his professional career. Bill Cartwright was a commanding complement at power forward, a position he was still learning. Others were filling in the gaps, with Gerald Henderson providing aggressive leadership and Gerald Wilkins adding a touch of flair. But then the worst thing possible happened to the Knicks: They left home for a three-game trip. Now everything has changed. Ewing is tired. Cartwright has been exploited by opposing players and is mired in a slump. And no one is filling in the gaps. Instead, some players have become disgruntled. And even Bob Hill, their eternal optimist of a coach, showed his frustration with an admittedly unwarranted emotional outburst during a timeout Saturday night in San Antonio. Such were the bitter fruits of a three-game excursion through Texas last week when the Knicks were blown out in Dallas and Houston by an average of 18 points before losing to lowly San Antonio. The three defeats dropped their record to a 13-28, and their road record to 3-19, fourth-worst in the league. These were the key developments on the trip: Hill has gone to great lengths to establish Ewing as the key to the Knick offense. It may have worn Ewing down. The second-year center averaged 24.3 points in the three games but his rebounding fell off a bit. When defenses surrounded him, he avoided passing to open teammates like it was a crime. In 118 total minutes on the three-game trip, Ewing had just 2 assists and he committed 13 turnovers. Ewing's falloff is compounded by Cartwright's slump. For the trip, Cartwright averaged a woeful 12.0 points and 6.0 rebounds, both well below his season averages before the trip (17.8 points and 7.8 rebounds). And defensively, he could not stop Sam Perkins of Dallas, Ralph Sampson of Houston and David Greenwood of San Antonio. The three combined for an average of 23.6 points and 13.3 rebounds against him. Greenwood's season-high 31-point, 15-rebound effort Saturday was Cartwright's low-point, and it raised once again the prospect that the Knicks might best be served by trading the veteran. Cartwright has expressed a desire to play center, even if for another team. An insurance policy covering his left foot, which has been broken three times, takes effect when he plays his 40th game. He has played in 39 games, so he should become more appealing to another team. Cummings and Oldham Unhappy A third development involves two reserves in the front line: Pat Cummings and Jawann Oldham. In his last four games, Cummings played only 27 minutes, including none at all Friday in Houston. He has made no secret of his desire to be traded. Neither has Oldham. And he remains adamant even though Hill seems intent on using him more.

332-> Guinness Disclosure
A British financier, Gerald Ronson, has admitted buying Guinness P.L.C. stock at the request of the company's former chairman to lift the company's stock price during a takeover battle. The disclosure was made late Tuesday by Mr. Ronson in a letter to Sir Norman Macfarlane, who became the head of Guinness after the former chairman, Ernest Saunders, was dismised last week. Mr. Ronson, whose Heron Corporation is one of Britain's biggest conglomerates, said he bought $37.5 million of Guinness stock. He said he returned to Guinness $8.7 million that he was paid to make the purchases. ''I did not focus on the legal implications of what had occurred, nor did it cross my mind that City advisers and business people of such eminence would be asking us to join in doing something improper,'' Mr. Ronson said in the letter. Guinness, a major brewer, admitted last week that it had illegally repurchased its own stock to raise its stock price and improve its chances of acquiring the Distillers Company, the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin. Guinness's $3.8 billion cash-and-stock offer defeated one from the Argyll Group. The Guinness dealings are under investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry.

335-> Worthy Women
TO THE HOME SECTION: While Angeline Goreau's column [ Hers, Dec. 4 ] was both informative and interesting, I must beg to differ with her evaluation of Christine de Pisan and Louise Labe. While they were extraordinary in terms of their level of education, they were not of noble status. Their views did not isolate them. Quite the contrary; they found support for their position among the leading male intellectuals of their day. True, they were controversial figures. Pisan's ''The Book of the City of Ladies,'' daring in its defense of women, and Labe's evocative ''Sonnets'' provide proof in this regard, but this only encouraged attention to be focused upon them. And they were deserving of the praise they received. Through the salon, the movement they supported was allowed to continue, namely, female artistic and intellectual expression. Without in any way downplaying the contribution of Esther Sowernam and Mary Wollstonecraft, I would suggest that, in order to paint a more complete picture of the history of women, these women, and others like them found throughout the pages of French history (for example), deserve our attention.

TO THE HOME SECTION: It was disconcerting to read the Hers column [ Dec. 25 ] about Mad Madge, the eccentric feminist writer.

If manipulating an older, wealthier man into a loveless marriage of business convenience is a true sign of women's liberation, then perhaps I'd prefer a return to the paleolithic age. HOLLY M.

339-> PLAINTIFF TESTIFIES IN THE 'BELL JAR' TRIAL
A psychiatrist testified here today that she felt dismay and outrage reading Sylvia Plath's novel ''The Bell Jar'' and seeing the 1979 film of it because, she said, she was recognizably the person on whom a key character was based. The 55-year-old psychiatrist, Dr. Jane V. Anderson, is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School. She is suing over the 1979 movie version of the book, not the book itself, contending it defamed her and invaded her privacy in portraying the character of Joan Gilling, which she contends is based on herself, as a suicidal lesbian. Dr. Anderson took the stand on the third day of the trial in Federal District Court. Questioned by her attorney, Harry L. Manion 3d, Dr. Anderson said she had never attempted suicide or had a homosexual relationship with Miss Plath or with Dr. Anderson's college roommate. 'Tense' Visit With Plath Among the 14 defendants is Ted Hughes, the poet laureate of Britain, who was Miss Plath's husband and who sold the movie rights to the book. Apparently referring to Mr. Hughes, but without mentioning his name, Dr. Anderson told the court that Miss Plath had told her in the summer of 1956 that she was ''very much in love'' with a poet, a ''person capable of being sadistic but she thought that she could manage that characteristic.'' Dr. Anderson was visiting Miss Plath in Cambridge, England, at the time, she said. The visit was ''tense,'' she said, and was the last time she saw or communicated with Miss Plath. Miss Plath married Mr. Hughes 12 days later, she said. Miss Plath committed suicide in 1963 shortly after her novel was published in Britain. Other defendants in the $6 million suit are individuals and companies involved in the film's production and distribution. CBS Inc. and Time-Life Films, the owner of Home Box Office, are accused of intentionally causing emotional harm by continuing to broadcast the television version of the movie after they were told of Dr. Anderson's complaint. Responding to her attorney under direct examination, Dr. Anderson cited 10 scenes from the novel that she said were similar to her own life. These included ''uncomplimentary'' physical descriptions of the Gilling character, portraying her as ''big as a horse'' with large teeth and a breathy voice. Reading the semi-autobiographical book in 1971, the year it was published in the United States, Dr. Anderson said, she was particularly shocked to realize that it revealed that Miss Plath and she were both at the same mental hospital. ''I felt a sense of outrage that she had acted in what seemed to me an irresponsible and uncaring'' way ''in revealing I had been a patient in a mental hospital,'' Dr. Anderson said. But she said she was afraid to speak out because it would call public attention to it. Testified About Similarities Dr. Anderson testified that she and Miss Plath grew up in the same Massachusetts town, attended the same church and college, dated the same man and were mental patients at the same time at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. Similar relationships hold true in the book between Joan Gilling, the character Dr. Anderson contends is based on herself, and Esther Greenwood, the character Miss Plath modeled after herself. Dr. Anderson said she had refused interviews with everybody who sought her out in writing biographical material on Miss Plath. She also testified that upon seeing the film, she was so upset, she got in touch with a psychiatrist she had seen years before at the mental hospital. In her testimony, Dr. Anderson also contradicted an assertion made by one of the defense attorneys in opening statements last week. The attorney, Alexander Pratt, said in the opening argument that he would show Dr. Anderson had engaged in a lesbian affair in college. He then read from her diary: ''Em and I in bed together for first time since we've been back.'' Dr. Anderson said today that the passage referred to the first night both she and her roommate Mary (Em) Eckart, were back at school after a Christmas vacation. ''We went to bed together at the same time in separate, single beds,'' Dr. Anderson said. ''During the entire time I was at Smith College, I never shared a bed with any female.''

343-> T.V.A. REINSTATING ADMIRAL AS MANAGER OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM
After more than two months of negotiations, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced today that it had reinstated Adm. Stephen A. White as director of its nuclear reactor program and had rewritten his $355,000 a year contract. The revised agreement signed today immediately restores the 58-year-old admiral's T.V.A. title, manager of nuclear power, and his salary, nearly five times the nominal top Federal salary for top Government executives. The retired nuclear commander took a leave of absence from the Federal agency last October because of possible conflicts of interest. In a statement released in Knoxville, Tenn., the agency's headquarters, Charles H. Dean Jr., the authority's chairman, said the revised contract was ''reviewed in detail'' with the Office of Government Ethics in Washington to ''remove all conflict of interest issues.'' ''This will permit T.V.A and Mr. White to move forward with the nuclear recovery program under new contracts and ethics guidelines,'' the chairman said. Agency spokesmen said that under the new contract, Admiral White has severed all financial ties with the Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation of Boston. Formerly, Stone & Webster paid Admiral White's salary under contract with the power agency. Ethics officials ruled that because Mr. White also hired Stone & Webster consultants as his staff aides at high salaries, the arrangement violated Federal laws barring Government officials from awarding contracts to companies in which they have a financial interest. Admiral White will be allowed to retain the consultants but their contracts will be supervised by others, the T.V.A. said.

345-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; How to Pick a Candidate
Max Hugel, who has been a businessman, political activist and high Central Intelligence Agency official, is trying to develop a conservative consensus on a 1988 Republican Presidential candidate. He has summoned 50 people, including some veterans of Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign, to a meeting in Waterville Valley, N.H., Feb. 13-15, including party politicians from 15 key primary and caucus states. This assembly is designed to examine potential Republican candidates and attempt to decide which of them ''will best carry on the Reagan agenda,'' according to one of the planners. A Hugel spokesman declined to identify participants and said the sessions would be closed to the press, although existence of the meeting is obviously not secret. Speakers who have accepted invitations include Patrick J. Buchanan, the White House communications director, and Vincent Breglio, former president of Decision Making Information, the polling organization now headed by Richard Wirthlin.

346-> MONITORING OF FAST-GROWING VOLCANO IN SOVIET IS DISCUSSED
So voluminous are the outpourings of lava from the Klyuchevskaya volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet Union that specialists there have concluded that the entire mountain, 15,675 feet high, has formed in the last 7,000 years. Apart from the Hawaiian volcanoes, which erupt frequently but do not form steep-sided mountains, Mount Klyuchevskaya appears to produce more lava than any other volcano on earth, according to S. A. Fedotov, director of the Institute of Volcanology in Petropavlovsk. He described results from prolonged monitoring of this remote volcano near Alaska and its five companion volcanoes to an international meeting on volcanology being held here this week at the University of Hawaii. Volcano's Extraordinary Growth Dr. Fedotov said in an interview that Klyuchevskaya produced one quarter of the lava erupted by all 68 volcanoes in the 1,600-mile Kurile-Kamchatka chain, which would explain the volcano's extraordinarily rapid growth. Other volcanoes in the chain, which stretches southwest into Japan, erupt far less often and voluminously. The Klyuchevskaya volcanoes are of special interest to American volcanologists because one of them, Bezymyanny, has an eruptive history strikingly similar to that of Mount St. Helens. Since a cataclysmic explosion in the 1950's blew off the top and one side of Byezimyanny, it has been rebuilding its conic structure; it has also exploded intermittently. This is seen as an ominous precedent by Dr. Donald A. Swanson, director of the Davis A. Johnston Cascade Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., which is responsible for monitoring Mount St. Helens. Soviet Volcano Called Worrisome The most recent eruption at Mount St. Helens occurred in May 1986. Although there is no indication that it will explode again, the example of Bezymyanny is worrisome, Dr. Swanson said. In June 1980, after its devastating eruption a month earlier, a lava dome in Mount St. Helens began building on its crater floor. In July it was destroyed by a violent eruption. A new dome began growing, but in October it too was blown sky high. Since then a third dome has been gradually evolving through small eruptions but there have been no further great explosions. Bezymyanny, on the other hand, has erupted more than a dozen times. Predicting dome-building eruptions inside the St. Helens crater has become fairly straightforward, Dr. Swanson said. The dome begins swelling two to three weeks in advance, as recorded by electronic tiltmeters mounted in pairs on the dome. Monitoring Inside Crater Seismic devices on the dome and crater floor record tremors induced as lava moves up into the dome. Virtually all monitoring of Mount St. Helens is done inside its crater, Dr. Swanson said. Laser pulses aimed at reflectors on the dome and elsewhere in the crater also record local deformatiom of the terrain as do strain meters mounted in the dome's cracks. Readings from all these devices are transmitted to the observatory in nearby Vancouver. A puzzling feature of the Klyucheskaya volcanoes, according to Dr. Swanson, is the manner in which Bezymyanny differs from the others. It produces a lava that is sticky and plugs the volcano until it explodes. The other volcanoes erupt lava that hardens into rock, or basalt. According to Dr. Fedotov, in the 215 years before his institute was founded in 1935, the summit of Klyuchevskaya erupted 38 times, in most cases explosively. Three times its summit was blown off, only to rebuild itself. Eleven times in the past half century the volcano has erupted from its flank, in addition to a number of summit eruptions, Dr. Fedotov said. Flank eruptions, like the one from St. Helens, can be particularly destructive.

347-> COMPANY NEWS; Ford and Navistar In Engine Deal
The Navistar International Corporation said that it would continue to supply diesel engines to the Ford Motor Company beyond its current contract, which is scheduled to expire later this month. The current contract, in which Navistar produced 6.9-liter diesel engines for Ford pickup trucks and vans, was signed in 1981. Analysts said the approaching deadline on the current contract had been a dark cloud for Navistar. The new agreement, terms of which have yet to be made final, is to run through the 1990 model year. Navistar, formerly known as International Harvester, said it had sold more than 300,000 engines to Ford. Navistar was the second-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange today. It closed at $6.375 a share, unchanged, on volume of almost 4.1 million shares.

348-> IN THE NATION; Choice in the House
Paradoxical as it may seem, Democrats in the House of Representatives - which last year voted to force a nuclear test ban and continued observance of SALT II - may be about to elect an Armed Services Committee chairman with the following record: * Support for the MX missile, a new nerve gas, funds for the Nicaraguan contras, the B-1 bomber, the neutron bomb and more military spending. * Opposition to the House-passed moratorium on testing anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and to a resolution demanding that the C.I.A. stop mining Nicaragua's harbors. * Consistent rejection of Democratic leadership positions in House votes from 1980 to 1985 - by that measure, one of the 10 least faithful Democrats, a ''boll weevil'' and a leading member of the Conservative Forum. Despite all that, by most estimates Representative Marvin Leath of Texas has a good chance to win the Armed Services chairmanship. Stranger still, if Mr. Leath wins, he apparently will do it with the support of some of the House's most liberal members - Ron Dellums and Barbara Boxer of California, for instance, and Marty Russo of Illinois. This situation arose after one House Democratic caucus denied reconfirmation (by 130 to 124) to Les Aspin of Wisconsin, who seized the post in a sort of coup d'etat in 1985. With so much support, Mr. Aspin has not given up; in fact, the ultimate choice probably will be between him and Mr. Leath. But the House Democratic leadership, in a bow to seniority, has endorsed 76-year-old Charles Bennett of Florida. Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts, a liberal, also is in the field. With that many candidates, who knows what might happen in the voting at another Democratic caucus this week? The low man on each ballot will drop out until someone wins; and the voting will be by secret ballot, which makes head-counting - and retribution - difficult. Even before Mr. Aspin was denied reconfirmation, Mr. Leath was campaigning energetically to replace him. One reason he may do well is that he is a well-liked member of the House, a gregarious Texan and accomplished country music singer, with a reputation for ''really listening'' to his colleagues. Another is that he modified somewhat his hard-line position on military issues last year and has let it be known that if elected chairman he would move even further to the center. He knows, and liberals know, that he could hardly expect to win, or perhaps to retain, the chairmanship without substantial liberal backing. Mr. Aspin, on the other hand, is widely regarded as having betrayed the expectations of many who supported him when he won the chairmanship from Melvin Price of Illinois two years ago. On the highly publicized issues of the MX missile, aid for the contras and the defense budget level, he was thought to have reversed or modified stands he had taken while campaigning for the chairmanship; on the less-known issue of Pentagon procurement reform, a number of members thought he had ''given away'' the House position in conference with the Senate. Undoubtedly, Mr. Aspin's defeat for reconfirmation can be traced to such complaints; but many Democrats -particularly liberals - who voted against him the first time meant primarily to show their displeasure and to bring a maverick chairman back into line. Judged by the kind of campaign promises Mr. Aspin is making, some House Democrats believe, that tactic was successful. But once burned, twice fearful; a number of Democrats are reluctant to trust him again. That, combined with Marvin Leath's effective campaign and personal popularity, could be the key to the secret balloting. The stakes are not minor: among other things in the coming session are a new vote on a nuclear test ban, railroad basing for MX missiles already built, a continued moratorium on ASAT testing, funding for the contras and the defense budget. For the long run, the choice could mean even more; the Democrats can't keep changing chairmen every two years, and Mr. Leath conceivably can establish himself in the post for a long time. That could be more important than any single issue now coming before the committee. So who's the best bet for those who have voted very differently from Marvin Leath on military issues? A backsliding conservative who needs their votes, at least for now? Or a maverick who says under pressure that he's ready to play ball with those who elected him?

349-> BIG CHARGE PUTS UNISYS IN THE RED
The Unisys Corporation lost $188.5 million in the fourth quarter because of a huge one-time charge to cover the costs of its creation through the merger of the Burroughs Corporation and the Sperry Corporation, the computer maker said today. The special charge of $280 million wiped out the company's profit from normal operations, Unisys said. For the year, Unisys posted a net loss of $43.4 million. ''Although we reported a net loss, it was the result of the special charges incurred in pulling the companies together,'' W. Michael Blumenthal, the Unisys chairman, said. ''In addition, the reorganization caused disruption to the fourth-quarter sales effort.'' Stock Price Rises by 25 Cents Unisys stock was up 25 cents a share, to $95.875, on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the announcement. Unisys's loss in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with a profit of $115.3 million, or $2.42 a share, posted by Burroughs in the fourth quarter of 1985, before the merger with Sperry. Revenue in the most recent quarter was $2.54 billion, up from $1.48 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the Unisys loss of $43.4 million compared with a profit for Burroughs a year earlier of $248.2 million, or $5.46 a share. Revenue for 1986 was $7.43 billion, up from $5.04 billion for Burroughs in the year before the acquisition of Sperry. Memorex Sale Cited Mr. Blumenthal said the plan of Unisys to sell its Memorex data-storage business also affected fourth-quarter results, but added that he believed the quarter was ''an aberration, not reflective of normal business patterns.'' Burroughs completed its purchase of Sperry Sept. 16, forming the world's second-largest computer company behind the International Business Machines Corporation. The fourth-quarter 1986 special charges included $201 million for closing and consolidation of plants and offices, work force reductions and sales of various operations, and $79 million in loss of earnings from discontinued programs, Mr. Blumenthal said.

350-> MUSIC: 'BEAUTY OF FLUTE' AT THE ASIA SOCIETY
ALTHOUGH ''The Beauty of the Flute,'' a program presented Saturday at the Asia Society, was marred by a recalcitrant tape machine, and - somewhat more seriously - by underrehearsal, its best moments made the afternoon a worthy one. The concert, which was sponsored by a group called Music From Japan, offered works from East and West. They were played by the first-class flutists and new music advocates Rachel Rudich and Harvey Sollberger, assisted by the pianist Martin Goldray, the percussionist Kory Grossman, the harpist Susan Jolles and the guitarist William Anderson. Yoriaki Matsudaira's ''Brilliancy for Flute and Piano'' proved a slight, pretty work that combined quarter tones and minimalist simplicity. Yasuo Sueyoshi's ''Correspondence V and VI'' for flute and percussion rattled and chirped energetically - a virtuosic celebration of hard sonic surfaces. Toshio Hosokawa's ''Sen'' and Ryohei Hirose's ''Hymn'' were two disparate works for solo flute - the first a dashing, angular glossary of avant-garde techniques, the second more lyrical and subdued. Another work by Mr. Hirose, ''Paramita,'' combined the alto flute with gonging, repeated chords on the harp, adding up to a solemn, pensive totality. Because of technical problems, a first attempt at playing Roger Reynolds's ''Transfigured Wind'' for flute and tape had to be abandoned in midcourse. When finally played through to its conclusion, Mr. Reynolds's work proved an eloquent, Modernist concerto for flute and tape, with a strong sense of mystery. It would be wise to delay comment on Mr. Sollberger's ''original substance - manifests -traces''; the composer finished the work within the last week or two, and the performance lacked the ease and fluency that a successful interpretation would demand.

356-> Panel Releases Export Study
The National Academy of Sciences released a report today calling for less Government restriction of high-technology exports, saying that existing rules cost the United States billions of dollars in jobs and trade each year. The report, a draft form of which has already been circulating here, has been critized by members of the Defense Department, led by Assistant Secretary Richard Perle. They say that relaxed trade restrictions would compromise American defense. The report calls for a coordinated effort between the United States and its allies to develop a ''multilateral'' export policy. ''The present procedure is an irritation to our allies,'' Melvin R. Laird, former Secretary of Defense, said at a news conference this morning. Other countries are often so ''discouraged'' by American restrictions that they refrain from buying American products, he said. ''The technology of concern is available within our NATO allies and newly developed countries,'' said Ruth Greenstein, vice president and treasurer of Genex Corporation, who served on the panel. ''A policy which restricts only United States business doesn't achieve national security goals or trade utility.'' A study included in the report says that the current controls cost the American economy $9.3 billion, or 188,000 jobs, in 1985.

357-> F.C.C. INQUIRY FOCUSES ON BOESKY TV STATION
The Federal Communications Commission said today that it was investigating the possibility of violations of its rules by the arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky and his wife, Seema, in connection with their Oklahoma City television station. At issue is whether a transfer of control of the station license on Dec. 31 to Mrs. Boesky from the Beverly Hills Hotel Corporation without approval by the F.C.C. violated the Communications Act of 1934, which requires approval of license transfers before they take place. Penalties can range from a reprimand to cancellation of the license. The F.C.C.'s enforcement division is also looking into whether the Boeksys may have committed a similar violation several years ago when they bought the station but did not advise the commission that Mr. Boesky had voted the shares of the Beverly Hills Hotel Corporation owned by his wife. This might have resulted in his being listed as controller of the license. Transfer Application Filed The investigation stems from an application filed with the F.C.C. last month by Beverly Hills Hotel, which is controlled by the Boeskys and owns Oklahoma City's KGMC-TV, Channel 34, through several subsidiaries. Beverly Hills Hotel, which is being liquidated since Mr. Boesky's settlement of insider-trading charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, had asked the F.C.C. for quick approval of a transfer of the station's control to a limited partnership controlled by Mrs. Boesky. In its request, the Beverly Hills Hotel Corporation said the Boesky group - comprising Mr. and Mrs. Boesky, a trust created for their children and the Greydale Corporation -had maintained majority stock control of Beverly Hills Hotel since it acquired the station in 1983. Greydale was owned 50 percent by Mr. Boesky directly, 25 percent by Mr. Boeksy as trustee for the Boesky children and 25 percent by Burton Slatkin as trustee for the Slatkin children. A Voting Trust Agreement In a footnote to this required information, Beverly Hills Hotel said Mr. and Mrs. Boesky and Greydale had entered into a voting trust agreement two years before buying the station. The footnote said this accord gave Mr. Boesky the right to ''vote their shares'' in Beverly Hills Hotel. In its filing, Beverly Hills Hotel said, ''Because the voting trust agreement was reached prior to the acquisition of the television station, it was inadvertently not filed with the F.C.C.'' The commission did not act by Dec. 31 on the request by the Boeskys. James McKinney, chief of the mass media bureau of the F.C.C., said today that he had been informed by David C. Jatlow, a lawyer for Beverly Hills Hotel, that the transfer of control had been executed anyway, without F.C.C. approval. Mr. Jatlow did not return a phone call placed to his office here to seek comment.

358-> PICKENS ALL SET FOR NEW GAME
T. Boone Pickens is not saying much about it, but when the last remnants of his Mesa Petroleum Company are transferred in early February to its successor, Mesa Limited Partners, it will open a door for the Texas oilman to pursue corporate takeovers outside the energy business. In Wall Street's view, Mr. Pickens proved his financial prowess in Mesa's raids against Gulf Oil, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal in 1984 and 1985. Over all, he has generated more than $400 million in after-tax profits for his independent oil company since 1981 with those takeover campaigns and other investments $3 Billion Backing Estimated Some of his former associates and some Wall Street analysts say privately that Mr. Pickens has agreements to raise $3 billion or more from investors to finance takeovers outside the oil industry. That, in theory, is enough to buy majority control of any but a handful of the largest American corporations. For now, Mr. Pickens is keeping his own counsel. ''People have all these images,'' he said during a recent interview in his office here. Most of his activities, he said, including Mesa's current, hostile bid for a large stake in the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, are designed to increase Mesa's natural gas reserves. In his view, acquisitions -rather than exploration - will be the least costly way for independent energy companies to grow for several years. Gas Reserves Doubled Since 1983 In fact, Mesa, one of the largest of the independents, has more than doubled its natural gas reserves since 1983, to 2 trillion cubic feet, with most of the increase coming from its friendly acquisition of the Pioneer Corporation last year. It could add another 1.2 trillion cubic feet if it wins Diamond Shamrock. Typically, about 90 percent of Mesa's reserves and 60 percent of its revenues are derived from natural-gas sales. Mesa earned $61.9 million in the first nine months of 1986, a sixfold increase from $9.9 million in the same period of 1985. Under agreements made when Mesa Petroleum was converted to a limited partnership in December 1985, Mr. Pickens, who is 58 years old, has not been permitted to initiate any takeover attempts through the partnership that were outside the energy field. A similar restriction has applied to his three key financial advisers, who were under contract to Mesa Petroleum. New Roles at Booneco Next month, however, after Mesa Petroleum is officially liquidated, the advisers will move into roles as takeover consultants for the partnership, where they will still be restricted to energy-related deals. But they also will be available to handle assignments for a new, unrelated business set up by Mr. Pickens, named Booneco. ''It's conceivable Booneco never does anything,'' if the Mesa partnership ''stays busy with deals,'' Mr. Pickens said. But David Batchelder, a takeover strategist at Mesa and one of the three Pickens advisers, said the unit was created by Mr. Pickens so he could independently pursue and finance takeovers in other industries. ''As long as there are undervalued assets and weak managements, we'll have an opportunity to make money,'' Mr. Batchelder said. ''And there are still lots of opportunities both in and out of the oil and gas industry.'' Higher Fees in New Concern Mr. Batchelder, who is 37, and the two other minority partners in the new business - Andrew P. Craig, 36, and Sidney Tassin, 30 - essentially serve as Mr. Pickens's investment bankers. They split $4 million in fees from Mesa's $750 million friendly takeover of Pioneer last year. In Booneco, the fees could be much higher, Mr. Batchelder said, but still lower than most charged by Wall Street firms. Two of Mr. Pickens's former associates, who asked not to be named, said the oilman probably sees Booneco as a way to add to his personal wealth more rapidly than he is likely to with Mesa. Prominent deal makers such as Michael Milken, the ''junk bond'' expert at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor who last year took control of Trans World Airlines Inc., were said by these former associates to be his models. Mr. Pickens rejected that comparison. ''I'm not trying to copy Mike Milken or Carl,'' he said. ''All of us have our own style.'' Some longtime Pickens followers agree. Rosario S. Ilacqua, an oil industry analyst with L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin in New York, said he thinks Mr. Pickens still wants to run a major oil company despite his intoxicating past successes in financial deals. Poker Player At the same time, Mr. Ilacqua added, the cagey, poker-playing Mr. Pickens is hard to read. ''He's always painting his trail,'' Mr. Ilacqua said, ''and trying to confuse you, me and anyone else as to what he's going to do.'' As it is, Mr. Pickens receives 4 percent of the value of any takeover as a fee for any acquisition he makes for Mesa; his $2 billion bid to capture all of Diamond Shamrock last December would have earned him about $40 million after taxes. A new, $300 million offer for part of Shamrock could give Mr. Pickens $70 million before taxes if his investor group eventually wins all of the company. Analysts said he could take even bigger percentages for personal fees in independent takeovers. Conflict-of-Interest Concerns Some owners of Mesa's units are worried about conflicts of interest. Lewis Gilbert, the stockholder-rights advocate, said Mesa needs outside directors to make sure Mr. Pickens is not neglecting Mesa in devoting time to other ventures. Mr. Pickens agreed to permit director elections this year, but it is not clear what issues those directors would be permitted to vote on, said Warren Vieth, a Mesa spokesman. Partnerships, unlike corporations, typically do not have boards of directors. An annual meeting tentatively is set for May. Mr. Batchelder said it would be self-defeating for the advisers to pursue deals that are bad for Mesa, even though he and the others are paid based on a percentage of the size of takeovers. The reason, he said, is that most of their personal net worth is invested in Mesa. And Mr. Pickens said worries about conflicts of interest were misplaced. ''I'll do a 40-hour week for Mesa even if I'm busy with Booneco,'' he said. ''I know the business. There isn't any reason for me to give up any part of it if I can fit it into my schedule. I have the flexibility to do a lot of things.'' $107 Million Personal Net Worth He put his personal net worth at $107 million, ''a lot less than people think.'' He has piled up debts of $55 million, much of it spent to increase his stake in Mesa over the years, he said. The stake is now approximately 5 percent of Mesa's equity, or worth about $80 million. In 1985, the last year for which figures are available, Mr. Pickens earned a salary of $1.2 million, plus a bonus of $3 million and a deferred bonus (related to the Phillips and Unocal transactions) of another $4.2 million. ''I damn sure haven't been greedy in these deals,'' he said. ''All of the bonuses before went right back into the business.'' Mr. Pickens suggested that this was a bargain for Mesa investors, and pointed out that Mesa had one of the highest average rates of total return on capital of any energy company during the last 10 years - an annual rate of 25 percent. Optimist on Energy Prices Despite his aversion to exploration for now, Mr. Pickens is an optimist on energy prices. He said he expects crude oil to reach $28 a barrel by January 1989, from its current $18.75 level. And natural gas, now selling at about $1.50 per thousand cubic feet, should top $3 by 1990, he said. Still, Mr. Pickens virtually shut off Mesa's drilling last year, a step that reduced expenses and increased cash flow. It also helped Mesa make a cash distribution of $2 per unit. That puts Mesa's rate of return on capital close to 12 percent, or three percentage points higher than long-term bonds are paying. Mesa units, traded on the Big Board, closed Friday at $16.875, down 12.5 cents. The $2 distribution keeps Mesa's unit price up and, according to analysts, is meant to help Mr. Pickens finance bigger takeovers for the partnership. Last year's acquisition of Pioneer, for instance, was financed solely with a new issue of Mesa preferred units. Doubts on Maintaining Payment Two analysts, who asked not to be named, said Mesa will have a hard time maintaining the payment unless it increases its cash flow. One analyst said Mesa's revenues this year probably will cover a cash distribution of just 60 cents per unit. ''The only way he can keep up the payment is to do new deals'' or draw money from cash reserves or bank credit lines, one analyst said. ''Meanwhile, he is just depleting Mesa's reserves.'' Diamond Shamrock's directors raised the same doubts in December, when they rejected a first bid by the Pickens group made up solely of Mesa units. A year ago, Mr. Pickens said Mesa could afford an annual cash distribution of between $1.50 and $2 per unit through 1990. Sharp-Pencil Maneuvers The balance sheet will get stronger on Feb. 2, when the partnership receives $250 million in cash as the final payment from Mesa Petroleum's liquidation. It will pare the partnership's ratio of debt to total capital to a modest 27 percent, from 42 percent. All of these sharp-pencil maneuvers by Mr. Pickens mean Mesa has ''a lot of financial flexibility'' to pursue takeovers, said Catherine Montgomery, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Other analysts said they believe it is only a matter of time before Mr. Pickens takes his appetite for takeover campaigns in new directions.

359-> MACHEL CRASH INQUIRY STARTS
An inquiry into the plane crash that killed President Samora M. Machel of Mozambique opened hearings Tuesday and was told that Soviet crew members reported moments before the accident that they could not find the airport in Mozambique's capital. The counsel for the board said there was no sign of technical failure and ''no question of sabotage.'' Mr. Machel and 33 others died Oct. 19 when their plane, returning to Maputo, the Mozambique capital, struck hills in South Africa 44 miles to the west. The death of Mr. Machel, who was returning from a meeting in Zambia, heightened tensions in southern Africa. Some African leaders said they suspected South Africa played a role in the crash. Mozambique, however, has not blamed Pretoria directly or indirectly. The international board of inquiry opened the hearings with a ''factual report'' approved by South Africa, Mozambique and the Soviet Union. According to the report, the crew did not detect any ground beacons, undercutting charges that South Africa may have lured the plane off course with false navigational aids. The report also rejected a charge by South African officials that Soviet crew members had alcohol in their blood. In the flight's final minutes, according to a transcript submitted to the inquiry, the crew told the tower that the instrument landing system did not seem to work, and that they could not see the lights of Maputo airport for a visual landing.

360-> SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES UPHOLD RIGHT TO SUE BY PUBLIC HOUSING TENANTS
The Supreme Court ruled today that tenants in federally subsidized, low-income housing projects are entitled to a Federal court hearing on purported violations of their rights under Federal housing law. In a 5-to-4 vote, the Court held that the approximately three million tenants in such projects do not have to depend on the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to enforce their rights against local public housing authorities. In the case, the Court allowed a suit against the Redevelopment and Housing Authority in Roanoke, Va., by a group of low-income tenants who said they had been charged an unreasonable amount for electricity in addition to their rent. The case showed the deep split on the Court over whether beneficiaries of Federal programs should have access to Federal courts to enforce vaguely worded statutes or regulations when it is not clear whether Congress intended to authorize such private suits. Previous Decisions Extended The majority opinion, written by Associate Justice Byron R. White, extended previous decisions that have allowed persons to use a broadly worded 1871 civil rights law to sue state and local officials for violating their rights under Federal statutes. The plaintiffs claimed that public housing tenants in Roanoke had been illegally charged $113,114 in utility payments over a two-year period. Federal regulations provide that a reasonable allowance for utilities be included in subsidized housing tenants' rents. Congress requires that such tenants be charged exactly 30 percent of their income for rent. Reversing two lower Federal court rulings, the Court said there was no evidence that Congress had intended to preclude private suits under the Federal Housing Act and related provisions, and that there was no provision for effective enforcement by Federal officials of tenants' rights. Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented in the case, Wright v. Roanoke, No. 85-5915, and was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Associate Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Antonin Scalia. In other decisions today, the Court did these things: Searches of Vehicles It made it easier for police to use criminal evidence found during a search without a warrant of a vehicle belonging to an arrested suspect. By 7 to 2, the Court upheld the legality of a search of a closed backpack found by a Boulder, Colo., police officer in a van he had impounded after stopping it for speeding and after arresting the driver for drunk driving. Inside the backpack the officer found metal canisters containing cocaine, methaqualone tablets and cocaine paraphernalia. Lower courts have been divided over whether police may inventory the contents of closed luggage and other containers found in vehicles taken into police custody. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled the search of the van unconstitutional. Reversing this decision, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Court that police have substantial discretion to look into containers found in impounded cars when the purpose of the search is to inventory the contents of the car, rather than to hunt for evidence of a crime. Justices Marshall and Brennan dissented in the case, Colorado v. Bertine, No. 85-889. Pocket Veto In Burke v. Barnes, No. 85-781, the Court dismissed as moot a major dispute between the Reagan Administration and Congress over the propriety of the President's pocket veto of a 1983 bill limiting aid to El Salvador. The pocket veto is a method of killing Congressional legislation in which the President declines either to sign a bill or veto it and return it to Congress when Congress has adjourned before the end of the 10 days allowed for the President to act. The Court held that because the bill would have expired by its own terms in 1984 even if the pocket veto had been invalid, the case should be dismissed as moot. This action left unresolved the dispute between the President and Congress over whether the President can use the pocket veto procedure between two sessions of the same Congress. The vote was 6 to 2 with Chief Justice Rehnquist writing the Court's opinion. Justices John Paul Stevens and White dissented.

361-> FOUR GOOD BUDGET IDEAS; For Jobs That Look Ahead, Not Back
The essential flaw in the Reagan Administration's new 1988 budget is that it's too little a budget and too much a bargaining position. To budget is to choose how to divide the pie; the ultimate choices will depend on give-and-take with Congress in the coming months. The Reagan budget nonetheless contains imaginative initiatives. Perhaps the most sensible and humane proposal would consolidate job-training programs for dislocated workers and triple funding to almost $1 billion. This is decent government. It's also smart. The Administration has, in effect, staged a pre-emptive strike against demands for protectionist legislation, particularly from organized labor. The Democratic Congress will be under pressure to respond to those demands, which aim to save the jobs of workers in noncompetitive American industries at the expense of the entire economy. There's a constructive alternative: Give displaced workers training for new jobs and assistance in relocating. That's the forward-looking approach the Administration proposes with this new program. About a million Americans a year see their jobs disappear for good. Many find new jobs fairly quickly; 40 percent languish. Education and the availability of retraining and support are the keys. Past government retraining efforts have been focused on those who lost jobs because of foreign imports. Commendably, the new Administration plan would make no distinction between a South Carolinian out of work because of textile imports and an Iowan unemployed because he lost his farm. Congress can improve the proposals, for instance insisting on special safeguards for minority workers and more basic education skills development. With such refinements, the proposal warrants the widest support.

362-> 482 Votes Later, Commission In West Virginia Picks Chief
Preston County Commissioners, who had been trying for more than a week to break a tie and elect a president, today unanimously chose one on the 482d ballot. They selected Dave Friend, a Democrat, who led one of the two factions that could not reach agreement. On Jan. 5 the eight Commissioners first sought to choose between two Republicans, Jesse Jennings, backed by the panel's three Democrats in a challenge to the long-time Republican leadership of the county, and Ward Thomas, backed by the other Republican members.

363-> ART: 47 FIGURAL PAINTINGS OF DAVID PARK ON VIEW
UNTIL a full-scale museum retrospective is organized, the work of David Park, who died of cancer in 1960 at the age of 49, may be doomed to perennial rediscovery. The current exhibition of his paintings at Salander-O'Reilly (22 East 80th Street) is the third this gallery has mounted in almost as many years; it is the best yet and should win Park even more admirers. Park, born and reared in Boston, never finished high school and had only one year of formal art education, at Otis Institute in Los Angeles. He was largely a self-taught painter who lived most of his adult life in San Francisco, teaching first at the San Francisco Art Institute and then at Berkeley. After an apprenticeship to Picasso and Matisse that lasted from the early 1930's to the mid-40's, Park, like many members of his generation, started working in an abstract style, but by 1949 he had destroyed all the abstract paintings still in his possession and returned to the figure. He was quickly joined by his friends Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff - the three of them starting a trend that was soon called Bay Area Figuration. The 47 paintings on view here (through Feb. 28) range from Park's first post-abstract canvas, the somewhat primitive ''Kids on Bikes,'' to the large, impressive ''Daphne'' of 1959, a monumental nude painted in white, tans and blacks that is surrounded by and nearly subsumed within an energetic background of black and orange. Park's return to the figure is frequently compared to the same move Willem de Kooning made the following year with ''Woman I.'' From the vantage point of the 1980's, however, it is more interesting to compare Park to Philip Guston. Like Guston, Park definitely saved the best for last, putting a completely different torque on his achievement in a mere 10 years of rapid development and unrelenting yet clearly pleasurable effort. More important, Park, like Guston, makes us understand how ideas from older painting can be put to new, contemporary uses. Park's mature paintings combine the psychological, often domestic intimacy of the Nabis with the bright hues of the Fauves, but on a scale borrowed from Abstract Expressionism. His paintings are not often big but their brushwork always is. He walked the line between abstraction and representation with consummate skill, making extravagant use of paint and color, while keeping a close eye on the subject at hand. The result was a double-leveled veracity that completely skirts conventional realism and is therefore all the more intimate: on one hand, there's a thick, slabbed surface that refers back to the artist's physical gestures; on the other, an image that, in its familiarity and emotional fullness, speaks directly to the viewer's psyche, to both his private and collective memory. In the mid-1950's, when Park was at the height of his powers, he painted scenes of everyday life, small private moments of quiet community or, more usual, of self-contained repose - moments slowed down and held in part by the paint itself. Here we see paintings of one boy looking out a car window and of another boy playing a violin; of an individual woman, usually the artist's wife, Lydia, who sews or reads or writes a letter; of a group of students on their way to class, heads slightly bowed in thought, and people seated in a dim theater waiting for the curtain to go up. Best of all may be paintings in which the relationships are slightly more dynamic and the colors hotter, too: the four dancing couples in ''Sophomore Society,'' and the man and woman deep in conversation in ''Flower Market,'' which, happily, is owned by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The woman's face, painted in unnatural hues of red and green that reflect the florist's wares at her side, projects an amazing array of natural emotion, from mild anger to tender concern. Park's use of deep space, of unexpected or steeply angled viewpoints, and his propensity for bringing his figures right up to the painting's edge amplifies their intimacy and our response. Many of his paintings give us the feeling that we are a second away from tapping the figure on the shoulder and striking up a conversation -it almost seems rude not to. As he freely admitted, Park was not a great inventor, but this ability to engage the viewer deeply and spontaneously, to convey the essence of life in the essence of painting, more than compensates. Also of interest this week: ''Contained Attitudes'' (Artists Space, 223 West Broadway, at Franklin Street): While it is well known that the newest art from Europe tends to be anything but Neo-Expressionist, the more specific information received here, the better. To this end: ''Contained Attitudes,'' the sparsest and best-looking exhibition to be installed at Artists Space in some time. It includes four European object makers - Alain Sechas of France, Jan Van Oost of Belgium, Ton Zwerver of the Netherlands and an artist simply identified as Meuser from West Germany - all selected by Saskia Bos, director of De Appel Foundation in Amsterdam. Also on view are the efforts of some video makers - Graham Young of England, Alain Bourges of France, Koen and Frank Theys of Belgium and Studio's Independent Theater of the Netherlands - selected by Chris Dercon, a freelance critic and curator from Brussels. All the artists here work with materials, images, stories and objects that already exist. Their art is somewhat impersonal and undemonstrative, hence the exhibition's title. Nothing is invented nor presumed to be original; all is recycled, reused and, one supposes, renewed, or at least recontextualized. The best of the video artists, Graham Young, works with whatever is handy in the home. He dismantles his living room to the tune of Beethoven's Fifth in ''Nil by Mouth'' and presses such things as a mousetrap, a glass of water and the family cat into service in a series of elegantly edited episodes collectively titled ''Accidents in the Home.'' Zwerver, the best of the object makers, seems similarly housebound. His photographs show how he has rearranged the contents of various people's living rooms or studios into temporary sculpture. An actual on-site piece is constructed from odds and ends, but especially from three windows, gathered at Public School 1 in Long Island City, Queens. It looks like a not uninteresting cross between the work of Richard Serra and Gerhard Mucha. Van Oost's objects consist of a large Plexiglas volume that suggests a double coffin plus two big Formica paintings that are based, it turns out, on the mourning notices that Belgian businesses place in newspapers. While these works will superficially remind many American viewers of Richard Artschwager's work, this is clearly not their whole story. For the most part, however, the work in this show is a tad dry and too contained. Nor does it entirely remove the suspicion that Europe, like New York, is caught in the throes of yet another swing of the esthetic pendulum, but only time will tell. In the meantime, any news is useful news. (Through Jan. 24.) Jules Olitski (M. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street): Jules Olitski, continuing his refinement of late Formalism, is now painting on Plexiglas. This material seems to provide him with the ultimate in a thin flat surface that can be subtly shaped - a corner truncated here, an edge angled in or out there - with a minimum of bother. Olitski's palette still tends toward muted non-colors - pale grays, silvery off-whites and pinky beiges abound - and the paint is still iced on to considerable thickness. Sometimes, as in ''Storm Star,'' the impasto is flattened out with a light dusting of a darker color - from a spray can, it would seem - which makes the painting look more like a photograph than the real thing. This effect recalls the Abstract Illusionism of James Havard or the flocked brushstroke paintings of John Clem Clarke - artists whom one assumes are anathema to hard-core Formalists. These paintings are not without a certain somewhat tawdry beauty. Nonetheless, Olitski's singular, unswerving determination has become more interesting than anything happening on their surfaces. (Through Jan. 31.)

364-> U.S. Wheat Subsidy Set
The Reagan Administration today approved the subsidized sale of up to one million metric tons of wheat to China. The announcement drew immediate objections from Canada, one of Peking's largest wheat suppliers. Australia, China's other large source of wheat, was also likely to protest the subsidy offer. Agriculture Department officials said Peking had indicated during talks earlier this month that it would take advantage of the offer, which involves a subsidy in the form of wheat from Government stocks. The long-awaited offer was designed to counter allegedly unfair subsidies by the European Community, Agriculture Department officials said. Daniel Amstutz, second-ranking Agriculture Department official, said in a statement that the subsidy will enable exporters to compete at commercial prices in the Chinese market. In the past, grain importing nations have complained that United States grain prices are too high compared with world prices. A Canadian embassy official said Ottawa was concerned that Washington's offer could damage Ottawa's export prospects and lower Canadian farmers' income.

366-> ESSAY; Mario Hare, Gary Tortoise
I used to think that Mario Cuomo was the most likely person to get the 1988 Democratic nomination. Accordingly, I put in a few zaps in this space about his avoidance of foreign affairs issues, which, after all, are kind of central to a campaign for leader of the free world. Back in September, the needling got a rise out of the New York Governor. ''I have a strong interest in foreign affairs,'' he wrote me, adding the qualifier, ''every Governor must. I have access to some of the finest minds in our country on all aspects of foreign policy and I use them.'' Why, then, has he not given anyone an inkling about whether he is hawk or dove, isolationist or interventionist? Governor Cuomo anticipated that question and provided the pre-emptive answer: ''I have discouraged public attention on this score because I thought it generated useless speculation about my plans.'' In other words: he fears that one peep about his profoundly pondered position on arms to the contras, or the slightest hint that he has gleaned an attitude toward ''Star Wars'' from some of the finest minds in our country, would be tantamount to an announcement of his candidacy for President. Let us charitably stipulate that Mr. Cuomo does have some views on foreign affairs; that he had an excuse of a gubernatorial campaign to evade the public discussion; and that he can get away with the alibi that he was too busy working on his State of the State speech to focus on the world beyond Montauk, L.I. O.K., that's over now. We have heard his reprise of family values, packaged now as ''progressive pragmatism,'' which presumably is much tougher-minded than pragmatic progressivism. We have heard his theme of ''the New York idea'' (the phrase lifted from Robert LaFollette's ''Wisconsin idea''), the essence of which is John Donne's universal connectedness. Now, as issue-duckers say, we can aim higher. We can dare to be bolder and wiser. We can cut out the alibis and come to grips with the connectedness of domestic and foreign affairs. I suspect Governor Cuomo is approaching national politics much as Gov. Nelson Rockefeller did: when the decision to run is made, put out position papers framed by the finest minds in our country, make elegant speeches in key states that can be published as a book, dazzle the national media with a sudden spate of interviews, show the party workers how well you do in the polls, and expect the convention to turn to you as savior. That didn't work for Rocky and won't work for Mario. As the Cuomo coyness continues, Democrats talk about all the unlikelies. The three senatorial B's -Biden, Bradley and Bumpers - will all have their day in the boomlet factory. Gov. Mike Dukakis of Massachusetts will tire of holding the Cuomo coat and make a liberal run for the exercise. We can expect to hear more from the old Scoop Jackson crowd about Georgia's Sam Nunn, the Republicans' favorite Democrat, who will be a star of the Iran televised hearings; but Senator Nunn, the best golfer in the Senate, knows the odds against a political hole in one, as does Chuck Robb, his Dukakis. The triple witching hour of the early regional primary will not produce a sweep for a conservative candidate, despite today's conventional wisdom. But now let's get serious. As the Cuomo hare hops tentatively around the country, sensitive to overexposure, tossing up foreign policy balloons to catch the prevailing breezes and getting ready for a burst of speed in the fall of 1987, realistic Democrats are looking at the tortoise. That's Gary Hart, who has the advantage of having been around this course a couple of times. Plodding along, visiting the primary states, stopping off in Moscow for a skillful interview with Mr. Gorbachev, willing and able to discuss in detail the need for American competitiveness, intelligently wrong about Central America and right about an oil import fee, enlightenedly engaging all reporters and readers of novels, the former Senator Hart is out to win the nomination one day at a time. He can draw his grand strategy on a cocktail napkin. Envision a series of concentric circles: the outside circle is the general electorate; inside that the primary voters; at the core, the 25,000 activists who organize and win primaries and caucuses. Front-runner Hart knows those 25,000 and intends for them to know and trust him. The political moral of Aesop's fable about the tortoise and the hare is not merely ''slow and steady wins the race.'' Gary Hart understands what Mario Cuomo, as yet, does not: to move ahead, a tortoise must stick his neck out.

371-> DANCE: CITY BALLET IN BALANCHINE'S 'SWAN LAKE'
JOHN MEEHAN brought a touch of melancholic poetry to George Balanchine's ''Swan Lake,'' presented by the New York City Ballet on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater. Mr. Meehan, a guest artist at City Ballet and former principal dancer with American Ballet Theater, has a romantic presence that brought added luster to this version of the ballet's second act, set to the familiar Tchaikovsky score. Mr. Meehan's Prince Siegfried entered with a commandingly quiet authority and his sure, strong partnering of Odette, the Queen of the Swans, reinforced that first impression, making him seem a still and graceful storm-center throughout much of the ballet. The gentle sweep of Mr. Meehan's arms not only drew Odette through the pas de deux but made him seem one with this wild and beautiful bird that he so suddenly encounters. But Mr. Meehan's sense of dramatic detail also added vivid highlights to the opening scenes, not only in the intensity of his gaze in the partnering but in the poignant details of his acting. This was a Siegfried who, though curious, knows how to approach and reassure unfamiliar animals. He reacts with believable fear at his first sight of von Rotbart, and he is enough of a hunter to be impatient when Odette blocks his way to that evil sorcerer. Mr. Meehan's dancing looked pushed in his variation, and his dramatic focus blurred a little toward the end. But this was a performance that worked well with the bold look of the recently redesigned production. Merrill Ashley was Mr. Meehan's Odette, dancing with just the right wild beauty until a few final, too-calculated moments. Diana White stood out as the swan leader of the Pas de Neuf, with dancing that was well-shaped and phrased and of a sumptuous yet simple strength. Melinda Roy was the stylish leader of the Valse Bluette, and William Otto was von Rotbart. The program also included Peter Martins's ''Songs of the Auvergne.'' Set to French folk songs adapted by Marie-Joseph Canteloube and sung compellingly here by Karen Hunt, the ballet is a pretty pastoral frolic through a dismal landscape. One billowing, magical duet for Heather Watts and Jock Soto manages to surface. Miss Watts has a special radiance in this role. And there was buoyant dancing from the rest of the lead cast, which also included Nichol Hlinka, Lauren Hauser, Leslie Roy, Carlo Merlo and Damien Woetzel. Things were peppier in the evening, if joyously as unbelievable, when Maria Calegari made a role debut in Balanchine's ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue.'' Dancing the Strip Tease Girl in this excerpt from ''On Your Toes,'' Miss Calegari had opera glasses raised all over the auditorium in a performance that was simultaneously sexy, virginal and witty. It would be interesting to see a slight degree of the world-weariness Miss Calegari brought recently to ''Vienna Waltzes.'' But she and Christopher d'Amboise made a sizzling pair here, dancing with a fine supporting cast that included Michael Byars, Patrick Hinson and Mr. Woetzel as the mouse-policemen, Paul Frame and Peter Naumann as the nonchalant bartenders, and Bruce Padgett, Cornel Crabtree and Mr. Otto.

374-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chairman of Baker In Fight on Hughes
Earnest Hubert Clark Jr. is scheduled to become chairman of a merged Baker International Corporation and Hughes Tool Company, but the Justice Department has thrown up a block to the proposed merger. Mr. Clark is currently chairman and chief executive of Baker International and one of the best-known executives in the oil services industry, which has suffered with the fall in the price of oil. ''He is viewed as one of the stronger managers in the industry, said Elizabeth Peek, an analyst with Wertheim & Company, ''and has come to be regarded as something of a spokesman for the industry.'' The Baker-Hughes merger, announced in October, would create one of the world's largest oil services companies, on the scale of Schlumberger and Halliburton, and would be one of Baker's ways of surviving in the embattled sector. But the Justice Department has sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds. Mr. Clark said yesterday in a telephone interview from Baker's Orange, Calif., headquarters that ''we're still negotiating with Justice to try to find a common ground that makes them happy and us happy,'' and added, ''We're working our tails off around here to make it happen and make it happen quickly.'' Mr. Clark, who is 60 years old and is known as ''Hubie,'' transformed Baker from a modest company into a leading industrial enterprise during his long tenure. The company's early growth has been attributed to his shrewdness in making acquisitions and predicting the course of oil prices. But his credibility suffered in the early 1980's, analysts said, when he put too much confidence in his views on the Middle East and hewed to the view that oil prices would not go down. ''Most everybody in the industry missed the turn in 1981 and 1982,'' he said yesterday, adding that Baker had ''responded rapidly when we recognized how drastic it was going to be. Our claim to fame was reacting quickly'' by making major cutbacks, he said. Mr. Clark grew up near Los Angeles and graduated from the California Institute of Technology with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1947. That same year he joined Baker Tools Inc., now Baker International. ''When I walked in the front door,'' he said, ''sales volume was $4.9 million.'' A combined Baker-Hughes company would have annual revenues of $2.4 billion. Mr. Clark was named president of Baker International in 1962. In 1969 he became chairman and chief executive. When he is not working he is usually pursuing one of his favorite sports - tennis, water skiing and scuba diving. He is married with six children.

375-> HOUSE APPROVES HIGHWAY AND MASS TRANSIT BILL
The House of Representatives today voted 401 to 20 to authorize highway and mass transit projects that could cost up to $91.6 billion over the next five years. The bill retains the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. The vote in the House may set up another confrontation with the Senate, which last year approved an increase in the speed limit in rural areas to 65 miles an hour. A Senate vote on the 65-mile-an-hour speed limit is expected next week. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Senate majority leader, said he was not sure how the vote would come out. The key vote today came when the House, 331 to 88, approved a procedure that would allow no amendments to the bill, blocking an effort by supporters of the higher speed limit. But many of these supporters agreed to back the bill after being promised hearings on the proposed 10-mile-an-hour increase in March. Deadlock Over Speed Limit The highway and mass transit bill died at the end of the last session of Congress because of a deadlock over the speed limit, a billboard program and differences between the House and the Senate over the number of local road and bridge projects to be included in the measure. Authorization for highway projects expired last Sept. 30, when the fiscal year 1986 ended, and there has been a major push since then by the construction industry to get a new bill passed quickly so that projects would not be stalled this spring. The House Speaker, Representative Jim Wright Texas, said today that the House would consider with separate highway legislation if this bill became deadlocked in conference with the Senate again. Earlier today, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved its version of the highway bill that did not contain a provision to raise the speed limit to 65 miles an hour. But the committee's chairman, Senator Quentin R. Burdick, a North Dakota Democrat, said he would support an amendment for the speed limit increase that is expected to be offered next week on the Senate floor. Strong Support in the West Such an amendment is strongly supported by Western states, which have long stretches of rural roads. The committee bill provides $52.4 billion for highway programs, as opposed to about $60 billion in the House bill. The authorization of funds for mass transit and other programs is in separate legislation that is to be combined when the Senate votes next week. In a separate vote the committee rejected a proposal to reduce the number of billboards along Federal highways. The Senate had approved a similar proposal last year. Under the proposal, new billboards would be banned and the state and Federal governments would no longer be required to reimburse billboard owners for signs that were removed. The House version of the bill still requires reimbursement but freezes the number of commercial billboards allowed along Federal highways. Highway and Bridge Projects The House and the Senate are still expected to be divided on the special highway and brige projects, of which there are 81 in the House bill. The version approved today by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee now has about 40 such projects, but more are expected to be added by amendment on the Senate floor. The key difference is that the House version provides additional funds for the 81 projects, with total funding for the first year at about $1.2 billion. The Senate version requires that the money come out of a state's regular apportionment from the Highway Trust Fund. The House also includes money for the depression of the Central Artery, an elevated highway in Boston, and for a new harbor tunnel to Logan International Airport in that city. Both projects were of special interest to the former House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts. The Senate bill does not include funds for the depression of the Central Artery.

376-> COLUMN ONE: Capitol Report; Freshmen Learn The Ropes in House
Getting on the committee of his choice came down to simple mathematics for Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, a freshman Democrat from the 1st District of New York, in Suffolk County. By his account, 258 and 177 equaled 30 -that is, the ratio of 258 Democrats to 177 Republicans in the House meant that the Democrats were entitled to 30 seats on the Armed Services Committee, two more than the party leadership had realized. Mr. Hochbrueckner said he had applied to be on the panel because 29,000 people in his district were employed in arms-related industries and because he was an aeronautical electrical engineer. But the leadership told him there were no vacancies. ''After 25 years in engineering, I developed a questioning kind of style,'' said Mr. Hochbrueckner, one of four House freshman from the New York metropolitan region. ''Besides, I didn't want to take no for an answer.'' He decided to check the ratios of the 22 committees to see if the six-seat gain by the Democrats had caused a shift. When he found it had, he prepared a chart listing the 22 committees and the changes in ratios. ''I did my homework,'' said Mr. Hochbrueckner. His reward? One of the two new seats. Bid Rebuffed Amory Houghton Jr., a freshman Republican from 34th District of New York, near Corning, was not as fortunate in getting on his favored committee, Energy and Commerce. Despite an impressive resume - he was chief operating officer of the Corning Glass Works for 19 years and co-founder of the Labor-Industry Coalition on International Trade - Mr. Houghton was turned down. ''They did not take any freshmen,'' Mr. Houghton said. ''They only took incumbents.'' But Republicans are saying it was not simply seniority that excluded Mr. Houghton. An aide to one Republican on the committee said Mr. Houghton's economic know-how might have helped him on, but he was late in requests. Still other Republicans said Mr. Houghton had been kept off because his ideas on trade differed strongly from the party. In the last Congress, his coalition lobbied for the Democratic-supported trade bill, which advocated better protection for American industry from foreign competition. ''I don't believe that's the reason,'' Mr. Houghton said, ''but it could be so.'' In addition to the Government Operations Committee, he has been assigned to the Budget Committee. Political Hotbed You would never know by the sound of her voice and the number of ''y'alls'' peppered in her conversations, but it has been years since the sun shone bright on Louise M. Slaughter's old Kentucky home. She left her hometown of Somerset and moved to upstate New York more than 30 years ago, settling with her family in the Rochester area. This year, Mrs. Slaughter headed back south again - to Washington, to represent the 30th District. But her drawl has not misled her colleagues. ''They just smile and say, 'Oh, you're the one from New York who doesn't sound like it,' '' she said. Mrs. Slaughter boasts that she knows of at least three other politicians who come from her tiny hometown. John Sherman Cooper, former Senator from Kentucky, hailed from Somerset, as does the representative from the 5th Congressional District in Kentucky, Harold Rogers. But Mrs. Slaughter notes that aside from being the sole woman, she differs from her fellow Somersetians in another regard. ''They're all Republicans,'' she said. ''I'm the only Democrat.'' A Matter of Address When the Rev. Floyd H. Flake returned from his first week as the Democratic representative of the 6th District, in Queens, some of his constituents had a small problem. They could not figure out how to refer to him. In addition to being their new Congressman, Mr. Flake, the leader of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, is also their pastor. ''During my pastoral word my first Sunday back, I talked about how happy I was now to be working with my friends, both here and in Washington,'' Mr. Flake said. ''Afterward, when people came over to me, I thought they wanted to talk about the sermon. All they wanted to know was 'Do we call you Reverend or do we call you Congressman?' '' His congregants-constituents decided to call him ''Reverend Congressman.'' ''The truth is,'' Mr. Flake said, ''I'd be more comfortable if they just called me Floyd.''

377-> 6 OF CITY's TOP 10 SCHOOLS IN READING TESTS ARE ON S.I.
Of the 10 elementary schools that scored highest in the citywide reading test administered last spring, six are on Staten Island -including the top-ranking school, Public School 5 in Huguenot. The school-by-school breakdown was released yesterday by the Board of Education. The overall results of the reading test -which showed that 63.7 percent of elementary and junior high school students were reading at or above grade level - were announced in June. As in past years, board officials cautioned against using the rankings as the definitive barometer of how good a school is. Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones explained that the statistics should be ''interpreted in the light of school variables,'' such as the transience of the student body and number of pupils not proficient in English. ''I would urge parents to look beyond these rankings for meaningful information about the schools their children attend or will attend,'' he said. Nonetheless, there was elation at the high-ranking schools and concern at those on the bottom of the list. ''I'm absolutely pleased and proud of the school's reading achievement, and pleased for the children,'' said Murray N. Brenner, principal of P.S. 5, where 98.7 percent of the students tested at or above grade level. It was the second consecutive year the school topped the citywide list. At Public School 235 in the South Bronx, the school that ranked the lowest, a poster with a red ''29%,'' drawn to look like a smear of blood, hung yesterday outside the office of the school's acting principal, Felix Gonzalez. With 29.1 percent of the students there reading at or above grade level, the school ranked the lowest of the 613 elementary schools. 'We Can Hide, or Improve' ''I want the students and the teachers to know how we're doing,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''We could try and be like an ostrich and hide, or we can improve ourselves. I want everyone to see that every day, and know that we've got to keep working toward common goals - a better education for the kids.'' Last year's lowest ranking elementary school, Public School 67, in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, improved to 575th in the new listing. The reading tests were given last April in the third through ninth grades at the 613 elementary schools and the 179 intermediate and junior high schools in the city. . The scores were not comparable with those from tests given in 1985 because a new test was used in all grades. The test, known as the Degrees of Reading Power, replaced the California Achievement Test, which had been used the eight previous years. When the results were first announced last June, Mayor Koch and board officials said that they represented an ''overall improvement,'' because the new test measured comprehension, rather than just vocabulary. The school-by-school breakdown, mandated by the City Decentralization Law, was released in a 49-page report that included seven statistical tables. It was prepared by the board's Office of Educational Assessment. In an introduction, the report notes that some schools may score well because they are designated as centers for the intellectually gifted. By the same token, some may be brought down a notch or more because they are centers for students who are poor achievers or were left back. Another cause for a low-ranking school is a large number of students known in Board of Education parlance as ''limited-English-proficient.'' Some of these students, many of them in bilingual programs, are excused from the test and counted with students who score below grade level. P.S. 235, for example, is a magnet school with special bilingual programs that draw students from numerous other neighborhood schools. According to Mr. Gonzalez, 97 percent of the pupils are Hispanic children, 57 percent have limited proficiency in English and 98 percent are from families who live below the poverty level. ''I'm not making excuses,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''But socioeconomic status plays an important role in standardized-test performance.'' Still, Mr. Gonzalez gives the impression that the school, at 1257 Ogden Avenue, at Merriam Street in the High Bridge section, is on the way up. Computer literacy programs have been added and new pupil performance goals have been set. Exposed Wires and Leaks Sharing a building built in 1859 with a neighborhood school, Public School 11, P.S. 235 is plagued by physical defects. Wiring is exposed in the hallways and, as the snow has been melting, water has been leaking into the hallways. The highest ranking school, P.S. 5, is also in an old building - it was built in 1930 - but it is well-kept. There are cast-iron radiators, varnished oak doors and grafitti-free hallways. The school, at Kingdom Avenue and Deisius Street in a middle-class neighborhood, has 180 pupils, with less than 5 percent from minority families. Mr. Brenner, who is in his 17th year as principal, attributed the school's success to ''a very hard-working, involved staff, very concerned and supportive parents, all pulled together by knowledgeable caring leadership.'' Students interviewed at the school gave another reason - they enjoy reading. A fifth grader, Stacy Abbate, said that she reads every night at bedtime - ''not a whole book, just about half a book, or maybe a chapter.'' Of the students in general, Mr. Brenner said, ''they all read. It's a life style.''

378-> Advances in Tin Cans; Lasers Help In Welding Smooth Seam
SOME manufacturers contend that the seams on tin cans are unsightly and make labeling and decoration more difficult. They say technological advances in the welding process will make these seams less noticeable and, in turn, create more attractive cans. In recent years, several companies have begun welding cans with laser beams instead of the conventional thin copper electrode strip. Although many people in the can industry suggest it will probably be several years before laser welding is widely used in consumer products, they say the technique will become a common method of can manufacturing. Officials of can companies that use laser welding say it cuts production costs and uses about 45 percent less energy than the traditional method, called resistance welding. ''Laser welding is a technology that's just getting started in the United States,'' said Fred L. Church, editor of Modern Metals, published from Chicago. ''Its use here is targeted primarily for the aerosol can business because that's where manufacturers think the technology would be best used.'' Most beverage cans, Mr. Church said, are now made with two pieces of metal. In these cans, there is no side seam because the cylinder and the base are formed from just one piece of aluminum. But aluminum is considered too weak for some food and pressurized products, so such cans are usually made from three metal pieces: a top, a base and a rectangular sheet of tin-plated steel, which must be welded to form a cylinder. In resistance welding, the thin area of overlap on the curved sheet is fused by intense heat conducted through a copper electrode. A 1,325-watt carbon-dioxide laser, by contrast, melts the steel at the edges of the sheet, fusing the edges and forming an almost seamless cylinder. After the welding, the can passes through a set of rollers that smooth the welded area, preparing it for the subsequent labeling or paint spraying. The process is controlled by a computer that shuts off the laser if the beam strays from the thin welding area. ''The biggest driving factor behind the development of laser welding is the fact that it makes the cans more esthetically attractive,'' said Gerald A. Vaughan, senior vice president for manufacturing and technology at the United States Can Company. Its recently acquired Pennsylvania Can Company subsidiary is one of the major concerns experimenting with the new technology. ''In the conventional method of welding cans with copper electrodes, there is a seam that's an eighth of an inch or so,'' Mr. Vaughan said. ''With laser welding, that seam is down to almost nothing. A lot of people think can customers will find laser-welded cans better to place labels on.'' The laser welding system has its problems, manufacturers acknowledge. One of the big production troubles is guiding the can body accurately enough to assure that the laser beam is focused properly. Also the production speed is slower. ''The problem is that you are slowing up a production rate that is normally about 300 cans a minute,'' said William J. Avery, president of the Crown Cork and Seal Company, whose Carolina Can Company is also testing laser welding. ''In laser welding, the speed is substantially less.'' He declined to be more specific. For that reason, many people in the industry suggest that acceptance of laser-welding technology will be slow at first. But they contend that after another year of experimental use the process will be made more efficient. And they predict that within the next five years use of the technology -which was developed by Soudronic A.G., a Swiss company - will be more apparent on a wide range of consumer products, such as aerosol cans. ''It certainly exhibits the potential of having the speed that manufacturers require,'' Mr. Church said. ''The laser techology is there already. But getting the can to the laser at a more rapid pace is going to take a little while.''

379-> IT'S THE WEEK OF THE YEAR OF THE RABBIT
''Gung Hay Fat Choy!'' 400 pupils roared yesterday at the Edward Hart Elementary School in Flushing, Queens. Perhaps a third of the students were Chinese. Most of the others, though, were for the first time hearing and saying ''Happy New Year'' in Cantonese, one of the dialects used by a fifth of the planet's population. The pupils who were able to get through the snow to the school, also known as Public School 21, gathered to hear Chinese stories, watch Chinese dances and learn a little Chinese history. A Time for Ethnic Sharing The idea behind the event was ''to encourage ethnic sharing at a very early age,'' said Teresa Ying Hsu, executive director of Asian-American Communications, which organized the event. The group, based at Teachers College of Columbia University, visits schools from time to time in its role as a liaison between Asian communities and others. Yesterday's event was one of the first celebrations of the Year of the Rabbit, which, on the lunar calendar, begins on Thursday. For Chinese, Koreans and other Asians, the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar used in the West is the first day of year 4685. The Rabbit is one of 12 animals whose names are given successively to each year. As the Year of the Tiger dwindles to its final courageous days, people born in the Year of the Rabbit can begin to take comfort in the positive nature of the traits said to be possessed by them. Rabbit people are talented, affectionate, seekers of tranquility and get on swimmingly with Sheep people and Boar people. Rabbit years are said to be good for world peace. Proclamation by Koch The New Year's doings began Friday when Mayor Koch proclaimed the week beginning yesterday Chinese Heritage and Cultural Week. The celebration continued last night with a dinner at the Flower Drum restaurant given by the Chinese Chee Yue Community Association, an organization dedicated to helping new immigrants. Today at P.S. 130 in Chinatown, students who six months ago were in mainland China will perform the Silk Ribbon and other dances. The big event comes about 10 P.M. Thursday, New Year's Day, when thousands of people will pour into Chinatown's Mott Street amid long, bright-red dragons, lion dancers and the snap of firecrackers. On Saturday the drum and bugle band of the New York Chinese School will march in Mott Street. Classical Dances Performed In Flushing, at P.S. 21's celebration of the year of the Rabbit, a high point was two Chinese classical dances, adeptly performed by 29 dancers chosen from 120 who had auditioned. The first featured a giant bok choy plant, a Chinese cabbage, as a cardboard prop. The star of the performance was clearly Damian Williams, an 11-year-old sixth grader who switched parts to replace a dancer absent because of the snow. Damian and his compatriots said his prowess at Chinese dancing was only to be expected: he is the school's most accomplished break dancer. But the real high point for most students was discovering what has always been the most pleasant part of the holiday for Chinese youngsters -gifts of red envelopes containing money. Ms. Hsu passed them out for such feats as guessing in which of three years the first Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States. (The answer is 1848.) In the shower of coins, the students' enthusiasm was such that the principal kept jumping up to remind the students where they were and exactly what they were not going to get away with.

380-> Bentsen Urges A Simpler W-4
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee urged the Internal Revenue Service today to come up with a simpler W-4 form for Americans to use in computing how much tax should be withheld from their paychecks. Responding to complaints about the complexity of the new W-4 form, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said in a letter to the I.R.S.: ''I must echo these concerns.'' The new four-page W-4 form, twice as long as the old one, was mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to assure that individuals adjust the amount of tax withheld from their paychecks to reflect the sweeping changes in the new tax law. All employees are required to file a new W-4 form this year with their employer.

381-> ADVERTISING; Investors Buy Control Of Entrepreneur Group
The majority ownership of Entrepreneur magazine, which frequently covers the franchising industry, has just been bought by three men in the business themselves. They are Barry Rupp, Peter Shea and Reinhold Pfahler, who run Stained Glass Overlay of Costa Mesa, Calif., a franchiser of 300 window-treatment product retailers. The group bought 65 percent of the Entrepreneur Group of Los Angeles from Chase Revel. The magazine has a circulation of 200,000 and last year carried 460 pages of advertising, a 49 percent increase over the previous year.

382-> THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS ALSO ALL CATHOLICS; Withdrawal of Consent
To the Editor: Your front-page article (Dec. 23) asks whose Catholicism will prevail, that of Pope John Paul II or that of the dissenters? The answer is that neither the Pope's nor the dissenters' version will prevail. The Vatican will cling adamantly to orthodox Roman Catholic doctrine on issues that provoke dissent (mainly sexual morality and the role of women in the church), while the dissenters will cling to their own liberal interpretations of that doctrine. One cannot, after all, expect the Holy See, which sees itself as the custodian of divinely revealed truth, to trim its sails to the winds of public opinion. But neither can Rome expect to change the minds of those who believe its moral strictures are unduly harsh and unrealistic, not to be taken seriously. Hence, the impasse will last indefinitely. You raise a related question, ''How much liberty can Catholic scholars be allowed to question, and the faithful to ignore, official teaching?'' Nobody knows the answer to that, least of all the Pope and his fellow bishops. However, it is clear that papal authority is no longer enough to command general obedience from the laity (or even from some theologians and clergy members) on the issues in dispute; and equally clear that the Pope has no feasible way of imposing his will on the dissidents. He can forbid a liberal theologian like Charles Curran to teach, and he can discipline a bishop like Raymond Hunthausen for alleged laxity. But he can hardly excommunicate tens of millions of Catholics for whom personal conscience, not official teaching, has become the arbiter of morality. Papal authority today is more nominal than real - because innumerable Catholics have withdrawn their consent to it. MITCHELL KELLER Rowayton, Conn., Dec. 26, 1986

383-> A Latin Alliance Behind Nicaragua
To the Editor: If, as your military analysis of the contra war says (Jan. 4), the goal of the rebels is to seize and hold a town in Nicaragua to establish a ''free Nicaragua'' and ''give Mr. Reagan a pretext to recognize the contras as the legitimate government and come to its aid by invading Nicaragua,'' Congress had better think twice before underwriting such an adventure. It resembles too closely the Soviet rationale for Moscow's involvement in Afghanistan. But what is even more dangerous is that such a war in Nicaragua cannot be contained but will spread to other parts of Latin America and destroy the fabric of the Organization of American States. It would be well to remember the speech made last March by President Alan Garcia of Peru to the Argentine Parliament. Mr. Garcia stated quite bluntly that as far as Peru is concerned, any aggression against Nicaragua by a third party would find his country on the side of the Managua regime. This speech was received, so the newspapers reported at the time, with ''tumultuous applause'' by the Argentine legislators. Is the Reagan Administration willing to sacrifice our relations with most of Latin America for questionable gains in Nicaragua? Congress will have to consider this issue before supporting any further funds for Mr. Reagan's ''freedom fighters'' in Nicaragua. WALTER A. SHELDON White Plains, Jan. 6, 1987

384-> SHUTTLE ESCAPE SYSTEM IS DELAYED
A rocket-powered system designed to eject astronauts from the space shuttle in an emergency will not be installed until further tests are conducted, an official at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said today. Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's Associate Administrator for space flight, said the agency did not ''feel comfortable'' yet about the escape system and would fly the shuttle even if such a system was not installed. But he said the agency would proceed with the design and installation of a system that could be used to blow away a space shuttle hatch to permit the crew to bail out. In the event of an emergency on the ground or in a low-speed controlled flight, the crew members could blow the hatch away and leave the craft, he said. Parachutes and other safety equipment are being developed, he added. Escape Methods Studied A study of escape methods at the Johnson Space Center in Houston showed that crew members bailing out of the shuttle could smash against the craft's wing or tail unless they were pulled clear by rockets. But Admiral Truly said more study was needed on this issue. He spoke at a news conference in which he and two other NASA officials reported on the status of the agency's recovery from the effects of the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986. The accident killed seven crew members and caused the shuttle fleet to be grounded until flawed rockets and other parts could be redesigned. Admiral Truly said NASA planned to resume shuttle flights Feb. 18, 1988, but said meeting that deadline ''continues to be a challenge.'' He said critical rocket engine tests scheduled for July ''will tell the tale'' on the schedule. The first full-scale tests of the redesigned solid-fuel rocket booster are set for mid-July, about six weeks later than originally planned.FAMILIES URGED TO SUE NASA HOUSTON, Jan. 20 (AP) - Betty Grissom, the widow of Col. Virgil I. Grissom, an astronaut who died in an Apollo spacecraft accident, has urged the families of crew members killed in the Challenger explosion to file lawsuits, saying NASA and space contractors ''don't care anything about you.'' Colonel Grissom, Lieut. Col. Edward H. White 2d and Lieut. Comdr. Roger B. Chaffee died in 1967 when a fire erupted inside their Apollo spacecraft while they were conducting tests at the Kennedy Space Center. The Houston Chronical reported today that Mrs. Grissom had said she would have received no financial judgment after her husband's death if Ronald D. Krist, a Houston lawyer, had not filed a last-minute lawsuit for her in 1972. The suit resulted in a $350,000 award from North American Rockwell, the primary contractor for the Apollo.

385-> How to Turn a Merely Formidable Politician Into a Shoo-In A Family Celebration
To the Editor: Your ''Winners'' editorial Topic (Jan. 4), criticizing Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for giving his campaign workers and supporters a two-day party in Washington, was unfair. That party was a generous gesture of appreciation for the hard work and long hours his volunteers put in to help keep in the Senate a man who represents the values and issues in which we believe. In addition to working in his campaign, I have worked about 100 days in his Buffalo regional office, helping with special projects and daily business. His way of thanking me and three dozen others in Buffalo, Rochester and Corning was to send a chartered bus to take us to the celebration. This was not a ''self-celebration for the Senator,'' as you wrote, but an extended family celebration in which we shared our love and respect for one another and the joy of working together for a better America.

386-> WASHINGTON TALK; Now, Maximum Interest in the Minimum Wage
When Ronald Reagan took office six years ago, the minimum wage was $3.35 an hour - $134 for a 40-hour week. It hasn't changed. Now, after several years of efforts to raise the minimum wage, organized labor and worker advocacy groups are convinced that the time is ripe for a change. And they are quietly marshalling their supporters in Congress to make an early push for a big increase in the minimum wage, perhaps by as much as $1 or more an hour. Their campaign comes at a time when Mr. Reagan has just approved raises, some hefty, for ranking Federal employees as part of his budget proposal submitted Monday. ''There's no question that a minimum wage increase is a top and early priority for organized labor,'' said Mark de Bernardo, labor manager for the United States Chamber of Commerce, a trade group that opposes such an increase. ''And the odds are against us right now.'' Kennedy Seen as Torchbearer To a large degree, the reason that the minimum wage issue is suddenly raising pulse rates in Washington is the new Democratic-controlled Congress and, in particular, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's decision to choose the chairmanship of the Labor and Human Resources Committee rather than that of the Judiciary Committee. The Massachusetts Democrat is widely considered one of labor's staunchest allies in Congress. So far, Mr. Kennedy has given no public indication of whether he will make raising the minimum wage a priority. But labor officials are convinced that the Senator will be a torchbearer for their cause. ''Senator Kennedy is very favorably disposed to dealing with the minimum wage,'' said Robert McGlotten, chief lobbyist of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organiztions. ''We'll give it quite a review this year,'' said Representative Augustus F. Hawkins, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. Mr. Hawkins called the current $3.35-an-hour wage ''terribly out of date.'' The case for raising the minimum wage has also been helped by the growing debate in Congress over how the Government can best help poor Americans find jobs and break the cycle of dependency on benefits. ''I think the recognition is quite widespread that if they don't raise the earnings of the working poor, then it puts a very strong disincentive for welfare people to move on to economic self-sufficiency,'' said Sar Levitan, director of the Center of Social Policy Studies at George Washington University. ''There's a good chance that Congress will move now'' on raising the minimum wage, Mr. Levitan added, ''because this is one important goal that can be achieved without exacerbating the deficit problem.'' Still, a rise in the minimum wage is far from certain. For one thing, Mr. Reagan has steadfastly objected to any such move. Speaking to a group of news editors in 1983, the President talked nostalgically of his own first job experience with a busy summer construction gang. ''There weren't any Government programs that made the employer have to hire an auditor and deduct from my paycheck for Social Security or other programs of that kind,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''He could just reach in his pocket every week at the end of the week and count out what he owed me and hand it to me in cash, and I wouldn't give up that experience I had for anything in the world.'' Congress last dealt with the minimum wage issue in 1977, when it passed a series of four increases, the last of which took effect Jan. 1, 1981, when the rate went to $3.35 an hour. The cost of living has since gone up by almost 20 percent. A person working full-time, year-round at $3.35 an hour will earn $6,968. The poverty level for a family of three was $8,573 in 1985, the latest year for which figures were available. In New York City, a family of three could have received $7,464 in basic welfare and food stamp benefits in 1985. Still, some economists and business leaders look askance at the rising clamor for increasing the minimum wage. One school of thought has long held that steadily increasing wages are a major cause of inflation. Moreover, these analysts say, when the minimum wage is raised, everything else being equal, a company's production costs will also increase. This increase may lead a company not to hire additional people or even to dismiss some of their current workers. ''There's no doubt that every time they raise the minimum wage, it's caused some unemployment,'' said Rick Berman, executive vice president of S & A Corporation, which operates several restaurant chains, including Steak & Ale. Raising the minimum wage, he said, would create a ''squeeze, in a sense.'' ''You have to pass the cost on,'' he explained, ''and thereby lose some of your customer base. And the ripple effect is that you lose some of your employment.'' The minimum wage may indeed cause a loss of jobs, some advocates say, but they see its positive aspects outweighing this loss by enhancing a poor person's self-esteem, for example, and increasing chances of breaking out of poverty. ''In most states, there's very little inducement for minimum wage workers to continue working,'' Mr. Levitan explained. ''Many of them do so because they prefer self-sufficiency to being on welfare.'' What of the Subminimum Wage Idea? What has worried advocates of raising the minimum wage in the past has been the Administration's push for a subminimum wage scale for youths. The legislation would let employers hire teen-agers for summer jobs at $2.50 an hour, rather than the $3.35 minimum. The idea of such a subminimum wage is backed by conservative economists who theorize that employers will create new jobs and that youths will get a valuable first taste of paid work. But both Administraion and Congressional officials say the outlook for that proposal is bleak. ''The subminimum wage now is just completely out - there's no support whatsoever for it,'' said Representative Hawkins. ''We don't have to worry about that anymore. We can now tackle the issue of raising the minimum wage on its merits.''

387-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Parrish, Phils to Talk
The Philadelphia Phillies will confer Friday with a representative of Lance Parrish to determine if the club is interested in signing the free-agent catcher. The Phillies have indicated an interest in signing Parrish if they are assured the back condition that ended his 1986 season on July 26 is not a chronic injury. Larry Shenk, a Phillies spokesman, said that Parrish's agent sent medical reports to the Phillies yesterday. Parrish, who hit .257 with 22 home runs and 62 runs batted in last season, has ended negotiations with the Tigers and declared that he will not play for Detroit again. At any rate, Parrish, under the rules of free agency, cannot sign with the Tigers until May 1 if he should change his mind. He rejected a $1.2 million Detroit offer and is reportedly seeking $1.8 million.

388-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Educational Bonds For Penn Offered
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Facilities Authority is offering $128.56 million of refunding bonds on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania through a group of underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation. A maximum yield of 6.741 percent is offered for 6 5/8 percent bonds due in 2017 at a price of 98 1/2. Yields on bonds with shorter maturities range from 3.75 percent for bonds due in 1988 to 4.9 percent in 1992, 5.75 percent in 1997 and 6.4 percent in 2002. The financing also includes 6 5/8 percent bonds due in 2007, priced at par. Proceeds of the bonds, rated AA by Standard & Poor's, will be used to refinance bonds sold in 1984 with an interest rate as high as 10 percent.

389-> CHARLES E. GOODELL, FORMER SENATOR, IS DEAD AT 60
Charles E. Goodell, who shifted from establishment Republican to critic of the Vietnam War and the Nixon White House as he moved from the House of Representatives to representing New York in the United States Senate, died yesterday in Washington. He was 60 years old and had been a Washington lawyer and lobbyist for the last 16 years. Mr. Goodell, appointed to the Senate in 1968 by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to succeed Robert F. Kennedy after his assassination, served only two years in the Senate, but he emerged as a leading critic of the Vietnam War and as a result, a leading target of President Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. Mr. Goodell joined liberal Democrats in sponsoring legislation to cut off money for the war effort, legislation that was essentially adopted five years later after he had left Congress. Before his appointment to the Senate he was a moderate to conservative member of the House of Representatives from Jamestown in western New York State. 'Radical Liberal' Two years later and now a liberal Republican with Mr. Agnew publicly castigating him as a ''radical liberal'' and even Mr. Rockefeller publicly questioning his ''undercutting'' of the President, Mr. Goodell sought a full six-year term. He failed largely because he split the moderate to liberal vote with Representative Richard L. Ottinger of Westchester, a Democrat, permitting James L. Buckley, running on the Conservative Party line, to win the Senate seat with less than a majority. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, referred to the heat and emotions of that campaign and that time when he said yesterday that Mr. Goodell was ''called to public service at a time of travail and tragedy.'' He added that ''I have not known a finer member of Congress.'' ''He fell on his sword politically,'' said a former aide, Michael C. Smith, a former city official and now a vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company. Another former aide, George Mitrovich, who had also worked for Mr. Kennedy, noted that there had been considerable criticism of the Goodell appointment originally because he was not a statewide figure but that Mr. Goodell proved to be ''a worthy successor of Senator Kennedy.'' One of 'Young Turks' As a member of the House for 10 years, he had been part of a group of Republican ''young Turks'' who helped oust Charles A. Halleck as House Republican leader and elect Gerald R. Ford as the new Republican leader. Later, Mr. Ford appointed him chairman of the Presidential Clemency Board, which reviewed in 1976 clemency applications by 21,729 Vietnam War resisters, including many who had fled to Canada and other countries to avoid conscription. After leaving the Senate and practicing law in New York Ciy for two years, Mr. Goodell became chairman of the board of DGA International, a public relations and lobbying concern. His second wife, Patricia Goldman, was another continuing link to government. She is vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Mr. Goodell was born and raised in Jamestown and was a varsity baseball and fooball player at both Jamestown High School and Williams College, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa, the national honorary society. He graduated from Yale Law School and received a master's degree at the Yale Graduate School of Government. He first went to Washington in 1954 as a Congressional liaison assistant at the Justice Department and then returned to Jamestown to practice law and eventually become the Chautauqua County Republican chairman in 1958. A year later, following the death of the veteran Representative Daniel A. Reed, he won a House seat in a special election. Survivors, in addition to his wife, include five sons, William R., Timothy B., Roger S., Michael C. and Jeffrey H. A memorial service is scheduled for tomorrow in Washington. The funeral and burial will be in Jamestown, but plans were incomplete yesterday.

Also on view are an oversized Dodo and Eaglet designed for ''Alice on Wonderland'' on Broadway and a detailed model set for the San Francisco Opera's production of ''Gotterdammerung.'' Many of the pieces are accompanied by photographs that explain how they were made and how they appeared when in use. The show was arranged by the Association of Theatrical Artists and Craftspeople, an organization of professionals who make such items. Members of the association will guide visitors through the exhibition from noon to 6 P.M. On view through May 2, free, from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Mondays and Thursdays, to 7 P.M. Tuesdays, from noon to 6 Wednesdays and Fridays, from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturdays. Information: 870-1630. NEW PATHS It is nearly 20 years since ''Cineprobe,'' which provides a forum and a screen for independent and avant-garde film makers, took root at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street. At these sessions, not only the film is shown but so is the maker, who usually speaks about the work with the audience. For the opening of its winter and spring season at 6:30 P.M. today, ''Cineprobe'' will feature the premiere of a 50-minute film made by Stan Brakhage, one of the best-known and most prolific of the independent makers. Mr. Brakhage is coming from his home in Colorado to disuss the work ''The Loom,'' which was inspired by Georges Melies, the French magician who took to the tricks of the new film techniques in the 1890's. Mr. Brakhage describes his film as ''a multiple-superimposition, hand-painted symphony of animal life on earth.'' He is also to introduce ''Jane,'' a 15-minute film made last year that serves as a portrait of his wife. The museum is open today from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission (no extra charge for films), $5; students, $3.50; over-65's, $2. Those who arrive after 6 P.M. do not pay to enter but do take their chances on the availability of tickets to the film at 6:30 P.M. Information: 708-9490.

391-> FAMILY NEAR SCENE DESCRIBES ATTACK ON BLACKS IN QUEENS
A family living close to the scene of the Dec. 20 attack in Howard Beach, Queens, has provided the first independent description of a gang of white youths beating a black man. In the account - the only one so far provided by someone other than the authorities or lawyers for victims - a woman and her husband told in an interview of watching from their living-room window as a black man ''staggered'' down the sidewalk near their home along Shore Parkway. She said she continued to watch as a group of whites chased and ''encircled'' the man, with two of them hitting him with sticks as he doubled over in pain. The woman's mother, after her daughter had gone to the telephone to dial the 911 police emergency number, came to the window and saw one man running across the parkway and another on the far side of the fence, with no attackers in sight, according to the mother. The window, on the second floor of the house, is about 80 feet from the scene of the beating. Concluding, she said, that the incident was ''over,'' she told her daughter to hang up the phone before she had spoken with anyone. Confronted by Gang The police have said a gang of white youths confronted three black men Dec. 20 in Howard Beach. One of the black men quickly managed to escape while the other two were chased to the scene of the beating. The woman who said she actually saw the whites beating the black man told the police that she would be unable to identify the assailants beyond describing them as ''young'' and ''dressed in typical clothes,'' such as jeans and ski jackets, she said. The four people in the living room at the time - the two women, the daughter's husband and her sister - said they knew nothing about a motorist striking and killing a black man running across Shore Parkway until the police knocked at their house at lunchtime the next day, during a check of the neighborhood, and informed them of the death. The woman who witnessed the beating said two police investigators talked with her ''for 15 or 20 minutes,'' as well as other family members. A police spokesman, Lieut. Edwin LeSchack, confirmed that the authorities had interviewed the family members in the course of checking the neighborhood and that they had described the beating but had said they could not identify the attackers. 'Not Surprising' Alice T. McGillion, the deputy police commissioner for public information, said it was ''not surprising or unusual'' that detectives would spend only 15 or 20 minutes interviewing the witnesses because those witnesses essentially had said they could not aid in the crucial process of identifying the assailants. She said the detectives had taken the phone number and address of the witnesses and could easily interview them again if they wanted more details of what happened in the attack. An agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation went to the house Monday and talked briefly to the mother. He said he would return to interview other family members who were not at home. The family, who asked not to be identified, spoke for an hour and half with a reporter who knocked on the door while canvassing the neighborhood. A spokesman for District Attorney John J. Santucci of Queens said last evening that two members of the family came to the District Attorney's office last night to be interviewed. Refused to Cooperate The spokesman, Thomas McCarthy, said he could not comment yet on the importance of the family's information for the case. However, he said, ''the more witnesses we get to fill in the details, we may be able, by a string of such witnesses, to paint enough of a picture that we could advance the case,'' even without a victim in the attack, Cedric Sandiford, who has refused to cooperate with them. On Tuesday, law-enforcement officials said they had found two witnesses, but added that the witnesses had been unable to identify any of the white assailants. Although the police received 22 calls on the 911 emergency number, 20 of those calls came from motorists who had seen the body of Mr. Sandiford's 23-year-old stepson, Michael Griffith, lying on Shore Parkway. The police say Mr. Griffith tried to cross the highway while fleeing the attackers. He was struck and killed by a car driven by Dominick Blum, a Family Court officer who has not been charged in the case. The police found Mr. Sandiford wandering, dazed, nearby. A companion of Mr. Griffith and Mr. Sandiford, Timothy Grimes, was said by the authorities to have run away from attackers several blocks east, on Cross Bay Boulevard, and thus was not a victim in the beating near Shore Parkway. The woman who saw the whites attack the black man is in her 20's and holds a Ph.D. She said she saw four attacking youths - ''In my heart, I visualize those four,'' she said. But, when asked again on this point, she said she had told police investigators that she had seen ''three to four youths'' and that ''I feel I better not change my story now.'' One Youth Released The police have charged three youths in the attack. A fourth who was arrested shortly after the incident was released. The beating witnessed by the woman occurred on a grassy knoll near the fence, on Shore Parkway - the extension of 156th Avenue - between 86th and 87th Streets. That spot corresponds to the place where the police have said a group of youths attacked Mr. Sandiford, 36 years old, with a bat, a tree limb and fists. The police say Mr. Sandiford was beaten while Mr. Griffith raced down to 85th Street, then doubled back to climb through a hole in the fence at 86th Street. Mr. Griffith was killed a short time later as he tried to cross the parkway on foot, according to the police. It is not clear whether the beating witnessed by the woman was the first or the second of what the police say were two separate beatings administered to Mr. Sandiford in the vicinity of Shore Parkway and 86th Street. Watching Television The woman said she was watching television with her mother as Friday night turned into Saturday morning, and was waiting for her husband to return from a late shift at his job in Nassau County. Her mother went to bed shortly after the ''Tonight'' show with Johnny Carson ended at 12:30. About 12:45, the woman said, her husband came home. Within a few minutes, both of them heard dogs barking loudly and looked outside the window. They saw a black man ''staggering down the sidewalk,'' which is on the south side of the street, the husband said. He said he ''thought the man was drunk,'' watched him weave between two parked cars, and then turned away from the window while his wife kept watching. Suddenly, she said, a group of white youths came running down the street. The black man, she said, backed up toward the fence, on the other side of the street, while the youths circled around him. Two of them were swinging sticks - one of them could have been a baseball bat, she said, and the other was ''T-shaped'' - while the other two youths remained within five feet of the man. The woman said she could not identify the victim, other than to say that he was black, because his face was down most of the time as he huddled to ward off the blows. ''I knew it didn't look like a game at that point,'' the woman said. 'They're Going to Kill Him' She said she then screamed - saying, ''My God, they're going to kill him,'' according to both her mother and her younger sister, who ran in from their bedrooms - and went to the telephone. The mother said that when she reached the window a few moments later she saw one man running across Shore Parkway. Another was on the same side of the fence as that man but was not running at that point, she said. In any event, she said, she did not believe that anyone was being chased anymore and she told her daughter that the incident she had seen was over and that there was no need to call the police. The daughter, who had continued to listen as the 911 line rang unanswered at least five times, then hung up the phone. A short time later, everyone in the house went to bed. Only the daughter said she actually saw the white youths beating the black victim, and none of the family members said they saw the youths running away afterward. It is not clear from police reports what direction they ran and whether the group stayed together. At House on Long Island Police investigators, searching the neighborhood the next day for witnesses, knocked on the front door of the family's house and spoke with the mother. The daughter and the husband were on Long Island at a house they are preparing to move into. Two police investigators drove out to the Long Island house and spoke with the woman and her husband. She described the attack but told them that she could provide only rudimentary descriptions of the assailants, she said. ''They were surprised that we said anything,'' the woman recalled. ''They said most people in Howard Beach just said they didn't want to talk at all.'' Ms. McGillion, the deputy police commissioner, said ''five rings is probably more than usual'' for 911 calls, but other police officials noted that Friday and Saturday nights are generally the busiest times for crime, and the number of rings could reflect many people calling in those hours. Saw Youths Running Separately, a 17-year-old who was driving home about 1:15 A.M. on Dec. 20, after the highway death, said in an interview that he saw a group of 12 to 15 youths congregated outside a house at 88th Street and 156th Avenue, about two blocks east of the beating site, plus ''four or five'' youths running from a point farther east toward the group. The teen-ager said that he saw two empty cars parked ''zigzag fashion,'' with their headlights on, at the site but that he could not identify any of the people there or the cars. Because he ''sensed trouble, and I didn't want trouble,'' he said, he drove the few blocks home and immediately went inside. The mother of the 17-year-old boy said they had no plans to tell the police of what he had seen because ''he certainly didn't see any crime.''

392-> Tool Orders Down 16% Last Year
New orders for American-made machine tools rose 2.6 percent in December from November, but orders for all of 1986 dropped 16 percent compared to 1985, according to a report to be released today by the National Machine Tool Builders' Association. The trade group and industry analysts attributed the overall decline to a sluggish economy and to uncertainties created by the new tax law, in particular by provisions eliminating the investment tax credit and lengthening depreciation schedules. ''By taking away tax credits and extending the life of the equipment, the Government has effectively discouraged companies from making capital investments,'' said Charles Pollock, a spokesman for the association. 22.3 Percent Drop in Month Although the tax changes did not go into effect until this year, many companies had anticipated them during the latter part of 1986, the association said. Ineed, tool orders fell 22.3 percent last month when compared with December 1985, according to the group's report. Machine tools are power-driven devices used to shape most metal parts, from tractor gears to vacuum cleaner motors. Their sales are an important indicator of capital spending by producers of metal products, mainly the automobile, aerospace and manufacturing industries. Machine tool orders bobbed up and down throughout 1986, totaling $2.13 billion, compared to $2.53 billion in 1985. Shipments of machine tools rose 1.3 percent, to $2.58 billion in 1986, compared to $2.55 billion the year before. Rise in Nontraditional Areas Mr. Pollock said that, in recent years, economic growth had occurred mainly in nontraditional manufacturing sectors such as consumer products and office equipment as well as in service areas. ''But it is the traditional sectors, which have not generally recovered from the recession, that represent the principal market for machine tools,'' he added. Andrew Silver, a machinery analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that there was excess capacity in many industries and that regular machine tool customers such as the automobile makers were simply not in need of new equipment. ''They are building cars with machinery they bought in the early 80's, and the demand is simply low at this time,'' he added. The association said that new orders for machine tools edged up to $136.1 million in December, from $132.6 million in November. Analysts said the modest gain was normal, the kind that occurs at the end of each quarter as customers anticipate production needs for the upcoming period. Orders for metal-cutting machines, which include lathes and boring mills, rose 3.3 percent, to $86.8 million, from $83.9 million in November. Metal-cutting machines account for about 75 percent of the industry. The association said that orders for metal-forming tools increased 1.3 percent, to $49.3 million, in December, from $48.7 million in November. Flat 1987 Predicted Analysts generally predicted that machine tool orders would remain flat for 1987, with possible modest gains resulting from recent trade developments affecting tool builders in competing countries. The industry has been battered by foreign competition, which now accounts for about half of the market in many sectors. In December, the Commerce Department put limits on machine tool imports from West Germany and Switzerland. These restrictions followed an earlier negotiation of voluntary agreements with Japan and Taiwan to limit their machine tool exports to the United States. Analysts expect the moves to raise orders by an average of $170 million a year. They noted, however, that there were substantial inventories of foreign machine tools in the United States and that many foreign competitors had established operations in this country.

394-> BEAN STAYS HOT ON CHILLY DAY
Andy Bean asked his wife to ship warm clothes to him two weeks from now, when the AT&T Pro-Am is to be played at the Pebble Beach, Calif., site that usually is cold. Bean never thought he would need the cold-weather gear until then because he anticipated no need for woolens at the two PGA Tour events in southern California and one in Phoenix before Pebble Beach. But temperatures went below freezing in the Palm Springs desert area Wednesday night and never got over 52 today as a chilly, steady rain fell during the second round of the 28th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Bean, a 6-foot-4-inch, long-hitting Floridian, found some long johns this morning and wore them under his summer-weight pants. He also wore his rain gear of jacket and pants. Thus bundled up on the Indian Wells course, he shot a four-under-par 68 to take the lead after two rounds of this 90-hole, five-day event. His total is 13-under 131. ''This is not what you'd expect to play in out here,'' Bean said. ''It's weather you'd expect at Pebble Beach or somewhere else in the country, but not here in the desert.'' Bean, who had a chance to shoot in the high 50's at Tamarisk Wednesday, settled for nine-under 63 there when he missed birdie putts on each of the last four holes. Upcoming for Bean is the new PGA West stadium course Friday. Then Bean will play Bermuda Dunes Saturday and be back on PGA West for the final day. The weather forced Bean to change his normal tactics on Indian Wells, one of the shortest courses on the PGA Tour at less than 6,500 yards. For the first time in his career, he laid up on the 501-yard 18th hole, a short par 5 for such a long hitter. ''I just wanted to put the ball out on the fairway, so I laid up off the tee with a three wood at 18,'' Bean said. But that came long after Bean had successfully attacked the course on the front nine with two birds and one eagle in the first five holes. The eagle came at the 517-yard fifth where he had no intention of laying up. He used a driver and three wood to get within 5 feet of the hole and then sank the putt for an eagle 3. But the rains became stronger, the wind picked up and it became colder as the day progressed. Bernhard Langer of West Germany, who also played Indian Wells today and shot 66, moved into the second-place spot at 10-under 134. David Edwards, who led after his first round on Indian Wells, played PGA West today and dropped to a third-place tie. His double-bogey 6 at 18 gave him a two-over 74 for 135, which tied him with Ed Fiori and Willie Wood. Bean's Tamarisk course record of 63 Wednesday came after he started with three consecutive birds. Another birdie on his front nine and an eagle and three birds on the back gave him a chance to break 60. But he missed birdie putts of 2, 18, 6 and 4 feet on the last four holes. He also three-putted the 13th.

396-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; MARA: A GRAND OLD NAME AGAIN
In their frustration of other years, many Giants fans thought the co-owners didn't want to win and the quarterback didn't know how to win. But as the Super Bowl XXI champions, the Giants indeed are the giants of pro football now. And after three decades, again. For weeks, doubters wondered if the Giants would turn out to be the Cubs or the Red Sox of pro football. Get to the playoffs or the Super Bowl and collapse in the clutch. But for those who were trying to compare the Giants' success to a baseball scenario, consider that when these Giants last lost a game, in Seattle on Oct. 19, the Mets were taking batting practice before the second of the three World Series' games they would lose. Unlike the Mets in their sixth game, the Giants didn't need a miracle rally to dominate the Denver Broncos, 39-20. Merely an explosive 30-point second half. As another one-sided Super Bowl ended, cynics were complaining that, ''The first half was all right, but after that it wasn't much.'' But every Giant loyalist thought the second half was even better. Especially Wellington Mara, who accepted the Super Bowl trophy named for the late Vince Lombardi, his onetime Fordham classmate. ''It was great,'' the 70-year-old Giants' president was saying yesterday, ''but I tried to be professional about it and remember it was great to win our other championships too.'' Hardly a man is now alive who watched the Giants win three previous National Football League championships in 1934, 1938 and 1956, but Wellington Mara did. For him, this title isn't that much different but the Super Bowl hoopla is. ''To the people on the inside of the organization, it's just as big as it was back then,'' he said. ''But there's more outside pressures now that you try to shield the players from.'' As a traditionalist, Wellington Mara would prefer to keep it simple. And that's how he tried to operate the Giants organization, simply. But his family feud with his nephew, Tim, provoked the hiring of George Young as the general manager and, more importantly, as the traffic cop who pointed the Giants in the right direction. But even as the Giants improved, some fans had two pet peeves about the Maras. One, with a sold-out Giants Stadium and a fat TV contract, the Maras didn't care if the team won. Two, they were cheap. In actuality, nobody cared more about winning than the co-owners, especially Wellington Mara, for whom the Giants have been a life's work. And if both Maras hadn't cared about winning, they would have sold the club for millions. As for the cheap rap, Joe Morris and Phil Simms are earning the millions they deserve, and when Lawrence Taylor was kidnapped by Donald Trump for future delivery to the United States Football League, the Maras never hesitated to come up with millions in ransom. Of those few players who were deemed expendable after a contract dispute, none has done much with another team. In pro football, Mara is a grand old name again. And while celebrating with two beers at the Giants' team party here Sunday night, Wellington chatted with several Giants alumni. ''Charlie Conerly,'' he said, referring to the quarterback of the 1956 championship team, ''told me, 'I was so into that game, I was so excited.' and Ken Kavanaugh, who coached the receivers on that 1956 team, asked me, 'Where is Simms, I've got to tell him how great he was.' ''Conerly and Y. A. Tittle had big games for us, but maybe not in that big a game. I wouldn't trade Simms for any quarterback in the game. For our team, in our environment, he's the perfect quarterback. He's tough, maybe strong is the better word. He's strong mentally, physically and spirtually.'' Against the Broncos during the season, Simms's last-minute passes positioned Raul Allegre's field goal for a 19-16 victory. ''But out here,'' Simms said, ''all we heard was how our offense didn't score a touchdown against them. It was a challenge.'' In answering that challenge, Simms completed 22 of 25 passes for 268 yards and three touchdowns. He also completed a 44-yard flea-flicker pass to Phil McConkey to position another touchdown and scrambled 22 yards to set up the final touchdown. ''I asked the coaches to get me in the game early,'' Simms said. ''I'd been in a good groove all week in practice. I knew if I hit a few passes right away, it'd get me going.'' On defense, the Giants were going too hard right away. Too undisciplined, too many mistakes. But perhaps that was an over-reaction to what Parcells had preached Friday at practice. ''I told them,'' Parcells recalled, ' ''Don't tell me that the Super Bowl guarantees that you'll play hard. I've seen some teams that didn't play hard in the Super Bowl, so play hard.' '' Now, of course, the question is: Can the Giants repeat as Super Bowl champions? It won't be easy, as the Chicago Bears learned. But the Giants' chances will depend on their coaching staff remaining together and on injuries. The Bears' defensive coach, Buddy Ryan, moved to the Philadelphia Eagles as head coach, Jim McMahon needed shoulder surgery, and the Bears' president, Mike McCaskey, dismissed Jerry Vainisi, the general manager. Even at their Super Bowl party, the Maras didn't talk to each other. But as long as they talk to George Young, the Giants will have a chance to repeat.

397-> If Truman Had Dealt With the Contras
Any hope that revelation of its folly in Iran might induce the Administration to abandon its equally ill-conceived policy in Nicaragua has gone quickly aglimmering. Administration officials are again insisting that aiding the contras is our only hope. The President can be expected to join in tonight, in his State of the Union Message, doubtless again describing the contras as the only thing standing between us and the Communist hordes. Some contra supporters even go so far as to suggest that if Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy were alive, this would be their policy as well. Aiding the contras, their supporters say, is of a piece with the Truman Doctrine. Bunk. Aiding the contras is a timorous and ineffective policy that has accomplished nothing in more than five years of trying. And it would have been rejected out of hand by Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and by President Kennedy as well, once he had been burned at the Bay of Pigs. The United States has legitimate security concerns in Nicaragua. We want all Soviet and Cuban military personnel sent home. We do not want the establishment of Soviet or Cuban military bases, or the introduction of sophisticated weaponry that might threaten nearby sea lanes and the Panama Canal. But present policy comes to grips with none of that. There is a greater Soviet presence in Nicaragua today than before we started the contra war. Nor does present policy in any way help to preserve political pluralism in Nicaragua. Quite the contrary, the war has brought the further curtailment of democratic processes and a harsher life for most Nicaraguans. The Sandinista Government has just promulgated a new Constitution that provides for civil and political liberties. It immediately curtailed these freedoms but said they would all be restored were it not for the war. Rather than testing Managua's word, we continue the war. In truth, of course, the Administration's aim is to overthrow the Sandinista Government. But that objective is well beyond its reach. The contras are vastly inferior to the Sandinista Army. They are led by men who once belonged to the National Guard of Anastasio Somoza Debayle and have been considerably tainted by their association with the Central Intelligence Agency. They haven't a chance of gaining popular support in Nicaragua and thus not a chance of winning the war. Meanwhile, legitimate United States security concerns are left unattended. Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy would have been appalled by this Administration's conduct. Truman, who had a deep commitment to the rule of law, felt that ''secrecy and a free, democratic government don't mix.'' His doctrine was aimed at containing Communism by aiding recognized governments to defend themselves -and with aid fully approved by Congress. No wimp was Harry, but neither was he a bully. He did not hesitate to go to South Korea's defense in 1950. But it was not he who had the C.I.A. overthrow the Government of Guatemala in 1954. That was President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. One can imagine Truman's acerbic reaction to today's policy - a policy that has brought us to illegally mine Nicaraguan harbors, to write assassination manuals to reject the jurisdiction of the World Court. A fine position, he would have said, for a nation supposedly dedicated to strengthening the rule of law. What would he have done instead? Surely, he would not have left the United States's security interests dangling from some contra's ammo belt; rather, he would have placed them in the strong hands of the United States itself. He would have said to the Sandinistas: ''Boys, we may not like or trust one another, but we can get along if you respect my security concerns. Let's sit down and sign a verifiable agreement under which you promise to send all those Soviet and Cuban soldiers home and guarantee not to let them set up any bases. You must also stop importing arms and halt any aid you may be giving to guerrillas in neighboring countries. If you abide by that agreement, we'll get along. Violate it, and the full might of the United States will fall on you.'' And Kennedy? What would he have done? Certainly not aid the contras -at least not after his painful defeat at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. He'd had his fill of illegal proxy armies, and the following year he ended the missile crisis with a sensible negotiated agreement that removed any security threat to the United States. He made clear that the strength of our great nation stood behind that understanding - and the Russians and Cubans therefore had to take it seriously and have never violated it. Truman's way, Kennedy's way, would have been honorable, effective and consistent with our basic values. The Reagan Administration's way both defies international law and fails to protect our legitimate security interests. In this, it is both shameful and a dereliction of duty.

398-> MACMILLAN TO DROP FICTION AND FOCUS ON TEXTBOOKS
The president of Macmillan's General Books Division has acknowledged that the 91-year-old house will no longer publish fiction or general nonfiction books. ''We are redirecting the Macmillan line to more specific markets,'' Bruno A. Quinson, the division's president, said Tuesday. ''It will continue to publish religious books, sports, textbooks, reference and science.'' Hillel Black will remain as publisher of adult books for Macmillan Publishing, which together with Charles Scribner's Sons and Atheneum Publishers make up the major publishing divisions of Macmillan Inc. But publishing sources say that he is winding up Macmillan's general trade publishing program and that Macmillan editors now report to Mr. Quinson. Mr. Black would not discuss the report yesterday, except to say, ''I am presently publisher, and my plans are to continue in the mainstream of publishing.'' At the same time, Macmillan Inc. will try to rejuvenate the Scribner's imprint, which, despite an occasional best seller, is no longer regarded as a major trade publisher. ''Scribner's is one of the great imprints in general book publishing, and it's a tremendous asset,'' Mr. Quinson said. ''It's going to be aggressive in the pursuit of books.'' After the recent resignation of Mildred Marmur as president and publisher of Scribner's, Robert Stewart, formerly special-projects editor at Macmillan, was named editor in chief of Scribner's. Mr. Quinson said yesterday there were no plans to replace Ms. Marmur. Novels and general nonfiction books already signed up by Macmillan, he said, will be published under the Scribner's imprint. Mr. Quinson also said no changes were planned in Atheneum's program of publishing fiction and general nonfiction.

399-> CUOMO IS SAID TO BE PLANNING SHIFT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEF
Administration officials said today that Governor Cuomo would replace his Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, Henry G. Williams, who has come under heavy criticism from environmental groups for what they have said is his lax enforcement of state environmental laws. Asked about the change, Governor Cuomo denied that he was unhappy with Mr. Williams's performance. But he confirmed that ''we are considering submitting Hank's name'' to fill one of six vacancies on the state Public Service Commission. Such an appointment, Mr. Cuomo said, would give Mr. Williams ''six years of guaranteed public service under relatively comfortable circumstances, given the maelstrom he's been through.'' In taking a position on the Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities throughout the state, Mr. Williams would accept an $11,356 cut in pay from his current commissioner's salary of $83,407 a year. Mr. Williams said today that he knew he was being considered for appointment to the utilities board, but declined to comment further. The prospect that Mr. Williams would be replaced was praised by many environmentalists, who said they hoped it would signal a new state emphasis on conservation issues. ''There has been a real lack of vision and urgency on environmental-protection issues, and that responsibility sits squarely with the Governor and Hank Williams,'' said Judith Enck, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby, a statewide coalition of environmental groups. ''The Governor's rhetoric has been great, but now we hope the policies will start to catch up with the rhetoric.'' Administration officials privately confirmed that the leading contender for the post is J. Langdon Marsh, the second-ranking official in the environmental agency.

400-> KOOKABURRA III WILL DEFEND CUP
Alan Bond spent nearly a decade and millions of his own dollars trying to win the America's Cup for Australia before finally succeeding in 1983. Now he has lost his chance to defend it. Bond's Australia IV was beaten today by Kevin Parry's Kookaburra III by 55 seconds and was eliminated from the defender's final without winning a race in the five-of-nine-race series. Iain Murray, the skipper of Kookaburra III, will now defend the cup against Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes in a four-of-seven-race series beginning Jan. 31. ''I think it's fair to say we weren't back on the pace as we should have been,'' Bond said today about his boat's performance in the final. ''But there wasn't a great deal in it. The races themselves show how close these boats have been during the whole regatta.'' Bond congratulated the Kookaburra III crew at a post-race reception, and then added a warning: ''We brought the cup here. Don't you lose it.'' Longtime Rivals The admonition rankled Parry, who like Bond, is a multimillionaire businessman. Parry and Bond have been rivals for years. Parry lashed out at Bond after first praising him for bringing the cup to Australia. He accused Bond of trying to put pressure on the Kookaburra team to keep the cup, or face Bond for failing to do so. ''We're out here to do our best,'' Parry told Bond at a post-race news conference. ''And we're not prepared to put up with any needling or any spite. The fact that you weren't good enough to provide the competition is just a fact of life.'' Bond resisted a counterattack. Instead, he repeated a commitment made earlier this month to offer his syndicate's support to Parry. Colin Beashel, the skipper of Australia IV, lost today's race at the start by boxing himself in behind the race committee's boat. Peter Gilmour, Kookaburra III's starting helmsman, took advantage of the situation by forcing Beashel to tack under the stern of the committee boat and away from the start line. Gilmour swung Kookaburra III up to the line and crossed 36 seconds ahead of Australia IV. Beashel and his crew failed to get within four boat lengths of Kookaburra III after that. Winds were moderate at 12-14 knots, and considerably lighter than the gusty conditions of the last few days. Winner Tours Harbor After the race, Kookaburra III made two triumphant swings through Fremantle's harbor. More than 40 team members, wearing yellow and white crew shirts, scrambled aboard Kookaburra III from dinghies that ran alongside the winning 12-Meter. A Kookaburra is an Australian kingfisher that has an abrupt, loud cry suggestive of loud laughter. The scene at the Royal Perth Yacht Club's annex in Fremantle was reminiscent of the celebrations for defenses during the New York Yacht Club's 132-year stewardship of the cup. Australia IV slipped alongside the club's dock and waited for Kookaburra III to raft alongside. At the foot of their bows was a floating dock set up with white linen tablecloths and glasses of champagne. More than 20 officials of the Royal Perth, dressed in white shirts with epaulets and white summer slacks, gathered to congratulate the crews who were marooned six feet offshore on their respective sailboats. Missing from the Perth contingent were the straw hats and navy-blue blazers that members of the New York Yacht Club wore during the decades when the defender was one of their boats. Dyer Jones Does Honors There was, however, one blue blazer. It belonged to Dyer Jones, rear commodore of the New York Yacht Club, who was there to pass on the Chandler Hovey Bowl, which New York had traditionally given to the boat selected as the defender, to Parry and his Kookaburra III crew. The Bond and Parry crews stood placidly on their boats, taking swigs of champagne from opened bottles that were being passed around in lieu of the glasses on shore. Australia IV gave the Kookaburras a ''hip, hip hooray'' and was done with it. ''Today is a character-building day for us,'' said Warren Jones, Bond's syndicate director. ''I guess we've tasted and savored victory, and it's a poor Australian that can't also taste and savor defeat. ''Within our group, we have a marvelous team of young men who I believe will come out of this regatta as men - and a lot of them came to us as boys. A 12-Meter campaign that takes three years is probably the closest thing in Australia to national service. When we stop and reflect, I think as individuals, we've gained tremendously. There's a lot of fun in winning, but it isn't everything.'' Bond a Central Figure Bond has been a central figure in America's Cup competition since 1974 when he made his first challenge with Southern Cross. He was back in 1977 and 1980 with Australia I. He built Australia III, a radical new boat with a winged keel, for 1983 and then trailing, 3-1, against Conner and Liberty, saw his dream succeed as John Bertrand won three straight races to win the America's Cup.

Phil McConkey, the Giants' wide receiver, appeared briefly on television after the Super Bowl game today, handing a gun to a security officer. According to a spokesman for the police, McConkey was returning a policeman's pistol that had fallen. ''At the end of the game, one of our officers was struggling with an individual who had jumped out onto the field,'' said Sgt. Phil McWade. ''The officer went to the ground and his gun came out. ''The football player picked it up and handed it to a security guard, who then returned it to our officers.''

404-> DANCE: DAVID PARSONS AND FRIENDS AT THE JOYCE
DAVID PARSONS, a dreamboat of a dancer in Paul Taylor's company - he has speed, fluency, wit, looks, charm - has taken to choreography in recent years. Wednesday night's program at the Joyce Theater, as part of the ''Joyce Sampler'' series, offered the first major overview of the works he has created since 1982. Excellent dancers attract excellent dancers - if this is not a law in some treatise, it is a hypothesis borne out by the outstanding guest artists on display here. Martine van Hamel and Clark Tippet are seen in the duet ''Walk This Way,'' which Mr. Parsons choreographed for them last year at American Ballet Theater; Gary Chryst, once a star of the supposedly starless Joffrey Ballet, re-creates ''Caught,'' Mr. Parsons' astounding strobe-light solo as initially seen with the Feld Ballet; Daniel Ezralow, an exciting dancer who came to public notice in the Taylor company, appears in the 1982 ''Brothers'' with the choreographer. The remainder of the program includes a premiere, ''Tightwire,'' as well as ''The Envelope'' and ''The Uninvited.'' The dancers in these pieces are amazingly polished performers for a small new group -able, moreover, to toss off the difficult Taylorisms at the root of Mr. Parsons' style with flair and precision. ''Tightwire'' has a strange purifying effect - its very subject seems to be group therapy. The eight dancers (Elizabeth Benjamin, Kristen Borg, Frey Faust, Gail Gilbert, Christopher Hoskins, Dianne Howarth, Mr. Parsons and Denise Roberts) act out some common frustrations via a contemporary ritual. They are first seen in a tense posture, shoulders raised, palms on thighs. The backdrop sports some crossed black brush strokes, visible amid darkness. At the end, Howell Binkley's lighting turns these into white beams and the dancers join hands. This is perhaps too schematic an outline of ''Tightwire,'' but certainly the way people change - or are changed - is a concern here. The point is cleverly made each time a movement is repeated but varied in speed or intensity. The initial walk to the rear or the front of the stage by the dancers turns into a more frantic run. A woman who is alone is warmly embraced by Mr. Hoskins but this caring aspect is completely dissipated as others come in to hug her mechanically and quickly. Two men walking side by side in comradely fashion become competitive - as a simple sequence becomes a race. Some performers get worked up in an autoerotic fantasy, women yell at each other. One seems possessed amid a group orgy of scissor jumps. Other people's problems can be tedious. But ''Tightwire'' (danced in silence in Judy Wirkula's tights with leaflike markings) manages to stay on the right side of this threshold. ''The Uninvited'' (1985), to Peter Gabriel's art-rock music, has Mr. Faust apparently working out a sexual fantasy. A woman enters and kneels. Mr. Faust, a remarkably limber dancer, seems to shatter before our eyes as he merely touches the vision's hand. Mr. Parsons is obviously still developing his content - his ideas occasionally look undeveloped. Miss van Hamel and Mr. Tippet are lovers who miss connections until the end but somehow their joke wears thin. The sibling rivalry in ''Brothers'' works, however, because the relationship changes with the movement quality. It may be a gimmick for a strobe light to catch Mr. Chryst in midair and make him look as if his feet never touch the ground, but it is a gimmick by a choreographer who knows how to use movement. That is Mr. Parsons at his best.

405-> PENTAGON OFFICIAL, LIKED TO CONTRA AID, TO RETIRE
The Defense Department's senior official concerned with Central American affairs, Nestor D. Sanchez, will leave office on Jan. 31 amid reports from Administration and Congressional sources that investigators are questioning the nature of his role in the Iran-contra affair. Robert Sims, the Defense Department spokesman, said today that there was ''nothing unusual at all'' about the retirement, adding ''he told me he just wants to go home to live on his farm in Leesburg,'' Va. But some other Defense Department officials said Mr. Sanchez was being eased out because the investigations of the controversy were getting uncomfortably close to his activities. So far, the Pentagon has not been linked to the controversy in any major way. Mr. Sims and some other Pentagon officials said Mr. Sanchez, who will be 60 this year, was planning to retire anyway. Mr. Sims added that Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger is ''sorry to see him go'' and plans to ''commend his service.'' 'Just a Matter of When' In an interview this evening, Mr. Sanchez said he was not surprised at speculation that he was leaving office because of the investigations. But he added: ''I've been talking about retiring for some time, and it's just a matter of when. No time's a good time. But I have some personal matters that I must attend to.'' He added that although he would not be surprised if he is called as a witness in the Iran-contra inquiries, no one has called him yet. He said he had not been involved in anything improper. Mr. Sanchez was a Central Intelligence Agency officer for 30 years before becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs in 1981. He was responsible for formulating Defense Department positions on Central American policy, and presented those positions as its representative at interagency meetings that included officials from the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Monitoring of Aid Effort Officials said Mr. Sanchez monitored official and unofficial military aid to the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua known as contras, including private shipments that had significant Government involvement during the period that Congress prohibited direct military assistance. After a flight with arms for the contras was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, officials said Mr. Sanchez was instrumental in planting a false report that was widely reported by American news organizations, asserting that the aircraft was on a private mission and had no Government connection. Only one member of the plane's three-man crew, Eugene Hasenfus, survived. The Sandinista Government convicted Mr. Hasenfus of espionage but released him last month. Mr. Sanchez acknowledged that he and others in Government were aware of the covert arms shipments but added ''I didn't know the origin of them.'' Report of Cover Story As part of the cover story devised after the crash, officials said, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Elliott Abrams, intended to ask Gen. John K. Singlaub, a retired officer who was then in the Philippines, to take responsibility for the plane. General Singlaub, who was involved in various covert operations while in the Army, had more recently organized and helped to finance several legal, open shipments of nonlethal supplies to the contras. The reports about General Singlaub's purported involvement appeared in print, however, before Mr. Abrams could reach him, the officials said. Mr. Abrams has denied this account. After he returned to the United States, the general held a news conference in Washington and angrily denied any involvement with the flight. Numerous officials said Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force officer, had arranged with associates for the flight in which Mr. Hasenfus was shot down. General Secord is also under investigation. Relationship to Retired Officers Pentagon officials as well as acquaintances of Mr. Sanchez outside the Government said he had monitored the operations of both General Singlaub and General Secord, but they asserted that he had not directed them. In other activities, Mr. Sanchez appeared to have been caught in a dispute between his former associates at the C.I.A. and his present colleagues in the Defense Department over how to train the contras in guerrilla operations and what sort of strategy they should adopt. The C.I.A., according to Pentagon officials, wanted to train the contras in conventional infantry tactics and to persuade them to fight decisive engagements with Sandinista forces with the intention of seizing territory and forming a provisional government. In contrast, the officials said, military officers argued that the contras were so poorly led and equipped that they would have little chance against the more numerous, better trained Sandinistas. For the moment, the officials said, the C.I.A. has had the better of the argument, and the Defense Department has been relegated to a supporting role.

406-> NEW YORK AREA COSTS UP 2.6% IN '86
Consumer prices in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area rose 2.6 percent in 1986, the smallest annual increase since 1967, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. In 1985, prices in the area rose 4.2 percent, according to Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the bureau. In December, consumer prices in the region climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, paced by a slight gain in energy prices. The dominant factor in 1986 was energy prices, which declined sharply for most of the year, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. Energy prices were down 21 percent from December 1985, with prices of residential fuel oil and gasoline down about 30 percent. The price of electricity declined 4.6 percent and natural gas, 8.4 percent. For the year, the cost of medical care rose 10.8 percent, compared with 5.7 percent in 1985. Grocery store food prices had the sharpest increase in six years, rising 4.7 percent, compared with 2.9 percent in 1985. The cost of public transportation rose at a faster pace in 1986, 6.5 percent, compared with 1.5 percent in 1985, in part reflecting a rise in New York City transit fares last January. For December, the costs of residential fuel and utilities rose three-tenths of 1 percent as higher fuel oil costs were partly offset by lower natural gas charges. Increases in the cost of shelter and medical care also contributed to the December increase. The cost of medical care rose a sharp 1.3 percent, and the housing index was up seven-tenths of 1 percent. Shelter costs rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, as rents and homeowners' costs rose. Costs of private transportation edged up two-tenths of 1 percent, while public transportation increased six-tenths of 1 percent. Grocery store food prices increased two-tenths of 1 percent, led by a 1 percent gain in the price of meats, poultry and fish. Cereals and bakery products rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, and dairy products were up four-tenths of 1 percent. But the cost of fruits and vegetables posted a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent. The food and beverage index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in December, reflecting increases of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the costs of both restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages. The cost of apparel, which typically declines in December, edged down three-tenths of 1 percent.

407-> ACTOR AND 71 OTHER PROTESTERS ARRESTED AT NUCLEAR TEST SITE
The actor Martin Sheen and 71 other antinuclear protesters were arrested at the Nevada Test Site on Tuesday in a demonstration marking the 36th anniversary of the first nuclear test there. One protester knelt in front of a bus carrying workers to the test site and poured red fluid from a baby's bottle. As sheriff's deputies lifted her from the road she screamed: ''This is the blood of the future! This is the blood of our children!'' More than 200 protesters were at the demonstration, according to security guards. Many were arrested when they tried to block cars and buses carrying workers to the 1,350 square-mile site, Jim Boyer, a spokesman for the United States Department of Energy, said. Others were arrested for trespassing when they jumped a fence along a road leading to the gate of the test site, according to Mr. Boyer. Traffic into the site was blocked briefly while arrests were made, he said. Charge Filed Against Sheen Mr. Sheen was charged with threatening to commit a crime against a person or property, said Karen Gray, clerk of the Nye County Justice Court. Justice of the Peace Bill Sullivan gave Mr. Sheen 48 hours to post a $5,000 bond and released him. Ms. Gray said a warrant for the actor's arrest was issued Monday after Mr. Sheen said in a television interview that he planned to demonstrate at the site. According to a transcript of the interview, Mr. Sheen said he would ''hopefully commit civil disobedience,'' Ms. Gray said. Under state law, anyone who threatens to commit a crime and then goes to the scene can be arrested and held on $5,000 cash bond, Mr. Boyer said. Members of the antinuclear group say they plan another demonstration at the gates Feb. 5, when the first United States test of 1987 is planned. The Soviet Union announced a unilateral moratorium on testing in August of 1985 but said it would end the moratorium after the first United States test in 1987.

410-> FLUENT COSMOPOLITES CAN'T FIND A JOB
To the Editor: The movement to bolster training for American students in foreign languages and international affairs (Fred Hechinger's ''About Education'' column, Jan. 13) makes sense on the face of it. It is also, not incidentally, in step with the politically popular yet nebulous goal of restoring United States competitiveness. However, as someone who studied foreign languages and affairs, both European and Asian, I have grave doubts about this new educational fad. Students base choices of courses and majors on perceptions of the career prospects that await them after graduation. If the popularity of international studies and foreign language programs has declined over the last two decades, as I believe it has, it is because students are concerned about the paucity of jobs for graduates with these degrees. This concern is well founded. I receive approximately two resumes a week from graduates of international affairs programs who are looking for positions that will draw on their credentials. Many have graduated from first-rate schools, are fluent in at least one foreign language and are attractive job candidates. The demand for them is dismally small, and it is difficult to believe that increasing the supply is going to improve the situation.

411-> PUBLIC BLAMES NASA OFFICIALS
One year after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the American people blame officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the disaster, rather than the scientists and engineers who developed the craft's technology, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. The 1,590 adults interviewed by telephone Jan. 18-21 were asked who was more at fault, and 60 percent of them said NASA officials, while 18 percent blamed the scientists and engineers. Eight percent blamed both, and 3 percent blamed neither, while the rest had no answer. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The poll also found continuing though somewhat diminished public support for the shuttle program. Sixty-six percent said the program was worth continuing despite its costs and risks while 28 percent said it was not. In a Times/ CBS News Poll taken a few days after the explosion one year ago today, 80 percent said the program was worth continuing and 14 percent said it was not. But the survey found slightly reduced support for spending on space programs as against a year ago. Forty-six percent of the public said too much money was now being spent on space, 12 percent said too little was being spent and 35 percent said about the right amount was going for space. In the January 1986 Times/CBS News Poll, 40 percent said too much was being spent, 12 percent said too little and 37 percent said about the right amount was being spent. In the latest poll, women were much less supportive of the program than men were. Fifty-six percent of women, but just 34 percent of men, said that too much money was being spent on space. And while 76 percent of men said the shuttle program was worth continuing, only 56 percent of women did. Whites were more likely to support the program than blacks. While 43 percent of whites said too much money was being spent on space, 61 percent of blacks did. Similarly, 68 percent of whites but only 46 percent of blacks said the shuttle program was worth continuing.

412-> Music Noted in Brief; Nina Beilina Performs In a Varied Program
Nina Beilina's violin recital at Alice Tully Hall Wednesday night was - either by design or accident - rarely devoted to the beauty of the instrument or the virtues of virtuosity. Miss Beilina's program was largely somber, often dense with complexity, even grim. She began with an E-minor sonata with organ attributed to Bach, the relentlessly devious melodic directions of which tested her bowing technique almost beyond its capabilities. The Shostakovich Violin and Piano Sonata (Op. 134) that followed was a darkly eloquent testament to this most unhappy of 20th-century composers. Most satisfying was Marc Kopytman's ''Dedication,'' a piece for solo violin in memory of the conductor Israel Chudnovsky, Miss Beilina's late husband. Played beautifully here, it re-creates the human voice in mourning with startling effectiveness. The swaying, sliding Jewish lament -even to the vocal cracking - is most imaginatively done. Miss Beilina also played an arrangement of the Falla ''Suite Populaire Espagnole'' and Sarasate's ''Caprice Basque.'' Falla's ''Nana'' movement was touching, but much of this music's extroversion seemed cramped by the violin. The Sarasate seemed dutifully virtuosic yet miles removed from Miss Beilina's true temperament and talents. Michele Levin was the highly musical pianist, while Gerald Ranck's organ registrations in the Bach were deft and colorful.

413-> Why We Shouldn't Go Metric McCarran-Walter Excludes Hundreds
To the Editor: The often-repeated assurance that United States industry could increase exports and reduce its foreign-trade deficit by conversion to one of the metric systems ignores the obvious fact that our materials, labor and other costs are among the world's highest, making our prices noncompetitive in foreign markets. Conversion to metric adds more cost for redesign, retooling, worker retraining, dockage, shipping and insurance, tariffs designed to protect foreign industry and employment, plus five-percenters. Nevertheless we are assured that foreign customers will pay far higher prices for U.S. products, merely because they are metric, than for similar products made in their own countries. Extremely unlikely. General Motors is one of the first and largest United States companies to convert to metric. Instead of its exports booming, as assured, G.M. recently announced it will close 11 plants, affecting 29,000 workers, for starters, with more to come. Later, G.M. said 1,300 more workers would be permanently laid off at its year-old Buick plant, thus torpedoing the perverse metric export hoax. The Department of Commerce reported in 1971 that the notion that metric conversion will increase exports is ''ill founded.'' If metric exports were at all feasible, that would have occurred long ago. The export argument, the one most often used, must be considered the trump card of conversion advocates, which shows a lack of valid reasons for conversion. There is even less incentive to convert for domestic consumption. Most metric products purchased in this country are forced upon us with little or no choice. Electric light bulbs are one example of countless thousands of standardized domestic products. No sane manufacturer would even consider making light bulbs having metric screw threads because they would not fit in any of the millions of existing sockets. Naturally the same applies to almost everything we have in place. In the United States metric is a misfit system with no proved benefits. WM. BATCHELDER Chester, Vt., Jan. 16, 1987

415-> METRO DATELINES; Westchester Fills Top Correction Post
The warden of Westchester County's correctional institutions for 14 years, Norwood E. Jackson, was named yesterday by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke to be Commissioner of Corrections. Mr. Jackson, who is black, becomes the first member of a minority group to hold cabinet-level rank in the Westchester government. The 52-year-old appointee, who recently completed 27 years of active and reserve duty with the Army Correctional and Military Police Services, had been the commanding officer of the largest correctional center in Korea. He also played football briefly with the Cleveland Browns. Mr. O'Rourke said 50 applicants from a dozen states had sought the $65,000-a-year post. Mr. Jackson will take over a correctional system with an average daily inmate population of 1,100 in the County Jail, which holds inmates awaiting trial, sentencing or transfer; the County Penitentiary, for those serving sentences of one year or less, and the Women's Correctional Unit.

419-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Aide Quits Iran Panel
The executive director of the House committee investigating the Iran-contra arms affair, John P. O'Hara, has resigned, just a few weeks after accepting the post. Mr. O'Hara was to have been in charge of hiring staff for the committee and scheduling hearings. Several people close to the committee said they understood Mr. O'Hara was dissatisfied with restrictions placed on his authority. But a spokesman for the committee's chairman, Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said Mr. O'Hara had quit because he could not arrange an acceptable leave of absence with Flying Tiger Airline, where he is director of corporate security. Mr. O'Hara joined Flying Tiger last year after serving as a Congressional aide for nearly 25 years. Mr. O'Hara did not return calls made yesterday to his Los Angeles office. Meantime, the committee has had trouble finding office space. Initially, the panel's staff was to be situated in a building about two blocks from the Capitol. But Mr. Hamilton's spokesman said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had said that it would be difficult to install proper security protections in the building. As of now, the committee's chief counsel, John W. Nields Jr., is working out of an office on the fourth floor of the Capitol.

420-> STEP BY STEP; BEFORE BROILING A FOWL
ONE of the quickest midweek dinners busy working people can make is broiled chicken, perhaps with a fresh herb and mustard glaze or a coating of seasoned bread crumbs. The chicken will cook more evenly and have a uniformly crisp skin if you follow the technique here for splitting and pounding it beforehand. This simple preparation works equally well with squab, guinea hen, Cornish hen and other fowl. 1. Place the chicken on a cutting surface, breast side up. Make an incision between the thigh joint and the breast to the bone to loosen, but not sever, the leg. Tuck the end of the drumstick through the incision to hold it in place. 2. Flip the chicken onto its breast, backbone up. Using a heavy kitchen knife or a cleaver, cut through the center of the backbone, starting at the neck and continuing to the tailbone. Cut through the breastbone, from neck to tail. The chicken is now in two pieces. Remove the backbone and rib cage bones. 3. Flip both pieces, skin side up, and pound them with a mallet - the bottom of a heavy fry pan works, too -to flatten. Tuck the wings under the breasts so they will not burn when placed under the broiler. The chicken will lie flatter on the broiling sheet this way and cook more evenly.

422-> WEST BANK STUDENTS MARCH IN SUPPORT OF FATAH FIGHTERS
Hundreds of students at Al Najah University in Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, defied warnings from Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and demonstrated today in support of Al Fatah, Yasir Arafat's guerrilla organization. Witnesses said about 500 students at Al Najah, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank, carried portraits of Mr. Arafat, sang Palestinian nationalist songs and chanted denunciations of Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Shiite Amal militia, which is fighting the Palestinians in Lebanon. Israeli troops surrounded the campus to prevent hundreds of other students and youths from joining the demonstration, but no violence was reported. The demonstration was called to commemorate the 22d anniversary of the founding of Al Fatah, the main guerrilla group operating under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Since it is technically against Israeli law to express support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, the demonstration today was highly unusual. It was also something of a challenge to the Israeli authorities, who have been tacitly working with Jordan to erode Mr. Arafat's widespread backing in the West Bank, particularly among educated youth, and to build support for the more conservative King Hussein. Warning From Rabin Last week, Mr. Rabin warned the heads of Palestinian universities and colleges that he would not tolerate their schools' becoming centers of Palestinian activity. Beginning last month, when Israeli troops killed three Palestinian students who threw stones at them during demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the tension between the Israeli occupation authorities and Palestinian youths has been steadily increasing. In recent weeks, there have been several confrontations between the Israelis and Palestinians. An Israeli Army spokesman announced today that a senior officer had been ordered to investigate allegations that two Israeli officers and eight soldiers had beaten and degraded Palestinian prisoners at the Ansar-2 prison camp outside of Gaza last month. The commander of Israel's southern front, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, dismissed the allegations when they were first brought up last month by Palestinian lawyers. The army spokesman said grounds have now been found for an inquiry. Allegations of Ill Treatment The Palestinian prisoners were arrested during a demonstration. One of them, Suhayl Abdel Ata, 21 years old, said at a news conference that he and two colleagues were forced by Israeli soldiers to strip, salute an Israeli officer and then kiss each other's buttocks. Later, he said, the three of them were bound and beaten and given virtually no food for three days. When they requested water they had to drink it from their shoes, he said. Last week, Mr. Rabin barred a former Hebron Mayor, Mustafe Natshe, and a Palestinian lawyer, Faiz Abu Rahme of Gaza, from attending an international conference in San Diego on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The two Palestinians are known for their relatively moderate views and had planned to go to the conference with Israeli peace campaigners, such as Abba Eban, a member of Parliament. The conference was called off because of the travel ban, which baffled even many Israelis. ''There is no escaping the conclusion that Rabin's decision is emblematic of an unnecessary and inexplicable act of oppression,'' wrote Zeev Schiff, the widely respected military editor of the Haaretz newspaper. ''The truth is that in everything regarding the Palestinian issue, Rabin holds extremist positions and follows a zig-zag policy.'' In the last two years, the Israeli Government has revived the practice of expelling Palestinians suspected of supporting the P.L.O. No trials are held and lawyers trying to appeal the deportations cannot see most of the evidence against their clients because the information is gathered by security services through covert means and from informers. On Monday, Mohammed Dahlan, 26, of the Gaza Strip, was expelled to Jordan after being accused by the Israeli authorities of leading Al Fatah's youth movement. A Palestinian newspaper editor, Akram Haniye, was deported last month, also on charges of being a Fatah organizer. Thirty-seven Palestinians have been deported since the practice was reinstituted under the national unity Government in July 1985. The policy was halted by Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1982. Stone-throwing at Israeli cars in the West Bank has also become a daily occurrence in recent weeks. The army said today that it was investigating whether an Israeli civilian, whose car was hit with rocks while driving past the Balata refugee district near Nablus on Monday, was responsible for shooting a Palestinian youth from Balata who was taken to a hosptial in Nablus with a gunshot wound. Last, month a 12-year-old Palestinian boy from Balata was shot and killed, reportedly by an unidentified Israeli West Bank settler whose car was stoned while driving by the camp. No one was arrested in the shooting.

425-> LADY'S SECRET LEADS ECLIPSE WINNERS
Lady's Secret and most of her handlers were among the 10 thoroughbreds and 5 people named winners of 1986 Eclipse Awards yesterday. Lady's Secret, the gray Secretariat filly who is a virtual cinch to be named Horse of the Year on Jan. 30, won the champion older filly title and helped win statuettes for her owner, Eugene V. Klein; her trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, and her jockey, Pat Day. Lukas and Klein also won the award last year, and Day was the champion jockey two years ago. Lukas is also the trainer, and Klein the part-owner, of Capote, the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby May 2, who was named champion 2-year-old colt. The other thoroughbreds chosen for awards were Brave Raj, 2-year-old filly; Snow Chief, 3-year-old male; Tiffany Lass, 3-year-old filly; Turkoman, older male; Manila, grass horse; Estrapade, turf female; Smile, champion sprinter, and Flatterer, top steeplechaser. The other human honorees were Allen Stacy, the apprentice jockey, and Paul Mellon, the breeder. Three Voting Blocs All of the winners except the steeplechaser and the breeder, who were chosen by committees, were elected by three voting blocs whose consensus choices carried equal weight: 126 journalists affiliated with the National Turf Writers Association, 77 editorial employees of The Daily Racing Form and 26 racing secretaries of Thoroughbred Racing Associations member tracks. Lady's Secret was the only winner chosen on top of all 229 ballots, and four of the champions were not the choice of all three voting groups. The Racing Form chose Melair instead of Tiffany Lass as champion 3-year-old filly, the N.T.W.A. chose Corey Black instead of Stacy as top apprentice jockey, and the T.R.A. preferred Precisionist to Turkoman among the older males and John Franks to Klein among the owners. The results in part reflected the growing importance of the seven year-end Breeders' Cup races in determining the sport's champions. Capote, Brave Raj, Smile, Lady's Secret and Manila all won Cup races at Santa Anita Nov. 1 to cement their titles, and only Lady's Secret would have won her title without having won a Cup race that day. Smile was the clearest beneficiary of a Cup victory because that was his only Grade I victory of the year. Phone Trick, retired with an injury in midsummer and the runner-up in the balloting, beat Smile by four lengths while conceding him eight pounds earlier in the year. Early Success Decisive Early-season accomplishments, however, proved decisive with the 3-year-olds. Snow Chief, who was sidelined from July through December, won his title on the basis of winter and spring scores in the Florida Derby, the Santa Anita Derby, the Preakness and the Jersey Derby. Tiffany Lass made her final start of the year May 1, winning the Kentucky Oaks, but she beat most of her title rivals that day and they spent the rest of the year beating one another. Lady's Secret, a gray, 4-year-old daughter of Secretariat, won a record eight Grade I races last year in a long campaign that won her the nickname the Iron Lady and made her the nation's most popular horse. She finished behind Precisionist twice and lost three of her four starts against males, but was overpowering against fillies and swept Belmont Park's fall filly triple series - the Maskette, the Ruffian and the Beldame. Lady's Secret is scheduled to compete this year, as are Capote, Snow Chief, Manila, Smile and Flatterer. Turkoman and Estrapade have been retired, and the racing careers of Brave Raj and Tiffany Lass are in doubt because of injuries. Lukas set an earnings record for a third straight year when his trainees earned more than $12.3 million in 1986 while winning 64 stakes races, 16 of them Grade I events. Day, despite finishing third in earnings behind Jose Santos and Gary Stevens, won a nation-high 55 stakes races and compiled an outstanding winning percentage of 30.3 with 429 victories from 1,417 mounts.

426-> WOMAN DIES IN JUMP FROM ROOF
A South Bronx woman apparently jumped yesterday with her 17-month-old granddaughter from the roof of her five-story apartment building in what the police said they believe was a suicide attempt. The grandmother, Carmen Aguier, who was 43-years-old, was pronounced dead at 9 A.M. at the apartment building at 1023 Avenue Saint John's. The granddaughter, Patrice Diodonze, was listed in critical condition at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, the police said. Two pairs of footprints were found in the snow on the roof of the building and the bodies were found in front of the building, the police said. It was not known who found the bodies, the police said. They also said they did not have any witnesses. Although the police said relatives have been notified, they did not identify the mother of the child. The police said they do not know why the woman apparently jumped.

427-> SUSPECT SEIZED IN OFFICER'S KILLING
A 23-year-old Bronx man was arrested last night and charged with the murder on Friday of an off-duty police officer, Michael Reidy, in an apparent robbery attempt in the lobby of the officer's apartment building in the University Heights section of the Bronx. The suspect, identified as Angel Maldonado of 20 East 190th Street in the Fordham section, was arrested earlier in the evening on the sidewalk at Morris Avenue and 190th Street on the basis of a tip from a caller to a special telephone line set up to receive information about the slaying. Mr. Maldonado was taken to the 48th Precinct station house on the Cross Bronx Expressway, where he was charged with murder in the second degree, attempted robbery in the first degree and criminal possession of weapons - three pistols. The suspect was also charged with escape in the second degree, the police said, because he attempted to flee through a window at the station house. Officer Reidy, who joined the police force a year ago, had worked in a neighborhood stabilization unit in the 48th Precinct before being assigned three weeks ago to the 41st Precinct in the South Bronx. He was the first New York City police officer to be slain this year.

429-> EXCERPTS FROM GORBACHEV'S TALK AT PARTY PARLEY
Following are excerpts from Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech today to the Communist Party's Central Committee, as distributed in translation by Tass, the Soviet press agency: Our achievements are immense and indubitable and the Soviet people by right takes pride in its success. They constitute a firm base for the fulfillment of our current programs and our plans for the future. But the party must see life in its entirety and complexity. No accomplishments, even the most impressive, should obscure either contradictions in societal development or our mistakes and failings. We have been talking about all this and should repeat anew today: At some point, the country began to lose momentum, difficulties and unresolved problems started to rile up, and there appeared elements of stagnation and other phenomena alien to socialism. All this badly affected the economy and social, cultural and intellectual life. Of course, comrades, the country did not cease to develop. Tens of millions of Soviet people were engaged in honest work and many party organizations and our cadre workers were energetically acting in the interests of the people. All this held back the intensification of negative processes, but could not avert them altogether. Changes Were Overdue A need for change was evidently overdue in the economy and other fields, but it was not realized in the political and practical work of the party and the state. What was the reason for this complex and controversial situation? The main cause - and the Politburo considers it necessary to say so with utmost frankness at this plenary meeting - was that the Central Committee and the leadership of the country failed, primarily for subjective reasons, to see in time and in full the need for change and the danger of the intensification of crisis phenomena in society and to formulate a clear policy for overcoming them and making better use of the opportunities intrinsic in the socialist system. Conservative sentiments, inertia, a tendency to brush aside everything that did not fit into conventional patterns and an unwillingness to come to grips with outstanding socio-economic questions prevailed in policy-making and in practical work. Party Bears Responsibility Comrades, it is the leading bodies of the party and the state that bear responsibility for all this. The extent to which vital problems and contradictions and societal tendencies and prospects were understood depended in many ways on the state and progress of theory, on the atmosphere in theoretical science. Lenin's dictum that the value of a theory lies in its providing an exact picture ''of all the contradictions that are present in reality'' was often ignored. The theoretical concepts of socialism remained to a large extent at the level of the 1930's and the 1940's, when society was tackling entirely different tasks. Developing socialism, the dialectic of its driving forces and contradictions and the actual condition of society did not become the subject of in-depth scientific research. The causes of this situation go back far into the past and are rooted in that specific historical situation in which, by virtue of well-known circumstances, vigorous debate and creative ideas disappeared from theory and from the social sciences, while authoritarian evaluations and opinions became unquestioned truths that could only be commented on. The forms of organization of society that emerged in practice became absolutized. Moreover, such ideas were actually equated to the essential characteristics of socialism, viewed as constant and presented as dogmas that left no room for objective scientific quest. ... Serious discrepancies kept piling up in planning. The authority of the plan as the main tool of economic policy was being subverted by subjective approaches, imbalances, instability, a striving to embrace everything down to trifles, and a host of decisions of a sectoral and regional character resulted in circumvention of the plan, often without due regard for realistic possibilities. Plans were often short of scientific substantiation and did not provide guidelines for the formation of efficient economic proportions, proper care for the development of the social sphere and the accomplishment of many strategic tasks. As a consequence, the huge advantage offered by the socialist economic system, primarily its planned character, was used inefficiently. In this situation, irresponsiblity was preserved and diverse bureaucratic rules and instructions were devised. Day-to-day practical activity was replaced with rule by decree, a show of efficiency and mountains of paperwork. ... Elements of social corrosion that emerged in the last few years had a negative effect on society's morale and inconspicuously eroded the lofty moral values that have always been characteristic of our people and of which we are proud, namely, ideological dedication, labor enthusiasm and Soviet patriotism. As an inevitable consequence of all this, interest in the affairs of society slackened, manifestations of callousness and skepticism appeared and the role of moral incentive to work declined. The stratum of people, some of them young people, whose ultimate goal in lfe was material well-being and gain by any means, grew wider. Their cynical stand was acquiring more and more aggressive forms, poisoning the mentality of those around them and triggering a wave of consumerism. The spread of alcohol and drug abuse and a rise in crime became indicators of the decline of social mores. Disregard for laws, report-padding, bribe-taking and encouragement of toadyism and adulation had a deleterious influence on the moral atmosphere in society. Real concern for people, for the conditions of their life and work and for social well-being were often replaced with political flirtation - the mass distribution of awards, titles and prizes. An atmosphere of permissiveness was taking shape, and exactingness, discipline and responsibility were declining. Serious shortcomings in ideological and political education were in many cases disguised with ostentatious activities and campaigns and celebrations of numerous jubilees in the center and in the provinces. The world of day-to-day realities and that of make-believe well-being were increasingly parting ways. The ideology and mentality of stagnation had their effect on culture, literature and the arts. Criteria in appraising artistic creative work were reduced. As a consequence, there appeared quite a few mediocre, faceless works that did not give anything to the mind or to the heart, along with works that raised serious social and moral issues and reflected true-to-life collisions. Stereotypes from capitalist mass culture with its propagation of vulgarity, primitive tastes and spiritual callousness began to infiltrate Soviet society to a larger extent. ... The Politburo considers the perfection of the Soviet election system to be one of the main avenues in democratizing our life. . . . What is the essence of proposals and wishes on these matters, which people are sending in to the Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and to other central bodies and the mass media? . . . Concretely, most proposals suggest that voters at meetings, in work collectives and at the places of residence, as well as at election meetings, discuss, as a rule, several candidacies, that elections be held in larger electoral districts, and that several deputies be elected from each of them. People believe that this would enable each citizen to express his or her attitude to a broader circle of candidates and will enable party and local government bodies to get to know better the sentiments and will of the population. . . . The implementation of these proposals would be the first important step towards further democratization of the process of forming the bodies of state power and of their functioning. But obviously, it is also necessary to consider deeper changes and further steps in this direction . . . To begin with, the formation of elective bodies in the primary party organization. The gist of most proposals on this score is to give full scope to the expression of the will of all Communists without exception during the election of secetaries of party bureaus and party committees and in raising their accountability to those who elect them. There is also a need to think of changing the procedure for the election of secretaries of rayon, okrug, city, oblast and krai committees of the party, and the Central Committees of the Communist parties of the union repubics. Here, comrades suggest that secretaries, including first secretaries, could be elected by secret ballot at plenary sessions of the respective party committeess. In that case, the members of the party committee would have a right to enter any number of candidacies in the voting list. Such measures should serioulsy raise the responsibility of secretaries to the party committees that elected them, give them more confidence in their work, and make it possible to determine more accurately the degree of their prestige. Of course, the principle of the party rules, under which the decisions of higher bodies are compulsory for all lower party committees, including those on personnel matters, should remain unshakable in the party. The Politburo's opinion is that further democratization should also apply to the formation of the central leading bodies of the party. I think this is quite logical. It would seem logical to democratize the elections of leading bodies in other public organizations as well. ... It may be advisable to convene an all-union party conference next year on the eve of the report-and-election campaign within the party, and extensively review the course of implementation of the decisions of the 27th congress and to sum up the results of the first half of the five-year plan period. It would also be right for the conference to discuss questions of further democratizing the life of the party and society as a whole.

430-> CREDIT MARKETS; Prices Rise Again, Modestly
Treasury bond prices rose modestly for the third consecutive day, but without the ebullience of the stock market. Although securities dealers discerned enough investor demand to offer more than $1.1 billion of new corporate issues, they noted that the Treasury market has been restrained by the absence of good foreign demand. Domestic investors' concerns about higher inflation and big budget deficits have also hurt. Traders said persistent rumors that central banks in Japan and West Germany would soon reduce interest rates helped raise prices of Treasury issues, but investor demand for long-term Treasury issues was less than robust. Many analysts are concerned that prospects for further declines in the dollar might discourage foreign buyers at the Treasury's early February financing, when an estimated $29 billion of notes and bonds will be auctioned. 'More Sellers Than Buyers' ''We've seen more sellers than buyers of long bonds recently,'' said the head of Treasury trading at one large New York firm. ''But you can't get too negative on bonds if you look at the stock market as a proxy for demand for all financial assets.'' ''I see a general celebration of liquidity in the financial markets,'' said Samuel Thorne, senior vice president at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. Apart from stimulating the stock market, he said, ''it seems to have helped the bond market shrug off the rise in oil prices to $18 and $19 per barrel.'' Indicative of the skepticism expressed by other analysts, Mr. Thorne said that ''if we don't get the rate cuts by Japan and Germany, or if the economy does not turn out to be as sluggish as expected, we're ready to cut and run.'' Purchases by Mutual Funds Several analysts said that bond purchases by mutual funds have been very strong recently, helping compensate for the caution of some institutional investors. Steven E. Norwitz, vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based sponsor of mutual funds, noted that sales of bond funds in the first half of January equaled more than three-fourths of the total for all of December and exceeded sales of his firm's stock mutual funds. ''But the stock mutual funds have benefited tremendously from money transferred from money market mutual funds,'' he said. ''Last year the trend was to move up the yield curve and earn the higher returns available on bonds, but now the move seems to be up the risk curve'' into the stock market, Mr. Norwitz said. Growth in M-1 The liquidity Mr. Thorne referred to can be measured by a variety of means, including the 15.1 percent growth rate in 1986 for the M-1 money supply measure consisting of currency and checking accounts. According to Federal Reserve data, savings deposits rose nearly $67.6 billion last year, to $369.4 billion in December, while assets in general purpose money market funds rose $29.7 billion, to $206.2 billion. At the weekly auction of Treasusy bills, rates declined more than one-eighth of a percentage point, reflecting the reduced size of the Treasury's weekly auctions and aggressive bidding by securities dealers in anticipation of additional purchases by foreign central banks that have been buying dollars in the foreign exchange markets. New three-month bills averaged 5.23 percent, down from 5.38 percent, while the six-month issue was 5.27 percent, down from 5.43 percent. By late in the day, the Treasury's bellwether 7 1/4 percent bonds due in 2016 were offered at 102 1/4, up 14/ 32d's of a point, to yield 7.31 percent. Early in the day, the 30-year issue traded as high as 102 1/2. In advance of today's auction of new two-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the issue with a yield of 6.15 percent. Activity in Tax-Exempts In the tax-exempt market, the decline in yields to 7 percent or less for many new issues is encouraging many local governments and investment bankers to consider sales of new issues to refinance old, high-interest bonds or to convert variable-rate bonds to a fixed interest rate. For example, several market participants said the recent decline in rates had touched off rumors that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority might soon convert some of the $2 billion of variable-rate bonds it sold in November 1985 to long-term, fixed-rate bonds. Specialists in bonds of New Jersey issuers estimated that a large turnpike issue could be sold currently with a yield of less than 7 percent. Robert H. Muller, vice president at J. P. Morgan Securities, noted in the Jan. 19 edition of Creditweek published by the Standard & Poor's Corporation that about $100 billion of variable-rate demand bonds are outstanding.

432-> OPERA: KLEIBER CONDUCTS 'OTELLO' AT CONVENT GARDEN
This is the ''Otello'' centenary year; Verdi's masterpiece was first performed on Feb. 5, 1887, at La Scala in Milan. To honor that anniversary, the reclusive conductor Carlos Kleiber, who has made ''Otello'' one of his few specialties, is leading new productions of the opera this month at London's Royal Opera at Covent Garden and, starting on Feb. 5, at La Scala itself. Both productions offer the leading Otello of the present day, Placido Domingo. London's ''Otello,'' the company's first new staging of the work in 30 years, bowed Tuesday night and was a gala occasion indeed. It was a characteristically formal affair attended by England's upper echelon, who braved fierce winter weather to get there. In the audience were Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband, Denis. Meeting the cast after the opera, Mrs. Thatcher reaffirmed her enthusiasm for opera, which one London tabloid had questioned. Tuesday's performance, with one crucial caveat, was the kind of event that might indeed quicken the flagging pulse of an opera-doubter. It was an altogether elegant, elegantly achieved affair, from Elijah Moshinsky's grandly traditional staging to the acting and singing to Mr. Kleiber's conducting. Since Mr. Domingo's Otello is a familiar presence at the Metropolitan Opera (and in Franco Zeffirelli's film), it was Mr. Kleiber who attracted the prime interest of this New York visitor. The 55-year-old son of the conductor Erich Kleiber, Carlos Kleiber lives in Munich, West Germany, and confines his rare appearances in the pit to a few core operas in the pantheon - ''Otello'' (which this writer heard him conduct 25 years ago in Stuttgart), ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' ''La Boheme'' (in which he will make his long-awaited Met debut next season, with Luciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni), ''Tristan und Isolde'' and a few others. He has recorded several of these, along with a clutch of symphonic masterpieces, thus building an international reputation even in the absence of many live performances. He has conducted fairly often at Covent Garden since 1974, however, and clearly feels comfortable with the working conditions there. Mr. Kleiber is a painstaking perfectionist, steeping himself in every detail of a score and then insisting on its precise realization. In some of his recordings, this attention to detail has resulted in mannered, tense performances. That was hardly the case on Tuesday; if anything, the orchestral performance lacked intensity and driving passion. But in their place was a quite remarkable re-creation of the sound of Verdi's orchestra, its exact weight and tonal character. And the amount of unself-conscious orchestral detail was often thrilling on its own, understated terms. The insinuating phrasing in the strings as Iago tightens his web; the whooping horns (never vulgar or overemphasized) as Iago crows in triumph at the end of the second act; the heart-rending lucidity of the strings as Desdemona begins her ''Ave Maria,'' the perfect equivalent of her own trusting innocence - all these revealed the work of two true orchestral masters: Verdi, of course, but also Mr. Kleiber. Mr. Domingo sang and acted with his usual conscientious intelligence and vocal beauty, and he was joined by the other two principals from Mr. Zeffirelli's film, Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago. Ms. Ricciarelli was exquisite - the ideal visual realization of the part and vocally in fine form, as well. As has become apparent in recent years, she feels more comfortable holding her soprano down to soft singing, which suits most of Desdemona's utterances just fine. But she kept her voice under decent control in more forceful passages, too, and dominated the third-act ensemble just as she should. A most impressive performance. As a bass-baritone with an emphasis on the bass, Mr. Diaz offers more vocal weight than most Iagos, and in truth his singing was neither as focused nor as confident as it could have been. But he easily compensated with a superb dramatic performance, swaggering and saturnine. Mr. Moshinsky's production took its cue from the various Renaissance-style paintings that adorned Timothy O'Brien's sets and the program book. This was a magisterial, stately ''Otello,'' handsome, dark-tinted, reasonably ingenious in its blendings of public and private space (although Otello and his bride did recline in the midst of a public square at the end of the first act) and always attentive to the intricacies of character relations. But to this taste, it was all just a bit too genteel, and this was a complaint that must be extended to Mr. Domingo's portrayal and Mr. Kleiber's conducting. The great Otellos, from the first, Francesco Tamagno (who left some recordings) to Giovanni Martinelli to James McCracken, may not have been the most dulcet singers, but they infused this part with a barely contained barbarous passion. Mr. Domingo is just too civilized, too contained and, on Tuesday, Mr. Kleiber was, too. In the end, this was an ''Otello'' one could deeply respect without being moved at the elemental level that any great performance of this opera must provide.

433-> CHRYSLER PULLS ADS FROM 'AMERIKA'
The Chrysler Corporation, the largest sponsor of the ABC mini-series ''Amerika,'' has pulled its commercials from the program, stating that the car maker's patriotic advertisements would be inappropriate in the 14 1/2-hour film about a Soviet takeover of the United States. One ABC executive accused Chrysler of yielding to pressure groups bent on ''censoring ideas.'' Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, personally approved the decision to pull Chrysler's commercials, costing roughly $7 million, after viewing six hours of the film, a Chrysler spokesman said. ABC executives said in interviews yesterday that despite the Chrysler pullout, the network would press on with the program, which is to be broadcast over seven nights beginning the week of Feb. 15. A Pledge to Proceed ''We'll absolutely go ahead,'' said the president of ABC, John B. Sias. ''It will not cripple us. It'll hurt us. But we're going to run that program come rain, blood or horse manure.'' ABC executives would not identify the other sponsors for the program but said no others had withdrawn their commercials. ''Amerika,'' three years in the making at a cost of nearly $40 million, has aroused dispute almost from its inception. The film depicts the peaceful takeover of the United States by the Soviet Union with the complicity of international ''peacekeeping'' troops whose uniforms and insignia are similar to those worn by United Nations forces. Critics of the project have cited a range of dangers that the mini-series could present, from defaming the United Nations to threatening relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Soviet officials have strongly criticized the project, threatening to put pressure on the ABC News bureau in Moscow and, in recent weeks, issuing almost daily rebukes of ''Amerika'' in the Soviet press. The United Nations has hired Theodore C. Sorensen, a former special counsel to President John F. Kennedy, to negotiate with ABC in an effort to win disclaimers and other concessions. A Chrysler stockholder and former United Nations official, Sally Swing Shelley, had called for a letter-writing campaign aimed at Chrysler, suggesting that ''a divestment movement'' or buyers' boycott might result if Chrysler helped sponsor the program. Mr. Iacocca was not available for comment. A statement read by a Chrysler spokesman, John Guiniven, said Chrysler executives had conducted ''an exhaustive review'' of the six hours of film made available to them by ABC. ''We have no personal quarrel with what we have seen, and we believe the mini-series will attract a huge audience,'' the Chrysler statement said. ''Nevertheless, we have concluded that the subject matter and its portrayal are so intense and emotional that our upbeat product commercials would be both inappropriate and of diminished effectiveness in that environment.'' Chrysler's television commercials are keyed to the theme ''The Pride is Back - Born in America.'' The president of ABC Entertainment, Brandon Stoddard, who is the executive who launched ''Amerika'' three years ago, said of Chrysler's decision: ''I think this is a result of pressure groups, and I have some concern that pressure groups are really censoring ideas. That is a long-term concern for us.'' The producer, writer and director of the mini-series, Donald Wrye, said yesterday that he feared Chrysler's decision would have a chilling effect in the executive corridors of the networks. ''That chilling effect that was sent through the fifth floor here was interesting to watch,'' he said, speaking of the programming department of ABC's West Coast headquarters. ''Network executives are wondering just how much censoring of themselves they're going to have to do to prevent this.'' Mr. Stoddard, interviewed by phone in Arizona, acknowledged that Mr. Wrye had a legitimate concern. ''That's the most important question that has to be answered, and I don't have the answer to it,'' he said. ''What I think must be avoided by any entertainment division is future self-censorship, the possibility that the creative people at a network censor themselves even before an idea comes into development. That would be tragic.'' Chrysler had bought about 38 of the program's 204 commercials, each costing $175,000 to $200,000, according to advertising industry sources. ABC will try to sell Chrysler's abandoned commercial time, but the auto maker is obliged to pay for time it agreed to buy that goes unsold. Counting Chrysler's commitment, ABC has sold about 90 percent of the commercial time in the mini-series. Cost Was an Obstacle ''Amerika'' almost died before going into production. Production was stalled a year ago after the Soviet threat against ABC's Moscow bureau, and while the network's new cost-minded owners, Capital Cities Communications Inc., assessed the economics of the project. The network decided to go ahead with ''Amerika,'' but the mini-series may be one of the last of its sort for a while. ''Frankly, the economics of making one of these things is not that attractive,'' Mr. Sias, ABC's president, said yesterday. ''This is one of the last of these to be around.'' Mr. Guiniven of Chrysler disputed the assertion that Chrysler had yielded to the protests. ''We're used to pressure, we're not bowing to pressure,'' he said. ''The publicity made it essential that top management review the decision. We don't want to prepare entirely new commercials for one program. We don't bow to pressure, because we're so used to pressure.''

438-> Role of African Mutilations in AIDS Discounted
To the Editor: Fran P. Hosken (''Why AIDS Pattern Is Different in Africa,'' letter, Dec. 15) maintains that widespread female circumcision in Africa helps explain why acquired immune deficiency syndrome is easily transmissible through sexual relations between heterosexuals there, but appears to be slow in spreading among nonrisk groups in the United States. Certainly, female genital mutilation is a brutal, sexist and unhealthy practice that should be strongly discouraged. But in the African countries where AIDS is most prevalent (Burundi, the Congo, Rwanda, northwestern Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia), female circumcision is either nonexistent or extremely rare. The practice is common from Senegal in the west to Somalia in the east: a region where AIDS is generally not found. Quite frankly, there is no relationship. However, as AIDS spreads into Kenya and eastern Tanzania, where the removal of the clitoris and labia minora is common, often resulting in genitourinary infections, it is likely that the practice may facilitate the spread of the disease. So then, why should heterosexually transmitted AIDS be spreading so rapidly in central Africa and so slowly in this country? I suspect such factors as the higher rates of prior immunosuppression and intestinal parasite infestation in Africans, the greater likelihood of urban African women to engage in sex during menstruation, possibly the common practice by prepubescent girls in parts of central Africa of elongating the labia majora through continual stretching, and the possible existence of an immunosuppressive viral co-factor. But I fear it is just a matter of time before the pattern of heterosexually transmitted AIDS in the singles bars along First Avenue, as well as the sidewalks of Queens Boulevard, will begin to look a lot like the pandemic in Africa today. DOUGLAS A. FELDMAN Acting Executive Director AIDS Center of Queens County Forest Hills, Queens, Dec. 20, 1986

439-> SHULTZ READY FOR TOUR OF 6 BLACK AFRICAN NATIONS
George P. Shultz will leave Tuesday on an eight-day swing through six African countries with close ties to the West. It is the first time the Reagan Administration has sent its Secretary of State to sub-Saharan Africa, where its policies toward South Africa have come under fire. Mr. Shultz will fly to Senegal after a one-day stop in Bermuda, where he will see the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe. He will also visit Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Liberia. The Secretary of State is expected to meet some sharp questioning in Africa about what many there have portrayed as the Administration's insufficient vigor in opposing apartheid. He may also raise the issue of human rights violations in Kenya and Liberia. But the Secretary's agenda, as described by a State Department official, is being shaped mainly by security issues and a desire to promote free-market economies. Furthermore, in keeping with Washington's basic strategy of containing Soviet influence in the third world, some military assistance is likely to be discussed. Trend to Free Markets Hailed ''Our principal objectives in Africa center on strategic denial to the Soviets,'' an Administration official said. ''These countries are of specific importance to us in a geopolitical sense.'' The policy that flows from that anxiety about Soviet influence has an ideological coloration in the economic sphere, as Administration officials hail the trend toward free markets and away from the flirtation with socialism that marked the early post-colonial period in many African countries. But all the economies, except for that of the Ivory Coast, face serious difficulties for which the relatively small foreign aid budget is no solution. All of black-ruled Africa is getting only $664 million in the current fiscal year, for example, compared with $1.2 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean. Senegal, Mr. Shultz's first stop, received $47 million in economic and food aid in the fiscal year 1986, and has undertaken major economic initiatives to lead toward a free-market economy, a State Department official said. It also received $3 million in military aid last year, partly in recognition of its provision of the alternative landing site for the space shuttle, to be used in case a mission has to be aborted. ''Senegal is helpful to us,'' the official said, noting that a tracking station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also situated there. Conflict in Chad Cited Cameroon, where there are large investments by American banks, oil companies and other businesses, also has military importance now. It is the main transportation route from the sea to landlocked Chad, which is fighting Libyan troops in the north. Indeed, the topic of Libya is likely to arise in Mr. Shultz's talks as well, since several nations on his trip are concerned about attempts by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, to attack or subvert African governments. Kenya, whose Government is strongly pro-American and provides port rights to the United States Navy, is nonetheless likely to hear expressions of concern from Mr. Shultz about a wave of political arrests. Students, university lecturers and journalists have been jailed for their purported support of Mwakenya, an underground group opposed to the Government. A State Department official said Washington's displeasure about the arrests had already been communicated privately to the Government of President Daniel arap Moi. No public discussion of the issue is planned by the Secretary, the official said, and it seems doubtful that he will risk alienating President Moi. ''Moi and Kenya have been a good home for American business,'' another Administration official said. But military aid has declined from $20 million in fiscal 1985 to $7.5 million this year, and economic aid from $25 million to $15 million in the same period. In Nigeria, which has one-fourth of all of black Africa's population, Secretary Shultz is expected to discuss the problem of drug trafficking, an official said. Heroin from Pakistan has been passing through Nigeria on its way to the United States, he said. The United States has stationed agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency in Nigeria - the only black African country where they are deployed - and the Nigerian authorities have been cooperative in trying to stop the flow, the American official said. U.S. Investment in Nigeria Mr. Shultz may also meet with American businessmen in Nigeria, an official said. American oil companies are heavily involved in Nigeria, which is the fifth largest source of oil imports to the United States. United States investment amounts to $3 billion, and although Nigeria has a large trade surplus with the United States, ''it is an important market for us,'' the official said. One subject likely to be raised is Nigeria's decision last summer, as an austerity measure, to ban imports of American wheat, which amounted to $225 million in 1985. In the Ivory Coast, Mr. Shultz plans ''a classic diplomatic visit,'' in one official's words. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is widely respected as a statesman who is on good terms with most of the so-called front-line states - the southern African nations leading the opposition to apartheid. In Liberia, Mr. Shultz is expected to discuss human rights and economic policy with Samuel K. Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup. Of $28 million in economic aid this year, $10 million is being withheld, an official said, because political and economic changes have not been forthcoming. ''We've held up things for months at a time while we squabbled over human rights and economic reform,'' he said.

440-> FRENCH STRIKE SPREADS TO ELECTRIC UTILITY
A strike movement spread today from France's railroads to its state-run electrical power company and the Paris subway, heightening a contest of wills between the conservative Government and the unions. The strike in the power company, Electricite de France, was pressed by the Communist-controlled union, the Confederation Generale du Travail, which has called for ''a movement of exceptional strength'' against a Government policy of curbs on wage increases. But Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, after an emergency meeting of his Government this morning, said there would be no departure from the present ''austerity'' policies, which, he argued, were necessary to prevent a new cycle of inflation and unemployment. ''The Government intends to continue in this direction, which is one of rigor, but also one of solidarity with the most disadvantaged and, above all, one of hope,'' Mr. Chirac said. 'Improve Our Competitiveness' ''We must improve our competitiveness, and the major effort of the Government consists of making sure inflation does not start up again and that it is mastered,'' Mr. Chirac said. The extension of the strike from the railroad to other sectors of the state-owned French economy marked a new stage in a clear union challenge to Mr. Chirac's Government. The movement began three weeks ago with wildcat walkouts by workers in the vast state-run railroad system and has by now become one of the longest and most costly strikes in recent French history. In a radio interview today, Mr. Chirac accused the Communists in particular of trying to exploit the workers' grievances to mount what he called ''an action leading to a direct attack on the policies of the Government.'' ''They are trying to torpedo the Government and to destabilize it,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''They don't have a chance.'' Power Blackouts in Paris The electricity strike today caused intermittent power blackouts all day in Paris and in several other regions of France. At the same time, subway service here was roughly halved by a renewed walkout of transport workers after a breakdown of wage negotiations on Monday. Meanwhile, train service throughout France was operating at roughly 40 percent, the state-run railroad said. As in past days, the police were called in to remove striking workers from railroad tracks they were occupying in an effort to prevent trains, operated by non-striking workmen, from moving. During these several days, the strike has preoccupied the French, who have watched as repeated attempts at negotiations with trainmen, subway workers and, now, employees of the electricity company, have failed. Striking workers are presenting several demands, chief among them that the Government back down from a 3 percent limit on pay increases. In his radio interview today, Mr. Chirac said, over the last 5 years, France had lost 13 percent of its export market, a loss he attributed to the high cost of production in this country. ''It is necessary to limit salary increases so that they are realistic and to maintain purchasing power,'' he said. ''And that is what we are doing.''

441-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; TEMPLE (19-2) ROUTS RUTGERS
Mike Vreeswyk, a sophomore forward, scored 22 points as Temple defeated Rutgers, 76-56, in an Atlantic 10 Conference game tonight. It was the Owls' 29th consecutive victory at McGonigle Hall and their 19th in 21 games this season. They are now 8-0 in the conference. Rutgers fell to 3-13 and 1-8. Rutgers took an 11-5 lead but Temple went on a 15-2 spurt and a jumper by Nate Blackwell gave the Owls a 20-13 advantage with 9 minutes left in the half. The Owls held a 33-25 edge at halftime and built a 47-33 lead with 14:11 to play. Eric Riggins had 21 points for the Scarlet Knights. DePaul 70, Weber State 51 ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) - Dallas Comegys scored 16 points to pace DePaul, which had an easy time rebounding from its first defeat, to Georgetown last weekend. The Blue Demons (17-1) ran up a 41-27 haltime lead that enabled Coach Joey Meyer to send the reserves in early. Weber State (3-16) got 10 points each from Walt Tyler and Dale Baum. Kansas 72, Iowa St. 48 LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) - Danny Manning scored 23 points as Kansas posted an easy Big Eight victory and ran its home winning streak to 44 games. Manning, a 6-11 forward, established himself early, scoring 11 of the Jayhawks' first 22 points.Kansas (14-5, 5-1) led, 36-20, at the half. Kansas employed a stiff man-to-man defense to shut down Iowa State (10-8, 2-3), except for Jeff Grayer, who scored 26 points. Connecticut 66 Boston College 60 BOSTON (AP) - Connecticut scored the Big East victory behind a pair of freshmen, Tate George, who scored 15 points, and Steven Pikiell, who added 14. Jamie Benton, a guard who had 18 points, hit the second of two straight 3-point shots with 1:02 remaining to pull the Eagles (8-9, 1-6) to 58-56. However, the Huskies (7-10, 2-6) hit eight of 11 free throws down the stretch. The game was Connecticut's first since a pair of sophomore starters, Cliff Robinson and Phil Gamble, were ruled academically ineligible for the remainder of the season. Wagner 83, Manhattan 70 By The Associated Press Terrance Bailey scored 28 points and Dean Borges added 25 to lead Wagner. The Seahawks (11-7) built a 36-27 halftime lead as Bailey, who led the nation in scoring last season, scored 12 points, while Borges had 11. Andre Van Drost, the Seahawks' point guard, had 15 assists. Manhattan (5-14) was led by Pete Runge, who had a career high 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Loyola, Md. 70 St. Francis, N.Y. 65 By The Associated Press Jim Tubman made six free throws in the final minute as Loyola handed St. Francis (5-11, 2-6) its sixth straight defeat in capturing an E.C.A.C. Metro Conference game. Tom Gormley and Aubrey Reveley had 12 points each for the Greyhounds (8-8, 5-3). Darwin Purdie had 16 points for the Terriers. Army 81, Fordham 73 WEST POINT, N.Y.

Fordham (8-10, 1-5) led by 54-48 midway through the second half, but Army (7-9, 3-3) went on a decisive 15-3 run. Houston started the run with two free throws and accounted for 9 of the 15 points. The Cadets, who lead the nation in free-throw shooting with an .803 mark, converted 21 of 22. Greg Pedro, who made five of seven 3-pointers, led the Rams with 27.

442-> Aren't There Any Real Republicans Around?
To the Editor: Since the lines are drawn in Washington more or less where they have been drawn before, I hope history will be remembered and used. One thing that makes this difficult is that the history of the Republican Party is known to almost no one in the present Administration, since they are almost without exception former Democrats (New Deal Democrats, Southern Democrats and the ''Scoop'' variety of Jackson Democrats). Perhaps Under Secretary William Taft remembers his grandfather's Senate attacks on the Roosevelt concept of Presidential control of foreign policy; perhaps not. Certainly neither Donald Regan nor Caspar Weinberger seems to be aware of the efforts of generations of Republicans to prevent both public and private war in Central America. This stand found its way into the first Republican Presidential platform, Lincoln's, and was taken up by Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts in 1899, and George Norris of Nebraska in 1928. On Aug. 23 of that year, Norris said in the Senate that if such unconstitutional executive actions continued, ''We shall . . . gradually surrender the functions of the legislature and in the end become a monarchy; not only a monarchy but an absolute monarchy.'' Of course, the younger generation of Republicans had to get rid of him after that. WILLIAM R. EVERDELL Brooklyn, Jan. 20, 1987

443-> Super TV Rating Is 47.8
CBS's telecast of the Super Bowl drew an average rating of 47.8 in 13 major markets across the country, the network said yesterday. The game received its highest rating, 58.6, in Washington. Denver had the second highest rating at 55.7, followed by New York at 53.4. Ratings measure the percentage of television households watching a program. Denver's rating for this year's Super Bowl was smaller than its rating for the American Football Conference championship game, in which the Broncos defeated the Cleveland Browns. The A.F.C. game, which was televised by NBC, drew a 60.7 rating in Denver. Linda Levens, associate director of program analysis at CBS, said she was puzzled by the drop. ''Maybe too many people from Denver flew to Pasadena to see the game,'' she said. The national ratings for the Super Bowl will be released Tuesday. The highest rated Super Bowl in history was the 1982 game between San Francisco and Cincinnati. The CBS telecast of that game received a 49.1 rating.

444-> FLYERS CONTINUE TO MASTER DEVILS
The Devils have always had difficulty playing the Flyers here, but tonight they learned that the worst time to play at the Spectrum is after the home team comes home with only one victory in five games on the road. Playing as if seeking to redeem themselves from losing four of their last five games, the Flyers were not only victorious, but they also posted their first shutout of the season, a 4-0 decision over the Devils. Daryl Stanley, Peter Zezel, Dave Brown and Brad Marsh scored goals in that order and Ron Hextall, the rookie goaltender, made 26 saves in achieving his first shutout in the National Hockey League. Devils Suffer First Shutout The victory for the Flyers was the 31st in 34 games (31-2-1) played here between the teams, and the shutout was the first against the Devils this season. It kept the Devils without a victory in their last eight games (0-7-1). New Jersey had three newcomers in the lineup: Craig Billington, Gordie Mark and Al Stewart, who were promoted Monday from the Devils' top affiliate in the minor leagues, the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League. Billington was particularly sharp in making 32 saves in his first appearance with the team since his demotion to Maine the day before the season opened. The 20-year-old goaltender held his ground well most of the night and also prevented Rick Tocchet from scoring on a penalty shot. ''We certainly got great goaltending, which was what we expected,'' said Coach Doug Carpenter of the Devils. ''I think Billington looked more confident and stronger, and he showed general improvement over last year.'' 'Felt Good All Night' ''I opened my eyes very quickly,'' said Billington, who played 18 games for the Devils in his rookie season. ''I felt good all night.'' Billington was promoted after a 9-8 record with the Mariners and a five-game winning streak that was snapped over the weekend. In the first period tonight, he faced a barrage of 20 shots. He looked particularly sharp in the seventh and eighth minutes of the game, when he stopped Ron Sutter from close range in a scramble and then Murray Craven after a breakaway. Billington's brightest moment, however, came 13 minutes 41 seconds into the middle period. The Flyers were awarded a penalty shot at that time because Ken Daneyko, the defenseman for the Devils, threw his stick at the puck just as Tocchet of the Flyers was ready to shoot all alone to the right of Billington. Tocchet attempted the penalty shot, but Billington prevented a goal by outstretching his right skate, forcing Tocchet to go a little wider than he wanted. As a result, the shot hit the base of the left post and went to the side of the goal. ''I practice that all the time,'' Billington said about the penalty shot, ''because we have shootouts in the minor leagues. I move out a little and then back in.'' There was little Billington could do on Stanley's first goal since March 17, 1984, which came after a rebound 9 minutes 24 seconds into the game. Billington could do even less on the goals by Zezel at 1:58 and Brown at 6:55 of the second period. Marsh's goal, his first since March 24, 1985, came with 7:02 left in the game.

445-> JAKARTA, CITING OIL PRICES, SETS AUSTERITY BUDGET
Indonesia, badly hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices over the last year, today announced the most stringent austerity budget the country has known since before the oil-boom years of the 1970's. President Suharto, speaking to Parliament and the nation in a televised address this morning, said that the nation - the world's fifth most populous - was facing a ''gloomy and dismal situation.'' In the budget, which takes effect in April, all military and civil service wages will be frozen - in a country dominated by the army and a huge bureaucracy. There will be no money for food stockpiling or subsidies. Development and military spending will be cut sharply. Taxes will rise. More Realistic Assessment The Government, acting on what some economists are describing as a more realistic assessment of future oil revenues than in the past, has based the next year's budget on a projected average price of $15 a barrel, down from about $25 last year. Oil products continue to provide about two-thirds of the country's income, despite efforts to diversify exports. For the first time, the President said today, the Indonesian Government is being forced to borrow abroad to pay the local-currency portion of foreign aid projects. Foreign debt servicing has climbed and will consume almost 30 percent of the new budget. But the President assured foreign creditors that there would be no thought given to renouncing international obligations. Looking back over the year since the last budget was announced, President Suharto said the oil price fall ''caused a decline in our foreign exchange earnings from oil of 47 percent, from $12.4 billion in 1985-86 to $6.6 billion in 1986-87.'' Despite a rise in other exports, he added, earnings will decline to $13.1 billion in the current fiscal year from $16.6 billion the year before. 'Tremendous Consequences' ''It is obvious,'' he said, ''that a 30 percent decline in foreign exchange earnings within one fiscal year, without any signs of recovery in the near future, is an extraordinary situation with tremendous consequences.'' The crisis had to be addressed, he said, ''by an equally extraordinary measure; the measure we selected was devaluation.'' The President was referring to the decision in September 1986 to devalue the rupiah, the Indonesian unit of currency, by 45 percent. The Government has denied recent rumors that another devaluation may soon take place. In the next year, according to the President's speech, overall Government spending will drop to $13.8 billion from $19 billion the year before. Hardest hit will be spending on national development, especially for industrial projects, health and education. The controversial transmigration program, which attempts to move people from overpopulated Java and Bali to sparsely inhabited islands, will suffer large cuts.

446-> ABRAMS ADVISES STATE TO REPEAL MILK SALE CURBS
Attorney General Robert Abrams today proposed legislation to repeal most existing marketing restrictions on the sale of milk in New York State. The legislation would eliminate all geographic limitations on milk distributors and prevent the state from denying milk licenses to protect existing dealers. The recommendations came after last week's Federal Court ruling allowing a New Jersey dairy to expand its milk sales in New York City. The changes are needed, Mr. Abrams said, to encourage still broader competition in milk sales and to insure that the New Jersey dairy, which has in the past been convicted of price-fixing, does not merely join the small group of dealers that has dominated milk distribution in the city for more than 50 years. Balanced Competition Sought Mr. Abrams said his plan was also necessary to compensate for legal advantages that the court ruling - which was based on constitutional provisions protecting interstate commerce -may now give to out-of-state milk producers at the expense of dairies in the state. Four days ago a Federal judge on Long Island, Leonard D. Wexler, overturned a decision by the Cuomo administration to bar Farmland Dairies of Wallington, N.J., from selling milk throughout New York City. The court ruling, which has already led to lower milk prices in some parts of the city, challenged the state's restrictive milk-licensing regulations, which consumer advocates say have allowed established dealers to maintain artificially high prices. Spokesmen for Governor Cuomo, who announced Friday that the state would not appeal the court ruling, said he would also offer new legislation on milk licensing in the near future, but they declined to comment on the kind of reforms that might be included. Existing Law Criticized In the past the Governor has been critical of existing law, which requires applicants for a milk dealer's license to demonstrate that they will not cause ''destructive competition'' in an area that already receives adequate service. Mr. Cuomo refused, however, to review the State Agriculture Department's refusal to grant a license to Farmland, calling the decision ''quasi-judicial.'' In New York City, officials of the Milk Industry Council, which represents roughly 90 milk processors and distributors in the city and on Long Island, said they had not seen the Attorney General's proposal but were pessimistic. ''We are not opposed to change,'' said Steve Mangione, a spokesman for the group. ''But if this is similar to the kind of proposals that he and others have made in the past, we feel it is likely to be destructive to a stable market.'' In a news conference called to announce his proposal, the Attorney General said the Federal court ruling had given an important lift to efforts to reform what he said was New York's ''antiquated and obsolete'' milk licensing system. But he pointed out that the ruling was limited to the specific Farmland case and argued that the entrance of Farmland alone into the market would not insure low milk prices in the long run.

448-> BROTHER OF SUSPECTED HIJACKER ARRESTED
West Germany has arrested the brother of a Lebanese terrorist suspect whose freedom is being sought by militants believed to be holding two West German hostages in Lebanon, according to various sources. It was not immediately clear why he was arrested, but the authorities were reported to consider him deeply involved in the kidnappings in West Beirut. After the arrest of the brother on Monday at the Frankfurt airport, the police stormed an apartment where he lived in the Saarland and wounded one man and detained several others, according to official and nonofficial West German sources. The brother, Abbas Ali Hamadei, 28 years old, was seized Monday night as he got off a Swissair flight from Geneva. Trip Said to Start in Beirut A West German citizen, Mr. Hamadei had reportedly started his trip in Beirut and was said to have been traveling on his own passport. On Jan. 13, the police arrested his younger brother, Mohammed Ali Hamadei, at the Frankfurt airport after liquid explosives were discovered in his luggage. Through fingerprint checks, the 22-year-old Lebanese Shiite was identified as one of three men wanted for murder by the United States in the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet in June 1985 in which a Navy diver was killed. After Washington demanded the extradition of Mohammed Hamadei, two West German businessmen were kidnapped in West Beirut in an apparent move to prevent his being sent to the United States. Since then, a sequence of kidnappings has led to the disappearance of three Americans and a number of others in the Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital. It was not immediately clear what Abbas Hamadei's motivations were in returning to West Germany. He is not known to be implicated in the T.W.A. hijacking case, and the United States has not issued an arrest warrant for him. Kidnappings Linked to Family He had disappeared from the Saarland shortly after his brother's arrest, and his estranged wife told journalists that he had gone to Beirut. Although the Hamadei brothers are said to be loosely linked to the pro-Iranian Party of God faction in Lebanon, West German investigators are known to believe that the kidnapping of the two businessmen, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt, were probably motivated largely by family loyalties. The Hamadei clan is one of the largest Shiite Moslem families in Lebanon, with roots in the Hermil plain east of Baalbek, near the Syrian frontier. The family has produced a number of feudal political chieftains, including Sabry Hamadei, who served 22 terms as the speaker of the Lebanese Parliament. Many family members are reputed to have made considerable fortunes from the cultivation of hashish. Abbas Hamadei acquired West German citizenship in 1979 by marrying a West German woman from whom he is now separated. They have a daughter. He had been living in the town of Merzig, in the Saarland, at the apartment of another Lebanese, Hamza Kassim. One Man Shot in Raid The police raided the Kassim apartment early this morning with a warrant linking its occupants to the Beirut kidnappings. In the course of the raid, the police shot one man - according to one account, a son of the Kassim family who tried to flee - and several others were arrested. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has personally ordered a news blackout on the hostage affair out of fear of jeopardizing the lives of the two Germans being held and possibly provoking other terrorist actions against West Germans. The only public information about the latest developments came this evening in the form of a terse announcement from the Federal Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. The announcement said that in the course of the investigation one person had been wounded by a policeman. It did not say where. Extradition Is Expected The Kohl Government - preoccupied with difficult coalition negotiations arising from its victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections - has not yet indicated publicly whether it intends to deliver Mohammed Hamadei to United States authorities. But a well-placed United States official said today that there was no indication that extradition would not proceed normally. Mohammed Hamadei lived in the Saarland from 1982 to 1984. He left West Germany after his application for political asylum was rejected. At the time of the T.W.A. hijacking, in which 39 Americans were eventually held hostage in West Beirut, confusion surrounded the political allegiances of the three young hijackers. Sheik Ibrahim el Amin, a Shiite cleric closely associated with the Party of God, or Hezbollah, told several reporters who visited him during the hijacking that a group called the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth was responsible. That group has issued communiques in West Beirut demanding the liberation of Mohammed Hamadei. Although the exact character of the Oppressed on Earth group is murky, it is believed to be composed of young radical Shiites who favor an even more extreme line than the one adopted by the Party of God.

450-> Last Copper Is Poured At a Polluting Smelter
Four workers today cast the last copper to be poured at the Phelps Dodge Corporation's aging smelter, which is being closed because pollution controls would be too costly. The smelter's demise ends an era in which this town owed its very existence to the copper industry, but community leaders said the town would eventually recover from the loss of the plant and its 347 jobs. The shutdown means an end to white-gray clouds of smoke containing sulfur dioxide and other pollutants that drifted from this southeastern Arizona community across Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, and even into northern Mexico. In addition to those on the last pouring, 100 employees attended to various other duties on their last shift, Sam Sorich, personnel head, said. Mr. Sorich said he was filled with ''very sad and depressing thoughts,'' after 31 years with the company, 17 of them at the plant here. Mr. Sorich, 51 years old, will retire. Douglas, which has 12,000 residents and sits on the Mexican border, was founded in 1901 by copper interests, and was named after Dr. James Douglas, then Phelps Dodge's president. Mayor Ben Williams Jr. said the closing would cost Douglas a direct annual payroll of $10 million, which some residents estimated represented 25 percent of the town's economy. ''But it's not fatal,'' Mayor Williams said. ''We'll get well in time and in fact cured.'' Many of the smelter's last workers were hired after a bitter strike in 1983 that brought decertification of the United Steelworkers union. About one-third of the workers were expected to retire, a third probably will get jobs elsewhere, mostly with Phelps Dodge, and the rest will seek other work in Douglas, a company vice president, Matthew P. Scanlon, said.

452-> JORDAN'S CHRISTIAN ARABS, A SMALL MINORITY, PLAY A MAJOR ROLE
When John Cardinal O'Connor of New York arrived here on his recent visit to the Middle East, an unusual clergyman was among the dignitaries greeting him at the airport. The clergyman, Bishop Eliya Khoury, who kissed the Cardinal on both cheeks, is the Palestinian-born leader of Jordan's 5,000-member Anglican Arab population. He is also in his second term as a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Christian Arabs, survivors of a 2,000-year-old religious tradition, are playing a role out of proportion to their numbers in the fight against Israel and in the affairs of Jordan. Most of the Christian Arabs here are members of the 1.4 million-strong community of Palestinian exiles who now make up over half of Jordon's population. A Proof of Their Sincerity ''We have suffered as much as the Moslems,'' Bishop Khoury said in an interview at his church here, explaining the political activism of Palestinian Christians. But like most experts he thinks this activism is also intended to prove that the Christians are as much Arabs as the Moslems. ''As a minority we feel a need to prove our sincerity,'' he said. ''It's hard for the Moslems to forget that Christians created Israel.'' In his history of Arab Christianty, ''Christians in the Arab East,'' the American scholar Robert E. Betts writes, ''Christian refugees from Palestine have shown themselves to be even more bitter, if this were possible, than their Moslem counterparts.'' Christian Arabs account for about 2 percent of the indigenous population of Jordan and 6 to 7 per cent of its total population, including Palestinians. Numbering about 200,000 in all, they consist mainly of Greek Orthodox, with smaller numbers of Roman Catholics, Protestants and others. At Christmas time their influence is apparent in the easygoing religious atmosphere that infuses the capital of this predominantly Moslem country, where even modest shops and stalls display twinkling Christmas trees. It is apparent, too, in Bishop Khoury's seat on the P.L.O.'s Executive Committee, which has been held by a Christian since the organization's foundation in 1966. At the Top of P.L.O. Factions ''It's not formally reserved for Christians but there has always been at least one Christian Arab on the committee,'' said Hanna Nasir, the Christian Palestinian president of Bir Zeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who was a member before Bishop Khoury. Christian Palestinians also lead the two main factions making up the P.L.O. along with Yasir Arafat's Fatah group. George Habash, head of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and his deputy, Wadi Haddad, are Christians, as is Nayef Hawatmeh, who runs the similarly radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Mr. Arafat's former information chief, Kamal Nasir, assassinated in 1973, was a Christian. According to a Western diplomat, Christians are ''conspiciously prominent'' at lower levels, too. Bishop Khoury describes himself as a moderate, opposed to violence. But he still draws a distinction between resistance and terrorism. ''To resist injustice is a virtue,'' he said. ''Look how you in the West still glorify the resistance movements in the Second World War.'' King Hussein of Jordan gives his country's Christian minority preferential political treatment. Traditionally, Christians occupy two Cabinet posts, though a Christian has never been Prime Minister or commanded the armed forces. In addition, Christians fill 10 reserved seats in the country's 60-seat Parliament. Christian Arabs, helped by their Western-oriented education and often superior knowledge of foreign languages, dominate business. A recent study by a Western embassy concluded that almost half of Jordan's leading business families are Christian and most Palestinian Christian. The comfortable position of Jordan's Christian minority owes much to King Hussein's efforts to maintain good relations with his uninvited Palestinian guests without incurring Israel's wrath. But relations between the King and the Palestinians became strained last year after the P.L.O. rejected his Middle East initiative because it required recognition of Israel. The King still accepts the P.L.O. as the Palestinian people's representative, but he has closed most P.L.O. offices in Jordan, refused permission to set up a Palestinian Open University and cracked down on P.L.O. military operations against Israel. In 1970, the Jordanian Army fought pitched battles against the P.L.O. ''Everything is getting difficult again,'' Dr. Nasir, Bir Zeit University's president, said. 'Minor' Discrimination Noted Many Christian Arabs fear that the continuing political deadlock in the Middle East will play into the hands of extremists and make their own position more vulnerable. ''Look at Lebanon, the country where Moslems, Christians and Jews got on well,'' Bishop Khoury said. ''If extremism prevails we will have to find ourselves another place.'' Christians already suffer from what Dr. Nasir calls ''minor but irritating'' discrimination in Jordan, notably a legal requirement for men to convert to Islam if they marry Moslem women.''The Middle East crisis encourages fundamentalism and that makes our position worse,'' he said. At the same time, Christians are losing the educational lead over Moslems that helped assure their privileged role in Jordan and other Middle Eastern countries. The country's Christian schools may still be the best, but most pupils are now Moslems. Already Christian Arabs are emigrating in significant numbers, especially to the United States and Canada. In the last 20 years Jordan's Christian population is reckoned to have shrunk by a quarter. Despite their anxieties about the future, many Christan Arabs remain proud of their faith and believe the Moslem majority has a duty to respect it. ''We were Arab monotheists before Islam and that is something to be proud of,'' said George S. Hawatmeh, a Jordanian Christian who edits The Jordan Times. ''It's something Moslems must respect us for - and they do.''

454-> To Geneva, With Firmness
As we begin the seventh round of the nuclear and space talks in Geneva this month, we look with satisfaction on one conspicuous fact: this past year, the United States succeeded, for the first time in history, in drawing the Soviet Union into serious negotiations on proposals for deep reductions in offensive nuclear arms. The agenda in arms control is now, irreversibly, deep offensive weapons reductions. To remain effective in our negotiations with the Soviets, it is essential that we hold staunchly to the principles that have guided our efforts over the past six years. To have gotten this far was not a sure thing. Ten years ago, American proposals for deep reductions were dismissed out of hand by the Soviets. Contrary to the American hope and expectation, the strategic arms limitation agreements in the 1970's never succeeded in achieving cuts in offensive weapons; on the contrary, the SALT process permitted vast increases in the arsenals of both sides - a fourfold expansion in the number of Soviet strategic ballistic-missile warheads since the signing of SALT I in 1972. Will the Soviets, in the end, be willing to put their signature to a genuinely equitable and effectively verifiable arms agreement that deeply reduces offensive weapons? Will they comply with it fully? The jury is still out - and, based on the available evidence, justifiably uncertain. But as the talks resume, we should be clear about the principles that have moved us toward our goal during the last half-decade. Be patient. One of the most successful treaties we ever concluded with the Soviet Union was the Austrian State Treaty, signed in 1955. Negotiations on that agreement - which guaranteed Austria's freedom and removed Soviet occupation forces -took 10 years. To succeed with the Soviets, we have to be able to outwait them, to restrain our national craving for instant results, to take the long view. We have to be able to get up from the table without an agreement if we are to get a sound agreement. In arms control, no agreement is always preferable to a bad one. Bargain from strength. Twenty-five years' experience has discredited the view that unilateral concessions by the United States will inspire matching concessions from the Soviet side. It never happens that way. In 1977, after President Jimmy Carter canceled production of the B-1 bomber, Senator John Tower asked the academician Aleksandr Shchukin in Moscow what the Soviets might be prepared to do in return. Mr. Shchukin's answer was as illustrative as it was memorable: ''Sir, I am neither a pacifist nor a philanthropist.'' The Soviets see unilateral American concessions - such as those legislated from time to time by Congress - as a sign not of good will but of lack of will. Congressional ''arms control amendments'' merely encourage the Soviets to stall, hoping that Congress will deliver free of charge what the Soviets would otherwise have to pay for with their own concessions at the bargaining table. This pulls the rug right out from under our positions. It makes things harder, not easier, on our negotiators. Focus on substance, not ''negotiability.'' A few years ago, when President Reagan first proposed a ''zero option'' for intermediate-range missiles and deep reductions in offensive nuclear arms, the conventional wisdom held that the Soviets would never play ball. Such proposals were dismissed by some as inherently not ''negotiable.'' This past year and at Reykjavik the conventional wisdom was proved wrong. President Reagan has transformed the definition of what is ''negotiable'' by insisting on what he thought was right. Keep arms control in perspective. Neither negotiations nor arms control agreements in themselves will guarantee improved relations with the Russians. Nor will they save us from our larger responsibilities for safeguarding freedom and peace. We saw this in the late 1970's, when a vigorous American push for arms control and the signing of a major arms agreement (SALT II) did nothing to prevent Soviet or Soviet-sponsored aggression from engulfing South Vietnam, Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia and Afghanistan year after year in rapid succession. What counts in arms control and relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is the broad picture. The broad trend since 1981 has been toward more stable relations because of renewed American strength and self-confidence; our central task is to preserve this trend, with or without new agreements. Insist on compliance. Ironically, the Reagan Administration has been under more fire from some quarters for calling attention to serious Soviet violations of arms control agreements than the Soviets have for actually violating them. A few years ago, the conventional wisdom held that the Soviet Union would not cheat on arms control agreements. Now we know that not to be true. But unless we can find some way to get the Soviets to kick their habit of noncompliance, the future of arms control is in jeopardy. Those who soft-pedal Soviet violations do not help the arms control process but weaken it. Hope lies with the defensive option. Logically, there is no contradiction between progress in arms control and movement to greater reliance on strategic defenses. Strategic defenses, if anything, would make reductions to far lower levels of offensive weaponry possible by providing crucial physical insurance against Soviet cheating. The key issue for arms control has never been defenses or offenses in and of themselves but political intentions. We ask: Are the Soviets willing to trade a genuine reduction in the threat to us in exchange for a genuine reduction in the threat to them? That has always been the nub of the problem. Thus far, strategic arms control agreements have failed to achieve this goal: they have coincided with huge increases in offensive weapons on both sides and a disproportionate increase in American vulnerability. If the Soviets are unwilling to permit us to reduce our vulnerability through a mutual deployment of strategic defenses, there is little basis to believe they would permit a genuine reduction in our vulnerability through an arms control arrangement. Logically and strategically, there is no better way to achieve greater security for both sides than strategic defense deployments in combination with deep reductions in offensive arms. Defenses are not part of the problem in arms control - they are part of the solution.

455-> FLYERS SURPRISED BY ISLANDERS, 3-1
The Islanders had talked about taking the giant step from being an also-ran to a contender, and they knew they needed to dominate the Flyers in order to achieve that. They needed to play simply, yet assertively, for a full game's worth of hockey, and they needed, for a change, to feel something akin to invincibility. Tonight, by defeating the Flyers, 3-1, and closing the deficit in the season series to three games to two, the Islanders made immediate strides toward that goal. Big Turnaround Most significantly, they gained confidence they had been lacking since the last game they played at the Spectrum, a 9-4 loss exactly one month ago that was the start of a slide for the Islanders. ''This was a big, big win for us,'' said Pat LaFontaine, who ended an 11-game slump by scoring the team's first two goals. ''We were humiliated the last time we came here, and I think we let it affect us in our past dozen games. We were shaken, and we didn't recover very well.'' The Islanders, still 15 points behind the Flyers in the Patrick Division, scored a psychological victory tonight. Moreover, they won without Mike Bossy, who was scratched because of a flare-up in his chronically sore back. ''It would really have been emotionally draining for us to fall behind in our series 4-1,'' said Kelly Hrudey, who stopped 11 shots in the third period before Brent Sutter scored an insurance goal into an empty net with five seconds left. ''But tonight we had a good start, we kind of shocked ourselves, and after we got out of the second period with the score still tied at 1-1, we started to feel really great about ourselves,'' Hrudey said. ''We were excited about going back out there for the third period, and we haven't always felt that way, especially not in here.'' Denis Potvin said the Islanders finally found that most elusive ingredient in their game plan: self-confidence that wasn't limited to a few players. 'An Invincible Feeling' ''It was like an invincible feeling,'' Potvin said, ''and we hadn't experienced that in an awful long time. It's something you want to feel right from training camp, but we kept having things knock us down. This was the best we'd played in a third period all season, and probably the first time we had no breakdowns.'' The game was the second of a home-and-home series that began with a 4-2 Islander loss Saturday. In the third period tonight, the Islanders outworked the Flyers and played superior defense. Once LaFontaine put them ahead, 2-1, at 4:23 of the period, beating Ron Hextall with a low, hard shot from the slot, the Islanders fought off a Flyer attack. Hrudey, under siege in the waning moments of the game, was unbeatable. ''The forwards were fantastic on defense, and our defensemen played their usual great game,'' Hrudey said. ''We had it on our minds what happened the last time we played here, and I think it helped us.'' Rare Home Defeat The victory halted a two-game Islander losing streak, and was only the third time this season that the Flyers were beaten at home. It also ended a seven-game unbeaten streak for Philadelphia. A bench-clearing brawl in the second period produced 114 penalty minutes and caused two of the Islanders' seven defensemen - Brian Curran and Steve Konroyd - to be ejected. But it served only to inspire the Islanders. ''This was a total team togetherness win,'' LaFontaine said, ''and nothing was going to spoil it.''

456-> METRO DATELINES; All-Male Club Votes On Allowing Women
Members of the University Club, bitterly divided over whether to admit women to New York City's largest male club, have voted on a resolution that would allow female members if a city antidiscrimination law is upheld in the courts. The results of the vote, to be released to members tonight, are also being awaited by the City Human Rights Commission. The commission has found the club in probable violation of Public Law 63, which prohibits discrimination in clubs not ''distinctly private,'' and is holding off on enforcement pending results of the vote. The vote comes after officials at the club took an earlier poll in which 46 percent of the club's members opposed the admission of women.

457-> IRAQ CLAIMS GAINS AGAINST IRAN PUSH
Iraq asserted tonight that it had driven Iran back from much of the border region it had overrun in its new offensive near the key southern Iraqi city of Basra, while Iran said its troops had withstood three counterattacks in ''pitched battles.'' In communiques monitored here, both sides described the fighting on the fourth day of Iran's offensive in such terms as ''fierce'' and ''heroic.'' Iraq also reported a series of air raids on Iranian cities and oil installations. The flurry of Iraqi communiques tonight described the Iranians as being pinned down in an area three miles by one mile, which is the same size as the area the Iraqis described on Sunday as a ''foothold.'' Over the course of the war, now in its seventh year, the more lightly armed Iranians, imbued with Shiite Moslem teachings about the value of martyrdom, have proved more aggressive in the attack. But they have had difficulty in bringing up reinforcements and supplies for their advances. Both sides are trying to reinforce their positions in what is shaping up as a major battle. The Iraqis have committed units of their elite force, the Presidential Guards, which is usually held as a mobile reserve, and a commando unit, indicating how seriously they take the Iranian thrust. A source with access to information gleaned from American satellite photographs said it appeared that the Iraqis were holding the Iranians, who were said to number about three divisions, or some 36,000 men, for now. But, as has often been the case, information from the battlefield itself was fragmentary and couched in hyperbole. Loss of 5 Jets Acknowledged Iraq acknowledged today that it had lost five jet warplanes during the fighting, although Iran asserted by the evening that it had downed 34. For Iraq, which has long enjoyed virtual mastery of the skies because Iran has been short of spare parts and pilots, the loss of even five planes is a significant development. Iran is reported to have strongly bolstered its American-made Hawk anti-aircraft missile defense system in its secret arms dealings with the Reagan Administration. In addition, it is reported to have gained some 2,000 TOW antitank missiles, which would be effective against the armor that forms an important part of the Iraqi military, as well as against Iraqi bunkers. The Iraqi press agency said President Saddam Hussein visited the battlefield Sunday night and was ''assured'' that the military operations were ''on the right course.'' The Iranian press agency, however, asserted that Iranian listening posts heard the Iraqi President ''desperately urging his demoralized commanders to resist.'' Conflicting Accounts The Iranian press agency said its troops turned back three counterattacks during the night and inflicted heavy casualties on the Iraqi 96th Brigade in ''hand-to-hand fighting.'' But the Iraqi press agency quoted Col. Fawaz Hamoud, commander of the 422d Brigade, as saying, ''Our forces managed to purge Ramp No. 2 east of the Fish Lake, marching over the corpses of thousands of Iranians.'' In an apparent indication of Iranian attempts to reinforce the beachhead they have taken, the Iraqi press agency quoted Brig. Gen. Abul-Wahid Shannan al-Rabat as saying, ''No reinforcements, no matter how huge they were, would help Iranian troops escape Iraq's painful blows.'' The Iranian press agency, in a dispatch from its correspondent at the front, described the area he said was taken by the Iranians as flooded and fortified with elaborate defenses that included 100-yard-long concrete trenches. The area being contested consists of two artificially flooded areas, a recreation zone created before the war and a north-south trench, resembling a moat, that was dug in 1982 and runs about 18 miles. The western side of the flooded area contains elaborate Iraqi defenses of high earthworks into which are dug concrete blockhouses, with barbed wire strung some distance to the front. IRAN SHUNS CONFERENCE UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 12 (Special to The New York Times) -Iran will not send representatives to the meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization in Kuwait later this month because Kuwait supports Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, Iran's chief delegate to the United Nations said today. The delegate, Said Rajaie Khorassani, said Kuwait was an ''inappropriate'' site for the meeting because ''Kuwait has been on the side of aggression in the imposed war against Iran by providing Iraq with financial and logistical support.'' GULF WAR AT A GLANCE History The roots of the current war can be traced to centuries of rivalry between Arabs and Persians. The Arabs first broke the control of the Indo-European Persians in Mesopotamia, now Iraq, in 637, which marked the introduction of Islam into Persia, now Iran. For about four and a half centuries, Iran has been the center of the Shiite branch of Islam, while Iraq, where Shiites are slightly in the majority, has been led by political elites from the Sunni branch of Islam. In the Iran-Iraq war, the ancient rivalry is being fought out in a struggle between the modern secularism of the Iraqi Arabs and the resurgent fundamentalist Islam under which Iran has been ruled since the 1979 revolution. How It Started On Sept. 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran by air and land. Iraq maintains that Iran started the war on Sept. 4 with artillery attacks on Iraqi towns. The aim of Iraq's attack, according to President Saddam Hussein, was to boost claims for Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab, the waterway at the head of the Persian Gulf that separates the two countries, and for a shift of the boundary to the Iranian side. President Hussein also demanded border adjustments in the north and the return to ''Arab'' sovereignty of three Arab islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf that Iran occupied in 1971. In reality, experts on the war say, President Hussein began the war expecting to topple the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and to make Iraq the dominant power in the gulf region. The Allies Iran's allies are Syria and Libya, which supply it with weapons. North Korea and China are Iran's most important suppliers of arms, but Iran also buys arms from a number of countries in the West, third world and East bloc. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf countries give substantial financial aid to Baghdad. Iraq is supported by most of the Arab world, and the Soviet Union remains its most important arms supplier, but Iraq also buys weapons from the West, most importantly planes and missiles from France. For several years Israel has clandestinely helped Iran. Recent disclosures about secret arms sales to Iran by the United States, which is officially neutral, also revealed that Israel has shipped large quantities of sophisticated American-made weapons to Iran. Progress of the War The Iraqis had early victories, driving deep into the Iranian oil-producing province of Khuzistan and capturing the port of Khurramshahr. But Iran went on the offensive in early 1982, scored a series of victories that year and crossed the Iraqi border for the first time. In 1983, Iran began a new drive across the marshes in southeastern Iraq. In February 1984, Iran again invaded southern Iraq, occupying the oil-rich Majnoon islands. In March 1985, the two sides began to strike each other's capitals. Early in 1986, Iran seized the Fao peninsula at the southeastern tip of Iraq and Iraqi troops have been unable to dislodge them. Iran's recent offensive, which began last week, is believed to be a prelude for a major offensive. Forces and Casualties There is much confusion about troop figures. Most military analysts say Iranian troops and irregular forces outnumber Iraqi troops at least 2 to 1. In major offensives, Iran has hurled poorly trained and badly armed teen-agers through minefields into fire from Iraqi artillery and machine guns. The exact number of casualties is not known.

458-> AUSCHWITZ CAMP IS VISITED BY KOCH
Mayor Koch, eyes watering with emotion and the bitter cold, today touched the wall at Auschwitz against which 20,000 people were shot by the Nazis. For most of the afternoon, as Mr. Koch walked through swirling snows at Auschwitz and past the barracks at the adjoining Birkenau camp, words appeared to fail him. He nodded as a guide informed him of grisly statistics. There were 120,000 shoes that had been found when the camp was liberated 42 years ago. There were 35,000 shaving brushes. At one point, the guide said, the five crematoriums processed 24,000 bodies a day. The Mayor, who had come to Poland on a private visit at his own expense, bit his lip. With several friends and aides, he walked from display to display. A Symbolic Gesture At the wall of death, he impulsively kissed his hand and placed it to the wall as observant Jews do when they touch the Torah or a mezuza. When asked about the gesture, he said: ''I have, as I believe every Jew has when he goes to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, touched that wall, and by touching the wall in a symbolic way made contact with every Jew who had been persecuted and killed through the centuries simply because they were Jews. ''And I felt the same compulsion to touch the wall of death to symbolically make contact with every Jew and every Christian who had been killed against that wall.'' Before coming here, Mr. Koch explained that he had wanted to come to Auschwitz for a long time, at least in part to honor several of his Polish relatives who had been killed by the Nazis. 'No Perception' ''It is quite simply ghastly,'' the Mayor said after standing in front of a display of hair shorn from women before they were sent to their death. The hair had been stored for shipment to Germany for processing for burlap and upholstery fabric. ''Everyone has an idea of a concentration camp,'' he continued, ''but you can have no perception until you have come to see it and you have walked through the cells. I am very appreciative of the Polish Government for keeping it as it was, because it would have been easy to tear it down.'' The Mayor spent close to three hours in the two camps. At Auschwitz, he signed a book of remembrance. He wrote: ''For me there can never be a greater horror than Auschwitz. The four million people who perished here will never be forgotten.'' Mr. Koch added the Hebrew word ''zachor,'' which is the imperative to ''remember,'' and he signed his inscription, Ed Koch.

460-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; How'm I Doing? Terrific
Most red-blooded Americans would wheedle and scheme just to be in Giants Stadium on Sunday when those magnificent linebackers try to sack Jay Schroeder of the Redskins. After the latest legal assault on a quarterback last Sunday against the 49ers, the Giants look like an excellent team just gathering momentum in the most critical weeks of the season. Those loyal and positive souls known as Giant fans cannot imagine losing to a team they have already beaten twice this year. One man will be among the missing, however. Mayor Koch has pulled off a plot worthy of Machiavelli, or maybe even the great Al Davis himself. He has managed to skip football and give a high moral reason for doing it, and he has also managed to avoid any kind of wager with his fellow mayors. What a guy. Although the Giants now play their games in a state to the west of New York, they have roots in the city. The city's population and image helped create the Giants, and its tax dollars helped shelter the Giants, until they got a better offer, that is. Despite the defection, most mayors would have volunteered for a diplomatic mission to New Jersey for such a big game, but Mayor Koch has found a loophole. It is no secret that the Mayor is not exactly a sports fan. He flings up his arms and waves to the voters, but the weary campaigner's smile cannot disguise his ennui during obligatory trips to the ball park. And when the Mets win a championship, he puts on his oldest suit and makes the best of it, even when people he never heard of, named Carter and Hernandez and Strawberry, squirt champagne at him. The man obviously likes travel, Chinese food, movies, books and making statements on foreign policy. Everybody needs a hobby, and he has his share. With the Giants playing the Redskins on Sunday for the right to go to the Super Bowl, the Mayor couldn't just come out and say, ''Echhh! Fifteen minutes of sporadic action? Three hours of waiting during commercials? I should freeze outdoors in January just to be part of a studio audience? No way.'' Like one of those New York street signs, written with Kochian inflection - ''Don't Even THINK of Parking Here'' - he might have said, ''Don't even THINK of making me go.'' Instead, the Mayor found a way out of this morass while upholding the very integrity of his office. Last year Koch made a bet with Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco over the outcome of the 49ers-Giants playoff game, and Mayor Feinstein paid off in a dozen prime steaks. Why she didn't send abalone or dungeness crab or dim sum from any restaurant on Grant Street is another question. This year when Mayor Feinstein proposed the same wager, Mayor Koch referred her to a municipality in the swampland. He said he thought they made a very nice cheesesteak sandwich in Moonachie, which he pronounced ''mah-NOO-chee'' instead of ''moo-NAH-key.'' (Mispronouncing names is good New York gamesmanship. Who will ever forget the Irish brogue of Mike Quill of the Transit Workers Union constantly taunting ''Mayor Lindsley'' during the strike of 1966?) This year, Mayor Koch said he was not interested in backing a team that had left New York. The sly dog also managed to avoid the ghastly stadium food and the dreadful traffic jams around a stadium unreachable by subway or train. Not only that, but the Mayor avoided a wager with the Mayor of Washington, a city once described by Representative Tom Downey, the basketball-playing Democrat from Long Island, as ''a theme park.'' Its theme is government and politics. New York is known for its pasta, its Hunan and its Sichuan food, its fine French sauces, maybe even a little potato pancake here and there. Washington's most tangible product is paper - the Congressional Record, volumes of statistics and publicity releases from elected officials to constituents. Imagine the Mayor cheering while Harry Carson and his pals flatten the Redskins on Sunday and the next day receiving a truckload of confetti from Oliver North's paper shredder? No, sir, Ed Koch is no fool. He has managed to get New York virtually to himself on Sunday, which will be the closest day the region is likely to ever have to staging a Super Bowl. I shouldn't be telling you this, but New York is at its pacific best when everybody is watching a big game. In the years when I was not working in sports, we used to spend Super Bowl Sunday in midtown, wherever there was not a television set. Never will I forget the civility of headwaiters, glad to find us a quiet table, eager to inform us of the specialties of the day. I recall one touch of football mania when Maestro Mehta requested that patrons refrain from wearing radio earphones during the concert, lest they cheer out loud during the cello solo. With football fans all presented and accounted for in front of the tube, you could walk at a brisk pace on the sidewalks. You could browse through the stacks at a record store. You could do your grocery shopping for the week. You could buy a new wardrobe. Whatever else you want to say about him, Ed Koch knows this city. While those patient, faithful Giant fans are cheering their heroes - at least until Phil Simms misses on third down - New York is going to be paradise. I can see him now, seated with a few friends in his favorite little joint on Pell Street, ordering the fried rice and the Peking duck, and maybe some eggplant in garlic sauce on the side. The adjacent tables are empty, no irate taxpayers to remind the Mayor of garbage uncollected, potholes unfilled. The waiter pours cups of steaming green tea and somebody says ''cheesesteak sandwich'' and everybody laughs.

462-> Broadway Gets 'Coastal Disturbances'
The Circle in the Square Theater announced yesterday that it will present the Second Stage production of ''Coastal Disturbances,'' beginning Feb. 14. Negotiations for the play, which ended a limited run on New Year's Day at the Second Stage, an Off Off Broadway theater, with virtually no interest from a commercial producer, were nearly completed last week for a commercial Off Broadway run at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village. However, the original producers and the playwright felt that more people would be assured of seeing the play in a production at Circle in the Square, according to a co-artistic director of the Second Stage, Robyn Goodman. Circle in the Square is a Broadway house whose productions are eligible for Tony Awards.

Japan has decided to drop barriers to orange imports but to maintain quotas on beef after the United States-Japan agreement on those products expires in 1988, the newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported today. Japan agreed to import 93,000 tons of oranges from the United States in fiscal year 1984 and increase imports by 11,000 tons a year, reaching 126,000 tons in fiscal 1987, the last year of the agreement. The Japanese fiscal year starts April 1.

464-> G.E.'s Costly Locomotive Gamble
THE General Electric Company and the General Motors Corporation routinely racked up big profits from their locomotive divisions during the late 1970's. But G. E., which straggled with 25 percent of the domestic market, wanted more. ''We were second in the industry because there were two of us. That didn't fit Jack Welch's definition of second,'' said Carl J. Schlemmer, who has run the G. E. unit that produces locomotives since 1974. John E. ''Jack'' Welch Jr. is the chairman of G. E., a man known for insisting that G. E. rank first or second in all its core businesses. With Mr. Welch's blessing, Mr. Schlemmer's transportation business systems operations group, which produces power systems for transit cars, oil rigs and off-road trucks, along with locomotives, plunged into a modernization program that has cost more than $500 million since 1981. G. E. has emerged with what is widely acknowledged to be a ''world-class'' automation showcase at this 175-acre complex, where it has been making locomotives since 1910. And it caught up with G. M., taking about 50 percent of new orders in recent years. But company executives have as much reason to cry as crow. The always cyclical locomotive market has fallen into an unexpectedly deep and prolonged recession that is robbing them of the payoff they anticipated. Mr. Schlemmer said bluntly that had the company foreseen the extent of the slump, it would not have invested so heavily - and probably would have ended up abandoning the business entirely. Having embarked on the modernization, however, G. E. discovered cost-cutting potential it hadn't envisioned and now hopes to prosper when business picks up. G. E. says that its locomotive business is currently limping along at 30 percent of capacity - ''marginally profitable'' according to Mr. Schlemmer. Its rival G. M. has not produced any locomotives since November; it is currently depending entirely on rebuild and spare-parts orders. The chastened Mr. Schlemmer now believes that domestic railroads may buy as few as 300 new locomotives this year - down from the already-low 525 reported last year by Railway Age Magazine - and that demand will rebound only to between 600 and 800 in the foreseeable future. A typical locomotive sells for between $750,000 and $1 million. As recently as 1979, the domestic railroads bought more than 1,700 locomotives. Manufacturing experts said that G. E.'s experience in Erie provides a classic example of the risks that companies take when they embark on modernization programs that require heavy capital investment. G. E.'s program included such low cost measures as improving quality and inventory control and designing its products for ease of manufacture. BUT the company also poured tens of millions of dollars into computer-controlled equipment such as a flexible machining center, a plasma-burning unit and a 12-story automated warehouse. The brightly painted machines stand out as islands of modernity in the vast, decades-old facility, which encompasses a score of buildings. The heavy outlays meant that G. E. would have to have sizable increases in sales just to break even. Steven Walleck, head of manufacturing consulting for McKinsey & Company, said that for an investment like G. E.'s to pay off, it must result in a product that creates significant new demand - either through new features or a lower price. ''They didn't change the name of the game,'' said Mr. Walleck, who contrasted the Erie experience with G. E.'s renovation of its dishwasher facility in Louisville, Ky. In that case, G. E.'s line of dishwashers was able to penetrate new markets, and sales boomed. Mr. Welch takes a more optimistic view. He said that the modernization allowed Erie to win foreign orders for which it could never have competed in the past, such as the hotly contested contract to supply over 400 locomotives to China that was completed last summer. ''We think rail transportation will be around a long time,'' Mr. Welch added. ''We now have the most cost-effective plant.'' Whatever its future, Mr. Welch sees the Erie experience as a model of effective damage control. When it became apparent that the market forecasts were wrong, Mr. Schlemmer and those under him restuctured the investment program on the fly. They canceled or delayed portions of it that were aimed at increasing capacity. They also accelerated existing cost-cutting plans and devised new ones. ''This could have been an unmitigated disaster if they hadn't adapted,'' said Mr. Welch. ''This team put yesterday's decision behind it as well as anyone has ever done it in G. E.'' Mr. Schlemmer, a silver-haired executive, said the forecasters, including outside consultants, failed to anticipate the full impact that mergers in the railroad industry would have on the demand for locomotives. Nor did they foresee the international debt crisis that curtailed the spending plans of such major export customers as Brazil and Mexico. And falling oil prices after 1979 made it harder to sell new engines on the basis of greater fuel efficiency, once a major selling point. The biggest error, though, was underestimating the impact of productivity gains made by the domestic railroads. Deregulation has enabled them to abandon peripheral routes, schedule their existing fleet much more efficiently and exploit the improved performance of the newest generation of engines. That mistake haunts Mr. Schlemmer because G. E. itself had plenty of examples in its own plant of how more efficient use of machinery could reduce materials needs. ''They were doing the same kind of thing we were,'' said Mr. Schlemmer. ''Everyone in the heavy industrial sector of the economy has been on a productivity binge.'' Neither Mr. Walleck nor any other consultant is saying that it is easy to parlay a modernization program into radical market gains. Such blue-chip corporations as the International Business Machines Corporation (typewriters) and John Deere & Company (tractors) have also been plagued by weak sales after putting huge sums into modernization projects that rank as major engineering achievements. INDEED, G. E. Erie's larger rival, G. M.'s electromotive division, has invested $600 million since 1982 in locomotives and related business and now faces a similar uphill battle to harvest healthy profits. ''It's an example of a class of problems that I run across all the time as I work with companies,'' said Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor who is considered a leading expert on international competitiveness. ''It shows how difficult adjustment is, particularly in capital-intensive industries that are not growing rapidly. You are choosing among bad alternatives.'' But Professor Porter said that such investment, despite its risks, is a bet that must be placed. ''Too many companies will face that situation without investing and slowly bleed to death,'' he said. In G. E.'s case, the potential for misplaying its investment cards at Erie was high because of both the scope of the project and the timing. ''There were more than 1,000 identified parts to the program and there weren't any models of how to do something like this when we began planning in the late 1970's,'' said Duane Shull, manager of the automation group that led the modernization program from the early planning stages in 1979 until 1985. ''We were flying blind,'' said Mr. Shull, who is now head of a G. E. automation systems group in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Shull's Erie team spent two years planning before making its first investment, starting with a ''story board'' on which ideas were posted - a technique he said was copied from methods used by Walt Disney in making animated films. G. E. also tried to minimize risks by using outside consultants and inviting railroads to make suggestions on design changes. In addition, the company set up quality circles to encourage employees to contribute ideas on cost-savings and quality. When market projections showed signs of unraveling as the $316 million first phase progressed, G. E. began modifying the plans. About $50 million in investments intended primarily to increase capacity from 600 units to 800 were canceled, while others aimed at cutting costs were accelerated or added. TODAY, bare patches of concrete that had been mapped out as the site for new equipment are visible alongside the gleaming stations in the $16 million computer-controlled engine machining center -mute testimony to both the company's change in plans and continued hopes that more capacity may one day be needed. G. E. also stepped up the hunt for design changes and reductions in the work force that could pare expenses. White-collar employment has been pared 43 percent since 1983, to less than 1,500, by eliminating several layers of management; the blue-collar force has been cut from 7,400, to 3,600. The Erie plant has reduced its annual operating costs by $200 million - more than 25 percent - since 1983, according to Mr. Schlemmer. Neither G. E. nor G. M. releases earnings figures for its transport group. Mr. Schlemmer said that G. E.'s is ''marginally profitable'' at the moment. But he said the latest round of cost-cutting has left G. E. Erie with tremendous leverage in the event of an upswing. ''We are now structured so that a little more volume will make it look like the company needed five more investments like this one,'' he claimed. The current sales slump is already twice as long as the previous one in the mid-1970's. The order book at the G. E. division consists of just 25 diesel engines for the Norfolk and Southern Railroad, a nearly completed contract covering 10 locomotives for the Goverment of Kenya, and 96 engines that are being rebuilt for Burlington Northern. The domestic market may not pick up significantly for several years, although delayed replacement of the current fleet might eventually produce a boomlet of demand. The short-term outlook in major export markets is also dismal and, as always, there is competition from European and Japanese manufacturers. Mr. Schlemmer said that there are few opportunities to sell to other industrialized nations, most of which have state-owned railroads with engine-building subsidiaries or close ties to domestic companies. In the absence of new sales, orders for rebuilding and spare parts pick up some of the slack. But with three of every four locomotives in the existing fleet built by General Motors, G. E. is at a disadvantage. In the past six months, G. E. has begun building small quantities of parts for inventory, which will cut delivery time on new orders. One benefit of the modernization program has been the installation of computer-controlled machining equipment that is flexible enough to machine parts for non-locomotive transportation systems. That has allowed G. E. to shut down older, less-efficient machinery in other parts of the complex. ''Our investments put us in a position to hold on to what little we have and get what's out there, but we are like a big engine idling, raring to go,'' said John Aymong, manager of the new computer-controlled flame-cutting shop that produces - just in time for use - parts that are welded into locomotive bodies. ''It is disheartening.'' G.E.'S MODERNIZATION: THE UNION VIEW There's no praise for G.E. Erie's modernization program at the nearby headquarters of Local 506 of the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, which represents most of the complex's blue-collar workers. Union leaders view key elements of the program as schemes to chip away at hard-won rights and wages. They are angry, for example, that G.E. used a significant chunk of its $500 million to set up engine production at a non-union service shop in Grove City, 80 miles to the south. And they complain that G.E.'s drive to cut costs has led it to lay off union workers, such as janitors, and begin contracting for services from non-union sources. The company has also closed down some production operations and switched to buying from outside suppliers. G.E. says that sharing information with its workforce, retraining programs, and quality circles are vital parts of its modernization. The union charges that such practices divide workers and are designed to circumvent the union's authority. In one notable case, the company flew a group of employees, including four members of the local 506 executive board, to Japan to see Japanese technology and labor-managenemt cooperation in action. Local 506 expelled the four officials from the board for violating the union's rule against participating in company-sponsored trips. ''If we thought the Japanese had anything to teach us, we'd pay for sending members ourselves,'' said Adam Fiorvanti, business agent for the local. Fueling Local 506's antagonism is the memory that the modernization plan originally projected stable or even expanding employment instead of the 50 percent reduction experienced to date.

465-> SCOUTING; Stars & Stripes Finds a Groove
If Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes is able to beat New Zealand today on the America's Cup race course in Fremantle, Australia, it may be due in part to a new ''secret weapon'' that Conner's syndicate revealed yesterday. In scheduling an announcement, the Conner camp alluded to a technological development that ''you see every day and yet you have not seen.'' The mystery weapon turned out to be a new plastic film attached in sheets to the hull of Stars & Stripes. Developed with the cooperation of 3M, the coating is designed to make a boat slip through the water with greater speed. The material is not clear and smooth like a plastic sandwich wrap. Instead, the 2-or-3-foot plastic panels are etched with fine grooves, referred to as ''riblets.'' The idea stems from initial work by NASA, which determined that a micro-grooved surface creates less drag than a totally smooth one. The technical name for the film, which is as thin and clear as Scotch tape, is drag reduction film. From a distance, there is no visible difference in the slate blue hull of Stars & Stripes. But up close, a surface similar to the fine grooves on a 33-R.P.M. record is visible. ''We had tested over 40 coatings, from gops to goops and paints, looking for finishes that were better than the state-of-the-art,'' said John Marshall, the team's design coordinator. Most 12-Meter yachts have a hard surface that needs to be sanded wet each day to keep it smooth. The etched surface of the film, which reduces hull turbulence, is also being tested by the Boeing Company to reduce air turbulence around its jets. Stars & Stripes was coated with the film for its semifinal series against Tom Blackaller's USA, which Conner's boat won in four straight races. While Marshall refuses to claim the film made the difference between winning and losing, he concedes it improved boat speed. Chris Dickson, skipper of New Zealand, seemed unimpressed at a news conference earlier yesterday. He recited detailed information about the plastic before Conner's group released its information. Dickson said his boat also has used a coating after testing a variety of brands, including the material from 3M, which said through a representative that its contract with Stars & Stripes is exclusive.

467-> WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LITERACY TUTORS Literacy Volunteers of Westchester estimates that there are more than 20,000 adults in the county who are functionally illiterate, and that the number has been increasing. ''In the last five years we are getting more high-school graduates who cannot read,'' said Joy Powell at the organization's headquarters on the campus of Westchester Community College in Valhalla. A countywide effort to train volunteers and recruit students is under way for 1987, with one trainee workshop beginning this week at the New Rochelle Public Library. Tutors must be high-school graduates, but they need no other educational qualifications. Sessions are scheduled from 9:30 A.M. to noon Wednesday and Friday through Jan. 23. Those who successfully complete the program will be assigned to students in their area. Students are accepted from the minimum age of 16, whether or not they are still in school. There is no upper age limit. ''Tutors are taught a mixture of teaching methods,'' said Ms. Powell, ''including word association and sounding out. There is a lot of participation in role playing and acting out potentially difficult situations. Tutors may also get involved in teaching conversational English as a second language, but they do not have to speak a second language themselves. It's sometimes hard to establish communication with someone who speaks almost no English, but students are so highly motivated that it eventually works out.'' She added: ''Recently we have had many women in their 50's and 60's call us about their husbands, who have somehow been functioning without learning how to read for more than 30 years. Now that they are retired, and cannot read stories to their grandchildren, they are willing to let their wives set up appointments for them. Widespread publicity has removed some of the stigma. They realize they are not alone.'' For more information about training programs in other locations, or to register as a student or tutor trainee call 592-2656. SINGERS WANTED The Westchester Choral Society needs singers in all voice ranges for its May 9 performance of Brahms's ''Ein Deutsches Requiem'' at the Performing Arts Center, State University of New York at chase. Auditions are to be held at 7 P.M. each Tuesday in January at St. Bartholomew's Church, 82 Prospect Street, White Plains. Lyndon Woodside is the director. Call 693-2453 for more information. BRAIN DEVELOPMENT Jacqueline Hammer's workshop on developing the abilities of the right side of the brain, attended by capacity audiences each year since 1984, will be repeated next weekend at Wainwright House in Rye. Admission to her lecture, from 7:30 to 10 P.M. Friday, is $10; tuition for the lecture plus two workshops from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday is $90. Ms. Hammer, who majored in painting and art history at Columbia University, and also studied at the Art Student's League and Pratt Institute in New York and in Rome, is a professional artist and teacher with a special interest in ''right brain people.'' ''She works with techniques based on new brain research,'' said Kathleen Madden of Wainwright House. ''Participants learn to control the left brain tendency to classify and judge, and to free the right brain's spatial and visual capacity to see as an artist does.'' ''She contends that everyone has the functional ability to draw, and she employs visualization exercises to loosen up the right brain's creativity,'' Ms. Madden said.

Free seating is available on a first-come basis. The library is located in downtown New Rochelle at Library Plaza. REPORT ON DRUG ''Hope For The Future'' is the title of a talk about advances in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by John P. Blass, professor of neurology and medicine at Cornell University, and director of dementia research services at Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains. The program begins at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the center's Wood Pavilion, Room G41, sponsored by the Westchester Chapter of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc. The focus of Dr. Blass' talk will be tetrahydroaminoacridine, or THA, a new oral drug treatment recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. According to the report, 10 out of 17 patients to whom the drug was administered in a University of California study improved significantly and had no serious side effects. Continued research and testing must be done before the drug can be assessed for widespread use. Burke Rehabilitation Center is at 785 Mamaroneck Avenue. Families of patients and those interested in the subject may attend free of charge. Call 428-1919 for more information.

470-> SYNAGOGUE IS URGED NEAR AUSCHWITZ SITE OF CONVENT BY KOCH
Mayor Koch today proposed to Franciszek Cardinal Macharski of Cracow that a synagogue be constructed near a recently opened Carmelite cloister at Auschwitz that has offended some Jewish groups. ''It would be a wonderful thing if Auschwitz could be an ecumenical center for meditation and prayer,'' said the Mayor, who is on a vacation visit to Poland at his expense. He said that in his hour-and-a-half audience with the Roman Catholic Cardinal, whose see includes the area of the Nazi concentration camp, Cardinal Macharski had told him that the camp was the single greatest site of horror that he knew. As Mr. Koch spoke with reporters, Cardinal Macharski nodded in agreement. The Cardinal has recently met with European Jewish leaders and traveled to Jerusalem to learn of Jewish sensitivities about the convent. Discussions With Jewish Groups ''Dialogue is continuing,'' said the Cardinal, who, as Bishop of Cracow holds the same post as that held by Pope John Paul II before his elevation. The Cardinal said there have been many discussions with representatives of organizations such as B'nai B'rith about the existing convent and about plans for other religious memorials. After the morning meeting with the Cardinal, Mr. Koch visited a children's hospital, discussed snow removal with Cracow's Mayor and stopped at a 14th-century synagogue. Mr. Koch was advised by reporters that Jerzy Urban, the Polish Government spokesman, had said in Warsaw that it seemed unlikely that the Mayor would be received by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.

471-> THE WORLD; Military Exercise Starts in Honduras
Thousands of United States Army and National Guard troops have been showing the Reagan Administration's military muscle in Honduras virtually continuously since 1982. Last week, Pentagon officials said that 1,100 troops from the United States had begun another joint military exercise that will last until April. United States officials in Honduras said a total of 3,000 would take part. In addition, the country expected this week the first of 4,500 National Guardsmen who will be rotated in until May. The United States contingent will be improving airstrips in southern Honduras near Nicaragua, building a dirt road, and taking part in field maneuvers with Honduran troops, the announcement said. An additional 1,100 troops from the United States are permanently stationed at Palmerola Air Base north of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. Nicaragua has criticized the exercises as provocative, accusing Washington of preparing an invasion. Also last week, officials said President Reagan would ask Congress for another $100 million for the rebels this year, despite opposition expected in the new Democratic-controlled Congress.

473-> New York Court Should Set Up Corruption Panel
To the Editor: A state-city panel studying New York City's corruption scandal has urged Gov. Mario Cuomo to establish a special commission to look into corruption and improper political influence in the city (front page, Dec. 19). But what legal basis would be used to charter such a commission, and what mechanism would be used to select its members? If the Governor acts under the Moreland Act, there might be a question about the commission's jurisdiction, and also it would not have the power to grant immunity, which is an essential tool in such an investigation. This risk could be avoided if the commission were to be established by the Legislature. A more important point concerns the all-important question, Who will be the members of this commission, and how will they be selected? It is vital that the commissioners be nonpartisan and above politics, and not afraid to embarrass the political powers that be - and that includes Governor Cuomo. On Aug. 21, 1930, Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a letter to the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division of the First Judicial Department, asking for a recommendation for a referee to investigate corruption. The Appellate Division promptly responded, designating Judge Samuel Seabury. Governor Cuomo should follow Governor Roosevelt's professional example and ask the Appellate Division to designate the chairman, chief counsel and commission members. New York City needs the toughest, most fiercely independent people possible for such an undertaking. They must be chosen by the Appellate Court, not by Governor Cuomo or Mayor Koch.

474-> IRISH CHEF, CALIFORNIA-STYLE
FOR years, much of the cooking in Ireland's restaurants has been of the ''Gravy, sir? One lump or two?'' school. The current 23 percent tax on all restaurant bills has not exactly helped, nor has the law against serving any liquor except wine; not even Irish whisky or beer is allowed. All this is beginning to change. The Irish are finally coming up with their own breed of chefs, home-trained and dedicated, who are correcting the country's sorry reputation in the kitchen. Myrtle Allen, co-owner with her husband, Ivan, of Ballymaloe House in Shanagarry, County Cork, is one of the reasons why. ''Myrtle Allen is one of the first to produce good cooking in Ireland in the modern style,'' says Jane Grigson, one of Britain's leading food authorities. ''She's on the California wavelength, using the very best ingredients and encouraging young purveyors, such as oyster Recipes are on page C4. growers and people who make oatmeal or smoked salmon. She's a cross between Alice Waters and St. Bridget -a missionary, but sophisticated with it.'' Myrtle Allen is to Irish food what Alice Waters is to California cuisine. Like Alice Waters, Mrs. Allen, a self-taught cook, uses the freshest and highest-quality local ingredients, and prepares them in imaginative and eclectic ways. Her dishes are noted for their intensity of flavor: Sauces are French-inspired, subtle and light; vegetables are cooked within hours of being picked; fish are caught in the nearby Bay of Ballycotton the day they are served. This is not nouvelle or haute cuisine - no potato lattice baskets, mountains of truffles or minimally designed plates here. Rather, it is farmhouse cooking executed with sophistication and flair. ''If I could start a fashion,'' Mrs. Allen says, ''it would be to recapture some forgotten flavors and to preserve those that may soon die.'' Just how good Mrs. Allen's cooking is can be measured by her audacity - and success - in running an Irish restaurant in Paris between 1981 and 1985. At La Ferme Irlandaise, near the Place de l'Opera, Parisians dine on Irish stew, buttered parsnips, gooseberry fool and carrigeen (Irish moss) pudding with whisky sauce. The ingredients are brought in from Cork. The Allens have exerted a powerful influence locally, not only by training young cooks in their restaurant kitchen, but also by supporting the better purveyors. In addition, Mrs. Allen runs a cooking school with her daughter-in-law, Darina, offering courses for professionals and amateurs. Graduates from both the school and restaurant have gone on to restaurants of their own or as chefs in professional kitchens throughout Europe. Ballymaloe House sits amid sheep-grazing pastures, surrounded by dark knolls, stony ridges and screens of trees. The 30-room house, dating from 1641, is built around a Norman castle; wings were added in the 18th and 19th centuries. The hotel is a family-run operation. Four of the Allens' six children work there, as do their spouses and some grandchildren. Timothy, who is married to Darina, and Rory Allen, whose wife, Hazel, supervises housekeeping, farm Ballymaloe's 400 acres. Jim Whelan, whose wife, Wendy, runs the hotel's craft shop, shares the buying of wines with Mr. Allen. Sasha, a grandson, occasionally acts as wine steward. Fern, the youngest child, opened the Art Gallery Cafe in Cork two months ago. Depending on the season, a four-course dinner might include zucchini flowers stuffed with fish mousse, fish bisque scented with saffron, potato soup laced with fresh herbs, pink grilled trout, a spiced mutton pie and smoked Clonmel ham, all served with vegetables, beautifully cooked and presented. Or there is the calf's liver sauteed and served in a delicate cream sauce flavored with tarragon and Irish whisky, a prime example of Mrs. Allen's skill in finding novel uses for Irish ingredients. Desserts range from fruit sorbets and compotes to a blackberry and apple pie with a melt-in-the-mouth pastry crust. The cheese board consists of the best Irish farmhouse cheeses, with names like Gigginstown, Mulleen and Gubbeens - something of a novelty since the art of cheese-making was revived in 1973, when Ireland joined the European Community. Because of the community quota system, only a limited amount of milk production is allowed; the surplus is used for cheese. Of an afternoon, Mrs. Allen, an energetic woman in her early 60's, can be seen strolling through her greenhouses in gum boots, picking zucchini flowers, selecting the ripest tomatoes for chutney or checking through a pile of apples. She and her husband, Ivan, who is also in his 60's, moved here as newlyweds in 1948. Mr. Allen was a gentleman farmer; Mrs. Allen, who had had an abiding interest in food, became a food writer for The Irish Farmer's Journal. ''In 1964, there wasn't a good restaurant around here,'' she explains. ''I saw a series of articles in The London Sunday Times by Robert Carrier on dining in country houses in France, and I realized that given the good produce we had, Ballymaloe could have the same sort of appeal.'' In the winter, the Allens offered cooking classes for local people to finance their operations during the off-season. This evolved into a three-month course, when Fern, her daughter, had difficulty getting into a London cooking school. Now, cooking classes are held in Darina's Regency farmhouse down the road. The Allens first used meat from their own livestock, eggs from their own hens, fruits and vegetables. But it was too time-consuming. Today, everything except the fruits and vegetables is bought locally. This has generated problems of its own, however. ''You can't do anything if you don't have good material,'' Mrs. Allen says. ''But nowadays, everything is done with a view to long shelf life. No one thinks about freshness.'' Her latest problem is getting good bacon. She left her supplier of 20 years because, she says, the quality dropped. ''It happens all the time,'' she says. ''Another bacon factory here was approached by a large supermarket chain, so they employed more people and set up a production line. Twelve months later the supermarket people found they could import bacon from the Continent for 5 pence a pound less. So the factory went bust.'' In Ireland, she went on, ''we need to concentrate on two things: keeping the quality and getting people to use the wonderful raw materials that are available in our own country.'' CALF'S LIVER WITH IRISH WHISKY AND TARRAGON 4 slices calf's liver (about 1 1/2 pounds) Flour for dredging 2 tablespoons butter 1 clove garlic, minced 4 tablespoons Irish whisky 3/4 to 1 cup chicken or veal stock, preferably homemade 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tar ragon 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream Coarse salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste. 1.Wipe the liver dry with paper towels and dredge lightly with flour, shaking off excess. 2.Melt the butter in a large frying pan and brown the liver pieces on both sides. Remove to a dish and keep warm. 3.Add the garlic, saute for a minute, then add the Irish whisky and bring to a boil. Add the stock and cook, stirring, until thickened. 4.Add the tarragon and heavy cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. 5.Return the liver to the pan and coat with the sauce. (Allow the liver to cook a little more if necessary, but beware of overcooking.) Yield: 4 servings. STEAK AND PIGEON PIE 4 ounces streaky bacon, in one piece 4 whole pigeon breasts, skinned and sliced in strips (see note) 2 pounds lean beef, trimmed of fat and sliced in strips 8 baby carrots, scraped 8 small white onions, peeled 1 tablespoon flour 2 cups meat or chicken stock 1 cup dry red wine Z cup tomato puree 1 clove garlic, crushed 2 tablespoons chopped thyme 2 teaspoons chopped parsley Coarse salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste 3 ounces white mushrooms, sliced 1 tablespoon butter 6 ounces short crust or puff pas try, enough for a 9-inch pastry lid 1 egg, beaten. 1.Remove the rind from the bacon and cut the bacon into thin strips. Brown in a heavy casserole, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 2.Add the pigeon, brown lightly and drain on paper towels. Add the beef strips, brown and remove to drain. 3.Carefully brown the vegetables without burning and remove. Stir in the flour, cook for half a minute (without burning), and then add the stock, wine and tomato puree. Bring to boil, scraping up the coagulated cooking juices in the bottom of the casserole. 4.Return the meat and vegetables to the casserole, along with the garlic, thyme and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 5.Cover and cook until tender, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. (This dish may be cooked on top of the stove or in a preheated 300-degree oven.) Allow to cool and skim off any fat that may have risen to the surface. 6.Saute the mushrooms in the butter and set aside. Add to the pie filling. Taste and adjust the seasonings. 7.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 8.Roll out the pie crust so that it is large enough to cover a 7-cup pie dish - 9 inches across. Turn the filling into the pie dish and cover with the pastry. Brush with the beaten egg and make a few small slashes in the pie lid to allow steam to escape. Bake for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, or until the meat is bubbling and hot and the pastry is cooked. Yield: 6 to 8 servings. NOTE: Chicken breasts may be used instead of pigeon. BALLYMALOE IRISH STEW 3 pounds lean lamb neck, with bones, cut into pieces 6 carrots 4 medium-size onions 2 1/2 to 3 cups rich meat or chicken stock Coarse salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste 8 medium-size potatoes, peeled 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 1 tablespoon chopped chives. 1.Trim the fat from the lamb neck. Shred a tablespoon of the fat and melt it in a heavy casserole dish. Brown the meat, a few pieces at a time, in the fat. 2.Meanwhile, scrape the carrots and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the onions and cut into quarters. 3.Remove the meat from the casserole and carefully brown the carrots and onions, without burning. Return the meat to the casserole and add the stock. Season with salt and pepper, stir well and simmer gently for one hour, covered. 4.Place the potatoes on top of the casserole and simmer for another hour. 5.Remove the meat and vegetables from the casserole with a slotted spoon and place them in a heated serving dish. With a large spoon, skim the fat from the juices left in the casserole. Pour the juices over the meat and vegetables. Sprinkle with parsley and chives and serve. Yield: 4 servings. CARRAGEEN MOSS PUDDING 1/4 cup dried carrageen moss (available in health-food stores) 1 cup tepid water 3 3/4 cups milk 2 tablespoons sugar 2 eggs, separated into yolks and whites 1 teaspoon vanilla essence. 1.Soak the carrageen in the tepid water for 10 minutes. Place it in a heavy saucepan with the milk. Simmer gently for 20 minutes, making sure the mixture does not boil over. Pour through a strainer into a mixing bowl. The carrageen will now be swollen and jellylike. Rub the jelly through the strainer into the mixing bowl. 2.Add the sugar, egg yolks and the vanilla essence. Mix thoroughly. 3.Whisk the egg whites until stiff and fold in. Pour the mixture into a serving bowl or individual glasses, and chill. Yield: 4 to 6 servings. NOTE: Carrageen can be served with fruit compote or a caramel sauce. BALLYMALOE BROWN BREAD 1 pound whole-wheat flour, pref erable stone ground 2 level teaspoons salt 1/2 ounce yeast (2 one-quarter- ounce packages) 1 tablespoon black treacle or dark molasses Approximately 1 1/4 cups warm water. 1.Mix the flour with the salt and warm it in an oven set at a very low temperature, around 250 degrees. Stir in the yeast. Dissolve the treacle in 1/4 cup of the warm water and stir that into the flour. 2.Add enough of the remaining water to make a dough that is just wet enough to knead. Place the dough in a greased warm 2 1/2-inch-by-8-inch baking tin. Cover with a warm dish towel and leave in a warm place until the dough has risen by about a third (about 45 minutes). 3.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bake the bread for about 40 minutes, brush the top with water and bake 5 minutes more. The loaf should be browned on top and should sound hollow when tapped. Turn out to cool. Yield: 1 loaf. NOTE: This bread requires no kneading and only one rising.

475-> SHULTZ RAISES HEROIN ISSUE IN NIGERIA
Heroin trafficking, American wheat imports, South Africa and Libyan moves in Chad were discussed today by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Nigerian leaders after Mr. Shultz flew in for a quick round of talks in Africa's most populous country. After meetings with the President of the military Government, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, and Foreign Minister Bolaji Akinyemi, Mr. Shultz praised Nigeria's economic changes. Those changes include devaluating the currency, the naira, ending some subsidies and shifting away from Government control of parts of the produce market. ''They are already working,'' he said of the changes. ''They're seeing results from them.'' He spoke at a news conference before leaving for the Ivory Coast, Nigerian officials did not make themselves available to reporters to discuss any aspects of the talks. American officials say Nigeria has become a transit point for heroin from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Thailand to the United States. Some discussions today included Nigerian law enforcement officials and focused on joint efforts to stop the trade. Official to Visit U.S. Mr. Shultz publicly invited Attorney General Bola A. Ajibola to Washington to meet with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d ''with the hope that we can work out a mutual legal assistance treaty that will enable us to work together effectively.'' The Secretary said later that Mr. Ajibola had accepted. Nigerians are arrested almost daily trying to smuggle heroin into the United States, an American Embassy official said. Some of those arrested had earlier presented diplomatic notes from the Nigerian Government when applying for United States visas, indicating possible complicity by some Nigerian officials. Nigerian customs inspectors frequently take bribes to not open bags, the American official said, although the authorities here have recently begun penalizing corrupt inspectors with arrest, dismissal or transfers. Nigeria had no narcotics law until March 1985, the American official said. In 1986, the United States Customs Service held a course here for about 40 Nigerian customs agents on how to notice and search airline passengers who might be carrying drugs. There were 294 drug-smuggling arrests here in 1986. American officials say the Nigerian Government is cooperating fully in the effort against drug trafficking. Drugs a Lucrative Business Still, in the midst of a severe economic crisis brought on partly by the drop in world oil prices, drugs have become a lucrative business here. Heroin couriers can earn $1,800 to $2,000 for each trip to the United States, the American official said. Five ounces of high-grade heroin can be bought in India for about $400, he said, smuggled into Nigeria for the price of a plane ticket, less than $1,000, taken to the United States and cut four-to-one with talcum powder or quinine and sold for $125,000. The dollars are then returned to Nigeria and sold on the black market for local currency at four to five times the official exchange rate, inflating the take to the Nigerian equivalent of a million dollars or so. Mr. Shultz also talked about South Africa. He repeated his opposition to apartheid, saying, ''We are in favor of a government that is so arranged that everybody in South Africa, black, white, colored, Indian - whoever they are, has an opportunity to take part.'' An American official quoted Foreign Minister Akinyemi as replying, ''We now seem to be running in tandem.'' The fighting in northern Chad between Chadian and Libyan troops was also discussed, with Nigerian leaders backing the Chadians but worrying about an escalation that could bring in more foreign troops and give the Chadians a more sophisticated stock of weapons. Nigeria shares a border with Chad and is wary of any buildup of Chad's military ability. Economic issues were also a major topic. Mr. Shultz touched on Nigeria's decision last summer to stop importing American wheat, a step taken by this country toward agricultural self-sufficiency. Nigeria imported $225 million in American wheat in 1985, a year in which the United States had a $2.5 billion trade deficit with Nigeria, largely because Nigeria is the United States fifth-largest oil supplier. Mr. Shultz stressed that if Nigeria resumed wheat imports, the United States wanted a share. PRETORIA CRITICIZES SHULTZ JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 12 (Reuters) - South Africa criticized Mr. Shultz today for his comments about its Government. Mr. Shultz said in Nairobi, Kenya, over the weekend that Pretoria should lift the ban on outlawed political parties and open negotiations on a new Government system that allowed all people to take part. ''Unfortunately, there is very little movement in the situation,'' he said. Speaking on state radio, Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha accused Mr. Shultz of trying to draw attention from Washington's ''inconsistent foreign policy through his attacks on South AfMr. Botha said Mr. Shultz did not realize that many African leaders were just as concerned as South Africa about what Pretoria officials termed poor and indecisive United States action against Communist atrocities in Africa.

476-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Mortgage-Backed Securities Offered
Securities dealers offered $700 million of collateralized mortgage obligations yesterday. Demand for the high-quality securities, which offer yields well above Treasury issues, remains strong from foreign and domestic investors. Goldman, Sachs & Company offered $400 million of fixed- and floating-rate issues backed by a pool of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation's 9 1/2 percent particpation certificates. Rated AAA by S.&P., the floating-rate portion pays interest of seven-tenths percentage point more than the offered rate for three-month interbank deposits in London. Yields on the four fixed-rate tranches range from 7.44 percent for an issue with a 3.3-year average life to 9.15 percent for one with an 18.1-year life. Another financing, handled through Salomon Brothers, consists of $300 million of fixed- and floating-rate collateralized mortgage obligations in the United States and abroad. They are backed by a pool of Government National Mortgage Association pass-through certificiates with a weighted average coupon of 11.6 percent. The domestic offering includes $120 million of floating-rate C.M.O.'s due in 2017 with an estimated average life of 2.97 years and an initial yield of 6.65 percent. Also, $60 million of fixed-rate obligations have the same average life and a yield of 7.28 percent, or 95-hundredths percentage point more than three-year Treasury notes. Interest on the floating-rate issue will be adjusted quarterly at one-half percentage point more than the London interbank rate. The same terms apply to another $120 million issue of floating-rate obligations offered in the Eurobond market.

477-> Reagan's Drug Policy: a Bust
President Reagan's proposal to reduce drastically Federal anti-drug funding in fiscal 1988 and 1989 proves he never really believed in his own drug abuse policies. Before last November's elections, when political pollsters reported that drug abuse was voters' No. 1 concern, surpassing even nuclear war, President Reagan made this his No. 1 priority. In a major speech last August, he declared a ''national crusade against drugs, a sustained, relentless effort to rid America of this scourge.'' Now he wants to eliminate all of the $225 million for fiscal 1988 state and local drug law enforcement that he approved in October. He also wants to cut by 60 percent the $250 million for drug prevention and education programs and to provide no new funds at all for drug treatment in fiscal 1988. The reality behind the rhetoric of the Reagan anti-drug program is dismal failure. After six years of highly publicized drug ''strike forces,'' and a $700 million increase in enforcement programs, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d acknowledges that ''the gap between the amount of drugs seized and the amount imported and consumed is growing annually.'' In his speech last August, Mr. Reagan admitted publicly that ''all the confiscation and law enforcement in the world will not cure this plague.'' It is scant comfort that he remains totally committed to his constitutionally vulnerable urinalysis program for Federal employees, for which he has already diverted $56 million from other scarce drug program funds. Nancy Reagan's highly publicized personal crusade against drug use by children seems to have had no effect whatsoever on public policy, for Federal funds for drug abuse education, prevention and treatment have been reduced by more than half since 1981. Drug abuse is too serious and complex a problem to be solved by campaign speeches and good intentions. The swings of political enthusiasm tied to our election cycles - when drug abuse emerges as a major concern, then recedes after the votes are in - make developing a coherent, long-term national strategy difficult. The Reagan record demonstrates that the absence of a well considered plan cannot be disguised by exhortations to ''just say no to drugs.'' Highly visible and dramatic law enforcement programs seem to offer the most politically salable results: seizures of cocaine and marijuana and arrests of drug pushers are the kinds of action voters are used to watching on television programs. Unfortunately, long-term drug prevention-and-treatment efforts are often less attractive politically. They do not produce overnight results, and their impact may not be felt for decades. Since funding in these areas has been erratic and inadequate, America has not used the enormous research potential it could bring to bear on this critical national problem. Investment in research into prevention and treatment is as important in combating drug abuse as it is in the fight against cancer. It must be protected against the vagaries of the political cycle if long-term results are to be achieved. What chance do we have to defeat the $100 billion a year drug traffic if we fight it badly with only hundreds of millions of dollars? A sustained national effort with strong bipartisan support is needed. If President Reagan is unwilling to provide leadership, Congress should develop a 10-year strategy with adequate and assured funding for drug enforcement, research, prevention and treatment as well as a vigorous international control program. Responsibility for this effort should be centralized in a single Cabinet-level office in order to prevent the dozens of Federal agencies involved in foreign and domestic drug programs from setting competing priorities. Congress voted overwhelmingly to create such a drug ''czar'' in 1983, but Mr. Reagan vetoed the legislation. He objected to creating another Cabinet department, but the real reason was the Justice Department did not want to cede any prerogatives. How many more personal tragedies and empty political promises do we have to witness, how many more lives and opportunities do we have to lose before the country makes a credible, cost-effective, long-term commitment to reduce drug abuse?

478-> DOUBT EXRESSED ON SOVIET PULLOUT
Despite growing signs of interest by the Soviet Union in getting its troops out of Afghanistan, American officials and foreign diplomats said today that an early withdrawal seems unlikely unless the Afghan insurgents moderate their opposition to forming a coalition government acceptable to Moscow. A flurry of diplomatic activity has taken place in recent days among senior American and Soviet officials in Pakistan, which provides the main sanctuary and supply route for the insurgents. Under Secretary of State Michael H. Armacost was scheduled to return to Washington late tonight after talks in Pakistan, where a Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoly G. Kovalev, was also holding meetings. The Afghan leader, Najib, has said that his Government and the Soviet Union have agreed on a timetable for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers. The timetable has not been made public, although it is expected to be submitted at the next round of indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is scheduled to convene in Geneva next month under United Nations auspices. Informally, Moscow is reported to have spoken of a withdrawal period of years, during which Pakistan would cut off the flow of insurgent manpower and weapons. Pakistan has suggested four months, an American official said, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz has also spoken of ''months,'' calling for ''a short and decisive Soviet troop withdrawal.'' A 'Decent Interval' Beyond the question of timing, however, lies the more fundamental problem of what kind of government is left behind in Kabul, officials and diplomats believe. They see Soviet officials requiring at least a face-saving political solution to accompany their pullout, a ''decent interval,'' officials have called it, during which a regime friendly to Moscow could preside. Soviet troops were sent into Afghanistan in December 1979 to help crush an insurgency by Islamic tribesmen. Given the long border between the two countries and the grueling war that has cost an estimated 25,000 Soviet lives, Moscow is expected to make any pullout contingent on the creation of an Afghan government that is not dominated by the West or by other elements hostile to the Soviet Union. The United States has already agreed to be a guarantor of the United Nations-sponsored agreements when and if they are completed, a commitment that implies ending the flow of American weapons to the insurgents. Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to abstain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, which would mean closing the Pakistani routes of supply. But neither the United States nor Pakistan appears ready to press the insurgents, known as the mujahedeen, to accept a coalition government that would include some Afghan figures who have served in pro-Soviet regimes. ''We can't force them to accept anything,'' a Pakistani diplomat said. 'Up to the Mujaheddin' A State Department official said: ''Our position is that it's up to the mujaheddin to determine what a future regime would be like. We're not looking for a puppet state for the West, but we won't accept a puppet state for the East. The U.S. is leaving it to the mujahedeen.'' The mujahedeen ended a three-day conference last Saturday in Pakistan with a toughly worded declaration that a government composed of the seven insurgent factions based in Peshawar, Pakistan, would take over after a Soviet withdrawal, a Pakistani diplomat noted. Any Afghan who serves in a government under Soviet domination would be considered a Soviet agent, he said. Diplomats speculated that the uncompromising stance of the Afghan insurgents could be a negotiating position masking some flexibility, but they said they were not sure. One complication is that the United Nations negotiations, in which Pakistan and Afghanistan do not talk directly with each other but through officials of the world organization, do not deal with internal Afghan political affairs. If they are to be resolved, they must be negotiated informally by Pakistan, the United States, Afghanistan, the Soviet Union and the insurgents. Problems With a Coalition Given Afghanistan's history of a weak central government and tribal autonomy, diplomats and officials doubt that the insurgent groups will easily agree to a coalition acceptable to Moscow. And without the presence of Soviet troops, the officials predict, the Soviet-backed Government would not last long. So far, the negotiations have produced agreement on three of the four issues on the agenda: noninterference in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan, international guarantees of Afghanistan's neutrality and the return of the three million Afghan refugees who have fled to Pakistan. The withdrawal timetable is the final piece of the puzzle, United Nations officials say. Pakistan is said to be anxious for a resolution to the conflict. An American official said that during the last year at least 500 sorties have been made by Afghan aircraft, some possibly flown by Soviet pilots, against Afghan refugee camps inside Pakistan. In addition, some restiveness has been detected among Pakistanis about the Afghans in their midst.

482-> FOR HOSPITALS, NEW VENTURES AND NEW PROFITS
Since 1894, Day Kimball Hospital, on the outskirts of the old mill town of Putnam, Conn., has provided most of the health care for the largely rural northeastern corner of the state. These days, corporate offshoots of the hospital are providing something else: a commercial cleaning business for schools and factories, a computerized billing service for doctors in the area and a catering business that uses the hospital's kitchen at off-hours to prepare food for wedding receptions and parties. Across the New York metropolitan region and elsewhere in the country, hospitals such as Day Kimball are rapidly diversifying into businesses that go beyond their traditional role of in-patient care, hospital executives say. To counter a continuing decline in patient admissions and stricter limits on payments for hospital care from insurers and such Government programs as Medicare, hospitals are reorganizing to spawn an array of new ventures to generate more income. Among the new hospital satellites are such real estate projects as professional office buildings for doctors and pharmacies; nursing homes; companies that sell or rent medical equipment to home-bound patients - even a health club. Throughout the country, hospital diversification is ''the wave of the future - in fact it's already here,'' said Andrea Mann, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association in Chicago. The United Hospital in St. Paul and the Metropolitan Medical Center in Minneapolis have begun a joint venture to market frozen food to the elderly in Minnesota, Florida, New York and Indiana. Under the label Nutritious Cuisine, it is distributed through agencies that provide home-health care. In Omaha, an affiliate of the Childrens Memorial Hospital operates Children's Corner, a chain of eight day-care centers serving about 400 children in Omaha and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Hospital officials said that while the new enterprises were separate business ventures, they were, for the most part, related to the activities already performed by hospitals and their workers. For example, in branching out into cleaning, catering and data processing, Day Kimball Hospital is ''using our resources on things we already do well,'' said the hospital's executive director, Charles F. Schneider. ''Cleaning is something we know a lot about,'' he said. Increased Competition In addition, the hospital officials said, increased competition for health care services from walk-in clinics and health maintenance organizations has prompted many hospitals in the region to begin advertising campaigns to make their communities more aware of the services they offer. ''The traditional payers for health care - Government, business, the insurance companies - are doing all they can to contain their expenditures,'' said a spokesman for the Connecticut Hospital Association, Albert F. May Jr. ''Therefore, the traditional sources of revenue are flattening out or declining. Hospitals have to look at new sources of revenue to stay in business, and that's why they are diversifying.'' The result, hospital officials say, has been a wave of corporate restructuring by hospitals in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey within the past three years. Turning to Profits The most common change, officials said, has been the creation of a parent or holding company, with the nonprofit hospital becoming a separate subsidiary to preserve its tax-exempt status and other business ventures grouped into separate divisions, which pay taxes on any profits that flow to the corporate parent and back to the hospital. ''Hospitals right now are very much in the same situation that the auto industry was in five years ago with over-capacity,'' said Lewis H. Titterton Jr., an Albany consultant who advises New York hospitals on diversification. ''The auto companies cut costs, but it's very difficult for hospitals to do that because of their high fixed costs. What they're looking for is alternate uses of their resources.'' In Connecticut, for example, a corporate relative of Stamford Hospital is building a $6 million, 120-bed nursing home on the hospital grounds to provide continuing care for patients who no longer require hospitalization. In Meriden, a corporate satellite of the Meriden-Wallingford Hospital is a partner in a proposed real estate development to include a medical office building and possibly some housing. The satellite also has bought a health and fitness club, about three miles from the hospital, complete with tennis courts and swimming pool. It emphasizes programs, such as losing weight and stopping smoking, that help keep people healthy, rather than ''pumping iron,'' in the words of the hospital's president, Theodore Horwitz. Taking in Laundry Meriden-Wallingford, which now uses about 180 hospital beds as against 280 five years ago, also does laboratory work for other health-care businesses and takes in laundry from two other hospitals. ''As a result, they didn't have to build laundries, and it helps us to fill our excess capacity,'' Mr. Horwitz said. In New Haven, the Hospital of St. Raphael, through corporate divisions, operates a small advertising and public relations agency, plans to open a pharmacy within a month and is undertaking a joint venture with a group of doctors to build a $10 million medical hotel for patients who no longer need hospitilization but are not ready to return home. Hospital officials, citing tight state regulations of the industry, said that diversification was slower in New York and New Jersey than in some other states but that some hospitals had embarked on new enterprises. For example, the Staten Island Hospital, a 470-bed nonprofit institution in Midland Beach, began reorganizing about five years ago. As a teaching hospital providing free care to the indigent, ''we would no longer be able to continue to grow and maintain the highest quality through the reimbursement stream that would be coming from in-patient care,'' said Barry T. Zeman, the hospital president. 'We Have to Make It' A subsidiary of the hospital's corporate parent now operates, among other things, two pharmacies, a graphics company and a company that supplies medical equipment to be used at home, such as hospital beds, wheelchairs and oxygen. ''We don't have large endowments,'' Mr. Zeman said. ''We have to do it the hard way: We have to make it.'' Over the last 18 months, more than a dozen joint ventures have been started by New Jersey hospitals to operate such projects as clinics for ambulatory patients or companies that lease or sell medical equipment to patients at home, said a spokesman for the New Jersey Hospital Association, Ron Czajkowski. He said 21 hospitals in southern New Jersey had recently collaborated on an advertising campaign urging residents to use the hospitals closer to home rather than going to Philadelphia or New York. Fewer Patients At the 110-bed Day Kimball Hospital in Connecticut, where the number of in-patients has declined by about 20 percent in the last five years, officials said their for-profit subsidiaries generated about $66,000 last year, including profits and payments for the use of hospital equipment. The hospital's total budget last year was about $20 million. One subsidiary, Clean Care, has contracts to do the cleaning at a nearby high school and two factories, including Frito-Lay, which makes snack foods. Another subsidiary, Special Occasions, has started a catering service in recent months and has prepared food for such things as a World Series party for 10 people, a wedding reception for 50 and a birthday party for 15. Officials said the hospital's cleaning and kitchen personnel earn extra money in their spare time working for the subsidiaries. ''As hospital costs increase and we see fewer and fewer patients, it allows us to retain employees who otherwise would have been laid off,'' said Stephen Burlingame, chairman of the Day Kimball Foundation, the hospital's corporate parent. The officials said they had encountered some criticism from at least one other cleaning company in eastern Connecticut. But they said that their cleaning service paid taxes and that they had tried to minimize direct competition with local businesses because the hospital relied on the community for its annual fund-raising appeal, which brought in $269,000 last year. Mr. Schneider, the hospital's executive director, said, ''We have tried to remain very sensitive to the community.''

483-> AMERICA'S CUP: THE CHALLENGERS' FINAL; BEYOND THE SKIPPERS, TALENTED TEAMS BRING SMOOTH SAILING: IT'S NOT ALL GLAMOUR IN A WINNING EFFORT
On the way out to racing one day, the crews on Dennis Conner's first and second-string boats noticed a group of schoolgirls hailing from shore. The girls stood there, all in uniform, with hands clasped and their arms stretched over their heads as if each was holding a beachball. It was a salute, one that only Conner's America's Cup team could understand. When the crewmen saw the shoreside lineup, they laughed long and hard. The girls were privy to the mushroom salute, an in-joke in the Conner camp that locals had heard about. The mushroom scenario was created by Conner's backup crew, the team that sails his pace boat, Stars & Stripes '85. Each day as the backup crew would go out to help the top boat tune up, one member of the second boat's crew would ask the skipper, Jack Sutphen, what they would be doing that day. Sutphen never knew the answer until he talked with Conner by radio once they were at sea. After awhile, the second-string crewmen decided they needed an identity of their own. Their motto turned into the B-team logo: ''We're just like mushrooms: kept in the dark.'' They had green shirts printed with a string of 11 gold mushrooms on the back, and they made a mushroom flag to fly off the boat's transom. The backup crews on a 12-Meter are largely an unknown group. They are part of a broad-based operation that includes sailmakers, boat designers, electronics experts, meteorologists, engineers, coaches, sports psychologists, physiologists, riggers, fund-raisers, office personnel, chase boat crews and house staff. Both the Stars & Stripes team and the New Zealand camp - the contenders for the right to challenge for the America's Cup - are better organized than most. In nearly every area, they excel. A sampling of the different components explains why: Crews Having two 11-man crews allows skippers to rotate personnel on the racing boat as well as having enough hands to sail a pace boat for practice sessions. Now that Conner's Stars & Stripes has made it to the challenger's final, the backup crew team rides out to the race course each day on the race boat. The crewmen lug sails, hoist the mainsail and set up the boat for the day's racing. The idea is to save energy for the crew that will do the racing. As soon as the pre-start signal goes off, the backups transfer to the syndicate's powerboat. New Zealand's backup crew still sails the backup boat out to the race course. Chris Dickson, New Zealand's skipper, uses the second boat to try out sails before the start of his race, and generally, for pre-race warmups. Conner's crew has more 12-Meter experience than any other team here. But the New Zealanders closed the gap quickly. ''We just tried to think of every little thing that would make a difference,'' said the shore manager, Peter Wilson. For example, the camp installed a board at the entrance to its sheds here. It listed the jobs required each day for the various positions on the boat. And until he had it down perfectly, each crewman had to sign the card every day. Designers Yacht design is as crucial to a 12-Meter campaign as food is to a dinner table. Both the New Zealand and Stars & Stripes teams have three yacht designers. The idea of combining talent seems to have worked. Conner built four new boats for this campaign; New Zealand built three. The designers' job hasn't ended at the drawing board; each of the three men involved in the project take turns making trips to Fremantle to oversee any changes that might be needed to squeeze out every last knot of boat speed. Sailmakers The New Zealanders set an early example. By deciding to set up their entire sail-making operation in Fremantle, the syndicate could reshape old sails and cut new designs overnight. The sailmakers are a close-knit group who refer to themselves as the ''Blue Dudes.'' Their insignia is a pair of blue sunglasses, and a blue sunglass patch is sewn into the corner of every sail they create. Sailmaking for Stars & Stripes started out as a long-distance project with the sails being made in San Diego and shipped to Fremantle. Delays of several weeks made the team realize that in-house sailmaking made far more sense. In other ways, it may have an edge. Tom Whidden, the chief sailmaker, said his group has a new low-stretch yarn, Spectra 1,000, that will show up in the sails during coming races. The sails are the engines of the boat, and their importance is reflected in the price. A new mainsail costs about $21,000; a genoa, $14,000; and a spinnaker, $8,000. By the time it is through, Stars & Stripes will have spent more than $1.5 million on sails. At any one time, is has 40 sails ready to be hoisted. Electronics Both teams use computers for analyzing performance while the boat is under way. But each has found other ways to make electronics work for it. Stars & Stripes uses a new range-bearing instrument that was developed with geophysicists at the University of Hawaii. The mechanism allows Conner to know within one-tenth of a boat length where he is in relation to his opponent or if a gain on the race course is due to pure boat speed or a favorable wind shift. Robert Hopkins, a computer analyst and sailing coach for Stars & Stripes, calls it the team's ''secret weapon.'' At the New Zealand camp, boat performance is only one use for the computer. The support team has gathered data on every 12-Meter that has sailed here the last three months, and has data banks full of information on each boat's basic measurements and speed potentials. Meteorologists Providing daily weather updates for a 12-Meter team is as important as knowing what sail to hoist or where to steer the boat. Stars & Stripes has fed more than 10 years of local weather data into its computer. New Zealand's meteorologist, Bob McDavitt, prides himself on the fact that his updates have stayed within his target predictions. He hasn't missed on the average more than 10 degrees in picking a wind shift or 2 knots in wind velocity. ''If I provide them with the wrong forecast and they put up the wrong mainsail, that's the race,'' says McDavitt.

484-> CITICORP GAINS 25.9% IN QUARTER
Citicorp yesterday reported a healthy 25.9 percent increase in fourth-quarter net income, to $306 million, from $243 million. It was buoyed by strong profits from its consumer and business banking operations, which more than offset flat results in its investment bank. Citing higher revenues in all of its businesses, the Chase Manhattan Corporation posted a modest increase for the period. Its earnings rose 4.7 percent, to $157.8 million, from $150.7 million in the corresponding 1985 quarter. In comparison, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation turned in one of its poorest quarters in some time. Although Manufacturers continued to build its capital and to restrain non interest expense, and even though its investment-banking results were robust, net income dropped 30.4 percent, to $75.4 million, from $108.3 million. The Bankers Trust New York Corporation also had a tough quarter. Its earnings were essentially unchanged, at $97.5 million, compared with $96.3 million a year earlier. And unlike recent quarters, Bankers Trust reported basically flat results in investment banking, which has become the heart of its operations. West Coast Banks Gain Meanwhile, two West Coast banking companies posted stronger results that were lifted by acquisitions. The San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Company posted a strong 51.8 percent earnings increase, bolstered by its acquisition of the Crocker National Corporation last spring. And the Security Pacific Corporation, based in Los Angeles, posted a 21.5 percent rise in profits, helped partly by its October takeover of the Arizona Bancwest Corporation. If a common thread ran through the reports of the four New York-based banking companies, it was that they continued to rely on one-time gains to sustain earnings. Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust, for example, both sold New York City real estate; Chase was helped by the sale of its Computer Power subsidiary and real estate in Japan, and Citicorp sold venture capital assets and its Signature magazine. All four banks also increased their loan-loss reserves, in some cases sharply. Partly, the increases reflect a belief that having more capital will be important in a deregulated environment, in which banks will be able to pursue businesses with more volatile earnings patterns. But the reserve increases also reflect growing apprehension over the future quality of loans. ''They are saying that there is continued uncertainty regarding domestic and international credit quality,'' said James J. McDermott, the director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. ''The distressing reality is that loan write-offs continue to be higher for this point in the economy.'' Citicorp At Citicorp, overall results showed that net interest income was essentially flat in the quarter, at $1.67 billion versus $1.53 billion. But fees and commissions rose 36.6 percent, to $858 million from $628 million; trading profits rose 60.9 percent, to $66 million from $41 million, and profits on foreign-exchange trading rose 17.1 percent, to $82 million from $70 million. Within Citicorp's individual business sectors, the consumer bank and the business bank performed extremely well. The consumer bank gained a bigger share of the credit-card business as well as of the New York City consumer-banking market. These gains helped to lift the consumer bank's overall net income 49.4 percent, to $130 million from $87 million. In the business bank, net income rose 85.3 percent, to $228 million from $123 million. Citicorp credited a big rise in fees, particularly those earned by its financial advisory group and its ''risk-protection group,'' which arranges interest-rate swaps. Wall Street analysts said they were encouraged by the results, but they also expressed concern about an increase in Citicorp's loan-loss reserve expressed as a percentage of its total loans, to 1.3 percent from 1.06 percent, and by a 23 percent jump in Citicorp's non-interest expense, to $1.99 billion. Chase Manhattan Chase's net interest income increased 4.1 percent, to $762.8 million, from $733 million. Non-interest income climbed 8.9 percent, to $415.4 million, from $381.3 million, as the banking concern enjoyed a robust performance in its investment banking activities. On a negative note, Chase said its improved income performance had been ''substantially'' offset by a sharp jump in noninterest operating expenses and by an increase in its loan-loss provision, to $595 million, from $435 million in the previous year. In addition, the company's results were helped by two one-time events: a $9 million gain due to an accounting change on lease financings resulting from the new tax law, and a $15 million aftertax gain on the sale of property in Japan. In increasing its loan-loss provision, Chase cited a higher level of consumer loan write-offs, mostly related to credit cards, and uncertainty on loans to some developing countries. The company's total allowance for possible bad loans was $1.06 billion, or 1.61 percent of loans outstanding, as of Dec. 31, compared with $908 billion, or 1.47 percent, a year earlier. Manufacturers Hanover Manufacturers Hanover's other operating revenues, including those from investment banking, rose sharply, to $391.5 million from $344.7 million, while non-interest expense rose modestly, to $542.7 million from $520.6 million. But these positive notes were more than offset by a big drop in net interest income, to $492.9 million from $544.7 million, and by a further strengthening of the bank's loss reserve, to $1 billion from $813.8 million. As one indication of its loan problems, Manufacturers Hanover wrote off $50.1 million in real estate loans in the quarter, virtually all of which were reportedly to finance the new Allied Bank building in Dallas. To help make up for the continued weakness in its core lending business, Manufacturers Hanover booked a number of nonrecurring gains in the quarter, including higher-than-usual venture capital profits and gains on sales of New York branches and an office building. Analysts are concerned that earnings could plummet once Manufacturers Hanover runs out of such special gains to book. ''Manny Hanny has been generating nonrecurring items all year,'' said Mark Alpert of Bear, Stearns & Company. Bankers Trust Although Bankers Trust's net interest income was flat, at $243.3 million, non-interest income rose $108 million, to $346.7 million. Fees, commissions and trust and custodian income rose sharply, while profits on bond trading and foreign exchange were less vigorous than analysts had hoped. But the biggest surprise was a nearly fourfold increase in Bankers Trust's provision for loan losses, to $188 million from $45 million. This more than offset $52.3 million in write-offs and raised Bankers Trust's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans to 2.21 percent from 1.73 percent. By building the allowance now, Bankers Trust should be able to avoid having to take earnings charges later on its bad loans. ''They clearly chose balance-sheet strengthening over current earnings,'' said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette. Wells Fargo In San Francisco, Wells Fargo & Company reported fourth-quarter net income of $74.4 million, or $1.36 a share, compared with $49 million, or $1.09 a share, in the comparable period a year ago. For the year, net income totaled $273.5 million, or $5.03 a share, up 43.9 percent from $190 million, or $4.15 a share, in 1985. Per-share figures reflect an increase in common shares outstanding stemming from the issuance of 5.3 million common shares in connection with the acquisition of Crocker National on May 30. In addition, the results are adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in the fourth quarter. Including a provision of $115.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo's provision for loan losses in 1986 was $361.7 million, compared with $371.8 million in 1985, including $105.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter. Security Pacific In Los Angeles, the Security Pacific Corporation said net income in the quarter rose to $104.6 million, or $1.31 a share, from $86.1 million, or $1.13 a share, in the comparable period of 1985. Net interest income fell 2.4 percent, to $454.2 million from $465.6 million. Non-interest income rose 40.4 percent, to $415.8 million from $296.1 million. The company said accounting changes on its leasing portfolio stemming from the new tax law reduced net interest income, but it said the reduction was more than offset by a reduction in income tax expense. Non-interest income benefited from gains in securities sales, loan fees and service charges on deposit accounts, as well as from gains related to the sale of the majority of the Security Pacific Mortgage Company and the acquisition of Arizona Bancwest. The company's reserve for credit losses increased to 1.71 percent of total loans and lease financing at the end of 1986, up from 1.63 percent at the end of the third quarter and 1.5 percent at the end of 1985. The credit loss provision for the quarter was $199.6 million, up 33 percent from $149.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1985.

485-> Washington Watch; A Banking Bill Rush
The rush has already begun in Congress to pass major banking bills. Lobbyists say they cannot remember when the chairmen of the two banking committees, Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, and Representative Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island, have worked so feverishly to pass early legislation. Not only have both committees planned two full days of hearings for this Wednesday and Thursday, but Mr. St Germain has called for a full committee mark-up and vote on final legislation as early as Feb. 10. Mr. Proxmire has promised a vote on his bill by the end of February. There is reason for haste by the two regulatory-minded chairmen - fear that highly effective lobbying groups will undo key apsects of the legislation, particularly a bill that would close the limited-service banking loophole and one that would inject an emergency $15 billion of new funds into the depleted Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Moreover, most of these issues are at least several years old. ''Strong centrifugal forces are working to undo these bills, and if Proxmire and St Germain don't act soon, those forces will tear them apart,'' said Karen Shaw, a banking expert with the Institute for Strategy Development. The would-be spoilers have already begun their attack. The highly influential United States League of Savings Institutions plans to hold a news conference on Tuesday to announce its alternative F.S.L.I.C. recapitalization plan, which would be less costly to the industry. And the Mayflower Group, a loose coalition of very large, deregulatory-minded banks, brokerage firms and financial institutions, plans to begin its winter offensive to preserve the limited-service bank loophole and all other existing loopholes in an effort to promote a rapid breakdown of banking barriers.

Skiing A First for Gaspoz: Joel Gaspoz of Switzerland won his first World Cup slalom yesterday with a skillful performance on the steep Lauberhorn course in Wengen, Switzerland. The 24-year-old Swiss was timed for the two heats in 1 minute 36.86 seconds. Dietmar Koehlbichler of Austria finished second in 1:37.40, giving an unexpected lift to the Austrian team, which has been lackluster this season. Five Austrians finished among the top 15 in their best showing so far. Yugoslavia's Bojan Krijaz was third in 1:37.44. Gazpoz went from fifth to third in the overall World Cup standing with 125 points, behind a countryman, Pirmin Zurbriggen, with 203, and Markus Wasmeier of West Germany, with 157.(AP) Walliser Triumphs in Women's Race: Switzerland's Maria Walliser easily won a women's World Cup giant slalom race in Bischofswiesen, West Germany, with two fast runs as Swiss skiers captured the top four places. Walliser had a combined time of 2:19.24. Vreni Schneider was runner-up in 2:21.40, followed by Brigitte Oertli in 2:21.44 and Zoe Haas in 2:21.50. Walliser leads the overall World Cup standing with 229 points. Schneider is second with 201 points.(AP) Bobsledding Swiss Take Four-Man Title: Hans Hiltebrand completed a Swiss sweep of the gold medals in the 1987 world bobsled championships by capturing the four-man title yesterday on his 42d birthday in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Last week, Ralph Pichler won the two-man championships. Although Hiltebrand had steering problems on the second day, the margin was large enough to enable him to hold off a strong challenge by Wolfgang Hoppe, the East German double Olympic champion of 1984. The total winning time was 4:22.65, with the runner-up sled clocked in 4:22.91. Matt Roy of Saranac Lake, N.Y., piloted USA I to ninth place in 4:25.72, leading the non-European entries.

Washington, playing at home in Landover, Md., had made up a 14-point deficit in the third quarter while Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was on the bench in foul trouble. Abdul-Jabbar finished with 15 points and James Worthy had 20 for the Lakers. Jeff Malone scored 27 and Moses Malone 21 for the Bullets.(AP) Bucks 100, Hawks 91: In Milwaukee, John Lucas, playing in his first game for the Bucks, scored a 3-point basket to snap a tie as they came from behind to defeat Atlanta. Lucas's basket gave Milwaukee a 92-89 lead with 1:50 left, and Jack Sikma, who finished with 18 points, increased the Bucks' margin to 95-91 with 39 seconds left. Ricky Pierce led Milwaukee with 20 points. Mike McGee led the Hawks with 24 points. Dominique Wilkins, who missed part of the game with a knee injury, finished with 18. (AP) N.H.L.

(AP) Red Wings 1, Penguins 0: Dave Barr scored midway through the third period and Glen Hanlon made 36 saves to give Detroit the victory in Pittsburgh. Barr broke the scoreless tie at 9:55 of the third period on Detroit's 26th shot. Steve Yzerman fed a backhand pass from the right wing and Barr, at the top of the slot, fired a 30-foot shot past Gilles Meloche on the stick side.(AP) Running Frostbite Race in Central Park: Frank Sharkey of Salisbury, Md., won the Frostbite 10-mile run in 52 minutes 23 seconds yesterday in Central Park. Sharkey, an Irishman now running for the Warren Street Athletic Club, defeated a field of 953 men and women who ran in snowy, chilly weather. Sharkey finished 380 yards ahead of Tom Phillips, who led the Central Park Track Club to the team title with 83 points. Phillips finished in 53:37. Atlaw Beligne of the Millrose Athletic Association was third in 54:00, followed by Martin Carle of Stony Point, N.Y., in 54.36 and Jim Kempton of Nanuet, N.Y., in 54:51. Cindy Gerard-Klein of the Atalanta Track Club shattered the women's meet record with a time of 57:09. The previous record of 58:06 was set by Cindy Wuss of the Atoms Track Club in 1985. (AP) Horse Racing Easy Victory at Aqueduct: Indistinctly, one of the outsiders in the field of 13, led from wire-to-wire under E. T. Baird to score a 5 3/4-length victory in the $75,000 Broadway Handicap for New York-bred fillies and mares 3-years-old and up at Aqueduct. The 4-year-old daughter of Vaguely Noble-Bold Rondo maintained a clear lead throughout, widening her advantage in the late stages. Wendy Walker outfinished She Skates, the favorite, for second. Indistinctly earned $45,000 for Flying Zee Stables after covering one mile and 70 yards on the sloppy strip in 1:43 2/5. She returned $53.40 for $2 to win. M.I.S.L. Stars 6, Express 5: Cico's goal at 2 minutes 18 seconds of overtime gave the Tacoma Stars a 6-5 triumph over the New York Express last night at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, L.I. The victory was the sixth in six overtime contests for the Stars, leaders of the Western Division. It also was Tacoma's 10th victory in 10 one-goal games. Preki led the Stars, who were tied at 2-2 at halftime, with three goals. Mark Liveric and Chris Whyte each had a pair of goals for the Express, who lost their fourth in a row. Liveric sent the game into overtime with his second goal at 14:02 of the final period.(AP)

488-> DENVER FANS ARE A MILE HIGH
''This is an unbelievable feeling,'' said Coach Dan Reeves, whose Denver Broncos beat the Cleveland Browns Sunday, earning the right to represent the American Football Conference against the Giants in the Super Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 25. ''I still feel like I want to wake up and see if it's all for real.'' It is indeed real. If Reeves had any doubts about that, they were resolved last night when the Broncos landed at Stapleton Airport to the wild cheers of about 20,000 fans. ''That was a tremendous thrill,'' Reeves said. ''It sent chills up and down my spine.'' Today, half the city seemed draped in orange and blue - the Broncos' colors - and across The Denver Post's front page was a giant headline that said simply: ''Wow! '' Feeling Like Christmas ''It is almost like Christmas again,'' said Michele Watson at The Sport Shop in downtown Denver, which sells Broncos' paraphernalia. ''People came in and bought everything they could get their hands on that was orange and blue.'' Despite the excitement, Reeves's mood was low-key and businesslike during a news conference here today. He seemed more intent on praising his team's performance Sunday and on getting a few days of rest than in stoking up the Super Bowl hoopla. ''I don't want to get too prepared this first week,'' Reeves said. ''We'll do most of our game preparation in the final week before the game. ''I know that the more film you look at, the more ideas you get. And I don't want to fall into that trap, and let things get too complicated.'' Reeves said he was not concerned that oddsmakers had rated his team an 8-point underdog. ''I wish they'd give us those 8 points on the board,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean anything, but it does tell you who everybody thinks is the best football team. But that's what the game is played for. You've got to go out there and prove it.'' Loss to Giants The Broncos lost to the Giants earlier this year, 19-16, in East Rutherford, N.J. ''The Giants are a team we know a little bit about,'' he said. ''They're an excellent team and they're playing better now than earlier in the season.'' ''We have tremendous respect for the New York Giants and they've got to feel good about their chances,'' Reeves added. ''But our football team has seemed to rise to the occasion all year. And this is, without question, the biggest challenge we've had all year. There's no tomorrow now.'' Reeves described the Giants as a balanced ball club with ''no weaknesses.'' But he said one possible soft spot is a defensive safety position where an inexperienced player has been filling in for an injured starter. ''But they play so much zone that you can't isolate on the position and take advantage of it,'' he said. The Broncos rose to the occasion Sunday with a stunning come-from-behind 23-20 overtime victory over the Cleveland Browns. ''If you wrote a script, you couldn't come up with a more exciting football game,'' Reeves said. Elway 'Unbelievable' The coach called the performance of his quarterback, John Elway, ''unbelievable.'' ''I think he played the best game he's played since he's been here,'' Reeves said. ''He was determined to play well and worked hard at it all week.'' Reeves also singled out a defensive end, Rulon Jones. ''He had 11 tackles and put tremendous pressure on Bernie Kosar all day. Our linebackers played well over all, but Rulon Jones was just a little bit exceptional,'' he said. Reeves said that the Broncos would likely begin practice again on Friday with conditioning workouts. ''We'll be doing a lot of running and a lot of lifting.'' But he said the team won't begin actual game preparations for the Giants until Jan. 20. He said he hoped to maintain a workman-like atmosphere and avoid the ''carnival type atmosphere'' that surrounded most Super Bowls. That may be difficult, judging from the reaction of many Denver residents today. ''We had lines in the stores from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock,'' said Ms. Watson, at the Sport Shop. ''I was amazed. As far as sales go, our morning average is about $900. Today, it was $4,000 by 1:30 P.M.''

490-> CANNON LOSES SOME LUSTER
The Cannon Group, once the hottest little film studio in Hollywood, has fallen on hard times. And Yuram Globus has this to say for himself and his cousin Menahem Golan, who run the company: 'Our only crime is that we love cinema. You don't see us at the Polo Lounge, on the tennis court or at parties. You see us at the office seven days a week.'' They love cinema so much, in fact, that they produced 43 movies last year, more than Universal, Paramount or any other Hollywood studio. The independent film production and distribution company is now paying the price. In the third quarter of last year, earnings tumbled to losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Cannon's accounting policies. And to keep from going bankrupt, Cannon struck a $75 million deal with Warner Communications, selling a number of assets at what most analysts believe are bargain prices. Yet Mr. Globus is optimistic. Recently the stranglehold the studios once had on financing films has relaxed somewhat, making it easier for newcomers to get into the business. On Wall Street there is a market for raising equity as well as junk bonds. And the ancillary markets from pay television to video cassettes have became more powerful, permitting movie producers to raise money by pre-selling the rights to movies before they are even made. Independents Face Struggle To some degree Cannon's problems are typical of those faced by small film companies trying to make a place for themselves in Hollywood. Cannon's ascent was remarkable. In 1979 Mr. Globus and Mr. Golan, Israelis and cousins, bought all of the company's stock when it was 20 cents a share. By 1986, it had risen to a high of $45.50. What made Cannon unique was that it started with inexpensive films typical of the small independent companies. It then branched out into more expensive, star-studded films. It developed an aggressive program of pre-selling home video, theatrical and cassette rights to its films overseas. It even manged to churn out such hits as ''Breakin' '' and ''Missing in Action'' in 1984 and ''Death Wish III'' in 1985. It is not easy for an independent film studio to survive in Hollywood. Only a handful - Orion, New World and Tri-Star - have made it. The power of the major studios to finance and market films is still so strong that smaller companies often have problems getting good properites and getting them into top theaters. But as Cannon's star rose, it attracted enormous publicity, luring such stars as Charles Bronson and Roy Scheider by offering them huge salaries, and dramatically increasing production. Appetite Is Sated At the same time, Cannon went on an acquisition binge. It bought movie theater chains and video cassette libraries. ''Both are very capital intensive, and Cannon did not have the capital to fuel its appetite,'' said one analyst who asked not to be named. Ultimately, Cannon failed to come up with enough hits to finance its dreams. Its 1986 releases earned a paltry 2.7 percent of the market share in domestic film rentals. Its list of 1986 disappointments was long. It is now cutting back production. It will only produce 15 films next year. For the third quarter of 1986, Cannon reported a loss of $14.6 million on revenues of $77 million, in contrast to a profit of $3.3 million on revenues of $34.3 million a year earlier. The investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into Cannon's accounting practices will look at the enormous flexibility film companies have in how they write off the cost of films. They are permitted to project a film's revenues and then write off proportionate costs in a manner relating to its earnings projections. If a company believes its films will make substantial money in secondary markets such as pay television and video cassette sales, it can write off a larger percentage of its costs in later years, when the company receives the revenues from video cassette and pay television sales for example. That strategy reduces current expenses and boosts near-term profits. Pace of Write-Offs Studied The question investigators are looking into is whether Cannon's management was too slow in writing off costs. If so, Cannon could be forced to amortize a larger proportion of its production costs now, which would reduce near-term earnings. Even without its S.E.C. problems, Cannon was virtually forced into a deal with Warner late last year because its acquisitions had left it so saddled with debt. As part of a $75 million deal, Warner gave Cannon a check for $25 million for which it got home video rights in North America to 21 Cannon films. Warner also got a $25 million note collateralized by Cannon's European theater chain. If Warner converts the note, it would hold a 25 percent interest in the chain. The remaining $25 million is put into convertible preferred stock, convertible at Warner's option into either another 25 percent stake in the chain or two million shares of Cannon's stock, which would represent about 15 percent of the company. Warner also received warrants to purchase the stock. Mr. Globus called the deal with Warner ''a seal of confidence,'' adding: ''Warner passed through terrible times with Atari and went out of it, and we will go out of it.'' Easier to Book Theaters If Cannon recovers, it will be in part because of the growing number of movie theaters, which make it easier for independents to book their films into well-located multiple theaters. Nevertheless the risks of the business are still enormous. Small film companies, unlike the studios, remain primarily dependent on their film operations. MCA, the parent company of Universal, also runs a highly successful television production company and Warner also has powerful television and record businesses. Cannon is solely dependent on churning out hits. ''Like the dress business, Cannon thought it could produce dozens of cheap dresses, hoping to make at least a small profit on each one,'' said one executive familiar with the company. ''But the film industry does not work that way. You have to work hard and come up with hits. That is the only way to succeed.''

491-> AIDS VICTIM TO BE ALLOWED TO WED AT ST. PATRICK'S
Maria and David Hefner, a couple married in a civil ceremony who had been denied a Roman Catholic wedding at St. Patrick's Cathedral because Mr. Hefner is dying of AIDS, will be able to exchange their vows at the Cathedral after all. John Cardinal O'Connor yesterday reversed the decision of the rector of the Cathedral, Msgr. James F. Rigney, who explained last week that a person in a ''life-threatening situation,'' such as AIDS, should not be married in the Cathedral but in a parish church where, he said, they would receive better premarriage counseling. According to a compromise suggested by the Cardinal on Sunday and put into effect yesterday, the couple will be prepared for marriage by their local parish priest, but will take their vows at St. Patrick's. ''I feel like I'm going to be the bride of the year,'' said Mrs. Hefner, whose case has received much attention and support from civil-rights groups and from religious leaders, both Catholic and Protestant. 'In Sickness and in Health' ''I couldn't understand why they refused us to begin with,'' she said. ''When you get married in the church you promise to be there for each other in sickness and in health. We have done that already. I think the hardest thing will be to keep from crying when the priest says that.'' Mrs. Hefner, 33 years old, spoke from her husband's hospital room where he was taken from their Manhattan apartment last Thursday with an infection in his chest. As she has during three previous hospitalizations, she is staying with him in the private room, sleeping on a cot beside his bed. Mr. Hefner, 38, said last week that a wedding in Saint Patrick's had long been a dream of his wife's, who is Catholic. ''There is not much I can do for Mara,'' Mr. Hefner, who is Protestant, said using the nickname of his wife. ''She does everything for me now.'' Mr. Hefner, a hairdresser, believes that he got AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as the result of a homosexual relationship that he had before he married his wife three years ago. Since her husband was diagnosed in May as having the disease, Mrs. Hefner has tested negative three times for AIDS antibodies. Mr. Hefner was told about teh Cathedral wedding yesterday at noon from his parish priest, the Rev. Gerald McGovern of Our Lady of the Scapular Church on East 28th Street. Earlier in the day, Father McGovern got a call from a priest-secretary in Cardinal O'Connor's office telling him to expedite the training and the paperwork and send the couple over to St. Patrick's to be wed. Since the couple has been married for three years, Father McGovern said he expects the premarital counseling will be brief. He said he is also waiting for one document necessary before the wedding can proceed - Mrs. Hefner's baptismal certificate. Mrs. Hefner said that her parents, who live in her native Brazil, are sending the document to New York. The Hefners are still hoping that they can put their wedding together by Feb. 14 - Valentine's Day - as they had originally had planned.

492-> NETS DO NOT FEEL AT HOME ON ROAD
In the brightest moments of a generally dreary season, the Nets always seemed to point to their defense, the one facet of their game that had become dependable. But even that failed them tonight, and now they are staring at another forgettable losing streak. The Nets withered early in the game, fell behind by 21 in the third period and finally lost, 118-100, to the Washington Bullets at the Capital Centre. The defeat was their fourth in a row, their fifth straight on the road and their 17th in 19 road games this season. In the aftermath, Coach Dave Wohl talked about a defensive collapse, and it surely was one reason the Nets dropped this game. In their best streak of the season - they won six straight at home and five of seven overall at one point last month - it was the defense that seemed brightest. ''We're a good team when we concentrate on defense and rebounding and don't worry about our scoring,'' said Mike Gminski, the Net center. ''When we're in a good frame of mind, good things happen to us. The defense that we had in the past is what we need to get back to.'' Lack of Defense But it was missing tonight. The Bullets, who have won four straight, shot 52.4 percent. Their bench - John Williams, Michael Adams, Darwin Cook, Manute Bol and Jay Murphy - were a combined 19 of 27 from the floor and had 47 points. There were few stretches in which the Nets played well. They were as close as 2 points at the end of the first quarter and as close as 9 in the fourth, but never did they appear to have the game in their grasp. Their lone run came during a three-minute stretch in the last period when they outscored Washington by a 13-2 margin, getting two long jumpers from Kevin McKenna and a dunk by Orlando Woolridge to finish the spurt and make it 104-95. But Adams, the 5-foot-11-inch guard, scored from 22 feet to break the string. He then stole the ball from Tony Brown and converted on the fast break. Suddenly, it was a 13-point game again with just 3 minutes 20 seconds to play. The Nets scored just 5 points the rest of the evening, all by McKenna, who had 10 points in 12 minutes. ''I hope this team doesn't get comfortable losing,'' said Buck Williams, who had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets but fouled out early in the fourth quarter. ''I thought we had begun to turn our situation around, but now we've got to dig deeper and see if there's anything more we can do with our effort.'' Wohl said he may soon contemplate changes if his team maintains its unsettling slide. Not long ago, he was clearly satisfied that the Nets were finally emerging from their horrendous start. ''I'm concerned that we're not as sharp as we were two weeks ago,'' he said. ''Our consistency at the defensive end has slipped. If it continues, we may think about changes in the lineup and in our substitution pattern.'' The Nets had dealt the Bullets a somewhat lopsided 118-96 loss last week at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. And tonight, they played well in the opening minutes, making 11 of 19 shots and staying close. But the Bullets pushed a 2-point lead to 12 in the first four minutes, and that virtually ended the game. MALONE EXTENDS STREAK Moses Malone, the Bullet center, made all 11 attempts from the free-throw line and now has a string of 41 straight over his last three games.

493-> Disallowed in England
To the Editor: Your Baby M editorial states: ''Judge Sorkow has about as much case law to call upon as Solomon did when he heard his famous custody suit. None.'' Not quite. While the Baby M case is the first in this country wherein a court must decide custody between a commissioning couple and a repudiating surrogate, such a case, A. v. C., was tried in England in 1978. It was decided first at the trial level by a judge of the Family Division and then by a three-justice panel of the Court of Appeal. The trial court held the contract unenforceable ''as being against public policy'' on the ground that ''this was a purported contract for the sale and purchase of a child.'' The appellate justices cast even severer aspersions upon it: ''a totally inhuman proceeding,'' ''a bizarre and unnatural arrangement,'' ''a sordid commercial bargain'' (Lord Justice Ormrod, who is also a physician), and ''a kind of baby-farming operation,'' ''a guilty bargain'' and a ''lamentable commercial transaction'' (Lord Justice Cumming-Bruce). Both the trial and appellate courts awarded custody to the surrogate as the child's mother, but they differed as to whether the father should have visiting rights. With some reluctance, the trial judge decided that he should. But the Court of Appeal unanimously held that he should not, reasoning that the mother should be free from ''interference from an obsessive father.'' The opinions of the four judges fill 17 printed pages, but were not published until 1985, in a series of unofficial reports that are available in very few law libraries in this country. This unusual circumstance probably accounts for your statement. This 1978 judicial precedent is not the last word on surrogacy in Britain. In 1985, Parliament enacted the Surrogacy Arrangements Act, which forbids, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, advertisements designed to bring together would-be commissioning couples and surrogates, and also the negotiating or making of surrogacy arrangements on a commercial basis. CYRIL C. MEANS JR. New York, Jan. 12, 1987 The writer is a professor at the New York Law School.

494-> VIOLENCE IN INDIA REVIVES OLD FEARS
A wave of violent protest over regional, religious and linguistic grievances has flared in different parts of India in recent weeks, reviving some old concerns about the difficulties of national integration. Although the incidents have been isolated and apparently unconnected, political analysts suggest that the protests have been wider in scope and more violent than others in the last few years. The violence, coinciding with the last weeks of 1986, have inspired a series of introspective year-end editorials and public comments in the Indian press. Many commentators wondered, for example, whether the problem involving Sikh secessionists in the northern Indian state of Punjab may be spreading as agitators for other causes become increasingly militant. #600 Deaths in Punjab ''If the Government is perceived as being too tough toward protesters, it provokes a reaction,'' a Western diplomat said. ''If it is perceived as too lenient, that provokes a reaction, too. Either way, the Government loses control.'' According to official figures, more than 600 people were killed in violence in the Punjab in 1986, many of them in spectacular or gruesome massacres carried out by extremists demanding an independent nation for Sikhs. Among the recent episodes in other parts of India were several days of riots last month by agitators demanding statehood for Goa, a tiny former Portuguese colony on India's western coast. The army had to be called out at the height of the winter tourist season to restore order. Before the Goa riots, Moslems in the nearby state of Karnataka went on a rampage in protest over a short piece of fiction printed in a local newspaper. Separate State Urged The short story was called ''Mohammed the Idiot,'' which Moslems deemed extremely offensive. Seventeen people were killed as rioting spread through the cities of Mysore, Bangalore and several smaller towns within a few days. Violence continues, meanwhile, as ethnic Gurkhas in northeastern India agitate for a separate state to be known as Gurkhaland. There have been almost daily reports of new killings in demonstrations and pitched battles among workers on the area's tea plantations. In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, protesters against the use of Hindi as a national language have set off bombs and held mass demnstrations, leading to the detention of as many as 19,000 people. Thousands of farmers and their organizers were arrested in December in the western state of Maharashtra while trying to block roads in an agitation for higher farm prices. Hundreds of Groupings Meanwhile, news organizations reported that more than 100 people died in 1986 as tribal separatists in the remote northeastern state of Tripura clashed with ethnic Bengali plains dwellers. From the time of independence in 1947, India has had difficulty forging a sense of national unity out of its hundreds of ethnic, linguistic, religious and regional groups and subgroups. Language has been an especially explosive issue, boiling over into serious riots two decades ago among ethnic Tamils in Tamil Nadu, where there was talk of secession two decades ago. The history of such conflicts has led aides to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to caution against drawing any conclusion that India is suddenly coming apart at the seams. Dangerous Trends Seen In an interview, an aide to Mr. Gandhi noted that the language agitations in Tamil Nadu had not even approached the level of those in the 1960's. He said that other problems in Goa, Karnataka and elsewhere were isolated in nature. ''In this country, it takes very little to start a new round of ethnic violence because tensions are always beneath the surface,'' he said. ''We have to keep things in perspective.'' But critics of Mr. Gandhi say his Government may be ignoring some dangerous trends behind the violence. Perhaps the most serious of these is the way that it seems to have spread so quickly as to suggest that it was highly organized. 'Determined Professionals' The Moslem protest over the short story in one city in Karnataka state, for example, touched off immediate similar protests elsewhere. There were even clashes between Moslems and the police in the faraway Moslem-dominated state of Kashmir in the north. ''In the earlier days, rioting tended to be spontaneous,'' said Rajni Kothari, a leading civil liberties advocate in New Delhi. ''What you're getting now are a bunch of determined professionals backed by hired mobs.'' For Mr. Kothari, two separate waves of violence in the last few years foreshadowed this trend. First were the anti-Sikh riots in the nation's capital after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two Sikh security guards in 1984. Some 2,500 Sikhs were killeed in those riots, and Mr. Kothari and others have long charged that they were organized or encouraged by leading politicians allied with Mrs. Gandhi and her son and successor. These politicians deny the charges. A Police Crackdown Next came the violence involving Hindus, Moslems and lower caste groups in the western state of Gujarat in 1985, where 250 people died over five months. The killings stopped abruptly after the police cracked down on what they said were organized groups seeking revenge on each other. As in many of the recent flare-ups, the police blame ''antisocial elements'' and ''miscreants'' for fomenting the violence.

495-> TV SPORTS; NETWORKS SCORE BIG IN N.F.L. PLAYOFFS
From frigid Cleveland to the windy Meadowlands, from Bob Costas's hello on NBC at noon to Brent Musburger's goodbye on CBS at 7:30 P.M., Sunday was Football. It was also another one of those days when television sports deserves our attention and gratitude. Although the telecasts were the championship games of the National Football League's two conferences, the games had little in common. NBC's Denver-Cleveland game was a thriller, with Denver scoring late in regulation before winning in overtime. CBS showed the Giants defeating Washington in a game that was about as one-sided as 17-0 could be. Yet both games, with all of the fan mania, were compelling. Not just because the winners go to the Super Bowl, but also because there is something neat and orderly about the league's playoff system. First 10 teams are involved, then two are eliminated, then four more, then two more, leaving only two. The math and the format are simple as the march toward Super Bowldom continues. And how considerate of the league and the networks to schedule Sunday's games one after another so viewers could see them both. But how selfish of Denver and Cleveland to play beyond their allotted time, forcing those with only one TV set to choose between the end of that game and the beginning of the Giants-Redskins. The choice was not incidental because, in the opinion of many football minds, the Giants took a big step toward their victory by winning the opening coin toss and thus getting a chance to have the wind in their favor first. Those who opted to watch the end of the Denver game and are kicking themselves for it should calm down: CBS did not show the coin toss, so you didn't miss anything. That, however, is about the only thing CBS didn't show. Its top broadcast team of Pat Summerall and John Madden continue to lay undisputed claim to being the best in their business, and Sunday was a decent example of why. Despite Madden's reputation for exuberance, some of it excessive, he and Summerall are the best for another reason entirely: the basics. Summerall just rolls along, quickly and distinctly calling the action. Even Sunday, with the Giants having the game in control from the outset, Summerall never lost his concentration. If broadcasters were food, he would be meat and potatoes. Real good meat, though. Madden's most important contribution is his consistent explanation of strategy. Over and over he showed how the Giants used an ''umbrella'' or ''soft'' defense, forcing Washington to throw short passes. He often had replays stopped, where he would note, chalkboard style, how the Giants were operating. The overview of the entire defense, and Madden's eye for watching players away from the ball, are a welcome change from the quarterback-oriented analysis of so many broadcasters. (Those who think it's easy to watch something other than the ball should try it the next time they go to a game. You don't have any choice at home - the standard TV shot follows the ball. Makes you wonder whether any kids nowadays still want to be linemen). As for NBC, Dick Enberg and Merlin Olsen, with an occasional assist from Bob Griese, did a more-than-adequate job. Though Enberg and Olsen have shown an irritating reluctance over the years to say anything at all critical of the players or coaches, there were some shining moments to the contrary on Sunday. One came in the fourth quarter, when Cleveland's head coach became livid over a penalty call against his team. First he screamed at the officials, then called a timeout. Olsen faulted him for ''burning so much energy'' on the subject and Enberg found fault for wasting the timeout. So, like Denver, the broadcasters finished well. One aspect of the telecasts where NBC showed more strength was on graphics. It was quick to update passing statistics and the like, while CBS was too sparing in its efforts. A rule of thumb is that the importance of graphics grows with the importance of the game. Noise levels, both at the stadium and wherever viewers watch the game, can often drown out the broadcasters. And nothing makes the point so well as putting the numbers on the screen. Another noteworthy point of comparison involves the choice of halftime features. NBC devoted some time to Frank Deford's commentary, in which he outlined a number of off-season problems facing the league, from new TV contracts to the lack of black head coaches and team executives. CBS did a silly, extended promotion of a new network morning show, complete with a look at the fireplace and the refrigerator on the show's set. A little genuflecting to network needs may be necessary, but please, CBS, only a little.

496-> I Think Reagan Is a First-Rate President
One of the top shows in Broadway history, South Pacific,'' had a top song, ''There Is Nothing Like a Dame,'' and the top lyric in that song went like this: ''So suppose a dame ain't bright, Or completely free from flaws, Or as faithful as a bird dog, Or as kind as Santa Claus, It's a waste of time to worry Over things that they have not Be thankful for The things they've got!'' The enemies of President Reagan, with motives ranging from noble to wretched, are active and articulate. Most of his defenders are embarrassed and floundering - or are silent. I am one of his unembarrassed defenders who voted for him twice and now asks himself, in light of what's happening, ''Would you do it again?'' Yes, I would. Different Presidents, for better or worse, for important or unimportant, come with different characteris tics. Franklin D. Roosevelt was admired for, among other traits, his ability to overcome physical paralysis and maintain a Presidential schedule. John F. Kennedy was admired for playing touch football. Harry S. Truman probably could not have identified the six republics that make up Yugoslavia, but his decision to jump to the aid of Mar shal Tito accelerated the fragmentation of the Soviet bloc. The notion of a President helping a Communist in 1948 makes the sale of arms to Iran today seem like an embassy party cookie push. They said some of the same things about Dwight D. Eisenhower that they're now saying about Ronald Reagan: no grasp of the issues, not really emotionally involved, more comfortable reviewing troops than facts. President Eisenhower's ''master of ceremonies'' administrative style made him vulnerable to insult by critics. Yet that ability, exercised in running an army and a democracy, served the nation well, and historians have been kinder to him than his contemporaries were. Jack Kennedy's short and cruelly terminated tenure may have fallen short in the solid accomplishment department, but who can forget his power to animate us all and give us the feeling that we were again a national ''somebody'' going somewhere? Lyndon B. Johnson grasped every issue firmly and clearly, but that didn't reverse or even stem the debacle of his Vietnam policy. Richard M. Nixon was unloveable, but he opened the channel to China. Jimmy Carter loved detail. The comics tell us he even knew who was using the tennis courts, but that quality, though laudable, didn't net his country or his image the rewards that many people think such ability deserves. My reaction when Ronald Reagan is criticized is not the standard, ''You never liked him, and you've been out to get him for six years.'' Nor do I say, ''It was all Oliver North's fault,'' and point out that Mr. Roosevelt did devious things, too. I simply invoke the ''South Pacific'' defense: What does he have? What does he have not? Mr. Reagan, I'm sure, does fall asleep at Cabinet meetings. I can see him nodding. I'm sure he despises detail. He has always had plenty of people around him as movie star, union chief, governor and President to handle the details. That's got to mean some big ones roll right between his legs. I'm sure Ronald Reagan is now bewildered and hurt, and feels that he is getting a rotten shake and that everybody should look at his six good years and lay off. You are perfectly free to value Jimmy Carter's grasp over Ronald Reagan's yawns, Richard Nixon's accomplishments over Franklin Roosevelt's charm, Lyndon Johnson's truculence over Jack Kennedy's elegance. I happen to value Ronald Reagan's Kennedy-like ability to inspire, his Ike-like ability to be the genial daddy of the mall, his Trumanesque toughness to tyrants in all words and some deeds, his Nixon-like willingness to try bold foreign policy initiatives and his Rooseveltian knack of remaining popular through it all. Call me wrong, even doltish, but I feel a new pride in this country, a new respect for this country, a new hesitancy in Moscow to commit aggression, a welcome paralysis among Moscow's client states to pursue subversion, and economic optimism to match a rising Dow. Democracy means we choose. It means you're free to be worried about the things he ''has not.'' And it means that I, meanwhile, can keep on being grateful for the things he's got!

497-> NEW FINDINGS REVEAL ANCIENT ABUSE OF LANDS
RECENT discoveries in the southwestern United States, southern Greece and the South Pacific have persuaded a growing number of archeologists that primitive people were much more destructive to their habitat than had been generally believed. The current trend may finally put an end to what Dr. Jared M. Diamond describes as ''the environmentalist myth'' - an alleged bias of many scientists toward ''the romanticized concept of the 'noble savage' '' proclaimed by the 18th-century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Writing in the British journal Nature, Dr. Diamond, a professor of physiology at the University of California (Los Angeles) School of Medicine, cited the destruction of plant species on Easter Island and in the Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico as glaring examples of primitive human abuse of the land. ''The reason for this bias,'' he said in an interview, ''is that primitive peoples have been so horribly treated by whites over the centuries that many whites today justly feel a sense of guilt. Scientists, among others, sometimes tend to compensate for this in inappropriate ways. For example, it has become politically and socially inexpedient to write or speak of the role of the Maori aboriginals of New Zealand in the extinction of the moa (a large flightless bird), or of early Polynesian settlers who brought about the extinction of various Hawaiian birds.'' Dr. Diamond and like-minded archeologists believe that some societies have directly contributed to their own demise by abusing the lands on which they lived. At the same time, a declining society is likely to abandon sound conservation, he said, and the spiral of decay becomes tighter. Strong support for Dr. Diamond's revisionist point of view has come from Julio L. Betancourt, an archeologist, and his colleagues at the University of Arizona, who have extensively studied the Anasazi Indian civilization that flourished in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon from about 1000 A.D. to 1200 A.D. The Chaco Canyon has long fascinated and mystified archeologists. Its vanished inhabitants, believed to have been ancestors of modern-day Hopi and other Pueblo Indian groups, built the largest and tallest buildings that existed in North America prior to the advent of skyscrapers at the end of the 19th Century. Hundreds of 12th-century Chaco Canyon families were housed in huge stone-and-adobe apartment buildings that stood as high as five stories and whose ruins are still impressive. Relics of this culture form an exhibit scheduled to open March 6 at New York's Museum and Natural History. Although archeologists consider Chaco Canyon culture to have been almost as advanced as that of the Maya in Central America, Chaco Canyon inhabitants were unable to sustain the life-giving qualities of their environment. Mr. Betancourt has unearthed some clues as to what happened to them, thanks to the preservative qualities of crystallized rat urine. ''Throughout the Anasazi region,'' Mr. Betancourt said in an interview, ''pack rats established nests and left middens'' or dungheaps. ''The feces and scraps they left in the middens were soaked in urine, which dried and crystallized, preserving the seeds and plant fragments the rats had eaten.'' The rats always foraged within a 50-yard radius of their nests, he explained, and as many as 30 different plant species are represented by fossilized seeds and twigs in each midden. The age of the material is determined by analysis for radioactive carbon 14. ''This gives us a series of snapshots of what plant species were growing in the Chaco Canyon region at various times during the history of the region,'' Mr. Betancourt said. From this kind of evidence, he said, ''you can see abrupt deforestation in the Chaco Canyon, as stark as night and day, as obvious as it is on Easter Island in the Pacific. Prior to 1,000 years ago there was pinyon-juniper woodland in the Chaco Canyon, and for the past 1,000 years it was gone. The change was irreversible.'' Although the cause of the deforestation is debated by scientists, Mr. Betancourt believes the evidence supports the view that as the Chaco Canyon builders used up local woodlands for fuel and building, erosion destroyed the top soil and deepened the surface water channels that had been important for irrigation, converting them into agriculturally useless arroyos. ''This accounts for the fact that the geological record shows us a major deepening of water channels in the area between the 12th and 15th centuries,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''It's perfectly evident to me that people beat the hell out of the environment there, and then they moved.'' Today, he said, inhabitants of other parts of the Southwest are once again ''attacking pinyon-juniper woodlands, this time with trucks and chain saws,'' using the wood as fuel. It is essential that the Federal Government protect its national forests from further inroads, he said, if the fragile Southwestern habitat is to be preserved. Dr. Diamond notes that deforestation also occurred on Easter Island in the South Pacific. Instead of moving on, however, the Easter Islanders abandoned their early artistic culture and land conservation practices to become warriers and cannibals. The island was once lushly covered with palms and other trees, but when its Polynesian population burned the wood and began allowing livestock to graze throughout the island, irreversible erosion destroyed the topsoil. By the beginning of the 18th century, Easter Island was barren, and remains so today. Another form of support for Dr. Diamond's thesis is emerging in a series of papers published by a team of Stanford University archeologists who recently completed a three-year expedition to the Southern Argolid -a tongue of land protruding from southern Greece into the Mediterranean, that has been inhabited by human beings for the past 50,000 years. The Stanford group gathered information and samples from 319 sites, seeking to determine whether a relationship existed between the vigor of regional society through the ages and the record left in the soil. One of the team leaders, Dr. Curtis N. Runnels, believes the results tend to confirm Dr. Diamond's view that early man strongly influenced his environment, often for the worse. ''But this is not to say that man's impact was always destructive,'' Dr. Runnels said in an interview. ''Throughout the history of the Southern Argolid, there have been times when man has conserved the land and prevented erosion, and other times when he let things go to pot. One can gauge the health of a society quite well from the amount of soil that erodes from high slopes and washes down as silt in the valleys.'' Most of the region's original topsoil was stripped away by the ravages of the last ice age, Dr. Runnels said, but when the human population began to grow rapidly, they soon made their mark on what was left. ''Roughly 5,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Bronze Age,'' he said, ''the population of the Southern Argolid increased dramatically, land was cleared as agriculture became intensive, and there was a period of severe erosion. We see it clearly in the great volume of silt that was washed down into the valleys and bays at that time.'' To gauge the thickness of various silt deposits offshore, the Stanford team used a side-scan sonar apparatus towed behind a boat to make echo soundings of the sea bottom around the Southern Argolid. They discerned the position and extent of offshore silting as well as changes that had occurred in the sea level since the last ice age. ''But ancient civilizations eventually learned to build terraces to prevent erosion,'' Dr. Runnels said. ''From the height of the great Mycenaean civilization in about 1,600 B.C. until its end in 1,000 B.C., we find no erosion at all. The Mycenaeans were great builders, of course, and they probably put up some of the original terraces and check dams that have been rebuilt over the ages and are still around.'' But the great disadvantage of terracing, Dr. Runnels said, is that terraces must be constantly repaired and kept from leaking. If livestock are allowed to trample and damage a terrace, rain water soon cuts a channel through it, dragging down the dammed-up topsoil and initiating runaway erosion that may be irreversible. The silting record shows that severe erosion occurred after the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, and that conservation practices were reinstituted only after the Classical Greek period began some five centuries before Christ. With the decline of Greek political power between the third century B.C. and about 50 B.C., another period of severe erosion is detectable in silt patterns, Dr. Runnels said. A revival of sound agricultural practice occurred during the Roman era, but erosion set in again in the sixth century A.D. after the fall of Rome. Two more social crises in the Southern Argolid are discernable in silt patterns of the medieval period and of the past two centuries, Dr. Runnels said. The current silting may be related, he said, to increased grazing on upland slopes, neglect of terrace repairs, the cultivation of such high-value crops as lemons (which consume large amounts of water), and the growth of the tourist industry at the expense of soil conservation. ''Right now, the people of the area are pushing for fast profits. But even a slight downturn in world conditions, or a decrease in the buying population of Athens, or a war interrupting shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean - any of those things could wreck agriculture in the Southern Argolid. The terraces would go to pot and what little topsoil is left would slide into the sea. ''At least in the Southern Argolid of Greece,'' Dr. Runnels said, ''the vigor and intelligence of each society clearly marked the soil record. Many of us suspect that this relationship between land use and social health will be found elsewhere.'' The tendencies of mankind have changed little over the centuries, Dr. Diamond believes. ''By nature, present day man is neither more nor less destructive of the land than was his forebears,'' he said. ''It's just that the technology of destruction is vastly more efficient than it was in the past. There never was such a thing as a noble savage.''

499-> A.M.C., Workers Continue Contract Talks
The American Motors Corporation said its union workers had agreed to continue talks tonight past their deadline for reaching an agreement on a new labor contract. The company says the contract is crucial to a $250 million plan to keep its only United States auto plant operating. A.M.C., which has had only one profitable year in this decade, has been at odds with local unions of the United Automobile Workers over a new Japanese-style contract the company wants to reduce costs at its assembly complex in Kenosha, Wis. Tommy Thompson, the Wisconsin Governor, has proposed a $200 million state loan package as part of a modernization plan for the plant. ''The deadline is passed, but the two locals in Kenosha and Milwaukee have agreed to continue bargaining,'' an A.M.C. spokesman, Michael Aberlich, said tonight. The company says the plant modernization is needed before A.M.C. can embark on its plan to build a new line of Jeeps at the Kenosha plant, which is the oldest operating auto complex in the nation. Moreover, A.M.C. is negotiating with the Chrysler Corporation to build a line of small Chrysler cars at the plant. Mr. Aberlich said A.M.C. officials would seek ''more time'' from Chrysler on the small-car project if the labor talks seem likely to go beyond Chrysler's previously stated deadline of Jan. 30 for concluding a deal. Baron Bates, a Chrysler vice president, said tonight that the deadline was a flexible one. Without the Chrysler deal and the modernization project, A.M.C. has said it would phase out car production in Kenosha by 1989. The Kenosha plant currently builds only the Renault Alliance, but it will also be used to assemble a line of large Chrysler cars under a contract that runs through 1989. A.M.C. has been carried through its losing years by sales of Jeeps and financial support from France's state-run Renault car group. Officials say cost-cutting has enabled the company to record a small fourth-quarter profit, its first since late 1984. A.M.C. has based its hopes for the future on a new line of French-made compacts and Canadian-built mid-sized cars that are due to go on sale later this year, as well as continued profits from its Jeep line.

500-> JAPAN'S GROWING ROLE IN CHIPS WORRYING U.S.
America's semiconductor manufacturers, the linchpin of the nation's electronics industry, are rapidly falling behind their Japanese competitors, according to experts and Government documents assessing the situation. Recent reports by a Defense Department study group and by the Central Intelligence Agency found that the United States chip-making industry was in worse shape even than had been previously thought. While many experts have wondered whether the American industry could maintain its technological lead over Japan, numerous authorities say the lead has been lost in many areas. The question being asked is whether the American makers of semiconductors - the tiny silicon chips that are the heart of computers and other electronic devices - will survive at all, and in what form. The draft of the report prepared for the Defense Department, for example, concludes that the United States industry may ''very soon, in fact, be competitive only in very small 'specialty' segments of the overall market.'' And the assessment by the C.I.A. concludes: ''We believe the U.S. semiconductor industry is at a crucial turning point in its history. It fundamentally cannot compete in its present form.'' The C.I.A. assessment is one of many made to a panel established by the Defense Science Board, a scientific adviser to the Pentagon. The panel was addressing growing fears in the Government that the deterioration of the semiconductor industry would leave the nation dependent on foreign companies for chips that are vital to national defense and would lead to an overall decline in electronics capability. Moreover, experts say, the decline poses a serious commercial problem, both because semiconductors are an important industry in their own right and because they are the key to many other even larger industries that use the chips, such as computers and telecommunications and medical equipment. If the American manufacturers of such electronic equipment become dependent on Japanese suppliers, it is feared, they will be at a disadvantage in competing with Japanese companies in the same industry. The same Japanese companies that sell chips used in computers also sell computers, which means they might have an incentive to withhold the most advanced chips from the American market. The American semiconductor companies were once the envy of the world for their innovativeness and dynamism. But in the last four years they have lost 20 percent of their world market share. Huge Losses for Companies Numerous reasons are advanced for the decline. A slump in chip prices caused by world oversupply and slow computer-industry growth has caused huge losses for many of the companies. But the Americans have also complained that the Japanese have deliberately priced their chips below cost to gain business and have kept their market closed to outside suppliers. A recent United States-Japan semiconductor trade agreement seeks to correct these problems, but there is widespread doubt as to whether it will work. Analysts say, however, that the American companies also neglected quality manufacturing, licensed technology to the Japanese too freely and did not make a strong enough effort to sell in Japan. And some say the entrepreneurial nature of California's Silicon Valley, where many of the companies are based, worked against the Americans because the constant exodus of executives to form new companies produced many tiny concerns that could innovate but not last in long-term competition with Japan. Fears about the industry's decline were heightened by the recent announcement that Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. would buy the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, a leading supplier of chips to the military. The Government is deciding whether to approve the purchase. $2 Billion Over Five Years The report of the Defense Science Board's panel, to be released this month or next, is expected to recommend almost $2 billion in Defense Department expenditures over five years to help the industry recover. A draft of a summary of the report, as well as minutes of one of the panel's meetings, were provided by sources who asked to remain unidentified. The Defense Science Board report concludes that the Japanese now have a technological lead in most silicon products, with the exception of customized logic chips and microprocessors. But even in those areas, the United States lead is narrowing. Japan also leads in non-silicon products, such as opto-electronic circuits that process light as well as electricity. In the materials and equipment used to make chips, the United States and Japan are at par, with the Japanese gaining, the report concludes. A chart in the report shows that, out of 25 semiconductor products or processes, Japan now leads in 12 while the United States leads in 5, with parity in the other 8. The chart also shows, however, that the United States position relative to Japan is declining in 19 of the 25 categories, including in 4 of the 5 in which the United States now leads. In six categories the United States is maintaining its position, but in no case is it gaining. For the Defense Science Board, the concern over the industry's slide is more immediately related to national security than to its commercial implications. There is a growing fear that the nation will become dependent on foreigners for chips used in weapons, satellites, supercomputers and other devices vital for national defense. In addition, the general decline in semiconductors could weaken the entire American electronics industry so that it would no longer be in a position to advance rapidly. The United States depends on advanced electronics to offset any advantage the Soviet Union might have in numbers of troops or weapons. 'Widespread Effects' ''This is not another case of citrus, tobacco or pasta,'' the C.I.A. said in its presentation to the Defense Science Board early in 1986. ''The consequences of losing a strong indigenous technology base in this industry could have, in our judgment, widespread effects on this country's ability to maintain technical superiority in advanced weapon systems over the U.S.S.R.'' The C.I.A. assessment was presented by Timothy L. Stone, who at that time was chief of the technology and industrial competitiveness division of the agency's Office of Global Issues. Mr. Stone left the agency last summer and is now in strategic planning at Motorola Inc., which makes semiconductors. The Defense Department report and the minutes of the study group's meeting indicate a concern that, even though Japan is an ally, it might not want to sell the latest technology to the United States. This could be because the Japanese do not want to show their best technology to companies that also compete with them in nonmilitary areas. There could also be political or ethical reasons. Some allies refused to sell equipment to the United States during the Vietnam War, for instance. Specific Examples Given According to the minutes of the Defense Science Board meeting, held last February in Arlington, Va., the examples of foreign dependency, and the concerns attached to such dependency, include the following: * The National Security Agency, which is charged with electronic eavesdropping and communications security, buys ceramic packages for 171 of 195 customized chips from one Japanese company, Kyocera, which dominates the market. The packages are used to house and protect computer chips in crucial applications, such as military ones. At one point, Kyocera, without warning, discontinued making the ceramic package for one key component, according to a presentation given to the panel by James R. Philblad, deputy chief of the N.S.A.'s communications security acquisition group. Now the N.S.A. is trying to develop more American sources for the packages. * Japanese semiconductor companies that also make supercomputers are not supplying their best chips to American supercomputer companies, according to Norman Kreisman, an Energy Department official involved with supercomputers. The machines, the fastest computers in existence, are used for weapons design and code-breaking, as well as for weather forecasting and other civilian applications. Lloyd Thorndyke, the president of ETA Systems, a supercomputer manufacturer, said that, since supercomputers depended on using the most advanced components, it was quite likely that the most advanced supercomputers would eventually come from Japan unless the Government helped the American chip industry. * Of 3,000 unique chips needed for America's military space program, 93 are supplied by foreign companies, all but one Japanese, because there is no American supplier, according to James J. Egan, an official with the Aerospace Corporation. There is concern that there could be no American suppliers for the next generation of high-speed chips made out of gallium arsenide, which are used in communications satellites, high-speed computers and fiber-optic communications systems. Some experts say that, in the future, many companies will form links with the Japanese to survive. Motorola recently entered a cooperative agreement with the Toshiba Corporation. Many start-up companies in Silicon Valley no longer do their own manufacturing but contract with Japanese or South Korean companies for that. In return, the American companies often give their technology to the other company. Fewer Larger Companies Other United States companies are likely to merge with each other or go out of business, leaving fewer larger manufacturers as well as, perhaps, numerous smaller ones in niche areas. Drastic actions might be required to reverse the decline. About half of the roughly $2 billion that the Defense Science Board report urges the Defense Department to spend over the next five years would be used to finance establishment of an industry consortium to produce memory chips and improve manufacturing techniques. In addition, the report urges the department to spend $50 million a year to set up university centers for excellence in semiconductor science and engineering. It also urges increases in department spending on semiconductor research and development, by 25 percent a year for four years, which would cost $60 million in the first year and $250 million in the fourth year. And it recommends that the department provide a discretionary fund for its semiconductor suppliers of $50 million a year. Next: American companies plan an ambitious cooperative venture.

501-> EX-AIDE SAID TO ALTER MEMO ON REAGAN ROLE IN IRAN SALES
Robert C. McFarlane, the former White House national security adviser, took part in a plan last November to put the best face on President Reagan's role in the Iran-contra arms case, a source close to Mr. McFarlane said today. Mr. McFarlane wrote a memo saying the President did not approve the first Israeli shipment of arms to Iran in August 1985, the source said, although McFarlane has since said the President did approve the shipments in advance. Mr. McFarlane knew that the President had approved the shipments in advance, but wrote the memo ''clearly seeking to put the best face on things,'' said the source, who has direct knowledge of the situation. Congressional investigators have said that a central question in the Iran-contra arms affair is whether President Reagan approved the shipments in advance. White House officials have indicated that the President did not give advance approval to the first arms sale, in the fall of 1985. Mr. McFarlane declined to discuss the memo in question today. But he denied that he had covered up the facts. ''The suggestion that I lied regarding the President's role in approval of Israeli arms transfers is categorically false,'' he said. The McFarlane memo was written in advance of a Presidential press conference last Nov. 19. The memo was based on an earlier draft written in part by Central Intelligence Agency officials, according to the source. The source said the earlier draft specifically said Mr. Reagan approved the first shipment of arms, but that Mr. McFarlane deleted that reference. The source said Mr. McFarlane did not believe his action was improper because he felt that while Mr. Reagan had approved the concept of arms shipments, he never specifically approved details of the first shipment. Mr. Reagan's approval of arms shipments ''did not require necessarily that he come back for approval of each specific'' shipment, according to the source. The memo, the source said, was intended ''as a portrayal to minimize the President's role.'' The source said Mr. McFarlane wrote the memo after he met at the White House last November with his successor as national security adviser, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North of the National Security Council staff. Once source said Admiral Poindexter was aware of and played a role in Mr. McFarlane's decision to ''minimize'' the President's role. The role of Colonel North in this instance is not clear.

502-> GOLF; PAVIN IS WINNER IN HOPE TOURNEY
Corey Pavin rolled in an 18-foot birdie putt on the final hole today to win the 28th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic by a shot over Bernhard Langer and end a grueling, five-hour-plus duel between these two close friends. The 27-year-old Californian, who played on the U.C.L.A. golf team and had a vocal gallery behind him all day, shot the best round of the week on the controversial PGA West course with a 5-under-par 67. Langer, the 29-year-old West German, two putted the final green for 70. The birdie putt gave Pavin a 19-under-par 341 to Langer's 342, so Pavin took the $162,000 first prize and Langer settled for $97,200. Langer opened the final round on this new and very difficult 7,000-yard stadium course two shots in front of Pavin and one in front of Mark Calcavecchia. Although Langer had a fine round, getting four birdies and saving par in a couple of dramatic moments, he took two costly bogeys. Pavin, on the other hand, was near perfect with five birdies and no bogeys. In fact, Pavin did not have a bogey in his last 56 holes of this five-day tournament. He had his last bogey on the 16th hole of Bermuda Dunes Thursday and shot bogey-free golf at Tamarisk Friday and Indian Wells Saturday. He had scores of 65, 66 and 67 in the last three rounds. Calcavecchia, who landed in water at the fifth and sixth holes, finished at 345, which gave him a third-place finish for the second week in a row. Pavin, who called PGA West ''too severe,'' was the one to best survive the most controversial course on the Pro Tour since the Tournament Players Club in Ponte Vedra, Fla., was opened for the Tournament Players Championship in 1982. Tom Watson, who finished at 357, said, ''I'm sick of these courses.'' He referred to the T.P.C. style courses such as PGA West and the T.P.C. in Florida, both of which were designed by Pete Dye. The distinctive features of the new ''stadium style'' courses are grassy mounds designed to give more spectators a better view of the action. Peter Jacobsen, who ended with 359, said: ''This course has set back golf a lot. For one thing it makes us play slowly while trying to hit impossible shots.'' Pavin, Langer and Calcavecchia played the final threesome today and took five hours to play the 18. A threesome of golfers of their caliber should complete 18 in less than four hours. The 71 pros who made the cut and played here today had to play PGA West twice during this five-day tournament. ''To be perfectly honest,'' Pavin said. ''The course is too severe in my mind. I don't agree with it. I had to make great iron shots to score like I did.'' Pavin hit a 4-iron into the 18th green to put his ball 18 feet from the pin that was tucked way in the rear left. The hole was cut just 20 feet from the bulkhead that contained the green against a huge pond. Langer hit a 5 iron in and came up 26 feet from the hole. The two, who had shared the lead three times during the round, became tied for the last time at the 16th hole. So when Langer's first putt on 18 rolled 2 feet by the cup, Pavin had his chance. He made good to win. Pavin left U.C.L.A. to play professionally in 1983 and started by competing on the European tour. It was there he met Langer and there that Pavin won the German Open, a tournament Langer won in 1982, 1985 and 1986. Both golfers joined the PGA Tour in 1984. Although Langer is rated among the best half dozen players in the world by some experts, Pavin has won five times on the American Tour while Langer has won only twice. The two opened with birdies at No. 1, and Pavin got within a shot of the lead with a 30-foot birdie putt at the third. It was at No. 5 that Pavin first tied for the lead, when he parred and Langer took bogey 6. But Langer got a birdie 2 on the next hole. Pavin had the lead by himself at 15 when Langer got a bogey. Langer's drive sliced right and rolled against a rake on a severe downhill bank of a huge bunker. He couldn't get to the green from there, so he got bogey 5. But Langer got to green at the par-5, 610-yard 16th hole in two. ''No way I can get to 16 in two,'' said Pavin. He didn't and took regulation par, while Langer two-putted for birdie and the last tie between the two. They both played the 17th safe with its island green and went to the final hole with everyone wondering whether the tournament would have its sixth straight sudden-death playoff.

504-> THERE'S A CONTRA IN MY GRUB
BANDITS By Elmore Leonard. 345 pp. New York: Arbor House. $17.95. THE question here is, Why is Elmore Leonard so good? He is. He is as good as the blurbs say: ''The greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever,'' ''Can't put it down,'' and so on. It's true enough. But how does he do it? Because it looks like he's thrown away the rules of a noble genre. He doesn't stick to the same guy or the same place. I had thought Raymond Chandler wrote the book when he set down Philip Marlowe in Los Angeles, in his lonesome house up Laurel Canyon, stoic and pure-hearted amid the low life of Sunset Boulevard and the bad cops of Bay City, a tough Galahad pitted against some very sleazy barbarians. But look at what Mr. Leonard is doing. Here he is now in New Orleans. I haven't read many of his books, but, as I recall, he's taken on Detroit, Miami Beach, Bal Harbour, Jerusalem, with a different cop or a different tough guy in each place. His New Orleans is done up with meticulous accuracy. The restaurants, streets, bars, hotels are just right - especially a lovely neighborhood restaurant, Mandina's, which tourists have never heard of, and even the funeral home across the street. One imagines Mr. Leonard moving into a city for a couple of weeks, yet doing his research as exhaustively as John Gunther doing another ''Inside'' book. Yet Mr. Leonard's New Orleans lacks the authenticity of Chandler's L.A., which works for Marlowe - and for us - as his very soul's terrain. I've often wondered why some good crime writer, local or otherwise, hasn't taken up with New Orleans, what with its special raffishness, its peculiar flavor of bonhomie and a slightly suspect charm. It's got the backdrop: Mafia types and the French Quarter downtown, enough decayed aristocrats uptown, lonesome anonymous suburbs like Gentilly, a greater ethnic mix than Marseilles. There are no ranker patios anywhere. Yet I can't recall a good novel in this genre and only one second-rate television series, ''Bourbon Street Beat.'' Does Elmore Leonard do the job in ''Bandits''? The early signs are not auspicious. His hero is an ex-con, a jewel thief turned mortician. The female lead? A good-looking ex-nun just back from Nicaragua where she took care of lepers until the contras hacked them up with machetes. Lepers? The ex-nun wants to smuggle a young Nicaraguan woman - who contracted leprosy and whom her lover, a Somoza-type colonel, is trying to kill for honor's sake and because he thinks she might have given him leprosy - out of Carville, a leprosarium in Louisiana. He is also raising millions from rich Americans to take back to the contras. The ex-jewel thief and his tough ex-con ex-cop friend are out to steal the money that the ex-nun wants so she can help the lepers and the Sandinistas. H'm. When she was a nun, the woman believed in touching people. Why did she quit her vocation? Because, she says, ''I was burnt out.'' ''What does that mean?'' her ex-jewel-thief boyfriend asks. ''I was touching without feeling,'' she explains. Oh my. What has Mr. Leonard got himself into this time? Nicaraguan politics and a gun-toting ex-nun who touches without feeling? Is it going to be standard Leonard crime and punishment flavored by gumbo and laced with bad contras and good Sandinistas? But wait. Things are not so simple. Who should show up but a Miskito Indian who is working for the contras and who shoots people in the head with his 9-millimeter Beretta. He's a Miskito, and we know, don't we, what the Sandinistas did to the Miskitos. A preposterous business this, but we keep turning the pages. Why? Here's one reason. Here's Jack Delaney, ex-con mortician, talking to his tough ex-con ex-cop friend, Roy, who's tending bar. Mr. Leonard has got the bar just right. We know what the bar looks like, what street it looks out on. Jack is telling Roy about the $5 million they can take from the colonel. Roy is mixing a drink, not paying attention. He ventures a remark. ''Delaney, you know what broads do when they get sick? I've never seen it to fail, they throw up in the washbasin. They don't throw up in the toilet, like you're supposed to.'' This gets your attention. What's Roy up to? Jack is telling him about stealing the $5 million from the contras and serving humanity at the same time. Roy is unimpressed by serving humanity. He tells about the humanity he serves at the bar. ''Guy comes in, looks around, he whispers to me, 'You got any absinthe?' He says, 'They don't have none at the Old Absinthe House. They tell me it's against the law to serve it.' I say how do I know, to this little . . . fella, you're not a cop? He shows me he's from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I glance around the bar, get out a clear bottle I make up that's got Pernod in it and a piece of deadwood with a caterpillar stuck on it. [ He ] drinks five of 'em at five bills a shot. Serve humanity, I serve 'em any . . . thing they want.'' Mr. Leonard has got my attention. You begin to notice his prose, the way he moves people around. People get shot in dependent clauses. Franklin de Dios is the Miskito Indian. '' 'I said I quit,' Franklin said, and shot him.'' The snap and crackle of the dialogue is something to hear. Mr. Leonard's ear is sharp and accurate: ''Jack put on a reasonably stupid grin for Wally Scales and slipped a little bit of West Feliciana Parish into his sound. 'Well, I can't say it was enjoyable, but I come through it, yes sir.' '' Sure enough, folks in West Feliciana Parish, which is next door to where I'm writing, could say that. Franklin drives a Chrysler Fifth Avenue. A black New Orleanian can't figure him out - he looks Indian but he's got nappy hair. ''Man, I look at you close I thought you were a brother. You know what I'm saying? I thought you were black.'' ''Yes, one part of me,'' Franklin says. ''The rest Miskito.'' Here's an item for the next doctoral thesis on Mr. Leonard: he often drops the word ''if'' in dialogue - and uses hardly any conjunctions. ''I had a tire iron we could find out in ten minutes.'' This sentence could use an ''if'' and a comma and would be worse for it. Yes, Mr. Leonard knows what he's doing. In the end he senses that Nicaragua and the gun-toting ex-nun may not be working out here. He backs off. Says Roy, mystified: ''I want to know, for my own information, which are the good guys and which are the bad guys.'' Jack doesn't know either. Mr. Leonard's instincts are good. Nicaraguan politics, it turns out, may be a bit too heavy to be carried by the graceful pas de deux of Mr. Leonard's good guys and bad guys. For this reason, ''Bandits'' is not quite of a piece, like ''Glitz.'' But it will do. Mr. Leonard has got his usual diverting cast of grifters and creeps up his sleeve and action as Byzantine as ever Chandler himself thought up. In fact, reading it, I felt like William Faulkner when he was writing the screenplay for the film version of Chandler's novel ''The Big Sleep.'' The story is that he had to call up Chandler to find out what was going on. Chandler wasn't sure. Yes, it will do. Letting the Characters Do It ''Most thrillers,'' says Elmore Leonard, ''are based on a situation, or on a plot, which is the most important element in the book. I don't see it that way. I see my characters as being most important, how they bounce off one another, how they talk to each other, and the plot just sort of comes along.'' In fact, Mr. Leonard is so comfortable allowing his characters to control the pace and action of his stories that he didn't know how ''Bandits'' would end until three days before he finished it last April. Mr. Leonard began writing for an advertising agency in 1949 and wrote westerns for two hours each morning before work. He published his first novel, ''The Bounty Hunters,'' in 1953, and sold his first crime novel, ''The Big Bounce,'' along with the movie rights, in 1969. Though he concedes that he writes genre fiction, he does so grudgingly. ''I write about crime, solving crime. But it's not a mystery, and it's not a puzzle. There are certain formats, and it's the same thing over and over, so I try to come up with fresh situations and real people.'' Mr. Leonard's characters are commonly tangled in the seedier fray of a community, whether it be Detroit or Atlantic City. He chose New Orleans for ''Bandits,'' his 24th novel, not only because he was born there in 1925, but also because the place intrigued him. He spent two weeks there researching the city and making notes on the speech of his characters. ''Until I get to know a character,'' he said recently from his home in Birmingham, Mich., ''the character isn't going to behave properly. I fool around with the dialogue, with how they talk, things they might say. As a scene develops, a character will start to do things on his own, but as soon as I can get a character to talk when I want him to, that's when I feel confident I've got a book. I know that I can mix them up together and something's going to happen. I'm not a strong narrative writer. I'm not especially good with imagery, so I have to let my characters do it. I studied writers who used dialogue well. ''I studied Hemingway when I was learning to write. You study him closely and you realize all the stuff he leaves out that you think is in the story. That's always interested me - to see the white space on a printed page.'' MICHAEL RUHLMAN

505-> DISTURBANCE ERUPTS AT DETENTION CENTER AFTER 2 INMATES FLEE
The police, firefighters and immigration officials quelled what one official called ''a small disturbance'' yesterday involving Cuban inmates at the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in lower Manhattan, where two prisoners had escaped a day earlier. The disturbance began about 11:20 A.M. when about 70 Cuban inmates on the fourth floor of the building at 201 Varick Street became agitated, according to a deputy district director with the immigration service, James A. Jasey. About 90 people were being held at the center when the disturbance began. No injuries were reported in the incident. There was only minor smoke and water damage to the fourth floor of the minimum-security center. Mr. Jasey, who cautioned against citing a specific cause, said the incident might have stemmed from anxiety over a possible transfer of some inmates to a Federal prison in Atlanta. He also said the disturbance might have been caused by the return Saturday night of Alfredo Diaz, 26 years old, one of two men who escaped earlier in the day by climbing down a bedsheet from a fourth floor window. The second prisoner, Ricardo Revuelta-Rosell, 26, had not been captured. Senator Alfonse D'Amato has often been critical of the security at the center, where at least 27 prisoners have escaped since June 1985. The center is used to detain illegal immigrants for deportation proceedings. Some of the detainees are suspected criminals for whom there is no space at maximum-security centers. Mr. D'Amato announced yesterday that immigration officials will move 50 of the Cuban prisoners tomorrow to the maximum-security Federal prison in Atlanta. The remaining 20 Cuban prisoners will be moved in 10 to 14 days, he said.

506-> GOLF; PAVIN BIRDIES 16TH AND 17TH TO GAIN ONE-SHOT LEAD IN PHOENIX
Corey Pavin, winner of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic by a shot last Sunday, birdied the 16th and 17th holes today to take a one-stroke lead over Paul Azinger through three rounds of the 52d annual Phoenix Open. The 5-foot-9-inch, 135-pound Pavin scored five-under-par 66 on the new Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale during a near-perfect day for golf. Numerous low scores reflected the playing conditions - little wind and temperatures in the 50's on a hazy day. Pavin's 66 put him at 13-under 200. Azinger, who has not won in five years on the PGA Tour, birdied the 17th hole, a tantalizing, short par-4 of 332 yards, to gain second place at 201. Fuzzy Zoeller, Doug Tewell and Jay Haas were tied at 202. Bob Tway, who won the PGA Championship in 1986, was at 203. Oak Tree Boys Sharp Tewell and Tway, a couple of the Oak Tree Boys from Oklahoma, shot spectacular rounds of 62 and 63, respectively. Tewell had a chance to equal Al Geiberger's PGA Tour 18-hole record of 59 shot in 1977. With four holes remaining Tewell needed a birdie on each to get 59. He birdied his 15th hole but could only get par on each of his last three. Tewell, Tway and a number of other pro tour golfers have been or are now affiliated with the Oak Tree Golf Club in Edmond, Okla. They are known informally as the Oak Tree Boys. Zoeller, winner of the 1984 United States Open and three-time winner on Tour last year, had the most spectacular shot of the day when he eagled the par-4 11th hole by sinking a 177-yard 5-iron shot on his way to a 67. ''I had a lot of chances for birdies coming in that I didn't make,'' Zoeller said. ''But when you hole 5-irons that's good for two or three missed putts at least.'' Then Zoeller birdied the two remaining par-5 holes, coming out of a greenside bunker each time. Off in a Rush Pavin was a shot off the second-round lead held by Howard Twitty and Steve Jones when he started today. And he got off in a rush with three straight birds. Pavin's irons were deadly as he sank birdie putts of only four feet at the first and second holes and a birdie putt of three feet on the third. Although Pavin did not remain in front, he got back in the lead with those two late birdies. An 8-iron within 10 feet of the cup at the 162-yard, par-3 16th led to one birdie and then a 4-wood tee shot and sand wedge within nine feet resulted in his final birdie. With such a closely packed field and golfers shooting such low scores, the chances are excellent that the battle will go down to the last two or three holes Sunday if not down to a playoff. And this may well bring into play two excellent short holes put on this course by the designers - Tom Weiskopf, Jay Morrish and Howard Twitty. The most intriguing is the 17th, the par-4 just over 300 yards with a big pot bunker 30 yards short of the green. Imagine a golfer trailing by one shot with two holes to go. He almost certainly will try to drive the green. A number of the long hitters have reached the green during this tournament although most have played short off the tee with irons or fairway woods. The 15th is a 501-yard par-5 hole with a huge island green. Golfers have been reaching it in two with irons while trying for eagle. But with the top prize on the line that iron shot can get testy. ''Imagine the guy trailing by a shot and having the honor over the leader at the 17th tee Sunday,'' Twitty said. ''He pulls out driver and unleashes one to the green and then turns to the leader and says, Now it's your turn.''

507-> Market Place; Broader Rally: Hope Growing
FOR the first time in more than six months, portfolio managers and investment strategists see the possibility that a market rally that has been largely confined to the highly capitalized issues that make up the Dow Jones industrial average could become much more broadly based. ''On Friday and again on Monday, the broad market kept pace with the Dow,'' said Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''You don't want to talk about a trend based on that period of time, but it is something that people should keep their eye on.'' The performance of the overall market relative to the Dow was even more impressive yesterday, as such broader measures as the over-the-counter Nasdaq composite index rose strongly, while the Dow, while reaching a new high, gained only 3.51 points, to 1,985.52. Since last Friday, the Nasdaq index, which includes more than 4,000 stocks, has risen by 5 percent. It closed yesterday at 366.02, well below the record 411.16 it reached last July. A continuation of the pattern would mark a significant shift in emphasis among investors, who were much more inclined to buy blue-chip stocks during 1986. It would also renew debate within the investment community about which stocks are going to lead the next leg of the four-year-old bull market. ''The market was ready to broaden out,'' said Byron Wien, managing director and United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''We have gotten to the point where the blue chips were fully valued. If we have a better economy this year, the smaller-capitalized stocks, which generally are cyclical in nature, will tend to do better. The market is in the process of changing.'' The broader market has been due for a rise, if only because it badly underperformed the 30 Dow component stocks last year. For all of 1986, the Dow rose more than 26 percent. By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 18.6 percent, while the Nasdaq index rose 7.5 percent. Robert Prechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, a Gainesville, Ga., monthly market forecasting letter, and an unabashed bull, said that secondary issues looked good from a technical perspective. ''I think we will have an excellent secondary stock rally this year,'' he said. ''The Nasdaq index hit a technical bottom on New Year's Eve and touched a two-year support trend line. The secondary stocks could well keep pace, or outperform, the Dow stocks for as long as nine months before tailing off in relative strength.'' Though impressive, the breadth of activity in the last few sessions has not made converts of everyone. Laszlo Birinyi, vice president and manager of equity market analysis at Salomon Brothers, said: ''Everything is going up, but a rising tide generally tends to raise all ships. The key point is that this is basically more of the same, that stocks like chemicals and tobacco continue to be strong, and that stocks which have not been doing well, like technology and semiconductors, are still lagging.'' On Friday and Monday, when the Dow component stocks rose 3.9 percent, Mr. Birinyi said that chemical stocks rose 5 percent, while tobacco companies, last year's best-performing group, rose 4.7 percent. By contrast, semiconductor and technology issues underperformed the Dow, rising 2.5 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. ''I would become much more supportive of a broad market rally if I saw buying on weakness in the smaller stocks,'' Mr. Birinyi said. ''For now, I would continue to focus on stocks that have done well, and not try to look for emerging issues.'' Leon Cooperman, a partner in charge of investment research at Goldman, Sachs, said: ''I would expect a modest, but not significant, broadening of the market. The change in tax laws eliminating the difference between short-term and long-term gains argues against going into less-liquid stocks.'' Still, the breadth of the advance that has already occurred has been significant enough to alter dramatically the perspective of at least one portfolio manager. Until Monday night, Donald I. Trott, market strategist at Mabon, Nugent, was very pessimistic about the stock market's prospects. Now, he says that the market will go higher. ''Until recently, the market was characterized by an increasingly narrow base of participating stocks,'' Mr. Trott said. ''When that sort of narrowing occurs, it generally is a precursor of one of two things: either a final gasp, or strength that starts with a small number of quality issues and then spreads. The across-the-board action of the past few days has rekindled a sense of excitement that there is money to be made in the market.''

508-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; West Points
A look at the list of college basketball's scoring leaders suggests that the military is permitting a little more individualism these days. On top is Navy's David Robinson, and right behind him is Army's Kevin Houston. While Robinson has been touted as perhaps the best big man in the nation, Houston, a senior from the Rockland County town of Pearl River, has steadily become one of the most productive players in the East. The 5-foot-11-inch guard, a preseason pick for player of the year in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, has an amazing career average of 39 minutes a game and has been an all-conference selection in each of his three previous seasons at the Academy. He's likely to finish second on Army's career scoring list, behind Gary Winton, a standout of the late 1970's who's now a West Point physical education instructor. In a loss to Seton Hall last week, Houston scored 42 of his team's 69 points to raise his season's average to 29.6. That game had observers asking what else basketball might have in store for him, but the answer is: Nothing. In light of the Navy's arrangement allowing Napoleon McCallum to play pro football, Robinson may stand at least a chance of heading for the National Basketball Association. Houston harbors no such hopes. ''We have no part-time lieutenants,'' says Army's sports information director, Bob Kinney. ''I say that tongue in cheek, but it's not an issue. He'll go in as a second lieutenant and serve his five years.'' In other words, be all that you can be in the Army, not out of it. Too bad. Still, it's comforting to know that our side will have a second lieutenant who can shoot that well.

509-> THE CUOMO BUDGET: EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION, DISPUTE ON LOCAL AID; BUDGET SEEKS TO RAISE SCHOOL AID $405 MILLION
Governor Cuomo proposed today a $405 million increase in state aid to public schools in the next academic year, with half going to economically disadvantaged communities. The Governor's proposals ranged from increased aid to prekindergarten programs to building a residential ''high school of excellence'' on Long Island focusing on science and mathematics. The Governor proposed to raise education aid just months after he had criticized the Board of Regents for failing to demonstrate gains in literacy or in reducing the dropout rate, despite significant increases in spending. The Governor coupled his recommended increase with a proposal for increasing the accountability of the Regents by requiring a detailed annual report on the schools. 'It's a Good Small Step' If his recommendations are adopted, the increase would mean a rise in state support for public schools of 52 percent over five years ago. Education associations hailed the increase, which would bring state support for public education to $7 billion, from $6.6 billion, as the largest ever proposed in a governor's budget recommendation. But they criticized the proposed budget as insufficient to reduce the dropout rate or to provide prekindergarten programs for all disadvantaged 4-year-olds, as the Governor has recommended. ''It's a good small step, but if that's his initiative in early childhood, that's not nearly enough money,'' said Louis Grumet, executive director of the State School Boards Association. Mr. Grumet also said he was concerned that the budget contained no new initiatives on lowering the dropout rate. ''I don't see a new commitment there,'' he said. Plan for Student Performance The Governor, whose budget message called education ''our highest priority,'' proposed an increase of $7 million to programs serving poor preschoolers. He defended the proposal as adequate, saying, ''Money isn't everything.'' In addition, the Governor has proposed consolidating several dropout programs under a new umbrella, the Performance Aid for Student Success Program. It would have a budget of $327 million, up $87 million from the total of the programs last year. Under a formula the Governor proposed, schools would receive money for the program based, in part, on the number of children living in poverty in the district. The proposal to establish a statewide residential high school of excellence on Long Island follows several years of proposals to develop such high schools regionally. The state's school boards continued to oppose the plan. To End 'Save-Harmless' ''We think that such a high school indeed could become an elitist program,'' Mr. Grumet said. As he has in the past, the Governor again proposed to eliminate the so-called save-harmless provision in the state-aid formula that allows districts that have lost students to retain constant fiscal levels. The provision is seen mainly as a boon to suburban and rural districts. Its elimination would result in a saving of $30 million, according to the budget message. The recommendation to eliminate ''save-harmless'' was quickly condemned by educational organizations, and legislators predicted its defeat. ''If I were betting right now, I'd say the Legislature would restore 'save-harmless,' '' said Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx and chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. Plea From Suburbs Representatives of suburban districts said even if the provision were saved, they expected suburban districts to continue to absorb a greater share of their increasing costs as their share of state aid remained fixed. ''The increases are going to the cities,'' the executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, Liz Jaffe, said. ''We can't object to any of that. They just have to recognize that other people need more money, too.'' James H. Donovan, Republican of Chadwicks and chairman of the State Senate Education Committee, predicted that suburban and upstate districts would be displeased with the Governor's proposals. ''They are not going to be happy with the Governor's new-found interest in education,'' he said. 'Governor Always Comes in Low' Education experts said the Assembly had traditionally rejected the Governor's education proposals as too low and had budgeted money far above his recommendations. ''The Governor always comes in low,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ''That's not what the Legislature will do.'' Experts estimated that the Assembly would press for an increase of more than $600 million. The proposed budget recommended no tuition increases at the State University or City University schools. But it did propose higher fees for professional licenses and registration. The proposed increases average 38 percent for physicians and 30 percent for all other professionals. For example, the cost of a chiropractic license would rise to $130, from $100, and of a massage license to $84.50, from $65. The increases are intended to generate sufficient revenues to oversee and investigate the 31 licensed professions, according to the budget message.

510-> COUNCIL WITNESSES DEBATE TOUGHER ANTI-SMOKING REGULATIONS
Emphysema reduced Kathryn Kennedy's voice to a barely audible whisper, but it commanded the attention of the audience when she testified yesterday on proposals to limit smoking in New York City. She recounted how her illness, compounded by a smoky office, forced her retirement last year. She told of her recent ''trache,'' a tracheotomy for installation of a plastic device to increase her intake of air. She concluded: ''I would be so happy to see smoking restricted in so many areas, if not eventually -'' Mrs. Kennedy had run out of breath. She paused to operate the device in her neck and gulp enough air to push out final word of her testimony: ''banned.'' Tougher Regulations Considered In all, 35 witnesses spoke at the City Council Health Committee's first day of hearings, which are scheduled to continue today and conclude tomorrow. Meanwhile, the New York State Public Health Council is considering regulations tougher than those it approved last month, which have yet to take effect but are considered to be among the toughest in any state. The state regulations would prohibit smoking in most public indoor areas and buildings and on the job, except in designated areas. At least 20 states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, now restrict smoking to some degree. Final Bill Not Decided At yesterday's hearing in Manhattan, paid representatives of the tobacco industry attacked the proposed restrictions as scientifically unwarranted. But the committee chairman, Fernando Ferrer, said in an interview that the committee ''might be disposed'' to approving restrictions. Its decision could take a few weeks, he said, and the final form of the bill has not been decided. Once a bill passes committee, it is routinely enacted into law by the full council. The proposal is aimed at protecting non-smokers by limiting smoking. It would ban smoking in taxicabs, restrooms, all stores, hearing rooms, waiting rooms, banks, medical offices, galleries, museums, libraries, hospitals, indoor arenas and schools. Employers would be required to provide non-smoking areas in work places. Some facilities, such as arenas, theaters and schools, would be allowed to designate smoking areas. Restaurants would be permitted to allow smoking in up to half their space. Mayor Koch, who proposed the new law last year after spurning previous bills, was the lead-off witness. He was followed by Health Commissioner Stephen C. Joseph, who also supported the legislation. The central dispute was summed up in Mr. Koch's assertion that ''It is clear now that second-hand smoke is causing ill effects.'' He cited several medical studies. But Scott Stapf of the Tobacco Institute said ''the scientific evidence simply does not support that claim'' as it applies to restaurants, offices and such places. Joining him was Jack E. Peterson, an industrial hygiene consultant who said, ''There's no evidence whatsoever.'' Another tobacco industry witness, Gray Robertson, a consultant on indoor pollution, blamed poor ventilation as the real culprit. He also said that in a typical restaurant, it would take 400 hours of breathing side-stream smoke to equal the direct inhaling of one cigarette. The New York Chamber of Commerce said it ''strongly opposes'' the restrictions and warned that attempts to limit smoking in the work place could cause ''serious problems and may even be impossible.'' The chamber said the issue is best left to voluntary action. As for the pending state action, Mayor Koch said the city should go ahead with its own law because there is no guarantee the state will act.

512-> SUPER BOWL XXI: THE GIANTS VS. THE BRONCOS; Security Forces Design a Defense
At Super Bowl XX last January in New Orleans, a rumor circulated that several foreign terrorists had been spotted in the area and intended to disrupt activities leading to the National Football League's championship game. As it turned out, officials from the local immigration and naturalization office had detained several foreigners. But they were not terrorists. They were young people from Libya whose student visas had expired. While that may seem amusing now, it wasn't then, and the story illustrates the kind of problems and concerns that confront the security and police agencies entrusted with keeping the Super Bowl and its attendant activies a free-flowing and safe week. Here, There, Everywhere For Super Bowl XXI, which will be played Sunday in the Pasadena Rose Bowl, the concerns are multiplied because of the logistics of staging the game and related events in so many different places within a 60-mile radius. Pasadena, for example, is about 40 miles north of Anaheim, which is the center for the hundreds of reporters covering the game, and the hotels in which the Giants and the Denver Broncos will stay are nearly 20 miles south, in Newport Beach. Other major sites are in between: the Los Angeles Rams' training facility here, where the Giants will practice; the University of California-Irvine, where the Broncos will practice, and Universal Studios in Burbank, where the annual league party will be held Friday night. ''We plan for the worst and hope for the best,'' said Warren Welsh, the N.F.L.'s director of security, who will coordinate security measures with more than a half-dozen agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the California Highway Patrol and the local police departments in the areas where Super Bowl-related activities will be held. There are many reasons for concern. This season in the N.F.L., Tom Landry, the coach of the Dallas Cowboys, was ushered off the field during a game against the Rams in Anaheim Stadium because of a death threat. He returned only after local police officers prevailed upon him to wear a bullet-proof jacket. Two teams, the Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks, had trips delayed when their planes had to be searched after bomb threats were received. Welsh also found it distressing that someone would parachute into Shea Stadium at the start of a World Series game. ''We have learned through the years that things can happen during a big event,'' he said. ''That's why we have contingency plans to deal with them. Our concerns are very real. On the other hand, we don't want people scared or players apprehensive because a coach had to put on a flak jacket. That was all a part of a comprehensive security package, and we would be remiss if we did not make plans for these kinds of things.'' An Army of Young Men A big part of the league's security package is the army of young men, many of them current and former college football players, who work for a local security firm employed by the league for many of its big events. These men, most of them built along the lines of a defensive end, are easily identified by their yellow or blue nylon jackets and are virtually everywhere: in the reporters' work rooms, at the reception area of the league's offices and with both teams in their hotels and at their practice sites. Other protective measures are less visible, such as the plainclothes officers the Pasadena Police Deparment intends to have wandering the Rose Bowl grounds the day of the game. Many of the game-day responsibilities will fall to the Pasadena police, whose biggest problems, according to Sgt. Frank McPherson, are traffic flow, parking and the kind of minor disturbances that can occur when more than 100,000 people are congregated in a small area. Pasadena, a community of about 150,000 people northeast of Los Angeles, is accustomed to annual big events. The champions of the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference play each New Year's Day in the Rose Bowl, following the Tournament of Roses parade, which attracts approximately 1 million spectators along the route. This will be the fourth Super Bowl played in the Rose Bowl. The Police Department has contingency plans for criminal activities. But Sergeant McPherson could not recall a major incident during a Rose Bowl or Super Bowl game in the 24 years he has served the force. ''There haven't been any bomb threats or terrorist groups trying to make a statement,'' he said. ''But we have had other kinds of incidents.'' One of them, he recalled, involved individuals from a nearby university, the California Institute of Technology. ''The individuals who attend that school are brilliant,'' Sergeant McPherson said. ''Somebody figured out how to intercept the code for the scoreboard during a Rose Bowl game. They left the score up but changed the schools, so it said, Cal Tech 35, Slippery Rock, 15. That's the worst thing I can remember. Maybe we have been lucky.'' The department's problems could be increased, he said, if a major political figure decided at the last minute to attend the game. The Super Bowl has attracted many officials over the years, including Vice President Bush in 1982, former President Carter, who sat in the Rose Bowl stands with his son Chip in 1984 and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has attended several. No incumbent President has attended a Super Bowl. So far, National Football League officials are aware of only a few dignitaries who plan to attend the game Sunday, including Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill of Massachusetts, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor Roy Romer of Colorado. The league personnel here have not yet heard from Governor George Deukmejian of California, Governor Kean of New Jersey or any New York State or City officials. In the instances politicians do attend, the Pasadena police work with the Secret Service or the F.B.I. An F.B.I. agent in the Los Angeles office, who asked that his name not be used, said the Super Bowl is a ''very minimal'' event for his office, ''which is not to say we are not concerned.'' ''We're just not the first line of defense,'' he said. ''Basically, we stay out of it unless we're asked by the locals to get involved.''

513-> THEATER; 'ROCKY HORROR' IN BRIDGEPORT MAKES THE BEST OF THE BAD
AFTER weekend performances of ''Oliver!'' at the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport, Mark Cheney's set changes from the streets and alleys of 19th-century London to the futuristic ''planet of the transsexual galaxy of Transylvania.'' Move over, Artful Dodger and Bill Sikes, and make way for Dr. Frank'n Furter (the bad, mad bisexual transvestite scientist), Riff-Raff (the hunchbacked butler), Rocky (the bleached-blond California ''Creation''), Trixie (the popcorn girl) and ''The Rocky Horror Show'' entourage. The 7:30 P.M. performances of the Dickensian musical and the 10 P.M. showings of the already passe, rock-horror show can hardly be called a double bill, as separate tickets are required for each show. In the half hour in which one audience leaves and another arrives, the set is changed. And those two audiences could not be less alike: The first show is described as a family entertainment, while the second is one for which, it is presumed, one leaves the family at home. To make the difference more evident, the theater's customary policy of bringing your own lunch bag or picnic basket does not prevail for the latter show, for ''Rocky Horror'' audiences are known for such antics as hurling rice at the stage, and the Bridgeport producers want none of that. Otherwise, the patrons deport themselves according to ''Rocky Horror'' ritual: Carrying audience participation to an extreme, they issue commands to the actors (''Go to the castle!''), comment upon the action, start and finish lines in the script and add ones that are not there. That sort of behavior has been going on for almost a decade, ever since the film version of the occult musical took on the status of a cult favorite, with audiences queued up for weekend midnight showings at movie theaters around the country -invariably equipped with word-for-word script knowledge and attired like their favorite characters in the show. In its original 1973 stage version, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' became a London hit that played for about five years. It had no such luck on Broadway, lasting a mere month in 1975. And for that, in accordance with the logic of Broadway economics, a theater was gutted - and redesigned as a cabaret. Clearly, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is more sensibly situated in Bridgeport than it was on Broadway. What is lacking, though, is a sleazy environment. The downtown cabaret is simply too nice a place for a show like this. With its inherent tackiness, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' ought to be the pre-demolition show in a crumbling cabaret or theater. Concocted (book, music, lyric) by Richard O'Brien, ''Rocky Horror'' is an intended send-up of horrible horror movies, and an unintended sampling of bad rock music. In an interview given to a British newspaper at the time of the ''Rocky Horror'' opening in the attic of London's Royal Court Theater, Mr. O'Brien conceded that he ''didn't know how to write a play or a musical.'' He went on: ''I don't know how to construct a sentence. I'm just an actor.'' (Mr. O'Brien, under the name Ritz O'Brien, played Riff-Raff in the London and Broadway productions.) What Mr. O'Brien wanted to do, he said, was ''pull together'' the components of his youth: ''comics, rock and late-night horror movies.'' What he came up with was a limp lampoon and a quaint picture of ingenuous decadence. The ingenuousness is neatly captured by the director, Bert Bernardi, who, perhaps not so incidentally, has staged more than a dozen shows for the cabaret's Children's Company. In an inventive directorial stroke, the show starts with on-screen credits. After Trixie and three ushers sing ''Science Fiction Double Feature,'' we are transported - along with Janet and Brad, the naive, newly married couple whose car has broken down - to the Gothic castle and its demented goings on. Out of dialogue that is either inane (''If only the car hadn't broken down'') or just plain insane (with references to ''laser beams of pure antimatter'') comes the show's final, uplifting message: ''Don't dream it; be it.'' Who can imagine a more extravagant buildup to a nonsequitor? With exaggerated postures, the Bridgeport cast makes deadpan, appealing fun of appalling material. Ironically, Phil Borchet comes off more prominently as the cliche-spouting narrator than as Fagin in ''Oliver!'' Jeri Sager, the impressively tough but good-hearted Nancy of ''Oliver!'' is as effective as the gullible, silly Janet, running through the castle, all too willing to participate in raunchy misadventures. Now that ''The Rocky Horror Show'' has been dusted off for the 1980's, perhaps it is time to put it away again. ''The Rocky Horror Show,'' at the Downtown Cabaret Theater, 263 Golden Hill Street, Bridgeport. 576-1636. Performances this Friday and Saturday at 10 P.M.

514-> DEBUT OF 'MORNING PROGRAM' ON CBS
HOW do you like your morning television? Who's for intimate and jolly? ''The Morning Program'' yearns to be loved; Mariette Hartley, Rolland Smith and the gang want to be members of the family. Maybe they will be in time, but yesterday they were self-conscious. It wasn't just that they were meeting us for the first time; they also seemed to be meeting one another. They worked too hard at having a swell time. ''The Morning Program,'' CBS's long-awaited, much publicized departure for 7:30 to 9 A.M. programming, is ''infotainment,'' filling a spot once occupied by CBS News. At 7:29 A.M., Miss Hartley joked about this in a commercial. ''Oh, you journalists are really hung up on facts,'' she said to Mr. Smith, once an anchor on WCBS-TV. ''A character flaw,'' he said gravely. It was, in its way, a preview of the next 90 minutes. Miss Hartley was aggressively perky; Mr. Smith was laid-back. Presumably, this was supposed to allow them, as co-hosts, to play off each other. It didn't work that way, however. Miss Hartley seemed determined to carry ''The Morning Program'' herself. ''No kidding,'' she told Pat Summerall, a guest, when he said his daughter was interested in athletics. ''No kidding,'' she said when he predicted the Super Bowl would be close. ''No kidding,'' she said when Dr. Robert Arnot, introduced as our ''personal health and medical adviser,'' said milk could be a stimulant. When, for reasons not clear, we saw a young couple who had just had a baby at New York University Medical Center, Mr. Smith asked the mother if anyone had advised her on how to raise children. ''My mother,'' she said. Miss Hartley said, ''No kidding.'' One, maybe two, no kiddings is acceptable; throw them around wholesale and they become merely something to say. ''The Morning Program'' suffered yesterday from a cacophony of voices. Perhaps the most cacophonous part was the first celebrity interview - with Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly of ''Cagney and Lacey.'' The two actresses and Miss Hartley sat with coffee cups at a kitchen table in front of a fireplace. Everyone was insistently hearty, and everyone talked at once. Consequently, whole sentences sprang free only occasionally. It was tough raising a family and being an actress; Miss Hartley used to meet Miss Daly in the supermarket; all three women had won Emmies. ''Is it over?'' one of the three said when the conversation ended. ''Congratulations - have a good time,'' drifted then out of the general hubbub. We had no idea of what anything had been about. On the other hand, maybe it didn't matter. ''The Morning Program'' was trying for the appearance of intimacy. Miss Gless and Miss Daly were supposed to be two old pals who dropped by for coffee. After they left, Mr. Smith introduced a segment called ''Personals.'' This was more intimacy - the ''videotaped hopes'' of two young men and one young woman. Chris, from New York, wanted ''someone to share with.'' Brenda, from California, wanted a ''loving, compassionate man.'' Al, also from California, wanted an ''intelligent, attractive lady.'' Candidates could write to the address that then flashed on the screen. In fact, Chris, Brenda and Al were all attractive. Why were they pleading on television? While we wondered, ''The Morning Program'' offered a clue. It came on with its logo, which yesterday featured an orange. Sometimes the orange turned into the ''O'' in ''Morning.'' Sometimes it squirted juice. That's it, we thought. This is morning breakfast television. This is something new. Well, maybe, but Chris, Brenda and Al were still a little discomfiting. Should we really worry whether they had dates? On then to the segment with Dr. Arnot, ''our very own family doctor,'' who talked about good and bad food while Miss Hartley and Mr. Smith interjected. When the segment was over, the audience applauded. Score a point now for courage; it's brave of ''The Morning Program'' to perform live. But where do you find people that early in the morning? At one point, the camera swept the studio. In the first row, a child slept on a mother's lap. Subsequently, someone said, ''Stay tuned for Sophia Loren.'' That sounded pretty good. Before that, however, Daisy, a golden retriever, came out to visit. ''Hello, sweetheart,'' Miss Hartley said. Daisy, apparently, was her dog, and it was a kind of intimacy again. What was most noticeable, though, was the way Daisy took over. It was as if she were a small child who had wandered into a gathering of adults who were uncomfortable with one another. They become enthralled by the child. The gang on ''The Morning Program'' - Miss Hartley, Mr. Smith, Mark McEwen, who does the weather, and Bob Saget, the resident comic - became enthralled by Daisy. It was a sign that something was wrong with the show. Eventually, Miss Loren did come along, only on tape and not, as the come-on had suggested, for a live visit. Robert Osborne, the show's entertainment reporter, asked Miss Loren if she felt like a foreigner in the United States. ''No,'' she answered, ''I feel I'm very much loved.'' Back then for a shot of Daisy, while Miss Hartley laughingly introduced Roy Blount Jr. - ''no kidding, the self-appointed chairman for the singing impaired'' - who did a comic essay on politics. It had its moments. More politics then: Mr. Smith introduced Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, newly elected to the House of Representatives from Massachusetts. Mr. Kennedy said he didn't think ''people are treating me differently because I'm a Kennedy,'' and that ''it's time the American people woke up.'' The co-hosts looked solemn. One had a vision of Washington press secretaries scrambling for phones, trying to book their bosses. That was about it. Daisy came back. Someone said she had shed. ''Kind of a fun first morning,'' Mr. Smith declared. ''I can't believe it,'' Miss Hartley added. Daisy wandered off while we saw the credits. No kidding. ''The Morning Program'' has a way to go.

515-> THE WORLD; O'Connor Learns As He Goes
Like many prominent Americans before him, John Cardinal O'Connor visited the Middle East last week proclaiming good will, only to encounter a storm of regional bitterness. The Archbishop of New York had been invited to Israel by Shimon Peres, who was then Prime Minister, but after a telephone call from a Vatican representative, he canceled plans to meet top Israeli leaders in their Jerusalem offices. The Cardinal said he had ''made a mistake'' and ''failed to be sufficiently thorough in my preparations.'' The Vatican, like many other states, has not accepted Jerusalem as Israel's capital or its annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. Some American Jewish leaders said the Cardinal's visit should be canceled, noting that he was meeting King Hussein in Jordan. He also visited Palestine refugee camps and reiterated support for Palestinian ''self-determination,'' a formulation rejected by Israel. Crossing into Israel, Cardinal O'Connor went first to St. Saviour's Church in East Jerusalem, where he apologized ''for any offenses that might have been perceived by those who govern Israel.'' Later, he called on the city's mayor, Teddy Kollek, and met with the Minister of Religious Affairs, Zevulon Hammer.

516-> Advertising; Publisher Set at Time Magazine
REGINALD BRACK JR., the new chief of the Time Inc. magazine operation, announced further changes in the operation yesterday. The most important shifts are the naming of Richard B. Thomas to the new position of top advertising sales executive in the group and Robert L. Miller to replace him as publisher of Time magazine, the company's flagship publication. Additionally, Richard W. Angle Jr. has been put in charge of almost everything that is outside the publisher's chores and has been promoted to senior vice president. Mr. Thomas, 55 years old, was once an associate publisher of People and had been publisher of Time since 1985. Mr. Miller, 37, has been a group publisher with several magazines reporting to him. While he will continue to be a group publisher, the only other publication reporting to him will be the recently formed joint venture with McCall's and Working Woman. The reorganization that accompanies the promotions will also include a change in the reporting system that previously had all publishers reporting to two group publishers, Mr. Miller and S. Christopher Meigher 3d. Now the publishers of the monthlies, Life, Money and Discover, and the biweekly Fortune will report to Mr. Meigher, while the publishers of the weeklies, Time, Sports Illustrated and People, will report directly to Mr. Brack, chief executive of the Magazine Group. Mr. Meigher's responsibilities include working ''closely'' with the Southern Progress Corporation subsidiary. On Mr. Brack's highest council will be John A. Meyers, chairman of the Magazine Group; Mr. Thomas; Mr. Miller; Mr. Meigher; Mr. Angle, and Michael J. Klingensmith, chief financial officer. Time Inc. announced earlier this month that it planned to take a $63 million fourth-quarter charge for the cost of staff cuts, which will be coming largely from the 5,000 employees in the magazine area and the several hundred in the corporate ranks. Yesterday's announced changes seemed aimed at trimming some reporting levels. Mr. Angle, for example, has been in charge of only corporate manufacturing and distribution. His new role will also make him responsible for circulation, Time Distribution Services, the newsstand sales operation, subscription fulfillment and human resources. The announcement notes that Mr. Thomas, who had been first ad director of both Money and People and more recently worldwide sales director of Time magazine, will now be ''responsible for addressing groupwide advertising sales opportunities, issues and policies.'' Mr. Miller was born in Los Angeles and raised in San Francisco and Darien, Conn. He got his bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1971 and an M.B.A. from Columbia in 1974, after which he immediately joined Time Inc. in the controller's department. From there, he went to Time-Life Books but soon got into magazines with a spot on Sports Illustrated, of which he became publisher in 1983. In a 1985 reorganization, Mr. Miller was made group publisher of People, Sports Illustrated, Life and Discover, while Mr. Meigher became group publisher of Time, Fortune, Money and Southern Progress. Time magazine was down by 110 ad pages last year, to 2,582, while advertising revenues were $344 million, down from $347 million, as estimated by Publishers Information Bureau. However, although Time magazine's ad pages were down, its market share in the newsweekly field was up because Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report were down a higher percentage in 1986. Mr. Brack returned to the Magazine Group as its leader in December when J. Richard Munro, president of Time Inc., switched him out of his job as head of the Books Group and replaced him with Kelso Sutton, the former magazine head. Since then, Elizabeth Valk has been named publisher of Life, and James B. Hayes appointed publisher of Fortune.

517-> ON EAST 104TH ST., A CHILDREN'S EPIPHANY
Amid live camels and papier-mache kings, about 1,000 schoolchildren - transformed by costumes into angels, kings, shepherds and peasants - celebrated the Epiphany yesterday in a parade that wound through Spanish Harlem. Frances de la Rosa Flores, a 6-year-old from Mexico whose shepherd's cowl flowed behind him, described the day, known as Three Kings Day, succinctly in Spanish as one representing ''happiness and love.'' The parade, sponsored by El Museo del Barrio, is in its 10th year, and is one of the few Epiphany celebrations that has not been transferred to the Sunday closest to Jan. 6. For many, it is a reminder of the larger festivals that were held yesterday in Latin American countries, where the three kings who visited the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem rival Santa Claus in importance. On Monday night, many of the city's Hispanic children joined others elsewhere in the world in putting out grass and water for the kings' camels and going to bed to await the gifts the magi would bring. The Hispanic children celebrating the feast at yesterday's parade, which began at El Museo del Barrio at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, were straightforward and brief in describing the day's significance. A Reminder of Puerto Rico For Marita Gonzalez, a 10-year-old dressed in a veil as the Virgin Mary, it reminded her of Puerto Rico, where members of her family celebrated with roast pig, sweet rice pudding and songs. To Michael Rodriquez, a 10-year-old sporting a straw hat, it represented a day of fun. Most of the children were bundled in parkas, long johns and tights hidden by robes, wings fashioned out of cardboard and hangers, cowls and halos of silver tinsel. Many of the children chose to dress as one of the three kings - Balthasar, the black king associated with Africa and, for some, equality; Melchior, bald and wearing a white beard, and the beardless, youthful Gaspar. After a moment of silence for the victims and families affected by the hotel fire in San Juan, P.R., that has claimed 96 lives, the parade left the museum at 10:30 A.M. and moved east on 104th Street to return two hours later. Not everything went as planned. One of the papier-mache kings created by Rosalie Roman could not be assembled in time and lay in parts inside the museum, according to the artist. A young boy, frightened by the mule he was to ride, had to be replaced, and one of the camels had a leg injury, forcing the third king to walk the parade route. The Epiphany, primarily an Eastern religious feast, moved from Syria and Egypt to Spain and other southern European countries in the fourth century, said the Rev. James Lara, director of the office of liturgy and cultural affairs at the Northeast Pastoral Center for Hispanics. It became imbedded in Spain's cultural life, and the conquistadors brought the tradition to the New World where it has evolved into an important holiday in places the Spanish colonized. While the Spanish tradition is to emphasize the visit of the magi on the Epiphany, Eastern Orthodox churches give special attention to the spiritual birth, or baptism, of Christ, according to the Rev. Efthimiou Milton, director of the Department of Church and Society for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America.

518-> 3 State Governors Sworn In
Roy Romer, a Democrat, was sworn in yesterday as Colorado's 59th Governor. Mr. Romer, who had been the State Treasurer since 1977, succeeded Richard D. Lamm, a Democrat who held the office for 12 years. Also sworn in were Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, to a fourth term, and Gov. Joe Frank Harris of Georgia, to a second term.

519-> U.S. CONGRESSMAN WARNS KENYA AGAINST A TREND OF RIGHTS ABUSE
An American Congressman said today that a growing trend of human rights abuses by the Government of Kenya could ultimately lead to instability and damage the country's strong relations with the United States. The legislator, Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, said his personal experiences in Kenya since he arrived on Friday had reinforced his concerns on human rights. He asserted that scheduled meetings with Kenyans never took place because of Government intimidation and that a meeting with a church leader had been broken up by the police. Mr. Wolpe, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said at a news conference here that he had received ''a number of reports'' of a marked decline in political and press freedom in Kenya, which over the last decade has been one of the largest recipients of United States aid in Africa. Mr. Wolpe voiced concern over an increase in what he called intimidation and imprisonment of people because of their political views. He said that the holding of as many as 62 political prisoners had been publicly acknowledged, although some critics of the Government contend that more than 1,000 are being held. Mr. Wolpe also said that there had been a steady increase in the number of arrests of Kenyans critical of the Government's policies. 'I Am Here as a Friend' Mr. Wolpe specifically mentioned the case of Maina wa Kinyatti, a senior lecturer at Kenyatta University who was jailed in 1982 on charges of possessing a seditious publication. Mr. Kinyatti was sentenced to six years in a maximum-security prison and was recently denied a reduction in his sentence. The Congressman said that Mr. Kinyatti's health was rapidly deteriorating and that he had asked Kenya's Foreign Minister to release Mr. Kinyatti on humanitarian grounds. The Congressman had stopped briefly in Kenya after visits to Zimbabwe and Botswana, where he was co-chairman of a meeting of the African-American Institute. Mr. Wolpe said that he had asked for a meeting with Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi, and two Government ministers to discuss the human rights issue as well as economic and other matters, but had been told that they were unavailable. The Congressman's visit came during a growing crackdown on internal dissent, according to political commentators here. A recently approved constitutional amendment stripped the security of tenure from the powerful posts of Attorney General and Auditor General, making them subject to dismissal by the President.

520-> DINING OUT; COZY FRENCH FOR HEARTY APPETITES
AT least three restaurants are clustered along Torrington's Main Street, making it a small-scale Restaurant Row. Newest is Le Rochambeau, whose name telegraphs the French menu you find within. Once you have entered, leaving your coats in the long tavern-like bar on the left, you move into an equally elongated dining room on the right. Despite its name, Le Rochambeau is a comfortable, family-style place. The booths along one wall contribute to that feeling, and so does the friendliness of the staff. The booths and a row of well-spaced tables along the other wall are well napped, each table graced with fresh flowers. The menu, like the room, has a homey familiarity, with many French perennials such as frog legs Provencale, breast of capon cordon bleu, half roast duckling with sauce Bigarade, filet mignon with bearnaise sauce and sirloin peppercorn steak flambee with cognac. Portions, too, are old-fashioned, with plates crowded with pre-nouvelle cuisine abundance. Never mind if something may have been lost in translation from France to Torrington - go with a large appetite and you will surely find enough dishes to provide a satisfying meal. Prices, in keeping with the neighborhood tone, are as reasonable as the portions are large. We began one repast with oysters Rockefeller, but Le Rochambeau's version was only a distant cousin of the New Orleans creation. Moderate-sized oysters, tucked beneath a placid bechamel sauce, rested on a bed of bland, chopped spinach. Go for mussels Biarritz, a steaming abundance of them, redolent with a herb-shallot butter or a competently prepared artichoke vinaigrette. Crepes de fruits de mer consisted of a single large, pale crepe stuffed with bits of shrimp and a strong-tasting fish. It, too, was blanketed in bechamel. Terrine pate du chef, described by the waitress as pheasant liver and pheasant meat in a terrine, might well have been as stated, except that a strong refrigerator flavor masked all others. On the basis of our experience, you might be advised to skip a first course. Before your entree arrives, you will be served a delicious salad of crisp, fresh greens and cherry tomatoes, lightly tossed with an excellent creamy vinaigrette. In contrast to the appetizers, every one of our entrees was a winner, from the tender veal kidneys au poivre vert, sauteed with mushrooms in a spirited green peppercorn sauce, to a succulent mussels mariniere in a subtle Riesling bath, an Italianate osso bucco, well-cooked veal knuckles in a robust sauce and a predictably garlicky frog legs Provencale. Breaded sweetbreads Dijonnaise was on the menu, but our waitress suggested it could be ordered unbreaded - a thoughtful and wise choice. The award for largest portion went without challenge to the quails baccus: two small, well-cooked birds wrapped in bacon, coddled in a white wine sauce with large white grapes. That was ample enough, but the plate was piled high with a wild rice mix, pickled red cabbage, mashed potatoes with a browned edging, three tiny, crisp, surprisingly light potato balls and a serving of flattened pork scaloppine wrapped, rouladen-style, around cooked spinach. Too much too late. Desserts are homemade and, again, portions are generous. Good selections included a serviceable creme caramel and a star-quality, almond-flavored meringue glace with a scoop of velvety chocolate ice cream in the center - a luscious, throw-diets-to-the-wind kind of dessert. Expect to pay around $32.50 to $40 for a three-course dinner for two, without tax, tip or beverages. The wine list is also moderately priced. Le Rochambeau Good 46 Main Street, Torrington. 482-9626. Atmosphere: A long, cheerful, family-style dining room with booths on one side, tables on the other and fresh flowers on each well-napped table. Service: Businesslike, competent, friendly.

521-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Repeat That, Please

522-> IN SUMMARY: PHILIPPINES; 'Maximum Tolrenance' Is Put to the Test
LAST week's killing of 12 protesters by Government policemen substantially raised the already enormous pressure on President Corazon C. Aquino and appeared to set the limit on her policy of ''maximum tolerance.'' In a rapid barrage that lasted less than a minute, troops fired into a crowd of about 10,000 demonstrators after some marchers pushed through a police line near the Presidential Palace in Manila. About 100 people were wounded. Many marchers were peasant farmers, demanding changes in land policy. But the opposition that took part was broad-based, and it appeared that the country's left wing was joining the extreme right in an attempt to destabilize the Aquino Government at a crucial time. In eight days, the Philippines is to vote on a proposed constitution that would give the Government a legal basis and lay the framework for democratic rule. ''In the period before the plebiscite, attempts to destabilize the Government and defeat our democratic aims will intensify,'' Mrs. Aquino warned in a televised address hours after the violence. ''We are prepared for this contingency. We shall have order throughout our land.'' In any case, said Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the armed forces Chief of Staff, his troops had ''overreacted to the situation.'' The police earlier said the marchers had fired shots at the troops, who were protected by shields stenciled with the Government's slogan, ''maximum tolerance.'' Even before the security forces braced for a leftist response to the killings on Thursday, they were on alert because of rumors of a coup attempt by right-wing military elements. Several groups have said they will hold another rally tomorrow. Mrs. Aquino's leftist opponents said that Thursday's killings were proof that her Government was repressive, while the right contended that the incident proved she was incompetent. Meanwhile, Communist negotiators who had come out of hiding to participate in Government-engineered peace talks were returning underground. They said their lives had been threatened. The day of the protest march, in what intelligence sources said may have been part of a coordinated turn against the Aquino Government by the left wing, the talks were indefinitely suspended. A 60-day cease-fire that expires Feb. 8 remained in effect. But the prospects for a resumption of talks and extension of the truce, the centerpiece of Mrs. Aquino's policy of reconciliation, have severely dimmed.

523-> JEWISH GROUPS IN U.S. PRAISE O'CONNOR'S MEETING IN ISRAEL
Jewish groups in the United States yesterday praised John Cardinal O'Connor for meeting with President Chaim Herzog of Israel at the President's mansion. One Jewish spokesman described Cardinal O'Connor's decision to meet with President Herzog as an act of ''noble ecumenism and high statesmanship.'' Another Jewish figure said it was ''a remarkable concession,'' and another called it a gesture inspired by ''generous spirit and human love.'' Many of these same spokesmen were critical of the Vatican last week when the controversy over the meetings arose. ''Cardinal O'Connor has performed an act of noble ecumenism and high statesmanship, marking another milestone in the progress of Catholic-Jewish relations initiated by Pope John XXIII and carried forward by his successors,'' said Morris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, which is composed of the heads of the 40 largest Jewish groups in the United States. ''In view of the earlier controversy over the Cardinal's plans to visit Israel's leaders in Jerusalem, we can only conclude that Pope John Paul II himself gave his blessing to Cardinal O'Connor's action,'' Mr. Abram said. ''This would be consistent with the historic act of the Pope last year in visiting the Great Synagogue of Rome, and in extending there his hand in brotherhood to the Jewish people.'' 'An Effective Compromise' Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which is the central body of Reform Judiasm in the United Stated and Canada, called the meeting ''an effective compromise based on good will and good sense.'' ''By visiting the President of Israel in the equivalent of our White House, Cardinal O'Connor made a remarkable concession that is deeply appreciated and that will be long remembered,'' Rabbi Schindler said. ''On a political level, the Cardinal's action may be an indication that the Vatican is prepared to reconsider its position on Jerusalem,'' he said. ''If the Vatican is indeed ready to review its longstanding opposition to Israel's adminstration of the Holy City, then Cardinal O'Connor's visit could have history-making implications for the relations between Christians and Jews and for all the peoples of the Middle East.'' Lester Pollack, president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, also praised the meeting. ''We can safely assume that the Cardinal's persistent good will in this regard convinced those who would have avoided meetings with Israel's political leadership that their position was counterproductive,'' he said. Seymour Reich, president of B'nai B'rith International, said, ''Rome is the center of the Catholic religious world, and Mecca is the holy city of Islam. Only for Jews is Jerusalem the great center of faith.'' ''That is why Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state, and that is why Jews everywhere will welcome the generous spirit and human love that inspired Cardinal O'Connor to call on the President of Israel in his official residence in the holy city of Jerusalem.''

524-> THE ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE
THE last words Gabriel Shaul heard his father say were ''hazak baruch,'' or ''be strong and blessed,'' a congratulatory phrase chanted by the congregation after the reading of a section of the Torah, Judaism's holy book. It was then that Gabriel, age 20, glanced to one side of Neve Shalom Synagogue and saw the terrorist standing in the doorway. The terrorist looked about as old as Gabriel. He wore sunglasses and was dressed in black. Gabriel blinked. The terrorist opened fire. Gabriel, who was seated next to his father near the front of the temple, dropped to the floor and hid under a bench. As the terrorist sprayed the synagogue with machine-gun fire, Gabriel felt his father slump down next to him, his face turned away. Gabriel played dead as the deafening sound of machine-gun fire echoed through the vast, newly renovated synagogue. Bodies fell around him. Screams and moans of the worshipers gave way to the voices of the two terrorists yelling instructions at each another in a language Gabriel thought was Arabic. He felt wet and glanced down at his clothes. He was lying in blood. He lay there, motionless, as the terrorists circled the room, firing more bullets into the bodies to insure that the Jews were dead. The terrorist approached his bench. The man in black sprinkled something on his father's leg - a clear fluid that smelled faintly of gasoline. The terrorist struck a match and set Gabriel's father's leg on fire. ''I realized my father was dead when his leg was burning, but he didn't move,'' Gabriel said. GABRIEL SHAUL IS ONE OF seven Jews who survived the terrorist attack last Sept. 6 at Neve Shalom, Istanbul's largest synagogue, whose name means ''oasis of peace.'' The others who had gone there for Saturday services to pray - 22 people, aged 30 to 82 - all were killed. Four months have passed since the Istanbul synagogue massacre and in capitals throughout the West, the verdict of responsibility has been assigned. The incident, it is widely believed, has all the earmarks of Abu Nidal. Abu Nidal, the nom de guerre of Sabry al-Banna, a Palestinian born in Jaffe in 1937, is said to head the Middle East's deadliest terrorist organization. A United States State Department report on the group issued early last year attributes more than 60 terrorist attacks to Abu Nidal in the last eight years, 30 since the beginning of 1984; 20 of the 1985 attacks were in Western Europe. The experts agree that Abu Nidal's group, which calls itself the Fatah Revolutionary Council, was involved in the synagogue massacre, but few who have examined the evidence believe that any single terrorist group could have carried out the attack without state-sponsored logistical support. Indeed, a six-week investigation by this reporter of the attack on the Sabbath worshippers - which turned the elegant Neve Shalom Synagogue into a charred and blood-stained slaughterhouse - points to a far more disturbing conclusion. Interviews with terrorism experts in Paris, London, Jerusalem and Istanbul suggest that the massacre was carried out not by one group, but by several, with the assistance of more than one govern= ment, acting together and sharing responsibilities and a division of terrorist labor. THE ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE massacre, these sources now believe, reflects the perfection of a new brand of cooperative international terrorism that attempts to leave no fingerprints and whose sponsors are intended to have no address. The evidence to back up this conclusion, while circumstantial, is persuasive. It includes clearly marked Communist-bloc weapons found at the synagogue and at the sites of other terrorist attacks in Turkey, plus information from a terrorist under arrest in Pakistan. This, along with the evidence provided by ballistics, terrorist interrogators, surveillance of clandestine shipments in diplomatic pouches, all point to three states as possible sponsors of the Istanbul carnage: Syria, Libya and Iran. Terrorism experts have conflicting scenarios, and are deeply divided over which country played the leading role in staging the synagogue attack. Israeli experts tend to blame Syria; the Turkish intelligence agency believes that Iran played the dominant role; Turkish police suspect Libya. Some American analysts believe that all three were deeply involved. An Israeli terrorism expert notes that cooperation in the logistics of terrorism has been seen before. ''Libya buys, stores and distributes weapons through its pouch; Syria provides the logistical intelligence and training needed for such an attack; Iran provides the suicide commandos and some funding,'' he said. American intelligence analysts believe that both Syria and Iran played a role in the murderous 1983 attack on the United States Marine barracks in Lebanon, and that Syria, as well as Libya, was involved in the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque last year. Publicly accusing Syria, Libya and Iran of involvement in the synagogue attack could have painful consequences for the Turkish Government. Turkey has long borders with Syria and Iran and has $3 billion in construction projects in Libya, money that Ankara desperately needs. Turkey is not alone in its discomfiture. The Reagan Administration is currently embroiled in a major crisis over clandestine arms shipments to Iran, the last of which was made in October, just a month after the Neve Shalom massacre. So for the moment, it is easier for Turkey, as well as for the United States, to blame the elusive Abu Nidal. (Box, page 47). ''Ask yourself a question,'' said one Israeli terrorism expert who has followed the Turkish investigation closely. ''If a young Irish woman had gotten aboard that El Al jet in London last April, if she and her unborn baby and some 375 other passengers had been blown to bits over Austria, if we had never learned that there was a Palestinian named Hindawi who could be traced directly to Syria's doorstep, whom do you think we would have blamed for the bombing?'' the expert said. ''It would have been blamed on Abu Nidal.'' ''When an attack succeeds,'' he concluded, ''it's Abu Nidal. When it fails, we discover that it was Syria, or Iran, or Libya.'' Although unwilling to declare its suspicions publicly because of diplomatic pressures and fear of further terrorist incidents, Turkey has recently taken highly unusual steps to thwart future terrorist attacks. In November, Ankara quietly expelled a Syrian diplomat and two diplomats from Iran suspected of involvement in the 1985 murder of a Jordanian diplomat - also blamed on Abu Nidal. Though it was never said publicly, the diplomats were also suspected by some Turkish officials of complicity in the Istanbul synagogue massacre. ALTHOUGH IT IS surrounded by Arab and Moslem states and 99 percent of its people are Moslems, Turkey was one of the first states in the region to recognize Israel, back in early 1950. The Israeli flag flies openly over its consulate in Ankara, the capital, and Turkey, whose 22,000 Jews have been relatively well treated over the centuries, has open, but low-key commercial and tourist exchanges with Israel. There are also important but unpublicized forms of cooperation between the countries. Turkish and Israeli police and intelligence agents, for example, often work closely together. Within hours after the attack on the Neve Shalom Synagogue, therefore, Israeli and American experts were working quietly with Turkish police, hunting for clues to the identity of the terrorists, combing through the debris, interrogating witnesses to the attack. What soon became frighteningly clear was that they had precious little to go on. ''This was a highly professional operation,'' said Yildirim Akbulut, Turkey's Minister of the Interior, in an interview in Ankara. Professionalism, in this case, meant that almost no clues to the identity of the terrorists were left behind. Nevertheless, the Turkish police and the Turkish intelligence agency soon came to some preliminary conclusions. First, Interior Minister Akbulut says that the operation was almost certainly a suicide mission. According to initial press reports, the terrorists had attacked the synagogue's congregation with hand grenades and machine guns. But the investigation by Turkey has revealed that the terrorists killed worshippers with machine-gun bullets; they reserved the hand grenades for blowing themselves up after they had completed their grisly mission. What is more, survivors said that the terrorists barred an interior door of the synagogue, which leads investigators to believe that no one, including the terrorists, was meant to escape. The terrorists' grenades were extremely powerful and, some intelligence agents believe, may have had specially rigged short fuses for immediate detonation rather than the standard three- to five-second delay that enables a grenade to be aimed and thrown. The force of the blasts blew apart the terrorists' bodies, splattering pieces of their flesh everywhere on the synagogue's freshly stuccoed and painted walls. The grenades so mangled the terrorists' bodies that identification proved extremely difficult. One terrorist apparently held his grenade close to his head, which Turkish police found blasted into the top of the synagogue's vaulted ceiling, more than 40 feet overhead. The second terrorist - and Turkish police believe there were only two assailants inside the synagogue - held the grenade to his stomach. All that remained of him were a mutilated torso and head, and the remnants of two legs, below the knees. Based on this information, plus descriptions of the terrorists provided by eyewitnesses inside the synagogue - among them, Gabriel Shaul -Turkish police made composite drawings of their faces, which were published in all the Turkish newspapers. To prevent identification of the country in which the terrorists' clothes had been purchased, the labels of every item of clothing had been cut out, apparently with a razor blade. Saffet Arikan Beduk, chief of the Turkish police and Director General for Security, said that his agents had found two clues suggesting that the assailants had been in Turkey for at least a day or two, and probably longer, before the massacre: a pair of Turkish-made tennis shoes on one of the terrorists, and a Turkish-made towel that had been used to cover the top of the satchel in which the terrorists, posing as photographers, had carried their machine guns and grenades into the synagogue. Mr. Beduk said that his agents had visited almost every store where that brand of towel and tennis shoes were sold - literally ''hundreds of stores,'' he said. ''We've had no luck.'' One police investigator said that the authorities had also concluded, despite the scant information available, that the terrorists were definitely Moslems, probably Arabs. ''First, Jews in the synagogue heard them speaking Arabic,'' said a Western agent close to the investigation. ''Second,'' he added, ''autopsies showed that they were both circumcised.'' Moslems, like Jews, insist on this practice for religious reasons. Police painstakingly pieced together the extant parts of the two terrorists' bodies, including tiny pieces of the fingers of one of the murderers to obtain partial fingerprints. These prints, along with actual photographs of the head of one assailant and the drawings of both, were sent to Interpol, the French-based international crime-fighting organization. But Western officials confirm that the agency has not been able to provide a positive identification of either terrorist. Nevertheless, Turkish police recently scored something of a breakthrough when a vital tip was provided by Pakistan, which has close ties with Turkey. The day before the Istanbul massacre, four terrorists stormed and attempted to hijack a Pan American jet at the airport in Karachi before they were overcome by Pakistani commando units. Although one of the terrorists carried a Libyan passport and is believed to be a Libyan national, Pakistani police and intelligence officials say that the hijackers are Palestinians trained in Lebanon and that some of them have links to Abu Nidal. During their interrogation, which is believed to have been physically punishing, Pakistani police showed the composite drawing of the two Istanbul terrorists to the hijackers. One of the hijackers claimed to recognize one of the photos. He told Pakistani police that it was of an Arab, one of the young men who had been trained in Syrian-controlled Lebanon - by Abu Nidal. The hijacker said he had never known the dead man's name or country of origin, but he recognized him by a peculiar scar on what was left of his face. ANOTHER IMPORTANT clue to the sponsors of the synagogue attack was the weapons that the terrorists left behind. Turkish police found more than 100 spent cartridges on the floor of the synagogue, two machine guns that they said were Polish-made, and seven unexploded Soviet-made grenades, a few of which were apparently defective. These weapons, some of which were the same type as those found in an attempted bombing of an American officers' club in Ankara last spring, have prompted Turkish police to suspect Libyan involvement in the synagogue raid. Libyan sponsorship of terrorism in Turkey has been a politically thorny problem for the Turks, Western officials said and Turkish authorities acknowledged. Turkish intelligence agencies have long kept Libya's diplomats under careful surveillence. Months before the attack on the synagogue, Turkish officials were quietly monitoring the weapons, false passports and identification papers that Libya routinely sent into Turkey through embassy pouches and mail. After the United States bombed Tripoli in April in reprisal for suspected Libyan-sponsored terrorism, Turkey, fearing that Libya would try to strike at the United States through its substantial military presence in Turkey, stepped up this routine surveillance of Libyan diplomats and offices. Three days after the American bombing, two Libyans who had been loitering at the United States officers' club in Ankara were arrested and charged with attempting to blow up the club by planting grenades on the building's roof. The grenades they were carrying, like those in the synagogue, were Soviet-made. Soon after the arrests at the officers' club, Robert Strausz-Hupe, United States Ambassador to Turkey, visited Turkish officials and demanded action against Libya's Ambassador, the deputy chief of mission and the head of the consulate in Ankara. The American Ambassador gave the Turks evidence that these three Libyan diplomats had been involved in the bungled terrorist attack on the officers' club. ''The Americans presented irrefutable proof that the weapons for the raid had been stored and distributed by the Libyans,'' said one Western source. ''They demanded the immediate expulsion of all three and asked Turkey to close the People's Bureaus'' - the name Libya uses for its diplomatic offices. Fearful of angering Libya through a public expulsion, Turkey quietly prevailed upon Libya to withdraw its emissaries. In midsummer, Libyan Ambassador Mohammad Abdul Malik, who was expelled from the United States in 1980 for similar terrorist activities and from Switzerland in 1983, and Ali M. Al-Zayyani, his deputy, left Turkey for ''reassignment.'' The consul in Ankara has remained. In November, Mr. Malik quietly returned to Turkey, ostensibly to buy some property for a nephew. As of mid-December, he was still in Ankara, Western sources said. The grenades found on the terrorists outside the officers' club were the same make and model as those found inside the Neve Shalom Synagogue, Chief of Police Beduk confirmed in an interview. About a month before the Istanbul massacre, Turkish police found a cache of weapons - grenades and machine guns - in a satchel in the Belgrade Forest, a wooded area on the outskirts of Istanbul. The weapons had clearly been left for a covert pickup, according to Turkish police. The police staked out the site for a month. When no (Continued on Page 32) pickup occurred, they recovered the bag shortly before the synagogue attack and analyzed the grenades and machine guns. What intrigued them were the machine guns. They weapons came in four parts, presumably to be assembled by their users. The serial numbers had been scratched out. In their place was a hand-carved number; the same number had been etched into each part of the machine gun, with a different number for each gun. This, Turkish police say, would enable the terrorists to smuggle the pieces in individually; they could then be collected and assembled shortly before use. Police Chief Beduk said the two machine guns found inside the Neve Shalom Synagogue also had their serial numbers removed. On one of the guns, the number ''11'' had been hand-etched into each of its four parts. Both sets of weapons were 9-millimeter, rapid-fire Makarov models. By subjecting the weapons found in the Belgrade Forest and those found at the synagogue to infrared analysis, Turkish police, with Western assistance, were able to identify the original serial numbers of the guns. According to Mr. Beduk, there could be no doubt that the weapons were from the same series. The grenades found in the forest were the same type as those used at the synagogue. They were also the same type as those found at the failed Libyan attack against the American officers' club. Those grenades had been supplied by Libya. Y ET ANOTHER CLUE to the origins of the synagogue massacre was developed during an investigation by the Turkish police of an earlier terrorist attack - the murder in July 1985 of Ziad al-Sati, a first secretary at the Jordanian Embassy in Ankara who is a relative of Zaid Bin Shaker, a senior Jordanian military officer and King Hussein's closest friend and adviser. The identity of the killers was only recently discovered, thanks to the synagogue investigation. After the synagogue attack, Turkish police rounded up for questioning more than 80 of the some 2,500 to 3,000 Palestinians in Turkey. In November, Turkish authorities formally charged six of them with the murder of Mr. Sati. All six Palestinian students, the indictment stated, had confessed to being members of the Abu Nidal group, which, the prosecutor alleged officially for the first time, had also carried out the synagogue attack. But Abu Firaz, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Ankara, asserted that the students had been ''tortured'' into making their confessions. P.L.O. sources say the arrests enraged Abu Firaz because the students had been working for him. Their mission, the P.L.O. says, was to infiltrate the Abu Nidal group for Abu Firaz, so that he could help Turkish police smash the organization in Turkey, which had attempted four times to kill him and other P.L.O. officials here. Some experts suspect that Abu Firaz may be a double agent - that he works not only for the P.L.O., but also for Abu Nidal, the P.L.O.'s sworn enemy. ''Here is a good example of why it's impossible in this part of the world to know who is working for whom,'' said Ertugrul Ozkok, Ankara bureau chief of Hurriyet, a leading Turkish newspaper. Whomever they were working for, the arrested students (Continued on Page 36) provided Turkish police with information that led directly to the Syrian and Iranian Embassies. In mid-November, the Turks arrested Adnan Ameri, a translator at the Jordanian Embassy who confessed to having worked for Syrian intelligence. His control officer, he said, was a Syrian diplomat in Turkey who had given the order to have Mr. Sati assassinated. Syria, Mr. Ameri said in a public statement, had ordered the Abu Nidal group to carry out the murder. On Nov. 21, Mohammed Darwichi Baladi, a second secretary at the Syrian Embassy, left Turkey only hours before a prosecutor accused him publicly of involvement in the Sati murder. Ali Kent, a Turk of Iranian origin, was arrested at the same time as Mr. Ameri. He had rented the car used to gun down the Jordanian. Mr. Kent identified himself as the chief administrator and liaison for Islamic Jihad, the Lebanese-based Shiite Moslem extremist group that has close ties to Iran. His goal, he said, was to destabilize Turkey and spread the fervor of the Iranian revolution there. Working closely with Syria, along with Iranian cover groups, Mr. Kent said that he had staged many clandestine operations in Turkey. In late December, two Iranian diplomats left Turkey at the Turkish Government's request. A statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said only that the two had abused their diplomatic status by attempting to ''recruit men to fight against the Turkish secular system.'' The indictments against Mr. Ameri and Mr. Kent mark the first time that members of the Abu Nidal group and of the extremist Iranian-dominated Islamic Jihad organization have been publicly linked to a terrorist attack in Turkey. While the charge against them is the murder of a Jordanian diplomat, Turkish officials now suspect that a similar collaboration took place in the staging of the Istanbul synagogue massacre. Turkish and Western officials cite ample motive for Syrian and Iranian involvement in the Neve Shalom attack. Relations between Syria and Turkey have long been strained by Turkey's belief that Damascus has been training and arming Armenian terrorists, known by the acronym ASALA, and infiltrating them across the border and into Western Europe for attacks against Turkey and Turkish targets. Syria, moreover, is obsessed with stopping Turkey's construction of the Ataturk Dam, a 2,400-megawatt dam on the Euphrates River. When completed in the early 1990's, Ataturk, along with two other Turkish dams, would have the capability of cutting off most of Syria's source of fresh water and electricity, should Ankara choose to do so. Among the names and items Turkish police found in the apartment of Mr. Ameri, Syria's confessed agent, according to officials, were maps of the dams on the Euphrates, plus a notebook containing records of payments to three Turkish night guards at one of the dams. Police have arrested all three guards, Turkish officials say. Relations between Iran and Turkey are equally troubled, if not more so. Iran is a major supporter of the insurgent Kurdish Workers Party, known as P.K.K., which has been fighting to establish independence from Turkey and Iraq, Iran's bitter enemy in their protracted war. Teheran was enraged, diplomatic sources say, when Turkish planes bombed a P.K.K. camp in Iraq last summer, destroying huge caches of Iranian-supplied equipment. Finally, Turkey, a Western-oriented secular republic, is an alternative political and economic model of development for the Middle East, one that could prove more attractive to the world's Moslems than the Ayatollah Khomeini's authoritarian Islamic regime. Ankara bitterly resents Iran's infiltration into Turkey of fundamentalist proponents and literature. The Turkish Government feels that it must be cautious with both of its neighbors. Some 3,500 trucks travel between Iran and Turkey each day. Turkish officials admit to the presence of some 20,000 Iranians in Turkey. But Western authorities said that the total is actually between a million and 2 million. If Iran began a serious attempt to destabilize Turkey, (Continued on Page 47) preventive action would be extremely difficult. Thus Turkey has chosen to play down the strains with Damascus and Teheran. This means that rather than publicly expelling known terrorists operating under diplomatic cover, such agents are quietly pressed to leave. In some cases, nothing is done. But Syria and Iran must also be cautious in their dealings with Ankara, which has a large military establishment, a well-trained army, and a well-deserved reputation for toughness. So rather than stage terrorist activities openly, Western intelligence (Continued on Page 52) and Turkish officials say, Syria and Iran prefer to use surrogates for their more daring operations. Iran's is Islamic Jihad, among others. The most prominent among Syria's terrorist surrogates is Abu Nidal. I N AN INTERVIEW IN the Bekaa Valley, Atef Abu Bakr, Abu Nidal's spokesman, said that the group always claimed responsibility for its actions; it has not claimed the synagogue attack. And while Abu Nidal has sent many young terrorists on missions from which there was little likelihood of return, such as the December 1985 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports, he has not been known to stage overt suicide missions. It is this fact that has led some counterterrorism experts to doubt that Abu Nidal's group alone is responsible for the synagogue massacre. Just as individual members of Islamic Jihad and the Abu Nidal group appear to have cooperated in the murder of the Jordanian diplomat last year, individuals from these two groups, paid by the sponsors, Iran and Syria and Libya, may have joined forces, or shared tasks, in the Istanbul attack, some experts believe. Such cooperation would be unusual, experts note, but not unprecedented. Robert B. Oakley, recently appointed by Frank C. Carlucci to head the National Security Council's office of Middle East affairs, said there were reliable reports that Syria and Iran had both helped stage the attack in late 1983 against the American Marine barracks in Lebanon, in which more than 240 Marines died. This kind of fluid interchange of surrogates and host countries seems to be on the rise. In the twin attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports in late 1985, terrorist experts believe there is evidence of participation by Syria, Libya and Palestinians from the Bekaa Valley. The bombing attack in April of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, in which two American soldiers were killed, seems to have been supported not only by Libya, as the Reagan Administration charged, but by Syria as well. The murderous attack on the Pan Am jet in Karachi last September appears to be the work of groups in Lebanon, perhaps aided by Abu Nidal, with a Libyan connection. ''Terrorists seem to be learning that it is simply harder to fix responsibility if more than one group and country is involved,'' said Mr. Oakley, who was formerly head of the State Department's office of counterterrorism. The perfection of this new kind of untraceable terror was the Istanbul synagogue attack. ''We can go on forever searching for Abu Nidal,'' said one Israeli official, ''or we can start right now to assign blame where it belongs - on the states that sponsor such actions.'' THE EVIDENCE The massacre at the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul, some experts believe, is an example of a new kind of cooperative terrorism in which several groups, backed by more than one government, work together. Turkish investigators suspect the involvement of Libya, Syria and Iran. The weapons used in the synagogue were the same type as some of those supplied by Libya to terrorists for an attack on an American officers' club in Ankara in April. A terrorist arrested while attempting to hijack a plane in Karachi recognized one of the two synagogue attackers from a composite sketch as an Arab trained by Abu Nidal in Syrian-controlled Lebanon. And their investigation of the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat has led Turkish police to believe that the Iranian-dominated Islamic Jihad group was also involved in the synagogue killings. WHO IS ABUL NIDAL? There is disagreement over what he looks like, conjecture as to whether he is in charge of his own organization and even rumors that he is no longer alive. But most terrorism experts believe that Abu Nidal does indeed exist. Yet while his name has become synonymous with terror itself, little is known about this elusive man or the inner workings of his group, the Fatah Revolutuionary Council. It is known that his real name is Sabry al-Banna. There are few photos of him, and some may be fakes. Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in the Palestine Liberation Organization, says that Abu Nidal has undergone plastic surgery at least six times to disguise his appearance (photos below). His current whereabouts are in dispute. A British intelligence source says that Abu Nidall was seen last month in Damascus; others say Lybia, still others say he travels most of the time. ''Frankly, we don't know where the hell he is,' said one American diplomat. Abu Nidal has reportedly had persistent health problems, aggravated by chain-smoking -- he is said to have smoked as many as four packs of cigarettes a day. In a recently published biography of Abu Nidal, the Israeli journalist Yossi Melman claims that the world's chief terrorist has had at least three heart operations. Many in his 300 to 500-member group are Palestinian students. Abu Nidal is said to recruit from his own region those linked to him by family loyalty, a strong bond in Arab circles. Members are reputedly well-paid; should they die during a mission, their families are provided for. There is no leaving the organization -- the only escape is death. The Fatah Revolutionary Council reportedly took root in the mid-1970's in Baghdad, where Abu Nidal was head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office until he broke off from the P.L.O. over Yasir Arafat's moderate policies. His first base was in Baghdad, but Iraq, under pressure from France and the United States, forced him out in the early 1980's. He moved to Damascus, where the group maintains a ''cultural center.'' It has bases in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, in Lybia and moves freely in East Europe. Ariel Merari, chief terrorism analyst at Tel Aviv University, says that Abu Nidal's group has become increasingly mercenary, working more to compensate host states for their services than for ideological goals. The group has been impossible to infiltrate, the analyst says, because it operates through small cells isolated from one another. Some Western intelligence experts believe that Abu Nidal may not actually run the organization. One Israeli expert believes that the real chief is a Syrian intelligence officer. A French expert suspects that the secret chief is a senior P.L.O. official, who, unbeknownst to Yasir Arafat, has for years been attempting to undermine the P.L.O by secretly directing the most bloodthirsty of the operations attributed to Abu Nidal. Despite the group's denials of the synagogue massacre, it has consistently attacked Turkey as a ''fascist junta'' in its weekly magazine, Palestine al-Thawra, published in Arabic in Damascus. The magazine routinely publishes news and communiques of the Kurdish rebels and Armenian terrorists, Turkey's enemies. Abu Nidal's spokesman, Atel Abu Bakr, said in a recent interview in the Bekaa Valley that more operations were in store. He threatened Jewish cultural and religious institutions in Europe where Jews, he said, were using synagogues as covers for ''Zionist espionage activities.'' -- J.M.

525-> TOP CONSERVATIVES CELEBRATE DOCUMENTARY OF THEMSELVES
The occasion was the premiere of ''The Conservatives,'' a documentary to air Tuesday night on the Public Broadcasting System. And several luminaries of the conservative movement, including Patrick J. Buchanan, the White House communications director, gathered at the Kennedy Center tonight for the special showing. President Reagan phoned in his remarks. ''Pat, are you out campaigning again?'' Mr. Reagan asked, as he, like others at the black-tie gala, made note of the Presidential speculation now surrounding Mr. Buchanan. ''You know, it's the darndest thing, the first time I went off to the Navy medical for some repair work, I came back to find Don Regan with his feet on my desk,'' the President said. After his recent surgery, he added, he returned to the White House to find Mr. Buchanan ''on the red phone'' to New Hampshire, an early staging ground of Presidential campaigns. Mr. Reagan praised the film, which traces the rise of the modern conservative movement, and hailed the movement itself. ''I may be a late convert to the Republican church, but I'm proud to say I'm conservative by birth,'' he said. In his remarks, Mr. Buchanan acknowledged that he had, in 1980, described the Public Broadcasting System and the National Endowment for the Humanities as ''the upholstered playpens of the Washington establishment whose shutdown should be the first order of business of Mr. Reagan's revolutionaries as they cross the Potomac River.'' But he praised the documentary, adding, ''It is remarkable that the commercial networks, which have devoted countless hours to the feminist movement and the quote, peace movement, should have left us with virtually no sympathetic understanding of a movement that is shaping the politics of this decade.'' Richard Viguerie, the conservative organizer, said the affair was a measure of the distance traveled by his movement. ''It used to be you couldn't get a handful of conservatives together,'' he said. But Paul Weyrich, a leader of the New Right, surveyed the crowd and said, ''I think our kind of conservative, at least some of them, are more comfortable as outsiders than as insiders.'' Representative Jack Kemp, the upstate New York Republican, played down the effect a candidacy by Mr. Buchanan might have on his own efforts in the 1988 race. ''Ronald Reagan was not the only conservative candidate in the 1980 race,'' Mr. Kemp said. The 90-minute documentary is scheduled to air in the New York area on WNET, Channel 13, at 10 P.M. Tuesday.

526-> CONFUSION ON ISRAELI ROLE
Recent disclosures of policy memorandums by the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee seem to suggest that Israel somehow led the Reagan Administration into the Iran affair by repeatedly promising, on the basis of Iranian-Israeli contacts, that with one sale of arms to Teheran all the American hostages in Lebanon would be released. Rebutting these memos, Israeli officials in Jerusalem have insisted that they were only minding their own business when, one day in 1985, the Americans came to them and appealed for their help in making contact with the Iranians. Israel gave that help, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has said, to ''save the lives'' of Americans held hostage. From the evidence that has already come to light in Washington and Jerusalem, there is ample reason to believe that neither Israel nor the United States has been wholly candid in characterizing the other's actions. U.S. Said to Evade Responsibility Israeli officials assert that the notion that Israel led the United States unwittingly into dealing with Iran is an example of an effort to run away from responsibility in Washington. Israeli officials contend that the United States had many contacts directly with Iran, outside of channels arranged by Israel, even before Israel came on the scene. The United States also had its own interests in re-establishing ties with Iran, a powerful and strategically important country, not to mention a desire to get the hostages back. If anything, Israeli officials say, they were being used as ''validators'' or ''endorsers'' by some American officials who were trying to persuade a wavering President Reagan to go ahead with the Iran initiative for purely American strategic reasons. Israeli officials contend that there would have to be something very wrong with the operation of the Reagan Administration if two policy memos based on Israeli advice were enough to prompt the United States Government to reduce its longstanding opposition to Iran, its opposition to selling arms to countries that support terrorism and its opposition to negotiating for the release of hostages - even if the Israelis were asserting that arms sales to Iran would lead to the release of all the American hostages. Doubts on Israeli Explanation As for the Israelis, the notion they have tried to put forward - that they were acting only out of humanitarian concern for American citizens - does not fully explain their involvement, Israeli political analysts say. The analysts say there would have to be something very wrong with the Israeli administration if it were to engage, over 18 months, in a highly complicated arms sale to Iran - a country that has declared deep hostility to Israel - just because one day an important ally asked if Israel had any ideas on how to help that ally. Such actions would suggest a dangerous loss of Israel's independence vis-a-vis the United States. To be sure, Israel would like, when possible, to help the United States, on which it heavily depends for economic aid. In particular, Israeli officials say, they are eager to help the Reagan Administration, which has been exceedingly friendly and generous. Israel Had Its Own Interests But Israel had some important strategic interests of its own in opening ties with Iran, and these interests went well beyond saving American lives, according to Israeli experts. First, Iran, which is a Moslem country but not Arab, has traditionally been a critical counterweight for Israel to the Arab countries. Israeli officials believe that their long-term interests would not be served by having the Iranian Army destroyed by Iraq. Second, Israeli officials are convinced that in the long term the strategic realities that Iran needs the United States to counterbalance its Soviet neighbor and that it needs Israel to counterbalance its Arab neighbors will provide the basis for a renewed relationship. Anything Israel could do to help bring to power more pragmatic elements in Iran who would be ready to act on the basis of these historical strategic considerations was seen in Jerusalem as being advantageous. Third, Israel is trying to help Iranian Jews emigrate, and this requires a level of contact with Teheran. Finally, Iran's Shiite Moslems have influence over the Shiites in Lebanon, and Israel hoped that any standing it gained in the circles of power in Teheran might be useful in quieting Shiites in Lebanon. Since the Iranians wanted American arms in return for their cooperation in these areas, and Israel could not sell those arms without American approval, Israel had a strong incentive to encourage the United States to join the initiative. Policies Couched in Moral Terms So why then the apparent lack of straightforwardness in both Jerusalem and Washington? The probable reason, according to an Israeli political scientist, Daniel J. Elazar, is that both Governments, particularly the Reagan Administration, have traditionally tried to characterize their foreign policies by couching them in the language of morality; customarily, means and ends have been portrayed as related to each other and pure. But dealing with Iran, a course of action that was in the strategic interest of both countries, required a policy that was politically questionable and means that were considerably more questionable than the ends; there were also a large number of built-in uncertainties about whether the desired results would be achieved. The dealings meant selling arms to a Government that is suspected of having engaged in international terrorism, in hopes that the sale of those arms would build relationships that could result in the freeing of the hostages and, in the future, bring about a level of dialogue and a lessening of tensions. Using Half-Truths to Explain But once this complex ''Realpolitik'' initiative was exposed, the moral language with which both countries were accustomed to talk about foreign policy simply could not characterize the situaton they had become involved in, Mr. Elazar said. So they both ended up explaining themselves in half-truths and seeking to excuse their actions by implicitly or explicitly accusing the other country of seducing it into a supposedly misguided and immoral initiative. In the end, the Israelis, who were primarily seeking to effect a strategic relationship with Iran, explained their involvement as an effort to help save American lives. The Reagan Administration, which seemed to have been primarily out to save American lives, explained its involvement as an effort to build a strategic relationship, prompted to some extent by Israeli advice. ''What was missing in both countries,'' the Israeli philosopher David Hartman said, ''was a mature ability by leaders to talk straight and to educate their citizens about the complexities of politics and foreign policy in the real world.''

527-> THE REGION; A Yearlong Look at Government's Underside
ONE year ago this Friday, Donald R. Manes, a powerful, popular and ambitious politician, walked out of Queens Borough Hall and into that special rogues' gallery of men who have robbed New York. Mr. Manes, then the borough president, left his office early on the evening of Jan. 9, got into a city car and drove into the night. Nine hours later he was found in the car near Shea Stadium, dazed and bleeding from wounds on his wrist and leg. The initial mystery was soon solved. He had tried to kill himself, and later did kill himself, after learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had discovered his role in a bribery ring that included other political leaders and present and former city officials. That disclosure has confronted New Yorkers with even bigger and still far from fully answered questions. How wide and how deep was the corruption? And who else was involved? Graft, of course, is nothing new. In New York City government, it goes back even before the time in 1861 when P.T. Barnum bribed the aldermen to let him pump saltwater from the bay for his whales to swim in. Whether the current scandals are the worst since Boss Tweed's exposure in the 1870's, as some have said, is still a matter of debate: Mayor Koch has sought to soften the blow to his administration by rattling off lists of previous episodes, including the time when bodies were sold from the morgue under the administration of that icon of New York mayors, Fiorello H. La Guardia. But a great deal has been learned this past year about the underside of New York's government. Here is a review of some of it. THE 'MARKETPLACE' Since Jan. 9, 11 men have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal. A 12th, the former head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, was acquitted of governmental corruption charges but convicted of personal wrongdoing and of lying on city disclosure forms. At least nine other people have been granted immunity in exchange for their testimony. Fourteen others, including two judges and the former taxi and transportation commissioners, are under indictment and awaiting trial. The cases are not all directly related, but taken together they have provided an insider's view of what one defense attorney described as the ''municipal marketplace'' -an Oriental bazaar where politics, government and business intersect, where influence is bought and sold and where the line between a consulting fee and a bribe is not always easy to discern. EARLY WARNINGS In retrospect, there were clues long before the scandals broke. Alex Liberman, a loyal member of the Brooklyn Democratic organization who became the man in charge of negotiating city leases, pleaded guilty in 1984 to taking more than $1 million in bribes from landlords. Questions about his integrity had been raised twice before, but each time he had simply been moved to another job. In 1982 James Rose, comptroller of the Parking Violations Bureau, complained about corruption in the bureau. He went to his superiors, to the Inspector General of the Transportation Department and to the Department of Investigation. But his information, along with the later testimony of a police officer and another parking bureau official, was shunted from file to file and ultimately forgotten. In 1984 James Smith, a Brooklyn weekly newspaper editor, asked Mayor Koch during a City Club luncheon why the city was making Stanley M. Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader, ''a millionaire'' by awarding a contract to Citisource, a firm in which Mr. Friedman held stock. Mr. Koch brushed the question aside, challenging Mr. Smith to show evidence of a crime. In 1985 Justice William C. Brennan of Queens Supreme Court was convicted of taking bribes from organized crime figures to fix cases in Queens. Elected to the court in 1969, he had long been active in borough politics and was a close friend and frequent luncheon companion of Presiding Justice Francis X. Smith, who is now under indictment for perjury in a separate case. THE STING The scandals came at a time when many New Yorkers, buoyed by boom times, had come to believe that their city, for all its economic and social divisions, was at least a relatively honest place. Sure, a building inspector might take a bribe, they thought, but this was not Chicago. It is thus particularly ironic that the corruption in New York came to light because a corrupt New York businessman, Bernard Sandow, tried to expand to Chicago and got caught. The man who triggered the crisis is a burly bunco racketeer and professional informer. He was born in Brooklyn 57 years ago as Michael Raymond, but his alias for the last few years has been Michael Burnett. Paroled from prison at the end of 1983, he got a job as marketing director for a New York City collection agency, Systematic Recovery Services, whose president was Mr. Sandow. Mr. Sandow wanted to use in Chicago the technique that was working so well in New York: bribing public officials. Mr. Burnett took on the job, but unbeknownst to Mr. Sandow, Mr. Burnett by then had become an informant for the F.B.I. From an apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast, Mr. Burnett began gathering evidence against corrupt Chicago officials - and against Mr. Sandow. On Nov. 26, 1985, Mr. Burnett, wearing an electronic recording device, attended a luncheon at Hisae's Restaurant, near Cooper Union in the East Village. The other guests were Mr. Sandow and Geoffrey G. Lindenauer, the portly deputy director of New York City's Parking Violations Bureau. The men talked about politics. They talked about losing weight. Most of all they talked about bribing the director of the Parking Violations Bureau, Lester N. Shafran, with cash, goods and women. At one point Mr. Sandow accompanied Mr. Lindenauer to the men's room and gave him $5,000. Confronted a month later, Mr. Sandow agreed to become an informer, too. Between them, Mr. Sandow and Mr. Burnett supplied the information to the F.B.I. that persuaded Mr. Lindenauer to turn on the other members of the bribery ring and testify for the Government. THE RING At the heart of the scandals was the revelation that Parking Violations Bureau contracts had been bought and sold by a ring of corrupt officials. To improve the collection rate, the P.V.B. had started farming out overdue fines to private agencies - sometimes already established, sometimes created for the purpose -that were allowed to keep a cut, up to 40 percent of the millions of dollars they collected. They would also, it emerged, turn over a cut to ring members, who included: Mr. Manes, the Queens Democratic leader, who was sworn in for a fourth term as borough president two days before his first suicide attempt. The parking bureau had become known as ''a Queens operation,'' with appointees loyal not to Mayor Koch but to Mr. Manes, who had bragged about how much money he would make in bribes if he succeeded in becoming mayor himself. On March 13 Mr. Manes died after driving a knife into his heart. He was never charged with a crime, but was named a co-racketeer in indictments issued after his death. Mr. Friedman, who became the Bronx Democratic leader with Mayor Koch's help after serving as Deputy Mayor and patronage chief in the administration of Abraham D. Beame. A sign that hung in Mr. Friedman's City Hall office declared, ''Crime Doesn't Pay - as Well as Politics.'' His party post allowed him to continue practicing law, and his clients included collection agencies and a company named Citisource. Citisource paid Mr. Friedman in stock, making him its largest stockholder, and the value of his holdings soared when Mr. Friedman won the company a contract to make portable computers for the P.V.B. In November he was convicted of acting as a broker for bribes to Mr. Manes and other officials to win their help in obtaining contracts for Citisource and other firms including Datacom, a collection agency and computer service company. Michael J. Lazar, a former City Councilman, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission and Transportation Administrator, the man who initiated the use of private collection agencies at the parking bureau under Mr. Beame. After leaving city government he became a private real estate developer and also worked for Datacom. He was convicted of paying bribes on behalf of Datacom. Mr. Shafran, a protege of Mr. Lazar who became director of the P.V.B. soon after Mr. Koch became Mayor in 1978. Mr. Shafran was convicted of taking bribes from contractors. Marvin B. Kaplan, chairman of Citisource, who was convicted of arranging a bribe of Citisource stock that Mr. Friedman held on behalf of Mr. Manes and Mr. Lindenauer. Mr. Lindenauer, the deputy director of the P.V.B. and a longtime friend of Mr. Manes, who got him his job. Mr. Lindenauer pleaded guilty to collecting some $400,000 in bribes from contractors and splitting the money with Mr. Manes. He also said he lied to other city officials so that Citisource would be given the contract to produce portable computers. His testimony in Federal Court was crucial to the conviction in November of Messrs. Friedman, Lazar, Shafran and Kaplan. Mr. Lindenauer's sentencing has been postponed while he continues to cooperate with Government lawyers. CLOSE LINKS Not part of the ring, but tied either to Mr. Manes or to the parking bureau and currently under indictment: Richard L. Rubin, a longtime associate of Mr. Manes who was the secretary to the Queens Democratic organization. He was indicted for inducing two Queens Assemblymen to put secretaries working for his law firm on their payrolls. Anthony R. Ameruso, a Beame administration official, promoted to Transportation Commissioner by Mayor Koch in 1978 on the recommendation of Brooklyn political leaders but over the objections of the Mayor's own screening committee. Mr. Ameruso has not been charged in relation to the bribery ring, although the parking bureau was under his supervision. But he resigned as commissioner and has been charged with perjury for concealing an investment related to a firm to which he awarded a ferry permit. John A. Zaccaro, a real estate and insurance broker and the husband of former Representative Geraldine Ferraro. He was indicted for acting ''in concert'' with Mr. Manes in attempting to extort money from a company seeking a franchise to install cable television. Also indicted were Justice Smith, who is accused of lying about meetings he attended with Mr. Zaccaro, and Michael Nussbaum, a political aide to Mr. Manes, indicted for soliciting a bribe from a cable company on Mr. Manes's behalf. OTHER CASES Indicted as a result of separate investigations: Jay L. Turoff, who was named chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission on the next to last day of the Beame administration on the recommendation of the Brooklyn Democratic organization and was later reappointed by Mayor Koch. He resigned abruptly in March, in the midst of investigations that are still continuing, and was indicted in June for accepting a $30,000 bribe from the manufacturer of a taxi meter that the commission ordered drivers to buy. Mr. Turoff arranged unsecured financing for the meter company, Electronic Compumeter, through a politically connected Brooklyn credit union, Hyfin (an acronym for Help Your Friend in Need). Three friends of Mr. Turoff who helped organize Compumeter have been indicted with him and will go on trial next month. A Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice, Jerome Cohen, has been charged with accepting interest-free loans from Hyfin in exchange for children's trust fund accounts. Hyfin's secretary-treasurer, Edmund Lee, and two other executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and the credit union has been dissolved. John J. McLaughlin, who resigned as president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation while under investigation in August 1985. He was indicted later that year for stealing from an elderly heiress whose funds had been placed in his trust. Last April, after the start of the city scandals but before his trial, he was charged with using the trust fund to launder a bribe from a company doing business with the hospitals corporation. He was acquitted on that charge but convicted of falsely billing travel expenses to the trust fund and lying on city disclosure forms. He was sentenced to six months in prison. YET TO COME Federal and local prosecutors say their work is far from over. In the Bronx: The United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is cooperating with the Bronx District Attorney, Mario Merola, in an inquiry into allegations of political abuse. Included are reports that Bronx businessmen were pressured for contributions to the campaign fund of Stanley Simon, the Bronx borough president, in exchange for economic development aid. Also under investigation are consulting fees paid to Mr. Friedman and some of his political associates by Cablevision, the firm that holds the cable television franchise in the Bronx. And the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has joined Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Merola in an investigation of Wedtech, a Bronx defense contractor that may have defrauded the Government. In Brooklyn: The Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, is investigating the award of cable television franchises and allegations that millions of dollars in bribes have been paid to Board of Education building inspectors to approve shoddy work. Federal Government officials are looking at the activities of the retired leader of the Brooklyn political organization, Meade H. Esposito, and are investigating a charge that Carl A. Capasso, a construction contractor who is close to several ranking members of the Koch administration, paid kickbacks to obtain a contract to build a sewage treatment plant.

528-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Strategist's Top Deal Is Rexnord Acquisition
Jeffrey Steiner, chairman and chief executive of Banner Industries, a diversified manufacturer in Cleveland, has taken the final steps to acquire Rexnord Inc. for about $525 million. The move is the biggest financial maneuver taken by Mr. Steiner, who is 50, since he came to Banner in 1984. An analyst for McDonald & Company in Cleveland, Harry W. Millis, said he thought that Mr. Steiner's intent had always been to create a much larger operation through acquisition, putting Banner in a much stronger position. ''As long as the operating management stays in place at Rexnord, there should be no major difference in the operating style of the whole business,'' Mr. Millis said. ''It should continue to be very successful.'' Rexnord, a much bigger company, with sales in 1986 of about $1 billion, serves a variety of worldwide industrial markets with mechanical and electronic components and systems, including power transmission, molded plastic components and specialty chemicals. It is based in Brookfield, Wis. Analysts say it is unlikely that Mr. Steiner will interfere in the day-to-day operations at Rexnord. They see Mr. Steiner as a financial strategist rather than an executive interested in operations. A prime example of Mr. Steiner's preference for strategy over operations was his decision to move Banner's executive offices to New York. This move has left the company, whose headquarters remains in Cleveland, in the operational control of Samuel J. Krasney, Banner's founder, previous chief executive and current chief operating officer. Mr. Steiner became Banner's chairman and largest stockholder in October 1985 after he bought a 25 percent share of the company from Mr. Krasney. Mr. Krasney said that with options, Mr. Steiner's position in Banner could reach 30 percent. Mr. Krasney said Banner, with annual sales of about $150 million, would probably keep looking at other companies with growth opportunities. Banner said its definitive agreement to acquire Rexnord would put Rexnord's chairman and chief executive officer, Donald Taylor, on the Banner board. Mr. Krasney said there was a possibility that a second seat on the board would go to another Rexnord executive. Before joining Banner, Mr. Steiner was president and managing director of Cedec S.A., a Paris-based engineering concern that he founded in 1975. Mr. Steiner, who was born in Australia, has been married twice and has four children.

530-> ADVERTISING; Public Service Spot To Raise AIDS Funds
A new public service spot to raise funds for the fight on AIDS, created by a team at Cunningham & Walsh, is scheduled for tonight during an NBC-TV special entitled ''Men, Women, Sex and AIDS.'' The spot, in 20- and 30-second lengths, shows a variety of people, with revolvers aimed at their heads, playing Russian roulette to indicate that AIDS has been hitting all segments of the community. Making up the team that created the spot were Paris Barclay, copywriter; Chip Lopez, art director, and Jocelyn Orner, producer. The spot was made in behalf of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, of which Elizabeth Taylor is chairman.

531-> CONNECTICUT GUIDE
WINTER-SURVIVAL TACTICS An ice-fishing and winter-survival clinic that is, from 1 to 5 P.M. today at the Bolton Lake Boat Launch, deals with such topics as down clothing not offering as much protection from Connecticut winters as many people might think. ''The winters here are very wet, and down takes a long time to dry,'' said Alberto Mimo of the State Department of Environmental Protection. ''Certain synthetic fabrics are better.'' A package of waterproof matches is indispensible. ''You can light a fire to keep warm or to attract attention if you are lost,'' Mr. Mimo said. ''However, Connecticut is so small that you can usually count on being found within a day. In northern Canada, by way of comparison, you could be lost for a month.'' He added that matches were also useful for warming snow to drink. Eating or drinking ice-cold snow could bring on hypothermia, he cautioned. Those who wish to bring their own fishing equipment may do so, and others may watch demonstrations by experts. Steve Fish of the education division of the Department of Environmental Protection; Fred Nassif, proprietor of Nassif's Sporting Goods Store in Manchester, and Mr. Mimo are to conduct the program. They will cover ice-fishing techniques, equipment, clothing, weather lore, survival skills, the ecological balance of fish and other lake creatures, and fishing-license regulations. The program is to be held whether the lake is frozen or not. To reach the site, take Interstate 84 east to the new Route 384, to Route 44. There is no charge nor any need to make reservations. GIANT WORMS OF THE SEA Dr. Meredith Jones, an inverte brate zoologist and curator of worms at the National Museum of History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., is to discuss ''The Vestimentifera: Giant Tube Worms of the Hydrothermal Vents and Elsewhere.'' at Trinity College in Hartford. Since 1977, when a National Geographic expedition brought back a five-foot long, mouthless, gutless worm from the sea floor near the Galapagos Islands and asked Dr. Jones to take it off their hands, he has concentrated on studying the creatures. ''The expedition was formed by a group of geologists,'' Dr. Jones said, ''who went down in a submersible craft to look at an area where the sea floor - about a mile and half down -was spreading at the rate of about seven centimeters a year. They found warm-water springs supporting a community of animals, most of which turned out to be new to science. ''There were clams about 14 inches across, similarly oversize mussels and the worms, which they referred to as giant tube worms. The name stuck.'' The large size, according to Dr. Jones, may stem, in part, from the warm environment. But in the case of the worms. the is more probably because of the efficiency of the creatures' feeding system, which operates with internal bacteria. The bacteria are able to convert large quantities of hydrogen sulfide into sulfur and then into organic carbon, which provides nourishment for the bacteria and is used by the worm in building its own body. ''Since hydrogen sulfide is a poison, we are curious about anything that can live in such an environment, where, incidentally, there is no oxygen except that which swirls in from surrounding cool waters,'' said Dr. Jones. The vents exist from Greenland to to the Cape of Good Hope, toward Easter Island and into the Gulf of California. They may shut off after 20 or 30 years, leaving the worms and shellfish to be eaten by other creatures. The temperatures produced by the vents vary from 72 to 600 degrees. The lecture is to begin at 4 P.M. Thursday in Room 134 of the Life Sciences Center. Admission is free. SLEIGH AND HAYRIDES Hayrides, sleigh rides, horse-drawn trolley rides and bobsled rides through the snow are the speciality of Wood Acres on Griffen Road in Terryville. The town is east of Thomaston and west of Bristol on Route 6. For 14 years, Ken Wood has hitched up two 1,800-pound Percherons to any of the above vehicles for an hour's ride through the woods, pastures and back roads. ''We do horse-drawn weddings and parades, too,'' he said. Chilled passengers returning from the rides may use the barn and woodstove to thaw out and picnic. The hay wagon, which stays on the back roads, holds 20 people. The bobsled is elevated two feet off the ground on runners and takes 15 passengers. The charge is $5 a person, but bookings are usually by groups, with a minimum of $75. On weekends, when business is brisker, couples or individuals may be accommodated. Call 583-8670. HISTORY OF THE GREEN The Green Show at the New Haven Colony Historical Society, on view through next August, is an exhibition of prints, photographs, drawings, maps, paintings and extensive interpretive text tracing the history of the first nine squares, or 16 acres, that made up the New Haven Green from 1638 to the present. ''The central square is still intact and green,'' the curator, Roger Egleston, said, ''but, of course, the uses have changed.'' Now surrounded by churches, the green - as shown in early drawings, maps and photographs - was a marketplace, burial ground, militia muster grounds and the site of several long-lost buildings. They included a schoolhouse, a jail, a courthouse and a state capitol designed by Ithiel Town in 1828, when New Haven and Hartford were co-capitols. One of the earliest maps was drawn by a Yale student, James Wadsworth, in 1748, ''probably as an exercise for a college course,'' according to Mr. Egleston. It is the earliest view of New Haven with elevations and color labels for each house and building by the owners. Wadsworth later became a general in the Revolutionary War. The hours are from 10 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays and from 2 to 4:45 P.M. weekends. There is no admission charge. Call 562-4183. 'ONION MAIDENS' RECALLED For almost a century, a group of mostly single Anglo-Saxon women dominated the red onion industry of Wethersfield, where the soil was particularly suitable. A Hartford teacher, Gladys McDonough, is to give a talk about ''The Onion Maidens of Wethersfield,'' as they were called, at noon tomorrow in the Connecticut Historical Society headquarters at 1 Elizabeth Street in Hartford. Ostracized from the Congregational Church for their unladylike occupation, they persisted from the mid-1700's until about 1840, working in the fields and as managers, producing onions for New York and European markets. The work was seasonal, and the pay was less than that of men in similar jobs, but it was the only way that women in their circumstances could earn a living besides weaving. Unfortunately, locally woven cloth had fallen out of favor as elegant textiles from Europe began to pour into Wethersfield's bustling river port. There is no charge for admission to the talk. The telephone number for information is 236-5621.

532-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Gap on Organ Donations
Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, has found an omission of just $7.4 million from President Reagan's trillion-dollar budget but one that the Senator says could end the hope of many people whose lives are endangered from the lack of quickly available body organs for transplants. The money is supposed to be available under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 and finances a nationwide data-gathering system. Through it, hospitals with potential donors can learn where the organs are most urgently needed, while hospitals with critically ill patients can learn where suitable organs are available. In a letter to the President, Mr. Gore wrote, ''Organ transplants are one of the great modern success stories of America's health care system. But we stand to lose all we have worked for if we remove the tools needed by the medical community to carry out our transplant policy.'' A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has jurisdiction over the program, did not have an immediate response to Senator Gore's complaints.

533-> STRIKE ON L.I.R.R. STOPS ALL SERVICE; NEW TALKS TODAY; BUS RUNS PLANNED
Workers walked off their jobs early yesterday at the Long Island Rail Road, shutting down the nation's busiest commuter line. After several days of around-the-clock negotiations, Joseph A. Cassidy Jr., general chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, one of 11 unions attempting to negotiate a new contract, said he had reached an ''irreconcilable impasse'' with the line. Officials of the railroad's police union announced moments later that their members would also strike, and the railroad halted operations. #5th Strike in 15 Years It was the 5th strike in 15 years for the Long Island, which serves 110,000 commuters on a typical weekday. The walkout had a minimal effect yesterday. It will have more impact today -a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., when Federal offices and some private businesses are closed - and an even greater impact tomorrow, a normal workday. Riders were making car-pool plans, and Nassau and Suffolk Counties were set to provide special bus service beginning tomorrow. The main issues in the dispute included wages, health-care coverage, pensions and work rules. Labor leaders accused Bruce C. McIver, the railroad's president, of intransigence, contending that he had forced them to strike. Mr. McIver said that a walkout was ''the last thing in the world'' he had wanted and that he was ''deeply troubled about what went on'' during the negotiations. New Negotiations Today The parties did not talk yesterday afternoon. New talks are to start today at 11 A.M. at the J.F.K. Airport Hilton. Meanwhile officials said local police departments would guard trains stored in the line's yards. The third rail will remain electrified, however, and patrol trains will run periodically to maintain the track and signals. Governor Cuomo, who has been monitoring the talks, said he hoped the strike would end before Tuesday. ''I hope that they settle it without binding arbitration,'' he said, adding: ''I hope that if they don't, they'll agree to binding arbitration.'' The unions rejected an offer of binding arbitration in the fall. $31,190 a Year The workers' previous contract expired in December 1984. They earned an average of $31,190 a year, the railroad said. Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, two Presidential panels had attempted to resolve the dispute and two 120-day cooling-off periods had elapsed. In the last few months, five of the line's unions - representing conductors, clerks, ticket sellers, yard masters and supervisors - had accepted a new contract that provides for a wage increase of about 20 percent over 4 1/2 years, retroactive to 1985. But unions representing 60 percent of the line's 6,600 organized workers - including engineers, machinists, carmen, boilermakers, laborers, electricians, sheet-metal workers, track workers, signalmen, police officers and supervisors - rejected that offer. Although leaders of those unions said money was a key issue, most said they were also seeking better health-care coverage - the railroad proposed keeping costs down - and a variety of work rule and jurisdictional changes. Railroad Stands Pat Intensive bargaining began at the Doral Inn in Manhattan a week ago, but the talks seemed difficult from the start. Railroad officials stuck by their wage offer, noting that the line's two biggest unions, the conductors and the clerks, had ratified it by overwhelming margins. Mr. McIver contended that the offer was higher than that in ''agreements reached by any other railroad in the country.'' ''Everybody knew the area of settlement,'' he said. ''I feel a responsibility not to make a fiscally irresponsible decision in the face of intimidation.'' However, Mr. Cassidy and other union leaders complained that management had refused to consider their offer to trade savings generated by productivity increases for economic concessions. They also said the railroad was insisting that all the unions accept essentially the same contract, regardless of differences in their jobs or provisions in past pacts. Stuart Sanseviro, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said the railroad had demanded that his union agree to work during a strike. ''My self-respect was at stake,'' he said. Complicated Issues Cited According to Walter C. Wallace of the National Mediation Board, who had been overseeing the negotiations, the talks were greatly complicated by the number of unions bargaining at once. Perhaps an even greater difficulty was apparent rivalry among some unions. For example, the engineers wanted to restore their wage superiority, eliminated after the United Transportation Union achieved parity. Although the transportation union's conductors had already accepted a contract, they had a letter obligating the railroad to match a better deal if one were negotiated by another union. The railroad and the engineers were apparently unable to find a way around this letter. For a time during the weekend, it appeared that the railroad was close to a deal with at least one union - believed to be the carmen. Meanwhile the strike deadline was extended twice, first from midnight Friday to 6 A.M. Saturday, then to 6 A.M. Sunday. The second postponement, proposed by the mediator and accepted by union leaders, surprised railroad officials, who had been braced for a walkout. Jockeying for Advantage Some labor leaders contended that the line would have preferred a strike to start on Saturday, in the hope that it would be over before the Tuesday morning rush. However, there was also speculation that the unions wanted to push back the strike deadline until Monday night, when a strike would have more impact. In any event, when talks reconvened Saturday afternoon, leaders of a coalition of five shop craft unions were nowhere to be found. John A. Caggiano, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and chief bargainer for the coalition, said the group wanted to rest from the marathon bargaining sessions and allow the railroad to make progress with other unions. The absence distressed Mr. Wallace, the mediator, who grew more and more pessimistic as the evening progressed. ''I regret that we have come to this point,'' he said as the 6 A.M. deadline neared. ''At the very least, there's a need for sleep here. I'm not going to set a date for more talks at this time.'' Mr. Wallace said the mediation board would be available ''to provide any assistance it can.'' Last-Minute Travel Plans As the strike took effect, a few riders made their way through Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, past the dozens of homeless people who have taken up residence in its precincts. Police officers from the Midtown South Precinct assumed positions along barricades. A lone ticket clerk was still behind the counter, but the automatic ticket machines had already been covered with boards. Inside the stationmaster's office, Gene Zeiner, the transportation manager, was rounding up a crew for the last train out - the 6:21 P.M. to Port Washington. ''I got a feeling it's going to run a little bit late, which is nothing new,'' he said. The train pulled out on Track 17 at 6:38 with five passengers. No fares were charged. As the train left the station, a public-address announcement advised would-be passengers that ''the Long Island Rail Road is officially on strike.'' STRIKE ISSUES: WHAT EACH SIDE WANTS

535-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
THE SPELL. By Hermann Broch. Translated by H. F. Broch de Rothermann. 391 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.50. THE Austrian writer Hermann Broch is one of the great names of 20th-century German literature. He was born in Vienna in 1886, went into the family textile business and did not become a full-time writer until he was over 40; his best known novels, ''The Sleepwalkers'' and ''The Death of Virgil,'' were published in 1931 and 1945 respectively. When the Nazis took over in Austria in 1938 he was briefly imprisoned, and later that year he came to the United States. He died here in 1951. In 1935 Broch wrote a novel that he referred to simply as ''the mountain novel.'' The following year he began to revise and expand it, but broke off half way through; he started work on a further, more drastic revision in 1950, but had completed only about a third of it at the time of his death. The translation that has now appeared, ''The Spell,'' is based on the earliest version, the only complete one, but also incorporates a substantial episode from the second, 1936 version. ''The Spell'' was written in response to the coming to power of Hitler. Set in a secluded Alpine village, it centers on the baleful activities of a stranger called Marius Ratti who shows up one day and starts preaching his own homemade gospel. He advocates a new communion with the earth, the rejection of ''unnatural'' modern inventions, the reassertion of male supremacy and a bundle of crackpot doctrines that include the belief that ''all diseases are the result of wantonness.'' At first the villagers mistrust him, but gradually they succumb to his influence. His more militant followers abandon their threshing machines and throw away their radios; when a dwarfish Ratti disciple called Wenzel appears on the scene, he teaches the local boys military drill and a folkish marching song; a tradesman and his family, outsiders who have settled in the region, are persecuted and forced to leave. Finally the whole village is caught up in a frenzied reversion to paganism in a ceremony on a nearby mountain that culminates in human sacrifice. Summed up as simply as that, ''The Spell'' may sound like a fairly straightforward fable about the spread of the Nazi infection. But the novel itself is anything but simple. For a start, there is a narrator, a middle-aged doctor who disapproves of Ratti but whose own position has its ironies: he originally settled in the village because life there was bound to be more harmonious, more deeply rooted, than it had been in the city. Again, the political parallels in the story are not only imperfect but overshadowed by Broch's mythic and philosophic concerns. The most important figure apart from Ratti is Mother Gisson, a peasant matriarch who is still in tune with ancient ways. She opposes Ratti in vain, and the sacrificial victim - who embraces her fate rapturously - is in fact her granddaughter. Mother Gisson's own death, a peaceful fading back into nature, comes at the very end of the book. In the meantime the village, with the sacrifice behind it, has resumed its daily round, though without ridding itself of Ratti's spell; he is now a member of the municipal council. ''The Spell'' is a more approachable book than ''The Sleepwalkers'' or ''The Death of Virgil,'' but it still bristles with difficulties. Fortunately help is at hand. A short explanatory commentary by Broch himself appears as an appendix to the novel, and ''Hermann Broch,'' an illuminating study by Ernestine Schlant, has recently been reissued as a paperback by Chicago University Press. Broch's commentary makes it clear that he saw the novel primarily as a study of mass-psychological forces surfacing from the archaic depths. Miss Schlant takes us a good deal further. She analyzes the values that the main characters embody, from the authentic wisdom of Mother Gisson to the spurious substitute peddled by Ratti; she explains Mother Gisson's failure to save her granddaughter as a sign that her day - and that of immemorial folk tradition -is over, while arguing that other characters, notably the doctor and the woman he once loved, Barbara, are meant to illustrate no less plainly the limitations of humanism and progressive politics in the face of fierce instinctual urges. (Barbara's story is told in the episode salvaged from the second version of the novel.) But an author's intentions are no guarantee of his artistic success, and I suspect that many English-speaking readers are going to take one look at ''The Spell'' and back away nervously. It seems at first sight like a compendium of everything least alluring about the loftier kind of German novel - murky philosophizing, cumbrous symbolism (the sacred mountain has a strange rock formation running round it in the shape of a snake), a general suggestion of what the English writer D. J. Enright once called ''metaphysical lederhosen.'' There can be no denying, however, that the book is the work of a powerful imagination, and if you persist, it offers some striking rewards. Ratti in particular earns his role in the story. He is at once terrifying and 10th-rate; even before he has shown his true colors, for instance, his combination of ''petty disputatiousness'' and an apparently cordial manner is ''a challenge to be hated, for in the sham-chummy tone and gesture there was something that seemed to say, Hate me, hate me, so that you may love me!'' The presence of the doctor in the book, with his milder version of unity with nature (today he would probably be a Green), is enough to show that Ratti also plays on more positive longings. And yet the doctor too, for a brief mad moment, is swept up in the excitement of the sacrifice. ''The Spell'' can no doubt be interpreted in a dozen different ways, but perhaps it is best read as the work of a romantic wrestling with the dark side of his own romanticism.

536-> Taiwan Gang Head Sentenced
A Federal judge imposed a 20-year prison sentence Saturday on a man convicted of playing a leading role in the racketeering activities of an international Taiwanese gang, the United Bamboo. The gang leader, Chen Chih-yi, 35 years old, of Houston, was convicted, along with 10 other men, in a trial last year in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Defense lawyers are expected to appeal the convictions.

537-> THEATER; SIZZLING 'EUBIE!' AT THE CROSSROADS
''EUBIE!'' is just the sort of high-voltage musical jamboree that one can count on the Crossroads Theatre Company to do sizzlingly. And how the company delivers! For sheer jubilation, the 1978 musical revue, a collection of songs by the composer-musician-performer Eubie Blake, who died in 1983 at the age of 100, ranks with the memorable Crossroads productions of ''One Mo' Time'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.'' All, not so incidentally, were directed by Rick Khan, the theater's co-founder and producer, and choreographed by Bernard J. Marsh, who has performed in many musicals, this one among them. ''Eubie'' overflows with floor-shaking numbers. Witness ''I'm Simply Full of Jazz,'' which ends the first act, and ''High Steppin' Days,'' which starts the second. But the show begins - and ends -elegantly, softly. A pianist wanders into an empty theater. Eubie Blake's voice is heard on tape and memories of musicals past materialize. The concept of a romantic waltz, danced to the melody of ''Good Night, Angeline,'' frames the show. At Crossroads, the silver-haired, radiant pianist is Lillette E. Jenkins, a show unto herself not only as the conductor of an unusually precise and engaging group of musicians but also in solo performances. Just listen to Ms. Jenkins' dazzling display of keyboard pyrotechnics in ''Rhapsody in Ragtime'' and try to remain self-contained. The sampling of Eubie Blake's music heard herein - it is to assorted lyricists, mostly Noble Sissle and Andy Razaf - covers the spectrum of blues, jazz and razzmatazz show music. In ''Roll Jordan,'' one can perceive the beginnings of what came to be known, some 20 years later, as the Motown sound. ''I'm Just Wild About Harry,'' from the musical ''Shuffle Along,'' circa 1921, is, of course, the most familiar song of the lot. Among moments to savor in the Crossroads production, count ''Weary'' and ''Memories of You,'' interpreted in rending blues and spiritual styles by the high-flying soprano of Darlene Bel Grayson. Praise, too, the torrid dancing of Steven Cates in ''You Got to Git the Gittin' While the Gittin's Good,'' Roumel Reaux's witty softshoe routine in ''Dixie Moon'' and Renee Warren's delightfully insinuating vocal manner in such numbers as ''If You've Never Been Vamped by a Brownskin, You've Never Been Vamped at All.'' Which is not intended to slight Luther Fontaine (watch his cartwheels), Lawrence Hamilton, Traci Robinson or Gayle Samuels. Indeed, this entire cast of eight dancing singers - or singing dancers - are, individually and in harmony, splendid. The show runs through Jan. 18, but New Jersey will not be without the songs of Eubie Blake for long. At the beginning of April, another production of the musical will be presented by Newark's Theater of Universal Images, where it will be directed by Lynnie Godfrey, a member of the original cast.

538-> IN WESTCHESTER AND CONNECTICUT; Office-Space Demand Strong in Hartford
NICHOLAS KAZONIS, senior project manager for corporate real-estate needs with the Amdahl Corporation of California, could not believe what was happening when he started negotiating a few months ago for a lease for 4,000 square feet of office space in downtown Hartford. Instead of the long list of concessions offered his company almost everywhere else to reduce excessive inventory, the Hartford landlords were not in a giving mood. ''There were none of those offers of free parking for employees, moving costs or rent abatements I was seeing elswhere,'' Mr. Kazonis said. ''It was quite a shock.'' The reason was strong demand. For in contrast to other parts of the country, and even other parts of Connecticut, the Greater Hartford office market is booming. Available space is tight. This is so despite an increase over the last three years of abaut 50 percent, from 10.8 million to 15.9 million square feet, according to figures compiled by the Farley Company, a major Hartford commercial leasing agency. In the same period, rents have risen from $12 to $22 a square foot to $14 to $28, about a 20 percent increase, and close to the rents obtainable in the more prestigious markets of Fairfield County. In contrast to the construction lull elsewhere, developers are still acquiring land as fast as they can - even assembling large parcels to fill the demand for space in ever-fancier, ever-taller buildings. The opportunity to create these larger lots is most apparent when a visitor looks down at Hartford from one of its taller new towers, such as One Corporate Center. Only yards from the heart of the central city there is still a patchwork of streets lined with a seemingly endless stretch of parking lots (the legacy of urban renewal) occasionally interspersed with old-fashioned red-brick commercial buildings of less than five stories. Word of the boom has started to attract developers from other states and lately, even from abroad, a new twist for this relatively small city 18.4 square miles and a population of some 135,000 people. At the end of last year, the vacancy rate for top-grade downtown Hartford space stood at only 6.6 percent, according to the Farley report, far below the 20 percent of much of the rest of the nation and considerably less than the 9.3 rate of a year earlier. The New York Times/Steve Miller Parking lot, one of many resulting from urban-renewal clearance in downtown Hartford, where the office market is growing, but available space remains tight. The suburbs south and east of Hartford were only slightly weaker with a vacancy rate of 11.8 percent, sharply down from the 20.9 percent of a year ago. The exception was the northern suburbs with a rate of 19.3 percent, about the same as the year before. John B. Cavanagh, a partner with Cavanagh Fritz & Company, another Hartford commercial broker who had noted simliar overall strength, attributed that slight weakness to the start of 10 years of highway improvements that are expected to produce short-term commuter chaos. UNLIKE the success of Fairfield County and Westchester County in New York to the southeast, the cause of the Hartford area boom is not the influx of corporate headquarters or migrations from elsewhere. Rather, it has been based upon the prosperity and resultant expansion of the country's major insurance companies, many of which are based in Hartford, and upon the city's growth as a regional banking center. Instead of being consumed by takeover battles, the insurance companies have been busy diversifying, becoming financial services and investment companies in addition to their traditional roles. The Travelers even dropped the word ''insurance'' from its logo 18 months ago to further emphasize its wider corporate scope. Typical of the impact of these companies are the experiences of Wayne Mills, vice president for office facilities at the Travelers. Over the past year, Mr. Mills needed to find 200,000 square feet of additional office space - 160,000 to accommodate new employees and 40,000 square feet to use as ''turnaround'' space while offices are being renovated. The company had been taking on almost 1,000 new employees over that time, many of them needed to handle new operations such as a credit-card division, money-market accounts and mutual funds. Though there was a substantial selection of small quantities of space - less than 20,000 square feet - he found a limited choice since he wanted to keep operations clustered in no more than four separate locations. This required large amounts of space in any chosen building. That pattern is typical of the attitude of the insurance companies. Not surprisingly, therefore, the developers have been active in Hartford despite the adverse effects of the new tax laws, which are expected to curtail construction in weaker markets where an adequate financial return is not so assured. ONE of the most talked-about recent land purchases was the 2.1-acre parcel bought in July by Daniel and Joseph Friedman. The downtown parcel was an amalgam of three lots that had been the sites of an auto dealership, a parking lot and two stores. Acquisition cost was $9.4 million, high by Hartford standards but a sum that has since been exceeded. ''We saw a market with a low vacancy rate and a limited number of other projects planned for the next few years,'' said Daniel Friedman. Plans have already been drawn up for a tower that will rise more than 40 stories - taller than any built so far. ''That's what the tenants want,'' he added. Construction is scheduled to start this summer and the building should be completed within three years. Robert von Dohlen, chairman of Russell, Gibson, von Dohlen, the architectural firm designing many of Hartford's new office buildings, said that to obtain city zoning incentives that allow extra square footage, developers will be providing more retail space on the ground floors than had been the custom in Hartford in recent years. Shops had been shunned because they took too long to rent, downtown having long since lost its retail appeal. Other new towers, Mr. von Dohlen added, will provide apartments above the office floors, another form of mixed use popular in other cities but which had not caught on in Hartford.

539-> GOING OUT GUIDE
SOUTHERN EXPOSURE Glover is a town in the northeast corner of Vermont along Route 91, some 20 miles south of the Canadian border. Glover boasts a population of 846 and a Bread and Puppet Theater. In the late 1970's some students who took part in Bread and Puppet activities formed the only dance-theater company in the area, the Expanding Secret Company. Now the company, which has been performing in Vermont for six years, has brought 16 members to New York. For its New York premiere the company, starting today, will present ''Girl in First Position,'' an experimental work directed by Tamar Thorne. The company says this production ''attempts to deconstruct some visual definitions of gender, especially in the imagery of the sexes as served by the media and Western art.'' The engagement will run from tonight through Sunday at La Mama La Galleria Second Classe, at 6 East First Street. Today's performance will begin at 8:30 P.M. Admission is $5. Information: 505-2476. MUSICAL BEE Oliver Lake is the flutist and alto and soprano saxophonist with the World Saxophone Quartet, of which he was a founder, and he is the leader of both Jump Up, a funk and reggae ensemble, and his own quartet, the Oliver Lake Quartet. Mr. Lake performs with his various groups and writes for soloists, small groups, big bands and even for the Brooklyn Philharmonic. This week through Sunday, one of his activities will be an engagement at Carlos 1 (982-3260), a restaurant at 432 Avenue of the Americas, at Ninth Street. Mr. Lake will perform with Geri Allen, pianist; Pheroan Aklaff, drummer, and Santi Debriano, bassist. Admission is $10, and there is a $7.50 minimum at tables and a one-drink minimum at the bar. Performances are at 9 and 11 P.M. during the week, with a 12:30 A.M. show on Friday and Saturday. GRAPHIC DISPLAY The German Expressionist artist Jakob Steinhardt was born in 1887, and 20 years later was studying etching under Hermann Struck. He was in the camp of the avant-garde Expressionists by 1912, and after World War I he showed a revived interest in the depiction of nature as demonstrated by the artists of the New Objectivity. In 1933 he moved to Israel and founded an art school. He died in 1968. Although his woodcuts constitute a small portion of his artistic production, he is best known for them. His body of work also includes major paintings, hundreds of drawings, etchings and lithographs. Seventy-two of his etchings and lithographs make up an exhibition opening today at the Jewish Museum (860-1888), ''The Unknown Steinhardt.'' Most of the work on display was produced between 1907 and 1934 and has never been exhibited in this country. The museum is at 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street. Today's hours are noon to 8 P.M. Admission is $4; $2 for children under 17, students with identification and people over 65.

540-> STREET FASHIONS; Reliable and Warm
THIS winter's fresh take on the classic camel's hair or camel-colored cashmere coat carries new proportions. Whether double-breasted, wrapped or sashed, it has large lapels, wide shoulders and a well-fed fullness. Worn over trousers by day and formal dresses by night, these coats end just above the ankles - and feet clad in velvet slippers, high heels or even the jogging shoes favored by Betty Furness, top right. Much like camels, these fashionable wrappers are functional and built for the long haul.

541-> Toxic Tide Reappears Along Coast of Texas
Red tide has reappeared in the Gulf of Mexico, forcing an indefinite halt to shellfish harvesting along a part of the coast ravaged by an outbreak of the toxic bloom last year. The harvesting ban went into effect after the fish-killing microscopic organism was found Thursday in Corpus Christi Bay, a Texas Health Department official said Friday. ''It was a complete surprise to us,'' said the official, Richard Thompson, director of the department's division of shellfish sanitation control. ''We certainly didn't expect it to bloom again this winter.'' Red tide was first detected in the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston last August, and subsequently killed more than 22 million fish. The toxin given off by red-tide concentrations is not fatal to humans, although it can irritate the eyes and respiratory system.

542-> TAKE IT EASY, DOCTORS ADVISE PRESIDENT
President Reagan has been ordered by his doctors to limit his physical activities for the next six weeks in line with the usual regimen for a man who has just been discharged from a hospital for a transurethral resection of the prostate. The instructions Mr. Reagan received from his doctors were to do ''no heavy lifting, no strenuous exercise, no riding or chopping wood, and to pursue a limited but progressive schedule,'' setting his own pace and increasing his routine as much as is comfortable, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Friday. It takes about six weeks for the body to heal after any kind of major surgery and when such patients leave the hospital, doctors generally give them instructions that vary according to each individual's condition to help them through. Mr. Reagan, like any other patient recuperating from prostate surgery, faces a small chance of complications such as bleeding and infection. Variation on Antibiotics Doctors vary not only in whether they prescribe antibiotics after prostate surgery but also in the choice of such drugs. The White House has said that Mr. Reagan will continue to take unnamed antibiotics for several weeks. Bleeding can occur at any time, though, if it occurs, it is most common during the first three weeks after surgery, according to Dr. Russell W. Lavengood, a urologist who practices in New York City. Urologists generally instruct patients who have had transurethral resections of their prostate to be active but not to do things that would put a strain on their abdomen. Dr. John W. Coleman, a urologist who also practices in New York City, said he tells such patients not to exert themselves to ''where the face gets red -not to lift anything heavy, not to do situps, leg raises and things like that.'' The aim is to avoid the risk of having a scab or clot break off and to start bleeding from the healing area. Dangers of Loss of Scab As the surgical area heals, the old tissue breaks off and the body forms new tissue. If a scab attached to a blood vessel breaks off, bleeding can result. Urologists generally warn patients that they will feel an urge to void urine more often in the first two or so weeks after their operation and that there will be blood in their urine, on and off, for up to three months. Because the surgical area has a raw surface, many urologists tell patients who have had prostate surgery to drink copious amounts of fluid and to avoid caffeine and spicy foods that will add to the frequency and irritability of urination. The White House has said that Mr. Reagan has been drinking decaffeinated coffee. Many urologists advise patients not to travel for three weeks after prostate surgery because, if a complication develops, it may be difficult to find a urologist quickly and a new doctor will not be so familiar with an individual's case as is the patient's own doctor. Col. John Hutton of the Army, the White House physician or a member of his staff is constantly near Mr. Reagan. Mayo Team Stood By Mr. Reagan's prostate surgery was performed by a team of urologists headed by Dr. David Utz from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Dr. Utz and other members of the team stayed in Washington after he left the hospital. Mr. Reagan's weight, 189 pounds, did not change while he was in the hospital, according to Mark D. Weinberg, assistant White House press secretary. Mr. Reagan's vital signs were reported as normal; his pulse ranged from 60 to 64 and his blood pressure from 120 to 140 systolic and 70 diastolic.

543-> SURROGATE-MOTHER PACTS ENDORSED
Contracts between surrogate mothers and infertile couples should be recognized as ''legal and enforceable'' in New York State, a report by the State Senate Judiciary Committee has recommended. The report, released yesterday, urges the Legislature to pass laws that would clarify the ambiguous legal status of surrogate motherhood. It also recommends that judicial review be required of all surrogate contracts. The recommendations, which are expected to form the basis of a bill to be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, represent an initial victory for proponents of surrogate motherhood. The recommendations are likely to spark an emotional controversy. Several religious groups, including most recently a group of New Jersey bishops, have condemned surrogate motherhood as a sophisticated form of adultery, and many feminists have decried the renunciation of a mother's rights that the arrangement entails. Opponents of surrogate motherhood, which generally involves a payment to the mother, have deemed the practice baby selling and hence illegal. The hazy legality of surrogate motherhood under current law has been dramatized by the Baby M. case in New Jersey. In that case, which is to go to trial tomorrow, the surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, is fighting to keep the child she conceived through artificial insemination and had agreed to relinquish to its father, William Stern.

544-> CUOMO AND SANTUCCI CONFER ON RACIAL ATTACK
Governor Cuomo met with the Queens District Attorney here today to discuss turning the case of the Howard Beach racial assault over to a special prosecutor. After a day of meetings here, the District Attorney, John J. Santucci, and the Governor's spokesmen gave signals of being prepared to turn the case over to a special prosecutor. Mr. Cuomo had previously rejected calls from black community leaders for a special prosecutor to look into the Howard Beach case. But after the meetings with Mr. Santucci, the Governor's criminal-justice coordinator, Lawrence T. Kurlander, said Mr. Cuomo was ''willing to consider such a request if that will play a useful role.'' Mr. Santucci, who was flown here this morning on a state plane sent by the Governor, said he had not formally requested the appointment of a special prosecutor. But he said he would consent to such an appointment, an unusual step in the state criminal-justice system, if it would break the impasse that has stymied prosecution of the white youths accused of beating three black men and chasing one of them onto Shore Parkway, where he was struck and killed by a car. But aides to Mr. Cuomo said they had been unable to get any indication that a key witness in the Howard Beach case, Cedric Sandiford, a victim of the assault, would drop his refusal to testify even if a special prosecutor was named. ''I'm not at all optimistic on that score,'' Mr. Kurlander said. He said he had been in touch through intermediaries with Mr. Sandiford's lawyers, who two weeks ago had called for the naming of a special prosecutor. One of the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr., did not return telephone calls to his office today. The District Attorney said he did not like the idea of giving up jurisdiction in the case. But he said the continuing impasse might have a serious effect on race relations. ''At times, you've got to swallow hard and do what you don't want to do for a general purpose,'' Mr. Santucci said after meeting with Mr. Cuomo here for a second time during the day. Mr. Santucci said appointment of a special prosecutor was ''one of the things I suggested we consider.'' Others included seeking Federal intervention, but the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Andrew J. Maloney, said that the Justice Department could only intervene if local authorities clearly would not handle the case and that it was preferable for the case to be prosecuted locally. Mr. Maloney said his office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were monitoring the situation. Mr. Kurlander, the criminal-justice coordinator, said no decisions had been made, however, and that time was needed to consider the situation. He said that historically when a district attorney requests a special prosecutor, that request is honored. One possibility for the job, if a special prosecutor is chosen, he said, is Charles J. Hynes, the special prosecutor for the criminal-justice system in New York City. The Howard Beach attack, which occurred on Dec. 20, has triggered the greatest focus on race relations in New York City in years. Refused to Cooperate One of the attack victims, Mr. Sandiford, 36 years old, has refused to cooperate with the police or District Attorney Santucci, saying they mistreated him in the early phases of the inquiry and were not interested in prosecuting the case fully. Mr. Sandiford and one of his lawyers, Mr. Maddox, have said he would not testify in the case until Mr. Santucci was superseded by either Federal prosecutors or by a special state prosecutor, who would be appointed by the Governor. Mr. Santucci has described Mr. Sandiford as a ''vital'' witness to the attack. Mr. Sandiford's stepson, Michael Griffith, 23, was killed in the attack when he tried to escape from the white youths by running across the parkway. A judge dismissed murder and manslaughter charges against three of the white youths because of insufficient evidence after Mr. Sandiford refused to testify. The three white youths are still facing charges of reckless endangerment. The prosecutors have until mid-February to try to reinstate the more serious charges. Initially, Mr. Cuomo rejected the call for a special prosecutor. His spokesman, Martin Steadman, said two weeks ago that Mr. Maddox had ''zero credibility'' in accusing the police and prosecutors of a cover-up. The Governor asked Mr. Maddox to bring his cover-up charges to Mr. Hynes. This apparently was not done and Mr. Maddox said Mr. Hynes only had authority to investigate police misconduct, not the death itself. Possibility Raised But on Sunday Mr. Santucci, in an interview with a black-oriented weekly newspaper, The City Sun, raised the possibility that he might agree to turn the entire case over to a special prosecutor. Having heard about the article, Mr. Kurlander asked Mr. Santucci to come to Albany, and the Governor sent a plane today. Special prosecutors are appointed under sections of the executive law that empower the governor to supersede a local district attorney when he cannot, for reasons of conflict, corruption, incapacity or other problems, handle a case. There are two types of special prosecutors. The first are those who fill essentially permanent offices created to handle a systemic problem. These include the special prosecutor's office that has authority to investigate all cases of corruption in the criminal-justice system anywhere in New York City. The other type of special prosecutor is appointed to handle a specific case. The only special prosecutor authorized by Mr. Cuomo involved a case in which the Jefferson County District Attorney, Gary W. Miles, said in 1986 that he could not handle the prosecution of two sheriff's sergeants who were accused of lying in a case in which Mr. Miles used them as star witnesses in the prosecution of another officer in the beating of a prisoner. Call for Boycott In response to the death of Mr. Griffith, his lawyer, Mr. Maddox, and various community leaders have called for a boycott of white-owned busineses on Jan. 21. Mayor Koch has criticized that action as ''racist.'' Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn Democrat and an organizer of the boycott, critcized the Mayor today. ''One wonders why the Mayor gets so touchy when the subject of the role of business in perpetuating racism comes up,'' the Assemblyman said. ''Instead of engaging in name-calling, the Mayor should deepen the dialogue with black leadership.'' Mr. Green urged the Mayor to endorse the call for a special prosecutor.

545-> ARTS GRANTS AWARDED
The National Endowment for the Arts announced today that it would award $189,875 in Federal grants to designers and artists collaborating on six model projects to develop public spaces. The grants were the first given under a new category, created by the endowment a year ago, that is intended to stimulate cooperation between visual artists and design professionals for whom project grants previously were awarded separately. ''In the area of public art and public design, it is important for us to see if architects, designers, landscape architects and others in the field can work more effectively with painters, sculptors and other visual artists in an integrated fashion from the very outset of a project,'' said the endowment chairman, Frank Hodsoll. These are the grants being awarded: * $35,375 to Creative Time of New York to plan for the development of Hunters Point, a 92-acre landfill site on the East River in Queens, as a waterfront park and arts center. * $15,000 to the Wellesley College Museum in Massachusetts for a sculptor and an architect to design a small, experimental work to place on a public, wooded pathway through the college campus. * $20,000 to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management in Boston for artists and landscape architects to design a riverside promenade and create an art master plan for the historic core of Lawrence, Mass. * $28,500 to the city of Concord, Calif., for a statewide competition to develop a landscape design and artwork for the downtown Todos Santos Plaza. * $11,000 to the Headlands Art Center of Sausalito, Calif., for the design of innovative furniture for public performances and lectures in the multimedia arts center across from San Francisco. * $80,000 to the Seattle Arts Commission for the design of a new, $160 million civic center by a team of artists, architects, landscape architects and engineers.

547-> AMERICA'S CUP; AMERICANS LONGING FOR HOME
During the decade that Australians went to Newport, R.I., to seek the America's Cup, the crews had the same complaint time and again. It wasn't that they didn't like the place. Nor was it the people they met. It was the fact that they were away from home and their loved ones for such an extended period of time. It was, many said, the hardest part about challenging for the America's Cup. Now the tables are turned. It is American crew members who are on foreign soil and the effect turns out for some to be just as wearing. Adam Ostenfeld, a 33-year-old sail trimmer on Stars & Stripes, has been around the 12-Meter scene before. He was in Dennis Conner's crew aboard Liberty in 1983, and for more than a year was part of the New York Yacht Club's America II program. Last October, he joined the Conner camp again, and he has been here sailing day after day since. Great Rewards The rewards have been great. Stars & Stripes needs to win only one more race against New Zealand to gain the right to challenge an Australian defender for the America's Cup. But it hasn't been all glory. ''We're so far away from home, from friends and from family here, and we're under a lot of pressure,'' said Ostenfeld, a short, muscular man who takes his sailing seriously. ''You go into a newspaper store around here, but it's not like having the local paper at home. And when you do get a paper, it's the same one that was there four days ago. ''If you want to call home, you end up spending $30 to talk 15 minutes. Professional football players probably have it easier than we do, because they're never that far away from home. We're here for six months.'' Not all the crew share Ostenfeld's view. Conner, for example, says he is comfortable living in Australia. He lives here with his family - his wife, Judy, and two teen-age daughters whom he has taken out of school in San Diego and placed in a school here. Feeling at Home ''We're used to campaigning away from home,'' Conner said last week. ''Frankly, the Australian people seem to me very similar to Americans, and in particular, southern Californians. We've been made to feel very much at home and popular here.'' Ostenfeld, who is a fine arts graduate from New York's School of Visual Arts, said he misses not having his own tools. He is a painter and a sculptor who learned boat-building and design as an offshoot of his art work. He has a studio at his home in Newport, R.I., where he has a drawing board, books, pencils and engineering tools. But when he does find free time from the boat here, he has no place to sit down and work. When Conner's crew has a rare day off, they tend to scatter. They don't go out much at night, except perhaps to a restaurant for dinner. There is a streak of local antagonism here toward America's Cup ''yachties,'' and the crew knows enough to keep away from certain bars. Ready to Leave Kyle Smith, a relief grinder on Stars & Stripes, is here with his wife, Karen, who directs an aerobics class for the crew. But like many others who have been here for a long stretch, he is ready to go home. ''It's not the same as when the cup was in Newport,'' said Smith, a native of New Orleans. ''At the end of the day, you'd see all your friends around the docks. Everybody would go out at night. And you could still go home. Here, it's not that easy.'' About the only time anyone sees a Stars & Stripes crewman in town is when he is having a morning coffee at one of the numerous outdoor cafes. It is about the only diversion to sailing that a crewman seems to have time for. More often than not, Ostenfeld can be seen at Gino's, a busy downtown cafe where many of Fremantle's old-timers gather each day. ''The America's Cup is not enough to hold someone here for such a long time,'' Ostenfeld said. ''It's a sailboat race. That's all. It's difficult to be in an environment where everybody is thinking and talking about the same thing. At home in Newport, I can accomplish something when I have a day off. Not like here.''

548-> Advertising; Muir Cornelius Moore Wins Helicopter Job
Muir Cornelius Moore has become the ad agency for the LHX Light Helicopter, now under development by the Boeing Sikorsky LHX Team, a joint venture of Boeing Vertol and Sikorsky Aircraft. The helicopter is expected to be fully operational by 1990, and in the meantime the agency will be promoting it in publications reaching the military industry. The client talked to nine agencies and narrowed them to three finalists.

549-> BankAmerica Meeting Shift
The BankAmerica Corporation said Friday that its board would meet Wednesday and Thursday, rather than on Feb. 1-2 as regularly scheduled. Analysts said they expected the bank to disclose the terms of a proposed stock offering at that time. Separately, the Federal Reserve Board has requested additional information from the First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles in its application to acquire BankAmerica. The Fed, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request by The American Banker, has released an edited version of a Dec. 23 letter citing various ''informational deficiencies'' in First Interstate's application. The Fed's letter said it sought additional information on what potential profit increases First Interstate expects from the merger; the dilutive effect of issuing new securities; a list of the branches of BankAmerica's Seafirst subsidiary that First Interstate would retain and a projection of asset sales and divestitures for the next five years. A Fed spokesman here described the request as routine. But Joseph Arsenio, an analyst with Birr, Wilson & Company, said the letter ''may be significant because BankAmerica did file an elaborate brief with the Fed which picks apart the application.'' He noted that Bankamerica had submitted an ''exhaustive list of deficiencies,'' but he said this was not surprising because First Interstate had not been able to see BankAmerica's books.

550-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Doings About Ribbons
Concerned over a cascade of unauthorized disclosures from closed hearings, the Senate Intelligence Committee recently adopted a rule that no Senator could take his notes from the hearing room. That created the problem of how to make the notes secure between meetings, said David L. Boren of Oklahoma, the chairman. The solution was to use plastic security envelopes devised by the Central Intelligence Agency for just such a purpose. The envelopes have a colored identification ribbon that is part of their design. The ones supplied to the committee all had the same color ribbon, prompting some Senators to complain that just any old colleague could pick up a Senator's private envelope and read his notes. So now each Senator, reports Mr. Boren, has a ribbon of his very own personal color.

551-> YOUR MONEY; Documenting Goods in Home
WHEN a fire gutted the Houston home of Virginia Robinson, she and her family managed to save just a few items. But when the time came to file a claim with her insurance company, she found it difficult to remember everything that she had before the blaze. ''We did not have an inventory and you miss things that way,'' Mrs. Robinson said. ''Even big things.'' Things might have gone better for Mrs. Robinson if she had an up-to-date inventory of all of the property in her home. For while any number and any value of belongings can be claimed, it is often hard to convince a claims adjuster working for an insurer that those items were owned by the policyholder. Therefore, a room-by-room, itemized list of possessions is not only an indication that the claimed furniture, appliances and other goods were actually on the premises, but also a good way to make sure that nothing will be forgotten in the trauma of a loss. And it may help to provide a guideline as to how much personal property insurance should be carried. ''It's up to the policyholder to lend an air of credibility to his claim,'' said Timothy Householder, general adjuster for the Kemper Group, a major insurance company. ''If you can show that on the first of every year you make an inventory, it lends a lot of credibility. It's mostly a common sense sort of approach.'' A detailed list of the various articles in the home, the purchase date and the purchase price can be prepared in advance by individuals on plain lined paper. The identification number on appropriate property, such as stereos or refrigerators, can also be inserted on the list. For pieces whose origin or value is unknown, such as heirlooms or gifts, a description may be useful. Many insurers and the Insurance Information Institute have special inventory forms that some homeowners use to simplify the preparation of this list. But some policyholders have started using photographs, audio tapes or videotapes to record the information. By taking still photographs or making a videotape of the property in a home, including whatever is in closets and other hidden areas, individuals can buttress their claims with a graphic record. Such photographing, moreover, can be done either by the policyholder or by a professional concern hired for the project. Receipts and other supporting documents for big-ticket items should be kept along with the inventory as further proof of purchase. One person who has long maintained a list of his possessions in the home says that he keeps a receipt whenever the price of the item exceeds $100. ''The biggest shock that most people have is not realizing the true value of their personal property,'' said Jean Baulis, assistant vice president of the Fireman's Fund Insurance Companies. ''The photograph shows the adjuster the true quality of an item, so that he can see that it didn't come from Penney's, it came from Tiffany's.'' Whatever type of inventory is compiled, financial advisers often recommend that the original be kept in a secure location outside the home, such as a safe deposit box. A copy might be retained at home for reference or updating. However, if the original record is stored in a house or apartment, it should be held in a fire-resistant safe or storage chest that is Underwriters Laboratories rated for fire protection. When considering the preparation of a household goods inventory, a related subject, of course, is the choice of homeowners insurance protection: either actual cash value, representing the replacement cost of an item minus depreciation, or replacement cost, representing the replacement cost at current prices. While most policies provide compensation on an actual cash value basis, more and more individuals are choosing the alternative of replacement cost these days. Take the case of a sofa purchased five years ago for $500, which had depreciated 50 percent and could now be replaced for $800. With actual cash value insurance, you would receive $400 - or 50 percent of $800 - in the event of a loss. With replacement cost insurance, you would receive the full $800. Another matter to consider is that, regardless of the overall policy limits, homeowners insurance typically has certain limitations, particularly for theft coverage, on certain high-value goods. Among them are $1,000 for jewelry, watches and furs combined and $2,500 for property in a home used for business purposes. To obtain higher coverage on such goods, individuals can buy an endorsement to their homeowners policy or obtain a separate ''floater'' policy for specifically named items. Then there is the matter of tax deductibility of personal casualty and theft losses. A deductible loss is generally the difference between the market value of the item before and after the loss, minus insurance reimbursements and $100. Furthermore, the amount that can be deducted must also be reduced by 10 percent of adjusted gross income.

552-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Legal Foundation Troubles
Dan Burt, president of the the Capital Legal Foundation, has turned in his resignation amid indications that support for such conservative legal foundations is flagging. ''There's no question about that,'' said Mr. Burt, who achieved a high public profile as the chief lawyer for Gen. William C. Westmoreland in his libel suit against CBS. ''What we have seen in the past year, not just us, is that the more reflective conservative groups have had real funding problems.'' Mr. Burt said declining revenue from conservative corporate donors resulted from a perception that their work ''has been done in the economy'' and that conservative emphasis was now on emotional issues such as abortion and foreign policy, notably in Central America. Mr. Burt, who has been president of the nonprofit foundation for six years, said the progress of deregulation in the Reagan Administration was, paradoxically, largely responsible for the decline of support for organizations like his. ''There is a lot less regulation and a lot of what is left is transferred to the states,'' he said. Despite his resignation, and despite cutbacks in the foundation's legal staff and a move to smaller quarters, Mr. Burt said, ''We're not out of business.'' The Capital Legal Foundation's economic problems are shared by similar free-market-oriented legal groups that sprung up in the 1970's. Such problems have been felt, for instance, at the Colorado-based Mountain States Legal Foundation, founded with oil money in 1977 to combat environmental restrictions, and headed by James G. Watt before he became President Reagan's first Interior Secretary. And on the West Coast, the Pacific Legal Foundation recently closed its Washington office.

553-> Bridge: Tri-State Swiss Team Titles Won by a New York Couple
An unusual double was achieved last Thursday at the Tri-State Regional Championships in Port Chester, N.Y. While Allan Stauber of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., was winning the Men's Swiss Teams event, his wife, Marcia Warner Stauber, was capturing the Women's Swiss Teams title. These were the winners of events played Friday : Master Pairs - Dave Treadwell, Wilmington, Del., and Brian Trent, Cherry Hill, N.J. Non-Master Pairs - Ted Ackerman, West Nyack, N.Y., and Ruth Bloom, White Plains. Newcomers Pairs - Thomas and Mary Cober, Macungie, Pa.; John and Pamala Hartigan, Hamden, Conn. On the diagramed deal, from the Men's Swiss Teams, Allan Stauber held the South cards and reached four spades as shown. North's bid of hearts was a splinter, showing a spade fit and at most one heart. This permitted East to suggest a lead by doubling. Ironically, this was the lead that South needed. He ruffed the second heart lead and cashed the spade ace. This revealed the bad spade split, and an apparently easy contract suddenly became difficult. Stauber took the club ace and the diamond ace and ruffed his last heart. He then cashed his spade king and exited with a club to endplay East. That player was forced to win and then had to lead in this position: With a diamond return, South would have disposed of both his club losers. With a heart return, South ruffed in his hand and threw a club from the dummy. He then ruffed a club and threw his last club on the diamond king. In the replay, the West cards were held by Steve Sanborn of Manhattan, who had won the Men's Pairs with Stauber a day earlier. With no clue to the opening lead, he tried a diamond against four spades and this proved more successful. East did not cover dummy's eight, and South won and tested trumps. He then led a heart, and West won and played another diamond. Now the endplay failed. A similar position to the one shown was reached, but when a diamond was led, West was able to ruff and cash the club king to defeat the game.

554-> SCOUTING; Change of Tone
Denise Berry had become accustomed in November and December to receiving early morning telephone calls from her son, Walter, who was playing professional basketball as a rookie for the Portland Trail Blazers. ''He usually called around six or six-thirty in the morning,'' Mrs. Berry recalled on Saturday at the St. John's-Boston College game. ''Usually he was sad when he called. He was injured, he wasn't playing, the coach was telling him what he couldn't do and, to tell the truth, Walter was beginning to think that maybe something really was wrong with him.'' She recalled that the first upbeat call came on Dec. 18 when Berry learned he had been traded to San Antonio from Portland, which had picked him in the first round of the draft. ''He called me and said, 'Mom, I'm out of here, I'm going to Texas,' '' recalled Mrs. Berry, who works as a security guard at St. John's games. Berry, the 1986 College Player of the Year, averaged only 2.7 minutes and 1.8 points in seven games with the Trail Blazers. But he enjoyed his finest game as a pro on Friday, making eight of eight field-goal attempts and four of seven foul shots for 20 points as the Spurs defeated Phoenix. At 6:30 Saturday morning, Mrs. Berry's phone rang, and the caller was ecstatic. ''He said, 'Hi Mom, it's Walter.' I said 'My, you sure sound happy,' and he said, 'I am happy, I scored 20 points last night.' '' Berry told his mother that after the game, Ed Pinckney, the Villanova center now in his second year with Phoenix, took him to dinner. ''It was the happiest he's sounded in a long time,'' said Mrs. Berry. ''The coach likes him and he's getting playing time.'' Asked if her son's improved fortunes has changed her mind about his decision to leave St. John's early, Mrs. Berry said it hadn't. ''I would have liked to see him finish, he only needed 15 more credits,'' she said.. ''But when a child gets to be 21, you can only tell him so much. If he'd stayed and been hurt this year, he'd never have forgiven me. I think it'll work out in the end.''

555-> WHITE HOUSE SAYS REPORT BACKS ITS ACCOUNT
The White House conceded today that the President's Iranian initiative ''could be interpreted as a trade of arms for hostates,'' but it again insisted that that had not been the President's intention. The acknowledgement came in a statement read by the White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, who described Mr. Reagan as pleased that the Senate document had been made public on Thursday. Mr. Speakes said that ''it confirms his position that he neither authorized nor was aware of the alleged diversion of funds to the contras.'' White House officials drew a distinction between parts of the report that focused on Mr. Reagan's decision to sell arms to Iran and other sections discussing whether he knew about the diversion of profits from those sales to Nicaraguan insurgents. The White House statement today did not address other suggestions in the Senate report that Administration officials mishandled investigations of sale of arms to Iran in the early stages in mid-November by ignoring, or trying to conceal, certain pieces of potentially damaging inforamtion. The statement today marked a shift in the White House strategy, which has included an adamant denial that Mr. Reagan had authorized the shipment of arms to gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Mr. Reagan and other senior aides have insisted that the shipments were linked to several considerations, including American strategic interests in the Middle East and the hope of influencing what were considered to be moderate elements in Iran. Mr. Speakes said the report was ''consistent'' with Mr. Reagan's position that, from its inception, ''the Iran initiative was an effort to open dialogue with top officials of a strategically important country.'' ''In implementing this policy, the release of hostages was an important preliminary step intended to show that the Iranians would no longer support terrorism, and the sale of arms was a gesture of good faith on the part of the United States in pursuing this strategic opening,'' Mr. Speakes said. Adopting a posture less defensive than in the past to suggestions that the President had engaged in an arms-for-hostages exchange, he added: ''To be sure, the linking of arms sales to the release of hostages at several points during the 15 months episode could be interpreted as a trade of arms for hostages, but this was not the policy approved by the President.'' Another senior White House official said that such language had been included in the statement because the report made it undeniable that arms had been provided to Iran in the hope of gaining the release of American hostages. But he said that White House officials still believed that the report, at numerous points, supported Mr. Reagan's contention that the Iran initiative had been started for other reasons. The report, for example, notes that the Central Intelligence Agency had in May 1985 raised the possibility of a change in American policy to seek a ''more constructive relationship with Iranian leaders interested in improved ties with the West.'' Mr. Speakes and other White House officials disputed another part of the report that said Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North had informed Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that it was a ''terrible mistake'' to say that the President had wanted a strategic relationship, because he wanted the hostages.'' Mr. Speakes said that Colonel North, who the report said had met with the President 17 times, was never alone with Mr. Reagan and that the meetings would not have been the sort in which such a statement might have been made.

556-> Verdict In Without Reporter
Prosecutors won a murder conviction Saturday without the evidence of a reporter who refused to testify about an interview he had with the defendant. The reporter, Robert Hohler, of The Concord (N.H.) Monitor, had refused to testify at the murder trial of Richard Steeves, a former mental patient, saying that the First Amendment gave him the right not to testify. The state had asserted that Mr. Hohler's testimony was needed to verify the content of a Monitor story based on his interview, which the state wanted to use as evidence against Mr. Steeves. Mr. Hohler was cited Thursday for criminal contempt of court by the trial judge, Justice G. Arthur Brennan, who ruled that prosecutors had shown that his testimony was essential to the case. Mr. Hohler's lawyer, William Chapman, said Saturday that the verdict vindicated the reporter's position that his testimony was not necessary, but Deputy Attorney General Fernand LaRochelle said that the state planned to proceed with contempt charges.

557-> ART VIEW; Beaux-Arts Sketches: Grace Under Pressure
Among the ordeals that faced the young French painter who wanted to climb the official ladder in the 19th century none was either more daunting or more decisive than the historical composition contest that was held every year between 1816 and 1863 at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Success in that contest was the indespensible preliminary to all the other competitive stages that led in time to the Rome Prize. From the Rome Prize there could follow a lifetime of official commissions and prestigious appointments until, heavy with honors, the veteran workhorse was accorded a state funeral. We all know this, more or less, even if our admiration has long been owed rather to the great independents -Delacroix, Corot, Daumier, Courbet, Manet, Pissarro and Cezanne - who stood aside from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, never went to Rome and did not care whether or not they got to decorate a law court, a city hall or a railroad station. What we don't know unless we have been given the run of the Beaux-Arts storerooms, is what the prize-winning sketches were like and to what extent they mirror the evolution of French art during the period in question. That is why an exceptional interest attaches to ''Oil Sketches from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts 1816-1863,'' which can be seen at the National Academy of Design at 1083 Fifth Avenue, near 89th Street, through March 15. In all, 139 oil sketches have been sent over from Paris, together with 23 painted figure studies and six of the penciled tree studies that were submitted for a separate prize in 1860. The show is completed by portraits of some of the often redoubtable professors who taught at the Beaux-Arts. Among those professors it is Ingres who dominates in art, as he dominated in life. Henri Lehmann's portrait of him may have been done from a photograph 13 years after Ingres's death, but it gives us an overwhelming impression of the barely contained rage with which Ingres would face down anyone who dared to question his every least opinion. As one of his pupils wrote, '' No one ever had a discussion with Monsieur Ingres.'' The exhibition itself starts with both a great advantage and a handicap. In its favor is the fact that our century has come to prize the sketch for its own sake. How often do we not rate it, for intimacy, immediacy and autographic quality, above the finished composition? Given the choice between an oil sketch by Rubens and the mammoth final version, we often feel more at home with the unmistakable presence of Rubens's own hand in the sketch than with the same subject magnified 100 times. Given that we cannot go every year to the Bishop's Palace in Burzburg in Germany, let alone live there, we delight all the more in the sketch for Tiepolo's ''Allegory of the Planets and the Continents'' which we can see six days a week at the Met. The nearer we get to our own time, the more strongly we empathize with the headlong first idea as against its often toilsome completion. In this matter, Eugene Delacroix is the great exemplar, and even if his ''Peace Descends to Earth'' for the Hotel de Ville in Paris had not been destroyed by fire in 1871 we should still have prized very highly the loose and liquid sketch for it in the Musee Carnavalet in Paris. As against that, it has to be said that at first sight there is something rather discouraging about the sight of 139 oil sketches, virtually identical in size - roughly 14 by 16 inches - every one of them painted in a single seven-hour session by artists who were young, untried and under appalling pressure. This is what happened. Each of the contestants had a small, windowed bay to himself in a long corridor. They would lower a curtain to knee height for privacy, but an invigilator stalked up and down to make sure that no prior idea, drawings after the Old Masters or stock figures that would serve a hundred purposes had been smuggled into the school. Punctually at the appointed hour the set subject was read out. Contestants were expected to know Greek and Roman history, literature and mythology in some detail, together with the Bible, Shakespeare and one or two other traditional sources. A memory lapse might be fatal, therefore, and it may have been with this in mind that the number of possible choices set each year rose gradually from one in 1816 to nine in 1863. These were conditions that favored dexterity and speed of wit, while discouraging slower and more ruminative procedures and making it unlikely that the end result would show anything approaching an emotional identification with the subject. When Delacroix, decorating the library of the Palais Bourbon in Paris in the 1840's, could freely express his sense of the fragility of civilization, the prize contestants of 1845 could hardly be expected to respond in any very personal way to ''The People of Sodom Stricken with Blindness.'' We would, on the contrary, expect to find that these very young painters - none of them was allowed to get married, by the way - were captives of the Zeitgeist who lived and breathed the specific idioms of their own day and did their best to adapt those idioms to their own purposes, such as they were, without shooting themselves in the foot. How could it be otherwise, when they had to contend with a new teacher every month and had not yet had time to develop as free and independent human beings? And that is, in fact, exactly what we do find. It was a further peculiarity of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts that although virtually every one of its students aspired to be a painter, painting itself was not taught in the school. Ingres defended this in 1862 by saying that ''drawing is everything. It is art in its entirety. As for the material processes of painting, they are quite easy and can be learned in one week.'' Given this point of view, it is not surprising that Ingres's own pupils used to sneak out and practice painting in secret. But then Ingres was undeniably perverse in his attitude to the school of which he was so prestigious an ornament. ''Don't dream of going near it unless you have to,'' he said to one of his pupils. ''They teach you nothing but how to get by . . . nothing but a shallow dexterity . . . of beauty and simplicity, never a trace.'' It is therefore all the more remarkable that although almost all the artists concerned are now forgotten, the long succession of stumpy little paintings at the National Academy of Design is so powerfully impregnated with the spirit of the age in its successive manifestations. Initially the figures move forward from an enveloping darkness towards a central pool of light in which high drama of one sort or another is played out. Vigor of expression is all, as if Jacques-Louis David was still around to set an example of heroic energy. It is a touching moment when in 1831 the first blue sky appears, and with it the will to open out the background, introduce symbolic architecture and move towards an ever ampler use of deep perspective. Palettes lighten, too, and there is a palpable delight in the handling of human beings in the mass. As the almost 50-year period draws to a close, we sense an almost universal readiness to dig deeper and deeper into the historical repertory of moods, poses, costumes and philosophical landscapes. Landscape and the human figure are equal partners and play off one another's strengths and weaknesses like a veteran doubles pair at Wimbledon. Something of the taut urgency of the 1820's was bartered in the 1850's for what could be called a comfortable eloquence. But then, as we now know, the moral center of painting had already moved away from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the Rome Prize and all that they stood for. All these matters are elucidated with exemplary devotion in a two-volume French language catalogue by Philippe Grunchec, curator at the school, and his colleague Bruno Foucart. Air France made a hefty contribution to the practicalities of the show, which will move later to museums in Madison, Wis.; Denver, and Coral Gables, Fla.

558-> Stephania Aulicino Is Married to James M. Condon
Stephania Aulicino, a daughter of Mrs. Armand D. Aulicino of Pelham, N.Y., and the late Mr. Aulicino, was married in Chicago yesterday to James Michael Condon, a son of Mr. and Mrs. John Edward Condon of Stuart, Fla. The Rev. Douglas Cater, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony at the Drake Hotel. The bride, who will keep her name professionally, is a vice president in the corporate finance department of Bear, Stearns & Company in Chicago. She graduated from Ithaca College and received an M.B.A. degree from the University of Chicago. Her mother, Mary Aulicino, teaches English as a second language at the Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx. Her father was the author of several cookbooks, including ''The New French Cuisine,'' and plays, including ''The Shoemaker and the Peddler.'' Mr. Condon is a project engineer for the Planning Research Corporation and a partner in Mackinac Yachts, a boat-building concern, both in Chicago. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana and received a master's degree in computer science from De Paul University. His father, who is retired, was a sales representative in Chicago.

560-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Soviet Aid on Ice
THE Vancouver Canucks, languishing in last place in the Smythe Division of the National Hockey League, hope a two-week guest coaching stint by Anatoli Tarasov, the former coach of the Soviet Union's national team, will pay some long range dividends. Tarasov, coach of the powerful Red Army team, will be in Vancouver from Jan. 30-Feb. 14 to assess the Canucks' talents. ''Tarasov has been invited to help us out by watching some of our games and practices,'' said Tom Watt, the Vancouver coach. ''I don't know all the details of his visit as yet, but he may even run one of our workouts during the All-Star break.'' The arrangement with Tarasov is a coaching exchange, with Watt scheduled to go to the Soviet Union in August to work with the Red Army team.

The United Nations has decided not to take legal action to try to block the broadcast of the ABC mini-series ''Amerika,'' according to Theodore C. Sorensen. But Mr. Sorensen, who has been retained by the United Nations to negotiate changes in the 14 1/2-hour mini-series, said he would not rule out other legal actions by the United Nations against the network. The mini-series depicts life in the United States 10 years after the country has been taken over by the Soviet Union with the aid of peacekeeping forces whose uniforms and insignia bear a resemblance to those of United Nations troops.

562-> Wadkins Birdies 18th to Lead
Lanny Wadkins finished with two straight birdies today, including a 20-foot chip shot into the 18th hole, to take the lead by a shot over Payne Stewart in the A.T.&T. Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Wadkins scored three-under-par 69 for a total of seven-under 137 after playing Cypress Point Thursday and Spyglass Hill today. Now he gets to play Pebble Beach, where he won the 1977 PGA Championship, on Saturday and Sunday in this event, formerly known as the Bing Crosby Pro-Am. Stewart, who was playing with Wadkins, celebrated his 30th birthday with a second straight 69 for 138. Sandy Lyle, who won the British Open in 1985 by a shot over Stewart, was tied with Dan Edwards and Isao Aoki at five under 139. Lanny's brother, Bobby, was tied with Fred Couples and Bobby Cole at 140. ''I looked up and saw Bobby was six under once,'' he said. ''Obviously he backed off a bit as little brothers tend to do.'' Rex Caldwell, the first round leader with 67 Thursday at Pebble Beach, fell back to 145 after a six-over 78 at Cypress Point. This second day ended rather poorly for Caldwell as he took a quadruple bogey 8 on the 18th hole that included a two-stroke penalty imposed when Caldwell's third shot bounced off a tree and struck his caddie. The golfers in this field of 180 pros and 180 amateurs are being allowed to lift, clean and replace their golf balls on their own fairways at Spyglass Hill, a course that has been drenched by recent rains, including a heavy shower this morning. Golf purists detest touching a golf ball between tee and green. To them it isn't real golf. Lanny Wadkins, who is one of the purists, said, however, ''That's the only way you can play Spyglass. That course is always soaking wet. It was a swamp today.'' This usually makes Spyglass the most difficult of the three courses on the Monterey Peninsula where strong winds can make Cypress Point and Pebble Beach difficult. But the winds have not been up yet this week. Wadkins, who missed only one fairway at Spyglass today, said, ''It has been a fairly easy seven under.'' The 5-foot-9-inch Wadkins got birdies today at his second hole with a pitching wedge to six feet, at No. 8 with a sand wedge to three inches and at 17 with a 6-iron to three feet. Then came the chip in with an 8-iron. A three-putt bogey marred the round only slightly. But Wadkins hit his iron apprpaches within 3 feet at 12, 4 feet at 13 and missed the birdie putts. He could just as easily been at nine under or better. Stewart, who always wears plus fours, was playing with Wadkins and only shrugged when the chip rolled into the cup at 18. Stewart's best shot of the tournament so far came in the first round Thursday at Cypress Point when he holed out a 100-yard wedge for an eagle 2 on the 12th hole. Five holes later, Stewart hit his drive so far right at 17 that it caught in the side of the cliff overhanging rocks and the Pacific Ocean. Saying ''I wanted to make sure I lived to be 30,'' Stewart refused to play from the treacherous cliff and took a drop and thus a stroke penalty away from the cliff hazard. Eventually he got a double bogey there but he was also able to make it to the age of 30.

565-> BATTLE FOR BASRA; U.S. EXPERTS STILL PUZZLED ABOUT FUTURE OF GULF WAR
WITH carnage reminiscent of the trench warfare during World War I, the battle for the Iranian port city of Basra, at the head of the Persian Gulf, is about to go into its second month. Both Iraq and Iran made what seemed to be exaggerated reports of enemy casualties last week, with Baghdad citing 100,000 Iranian casualties and Teheran saying 30,000 Iraqis had been killed or wounded. United States Defense Intelligence Agency estimates were lower but still dramatic: 50,000 casualties for Iran and 10,000 to 20,000 for Iraq. Last week, President Reagan condemned Iran's seizure of Iraqi territory and called the war a threat to ''American strategic interests.'' Iran's plans and the likely outcome of the battle remained a puzzle to American intelligence authorities. Iran has long promised a ''final offensive'' by late March but now says it has not begun. Some analysts say the Iranians may be content, for now, to hold the ground they have captured. They have made small gains south of Basra near Fish Lake, which runs perpendicular to the strategic Shatt al-Arab waterway connecting Basra with the Persian Gulf. They have also gained footholds on some islands in the Shatt but have not been able to cross it. Iraqi counterattacks, including one using elite Presidential Guards, have failed. Baghdad apparently was forced to concede Iran's gains and try to use its superior artillery and airpower to bar further advances. Military experts doubt that Iran can capture Basra but say that constant shelling can insure that the town remains unlivable. Role of Revolutionary Guards The State Department publicly played down Iran's latest gains and implied that the battle was about over. But military intelligence sources said the lull may be a breather while the Iranians are resupplied and reinforced. Of the estimated 200,000 Iranians available, they said, only about 60,000 have been fighting. The degree to which munitions and equipment are available to sustain Iran's attacks is not precisely known. But its main problem, military sources say, has not been availability so much as logistics, getting supplies to the front line. American intelligence analysts, who are watching the situation closely, noted that the Iranians were successful last week in moving men and supplies at night, despite fierce Iraqi artillery and air attacks. But Iran has also had difficulty in the past controlling and coordinating its units, and this has been attributed to lack of communications and professional competence. Iraq has indicated that the recent fighting has involved only units of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who, American sources say, are emerging as Iran's new army. The regulars held over from the Shah's time are increasingly relegated to static defensive duty. The Revolutionary Guards reportedly have taken on the organization and trappings of a conventional army. They are showing increased military sophistication, leading American analysts to believe they may now be able to overcome logistic and control problems and sustain their attacks. Analysts note that Iraq has reinforced its southern front with forces from regions as far north as Mandali, along the border east of Baghdad. The Basra attack, they say, may be a diversion, and the main Iranian attack may be launched farther north. Intelligence sources say Iran has substantial forces in the Ahvaz-Dezful area, north of Basra, and near Mandali, where clashes have already occurred. While the fighting raged around Basra last week, both sides launched air attacks and used Soviet-made ''Scud'' surface-to-surface missiles. Iraq reportedly launched 14 Scuds, and the Iranians hit Baghdad with six of them. Exploiting its superiority in the air, Iraq bombed Iranian cities, including Teheran and the holy city of Qum. Iran said more than 1,700 civilians have been killed and 6,000 wounded in 29 cities. There were also new maritime developments last week. Iranians launched Italian-made ''Sea Killer'' missiles at night from warships near the Strait of Hormuz, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf - attacking neutral shipping doing business with Kuwait, a major transshipment point for war materials bound for Iraq. Three oil tankers were damaged in the territorial waters of Oman and the United Arab Emirates. And the Soviet Union sent a Krivak-class frigate into the Gulf for the first time, escorting four Soviet merchant ships reportedly carrying arms for Iraq. The intensity of the fighting has strained both sides, yet both boast of high morale and unflagging determination. The claims are difficult to assess because neither country has let outsiders watch the battles. Iraq has a smaller population to draw upon for military service. Its army includes a large number of Shiite Moslems, who might be sympathetic to Iran's fundamentalist revolution. Consequently, Iraq has always been reluctant to risk heavy casualties by counterattacking on the ground. Iraq's ability to withstand losses may determine the outcome. Experts do not discount the possibility that Iraq's military leaders may decide one day that their President, Saddam Hussein, is the main obstacle to ending the war and look for a way to remove him.

567-> QUESTION BOX
Tulip Time Question:Where can one arrange a trip to the Netherlands in the spring when the tulips are in bloom? -M. C. H., Dolgeville, N.Y. Answer:An eight-day trip called Holland Holiday visits bulb fields, gardens and other sites in spring and summer, including April and May, when the tulips, daffodils and other flowers are in bloom. It is operated by Maupintour (408 East 50th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-688-4106 and 800-255-4266, which can be called from New York). Departures and return are on Saturdays. The itinerary includes the 70-acre Keukenhof Gardens at Lisse, the showcase of the bulb industry, as well as The Hague, the Delft pottery factory in Rotterdam and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. A guide accompanies each group and the land cost of $1,498 a person, double occupancy, includes hotels, 13 meals and tour bus. The tour uses KLM for the flight from New York to Amsterdam, which, depending on date, costs from $448 to $628, round trip. Another way to see the spring flowers is from a 100-passenger ship that cruises along the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. A program combining this seven-night cruise and three nights in Amsterdam is offered by Sea Air Holidays (733 Summer Street, Stamford, Conn. 06901; 203-356-9033 and 800-732-6247). The price, excluding air fare but including most meals and sightseeing ashore, is $2,079. The cruise on its own costs from $1,199. The ship leaves Amsterdam on six consecutive Saturdays starting April 4. Battlefields Question:Where can I find information about escorted tours of the Normandy battlefields? - H. W., New York Answer:World War II sites in Normandy are included in tours from the United States and on shorter trips from Paris, all of them escorted. One of the longer ones, a 15-day ''March to Victory'' tour, is offered by Battlefield Tours (1680 Old Spanish Trail, Slidell, La. 70458; 504-641-4422 or, out of state, 800-321-9412). The tour starts with a flight to London and a visit to Southampton, goes across the Channel by ferry to Cherbourg and continues to Caen, Paris, Rheims and Aachen, West Germany. The return flight is from Frankfurt. There are departures on June 26, Aug. 14 and Sept. 21, and the cost of $1,995 a person, double occupancy, includes trans-Atlantic round-trip air fare, hotels, most meals and guides. Galaxy Tours (Post Office Box 234, Wayne, Pa. 19087; 215-254-6600 or 800-523-7287), which has organized visits to Normandy for 28 years, does a lot of trips for veterans of specific military units who want to retrace their own routes. But it also has a general tour, scheduled for June 1. The 10-day trip includes London and Paris as well as the beaches and other landmarks in Normandy. The land-only cost will be about $900 a person. From Beach to Bastogne is the name of a nine-day trip, departing June 11 and Sept. 26, with Tours of Historic and Important Places (Post Office Box 203, Mountain Lakes, N.J. 07046; 201-335-8316). The cost of $1,599 includes air fare. A one-day visit to the Normandy landing beaches and other sites can be taken from Paris through City Rama (347 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-683-8120). Its program is on Tuesday and Friday from April 17 through October. The one-day tour, by bus and back to Paris by train, costs $113, including lunch. Eleuthera Question:Would you please give some information on the Cotton Bay Club in Eleuthera, the Bahamas? I never see it mentioned any more. We stayed there some time ago. -M. F. P., Edison, N.J. Answer:By all accounts, the Cotton Bay Club near Rock Sound, Eleuthera, continues to flourish. The resort is one of the few in the Bahamian Family Islands with an 18-hole golf course, and it also has its own marina and four tennis courts. There are 77 rooms, about half of them in the main lodge, the remainder in cottages and villas in the gardens. Rates this winter are from $254 to $302 a day for two people, breakfast and dinner included. Reservations can be made through Hotels of Distinction (800-843-2297) or the Bahamas Reservation Service (800-327-0787). The address is: Cotton Bay Club, Post Office Box 28, Rock Sound, Eleuthera, Bahamas; 809-334-2101. Yugoslavia by Bus Question:Will there be bus tours of Yugoslavia next summer, and where can reservations be made? - J. F., Philadelphia Answer:Several tours are scheduled from April through October, many of them taking in the Dalmatian coast and visiting Dubrovnik. Some either begin or end in Zagreb, which, like Dubrovnik, is a gateway city for international flights. For travelers making their own way to Yugoslavia who are interested only in land arrangements, there are some Yugoslav travel agencies with respresentatives in New York that make reservations. Among them are Atlas Ambassador (60 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10165; 212-697-6767) and General Tourist (212 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-935-3022). Both offer escorted tours of eight days from about $420 a person, double occupancy. Their prices include hotels, with private shower or bath, most meals and sightseeing. Travel agents can book bus tours with Yugotours (350 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10118; 212-563-2400 or 800-223-5298), whose prices include international, round-trip air fare as well as hotels and two meals a day. A 10-day itinerary, including 2 nights in Dubrovnik, costs, from New York, from $958 to $1,308. Departures are on Tuesdays. A two-week tour, with visits to Belgrade and Sarajevo, leaves on Thursdays and is $1,209 to $1,598. A Yugoslav bus tour is also available with Saga Holidays (120 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02116; 617-451-6808 or 800-343-0273), which caters to travelers aged 55 and over and deals directly with the public. Saga has a 17-night trip, with four departures in April and three in May, all on Mondays. The tour includes one night in London on the outward and return journeys. Price, including round-trip air fare from New York, hotels and three meals a day: $1,409. Readers are invited to send written questions about travel to Q & A, Travel Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions may be answered only through the column, not by mail or telephone.

570-> A CITY OF MUSICIANS AND AUDIENCES
An art museum may sound like a strange place to begin a musical tour, but for the visitor to Prague who is interested in Czech music, the Gallery of 19th-Century Czech Art is a striking introduction. The museum, part of the National Gallery, is imaginatively housed in the former Convent of the Blessed Agnes, a vast and magnificent 13th-century complex, the largest and oldest Gothic monument in the city, still being restored, rescued after centuries of neglect. Two wings are now open; in the intelligently installed collection you can see any number of big canvases reflecting the last century's nationalist passion for Czech history: the legendary Queen Libuse stands on Vysehrad Hill, prophesying the glory of Prague; and here is the Amazonlike Sarka, and Premysl, the farmer-king; and, closer to modern times, Jan Hus, the 15th-century religious martyr. All these characters inspired the operas and tone poems of Czech composers, from Smetana and Dvorak to the later Fibich and Janacek. Many of these works were written to be performed at the Narodni Divadlo, the National Theater, which was first inaugurated in 1881, then destroyed a few weeks later by a terrible fire, then definitively inaugurated in 1883. Unlike most European opera houses, which were built at the command (and expense) of kings and dukes, the Narodni was financed by popular subscription, and was meant to be the expression and the emblem of the Czech nation, which then existed only as a subservient, restless element in the patchwork of the Austrian Empire. All the leading painters and sculptors of the nation made their contribution, and in the 19th-Century Art Gallery, you can see the sketches they made for the frescoes, the painted curtain, the sculptures that now adorn the lovely opera house. Few theaters, for me, are as moving as the Narodni Divadlo. ''Narod sobe'' says the inscription over the proscenium arch: the nation, to itself. What a gift. And the people, the audience, really do have a proprietary air. They dress formally, and they behave soberly; the popular drink at the bar is fruit juice. And they are proudly cordial toward foreign guests. (For an extra couple of crowns you can buy an English-language program from the maternal, smiling ushers.) Though the Narodni performs the international operatic repertory, they also schedule, rightly, a long list of Czech operas. Virtually the entire Smetana canon is given every year, in addition to the most important works of Dvorak, Janacek, Fibich, their less well-known contemporaries (Novak, Kovarovic), and living musicians like Jiri Pauer and Jan Hanus. Foreign guest singers are a rarity; and since every major city in Czechoslovakia has at least one opera house (Prague has three), the supply of native singers is smaller than the demand. Veterans tend to go on working longer than advisable, and promising young artists are kept too busy. (I heard one gifted tenor four times in six nights.) Casting is uneven, as a result; but it is unusual to hear a dull performance. If nothing else, the orchestra can be relied on to play beautifully, and the chorus - especially in Smetana - is full-voiced, rousing. Nowadays the National Theater is an umbrella term covering two other halls. One of these is the new chamber theater, the Nova Scena, a glass-sheathed cube on a newly created plaza next to the old opera house. The plaza also comprises a new administration building and a restaurant building, where you can get a good meal and excellent beer after the performance. Originally planned as a conference center, the Nova Scena was drastically reconceived after building had already begun. Most of my Prague friends thoroughly dislike it. In a city with few modern public buildings, it does come as something of a shock. But then most of my Prague friends have never seen the interior; the seating capacity is small - a couple of hundred - and every performance is sold out immediately. The foyer, with its walls of green marble from Cuba, is bright and welcoming; the leather seats - worthy, indeed, of a board of directors' conference table - are seductively comfortable; and the acoustics are excellent. Designed by the renowned Jiri Swoboda, the hall is extremely versatile. I saw there a children's opera by Pauer, ''The Talkative Snail,'' which, in the fashion of Swoboda's Lanterna Magika, combined film and mime, taped music and live actors. The children loved it, and so did we few adults present. The Nova Scena divides its time between spoken theater and opera, mostly new and experimental opera. But the Narodni also administers the handsome Smetana Theater. Originally known as the German Theater, this house opened in 1888 (perhaps in response to the Czech Theater, then five years old). Mahler conducted there, and Alexander Zemlinsky was its chief conductor from 1911 to 1927. (In 1924 he conducted the world premiere of his brother-in-law Arnold Schoenberg's ''Erwartung'' in this house.) Like the Narodni, the Smetana has recently been restored, with tact and respect. Its golden decorations glow against its white walls, the red plush is warm and welcoming, and so are the larger-than-life-size caryatid ladies, who might have stepped off the label of a bottle of White Rock. Of course, the oldest, most distinguished opera house in Prague is the Tyl Theater, originally known as the Nostitz or the Estates Theater. This is the house for which Mozart wrote ''Don Giovanni'' and ''La Clemenza di Tito,'' and where he attended with delight the enthusiastically successful Prague performances of his ''Nozze di Figaro.'' Also under the Narodni's direction, the Tyl is currently closed, bricked up and undergoing restoration. It will reopen in 1991, for the Mozart bicentenary year. And then it will resume its normal life as another Prague opera theater. Music in Prague is not only opera. Prague, with a population of about 1.2 million, has more symphony orchestras than New York or London, and the Czech Philharmonic -the country's No. 1 - ranks among the finest in Europe. (It is not well known in the West, but it has made many recordings; the historic disks with the conductor Vaclav Talich are worth hunting for.) Orchestral concerts are usually given in the Smetana Hall, surely one of the most beautiful Secession buildings in existence. The exterior, these days, is somewhat drab at first sight; but, under the layer of dust, you can see the careful detail and the grandeur of the design. The interior is largely restored, and gleaming. All the great Czech artists of the early years of this century contributed to the decoration. (Be sure to visit the Primatorensaal, with allegorical paintings by Alfonse Mucha, Sarah Bernhardt's protege and poster designer.) The House of Artists, once known as the Rudolfinium, also has concerts, usually on a smaller scale, in its handsome Dvorak Hall, the seat of the Czech Parliament during the First Republic and, before that, the recital hall of the Prague Conservatory. But in Prague there are concerts everywhere: in gardens, in churches, in museums and villas. A friend proudly took me to an otherwise dreary, working-class neighborhood to show me a new concert location called the Atrium. Actually the hall is the 18th-century Church of the Holy Cross, neglected until a few years ago, when restoration revealed its excellent acoustics and its beautiful organ (which has also been restored). Now, with a 120-seat capacity, it has an intense concert program. The calendar I saw listed 22 events - chamber orchestras, the Prague Madrigalists, trios and quartets - in a single month. The Atrium draws largely a neighborhood audience, but for that matter there are concert halls in every quarter of the city, as I discovered one evening when I went up to the Vinohrady Theater for a (very creditable) performance of Mozart's ''La Clemenza di Tito'' by students who were graduating from the Conservatory. After I had bought my ticket, I had a half-hour to kill, so I walked around the square. I came upon an impressive, obviously public building, the House of Culture, which also comprised an agreeable wine bar, where I stopped for a pre-opera drink. When I came out and headed for my theater, an audience was streaming into the House of Culture, too; and I paused for a moment to look at the list of events. That night there was a lieder recital by a well-known soprano from the National Theater; later in the week, the Steamboat Stompers were scheduled to perform. These neighborhood halls also sponsor collective trips to museums and monuments outside the city and present amateur talent as well as professionals. The very streets of Prague are full of musical associations. Not far from the Tyl Theater, in the Old City, there is a plaque on an unassuming facade in the old Coal Market (Uhleny trida), the site of the Three Lion Cubs, an inn where Mozart stayed. But Mozart's spirit is even more compellingly present in the Villa Bertramka - an inexpensive taxi ride from the center of town - where the composer visited his good friends, the Czech musician Frantisek Dusek and his wife, the singer Josefa. According to credible tradition, Mozart composed the overture to ''Don Giovanni'' in the shady garden of the villa, and for his hostess he wrote the concert aria ''Bella mia fiamma.'' Josefa must have been a good singer: years later, she created Beethoven's ''Ah perfido!'' The airy, bright rooms of the villa are now a touching little Mozart -and Dusek - Museum. There is also a Dvorak Museum, in an elegant 18th-century villa in the Vinohrady quarter. But most moving of all is the Smetana Museum, housed in an old flour mill overlooking the Vltava, which most of us know best by its Austrian name, the Moldau. There, among old family photographs, faded letters and posters, you can see from the windows the churning rapids described in the tone poem. As you wander through the rooms of the museum, a tape of Smetana's music plays discreetly; by magic coincidence, I heard ''Vltava'' just as I was gazing down at the rushing water. In Prague you really do have the sensation that musicians are everywhere. Once I saw a uniformed army colonel return a salute with his right hand while carrying an instrument case with his left. On another occasion, I was talking with the charming wife of a distinguished violinist, and asked her if she, too, was a musician. ''Oh, no,'' she demurred, then added, as an afterthought: ''Naturally, I play the piano. Like everyone else.'' TAKING IN SIGHTS AND SOUNDS Events The Information Service of the city of Prague publishes a monthly pamphlet, available free at the grander hotels, listing all cultural events. (The list for the month I was there ran to 10 closely printed pages.) The office, centrally located at Na prikope 20 (telephone 544444), will also help with additional information. Getting information before you leave for Prague can be difficult, but you can try writing to the Information Service at Betlemske namesti 2. Tickets to musical events are cheap; the best seats at the opera cost about $1.50 at the official rate. Therefore, they are not always easy to find. If you are staying at one of the better hotels, such as the Intercontinental or the Alcron, the porter should be able to help. Even the thorough list provided by the Information Service is not absolutely complete. Fringe events sometimes elude its grasp, so keep an eye out for posters. The wooden fences along Narodni trida, just before you get to the National Theater, seem to have the greatest array of announcements. They are, of course, in Czech, but with a little enterprise you can figure out the words for concert, quartet, recital; the dates are usually given in figures, month first. There is a Spring Festival in Prague, generally from mid-May to early June, that features internationally renowned performers; last year's event had the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne and the violist Eugene Fodor as soloists. Shopping There are record shops all over the city, but for the foreign visitor the best is the Supraphon shop on Vinohradska, which stocks the export edition of most albums. Practically speaking, this means that the liner notes are in several languages (including English) and the opera librettos include a translation. Ask for Mrs. Eliasova. New printed music can be found at the music shop at Jungmannova ulice 30. For secondhand music, there is a shop at Na prikope 24. Czechoslovakia has an ancient tradition of instrument making. (Its Petroff pianos are excellent.) New instruments can be found at Jungmannovo namesti 17. Secondhand instruments are sold at Narodni trida 18. I saw in the window some amazingly inexpensive violins, but since I didn't (couldn't) try them out, I can't judge their condition or quality. Museums The Villa Bertramka was closed during a recent visit for restoration, but was scheduled to reopen shortly. It is closed on Monday. Hours are 1 to 4 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and 10 to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. In summer there are sometimes concerts given in the garden. There are occasional concerts also in the Dvorak Museum (open 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily except Monday) and the Smetana Museum (10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily except Tuesday). Admission to the museums is less than 50 cents. Dining Opera performances usually end before 10 P.M., so a number of restaurants are still open. Near the National Theater, in addition to the theater restaurant in the new building behind Nova Scena, there is the Klasterni Vinarna (Narodni 8), a wine restaurant. A hefty dinner with ample wine cost about $5. Visitors should also try to eat a meal in the Restaurant of the Smetana Hall, in the Municipal House. Its Art Nouveau frescoes and fittings have just been refurbished, and it glows with real old-fashioned Central European hospitality. A classic Czech meal featuring roast pork, dumplings and so on, with some full-bodied Russian (Georgian) wine, and preceded by a stimulating shot of Becherovka, an aperitif from Carlsbad, came to $8. Service is impeccable. - W. W.

571-> NEWS SUMMARY: MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 1987
International A2-9 Iran and Iraq got false U.S. data in recent years as intelligence agencies deliberately distorted information to further the Reagan Administration's goals in the region, sources said. Page A1 Iran said it opened a ''second stage'' of its offensive in the gulf war, firing missiles into the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Basra. Iran appeared to have established a beachhead of about four square miles. A1 Moscow's tilt toward Iraq over Iran seems to be increasing, according to Western and Arab diplomats and experts discussing Soviet pronouncements on the Iran-Iraq war that also accuse the United States of intensifying the war.

572-> ABOUT LONG ISLAND; WAITING ROOM LITERARY CLUES
THE sniffle season being in full flow, it is small wonder that the winter is turning out to be another festival of medicine in many homes. I myself, like any used car, have been in regular attendance for oil change, odd noises in the transmission, creakiness in gear shift and suggestions for getting more mileage with less fuel intake. Do not yawn in anticipation of another one of those stories of how a brave soul has triumphed over the common cold to win the annual dog-sled drag race, nor should you move to the edge of your seat in expectation of another diatribe against medical practice. That is not the thrust of today's musings. This is actually a literary piece, about the reading material I have gone through in doctors' waiting rooms and what they tell me about the medical man I am staking my future on. It appears to be put on the low tables in seemingly random order, ostensibly to help the patient pass the time while waiting for the healing ministrations. Perhaps these seemingly innocent offerings contain clues as to the doctor's personal outlook. Maybe they indicate the line the doctor - and dentists are included in this as well - will take in his approach to improving one's health. Waiting rooms are a good place for one to catch up not only with what may have been missed in print but with what one may never have intended to be abreast of. Nobody has weeded any of the magazine collections I've seen in medical offices, and one often finds vintage issues dating back to 1985. The National Geographic, it seems to me, was at one time a mandatory staple in the waiting room. When I was younger, it was at checkup time that I became acquainted with the ritual dances of half-clad natives on South Pacific atolls, briefings that prepared me for exotic datelines during World War II. The Geographic was standard waiting-room fare and did not tell you much about the doctor, except that his tastes reflected those of much of the population. My several medical advisers do not carry the Geographic. One of my specialists does stock travel magazines, including a line that features luxury cruises to places like the Antarctic and China and overland journeys to Tibet and innermost Africa. The advertisements sing of the joys of condominiums on the Costa del Sol and the Caribbean isles. He is obviously a man who likes travel, and I make sure that he has a competent colleague whom I may consult if an emergency should arrive while he is exploring New Guinea. I am pleased when I see one of those magazines that promote good restaurants and entertainment. This doctor understands that man does not live by celery alone and that croissants and bouillabaisse figure into the scheme of life. He will not harangue you about the need to lose weight, unless he feels it is specific to your case. On the other hand, I tremble when I notice that the table is loaded with copies of magazines that preach physical fitness, the nutritional magazines, the publications devoted to jogging and exercise and the absolute necessity of shaping the human body into a frighteningly perfect physical machine. From this doctor you can expect no mercy. His scale will offer no quarter, in terms of poundage, when it comes to demonstrating that you are in miserable condition. He will examine you with cold eyes and speak to you with the manner of a hanging judge. He will assign immediate and rigorous diets along with a regimen of exercise without which you may expect shortly to be passed along to specialists in last rites. I have noticed an increase in financial publications and I question whether these are proper for the eyes of people who are waiting and uncertain about how much of the visit will be covered by medical insurance. By the time one has thumbed through the biographical features about hard-driving executives who have clawed their way to the top and other articles warning you about measures you should take to ward off disaster in the forthcoming financial debacle that must surely be weathered before the economy bottoms off, the reader's blood pressure is guaranteed to have outstripped the market's rise. The same caution applies to the medical magazines that find their way into waiting rooms. These are often technical affairs whose language is too complex for the layman. They can only panic the casual reader, who shudders as he glances through the title headings and the diagrams illustrating the most recent methods of slicing up the large intestine. A sensitive patient whose eye has fastened on a paper that deals with catastrophes lurking in the same area of the body whose eruptions have brought him to the office cannot be in a tranquil frame of mind when he is brought to the inner sanctum and ordered to strip and await examination. It may be time to try new techniques in the waiting room. Television is not viable, because patients may find it divisive choosing a program. The same holds true for piped-in music. In one waiting room, I have been mesmerized by a peculiar sculpture, a glass construction in which masses of material move about turgidly, forming constantly changing patterns; it was so riveting that the nurse had to call my name twice when my turn arrived for examination. It was not a pleasant sculpture, and these churning images kept recurring in my mind as the doctor discussed my interior. Of course, there is one solution that could obviate all this. It would be, as in the case of one of my advisers, not to give you a waiting period of any substantial length at all. When I visit this man, I am usually whisked right inside before I have had time to do more than give the receptionist the medical form. There is some waiting between this test and that test, but I bring my own newspaper, magazine and book to read in these interims. There may be no answer to the problem, just as their seems to be no answer to the situations that find us waiting for trains, buses, test results, marriage and retirement. People wait to get into movies and good restaurants. It is perhaps incurable, although attempts have been made. The one I like best is one offered by a popular delicatessen I know that always has long lines waiting for tables. When long waits loom, the owner assuages those who wait with little crackers loaded with chopped liver. It's a good solution, but I can't imagine a waiting room stocked with health-care magazines giving it a whirl.

574-> AROUND THE GARDEN
This Week: If pots of daffodils, hyacinths or crocus are well rooted, bring a few indoors from the coldframe or basements to force flowers. . . Prune shade trees. . . . Examine fruit trees for rodent damage; use wire cylinders to protect bases from gnawing. Miniatures One plant fits in the palm of your hand. The leaves are clustered together and push up from a crown. Each is no longer than a baby spoon. The flowers are about the size of a quarter and the colors are cream, yellow, rose, orange or white. This relative newcomer is a miniature primrose and it's winning hearts everywhere. It is a scaled-down edition of the old-faithful English primrose (Primula vulgaris). Out on the West Coast, this miniature is popular as a bedding plant. On the East Coast, it is sparking windowsills now, but since it is hardy, the primrose can be planted out in the garden when the weather settles in late spring. The trick will be to keep the plant thriving until it can be set outdoors. But this should be easy. Provide a cool temperature, keep the soil moist, but not soggy and flower buds, hidden under the sturdy leaves, will continue to flower. Another miniature is also winning hearts. This one is a streptocarpus hybrid or more easily remembered, a Cape primrose. (This one is a gesneriad, however, and not related to primulas.) Unlike the type streptocarpus, which has enormously long and ungainly leaves, this scaled-down hybrid has compact foliage. The leaves are only five to six inches long and the modest flowers match them in scale. This new series has been named Olympus and was developed by Mikkelsen, wholesale growers in Ohio. The grower has given these new miniatures names to match including Adonis, Juno and Venus. Nine new ones have joined the series this year including Ariadne, Electra, Minerva and Pegasus. The flowers are beautiful in pastel shades with blushes of pink, lavender and magenta or bold colors such as purple, blue and pure white. Grow these miniature Cape primroses as you would African violets: an east window, moist, but never soggy soil and warmth away from chilly windowsills. Check the plants frequently for mealybug invasion or sometimes white flies. The miniature primulas are found in many retail sources in the metropolitan region, but the miniature streptocarpus are more difficult to track down. In Manhattan many florists should have them as well as Farm and Garden Nursery, Two Avenue of the Americas at White Street. In Westchester County both miniatures are stocked at Sprainbrook Nurseries, 448 Underhill Road, Scarsdale and Nable's Nurseries, Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains has the primulas. QUESTIONS/ANSWERS ASPARAGUS We have just moved into a new home and would like to begin an asparagus bed. What variety can best tolerate Michigan winters? F.M., Birmingham, Mich. Asparagus is an ancient crop and it will thrive in Michigan or anywhere that soil freezes. The newest method is to start plants from seed rather than crowns. Some of the best cultivars include Viking, Martha Washington and Jersey Giant.

576-> QUESTION BOX
QUESTION: How many players have been unanimous selections to baseball's Hall of Fame? It's never happened. In order to be chosen unanimously for enshrinement at Cooperstown, a player must be named on every ballot by those members of the Baseball Writers Association of America who vote in that year. The closest to perfection so far was Ty Cobb, one of the original five members of the Hall, who was named on ballots by 222 of the 226 voters in 1936, a 98.2 percentage. Others to come close were: Henry Aaron in 1982 with 406 of 415 for 97.8 percent; Honus Wagner and Babe Ruth in 1936, each with 215 of 226 for 95.1 percent, and Willie Mays in 1979 (409 of 432 for (94.6 percent). QUESTION: Did Granny Hamner ever hit .300 in the major leagues and did he have a brother who also played for the Philadelphia Phillies? No and yes. Hamner's highest season average in the majors was .299 for the Phillies in 1954, when he had 178 hits in 152 games while playing second base. He was the Phillies' regular shortstop from 1949-52 and at 23 years of age one of the chief ''Whiz Kids'' who won the pennant for Philadelphia in 1950. His brother Garvin, three years older, appeared in 21 games, all in 1945, at second base and shortstop, getting 20 hits and batting .198. Granny, who first appeared in the majors at 17 in 1944 and ended his career as an infielder with Cleveland in 1959, did lead the Phillies with a .429 average in the 1950 World Series, going 6 for 14 as the Phillies lost to the Yankees in four straight. He called it quits for good after attempting a comeback as a relief pitcher with the Kansas City Athletics in 1962. For his career of 1,531 games, Hamner averaged .262 with 104 home runs. His pitching career was less impressive: 0-2 with a 5.40 earned run average in seven games covering 13 innings. QUESTION: In a pro football game that is less than a minute from its conclusion, Team A appears to be in good shape to nail down a 19-14 victory. Even though he faces a third down and 20 situation on Team B's 40-yard line, the Team A quarterback decides on a pass play in the belief that he can either pick up enough yardage to position a field goal attempt that could raise his team's lead to an insurmountable 8 points or he could make the first down that will enable his team to run out the clock. But the rush by the defense is so swift and effective that his pass attempt is batted in the air, then caught near midfield by a Team B player, who has a clear field to the end zone for the points that would give Team B the victory. If the player rambles downfield with the interception followed only by his teammates, can he pause just before he crosses the goal line in order to take enough time off the clock that Team A will never get the ball again in the game? Or will the play be whistled dead when his forward progress stops? The clock would keep running in this example even if the runner didn't, so the delay-of-touchdown tactic would be a shrewd one as long as the player for Team B remembered to get across the goal line before game time expired. Although it seems contrary to the aim of the game, it's sometimes wise to make sure your opponent gets into the end zone as quickly as he can. A ball-carrier should always be pursued and never allowed to dawdle on his way to the end zone, for there's always the possibility that the runner will slip, or develop a cramp or even drop the ball (see: Jerry Rice, San Francisco vs. Giants, Jan. 4, 1987). QUESTION: Players on the winning team each get a ring for their Super Bowl victory, but what about members of the losing team? After they've finished wringing their hands, the losers earn rings for their fingers, too, but not for being runner-up in the game. The losers' rings celebrate the conference championship they won that carried them into the Super Bowl. The National Football League makes available $3,000 each toward a Super Bowl ring for 90 members of the winning organization, including coaches, assistants, trainers, front office personnel and any other members the organization deems deserving. For the Super Bowl loser, there is $1,500 available from the league per conference championship ring. If teams want to commemorate their achievments more extravagantly, they pay the difference, as the Chicago Bears did last year after they ran rings around the Patriots in the Super Bowl.

577-> 37 DEAD AS U.S. STRIVES TO ADJUST TO WINTER STORM
A blast of arctic air, trailing a blizzard that has been linked to 37 deaths, forced homeless people into shelters in the Northeast yesterday. Meanwhile, more snow fell on the Great Lakes area and freeze warnings went up in Florida. Overnight lows were below zero from eastern North Dakota across the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to the northern Ohio Valley and parts of northern New England. Meanwhile, there were storm watches from parts of Georgia and the Carolinas to southeast New York as a new snow storm was expected. The coldest temperature in the country yesterday was recorded at Warroad, Minn., at 45 degrees below zero, the National Weather Service said. International Falls, Minn., on the Canadian border, reached 35 below zero. Citrus growers in central Florida used irrigation equipment to protect fruit from temperatures that were expected to fall into the middle- to upper-20's, but experts forecast little damage. Shelters Opened in Georgia Relief agencies in Savannah, Ga., a city unaccustomed to such chilly temperatures, opened emergency shelters for the homeless after the existing shelters filled to capacity. A storm brought rain and snow to the Pacific Coast. The forecast called for up to a foot of snow by midday across the northern mountains of California. Ice combined with Lake Michigan's rising waters to cause a flood in a Chicago synagogue Friday. The ice clogged portholes in the sea wall that normally protects Temple Emanuel from high waves, allowing up to eight inches of water to collect inside. Sabbath services had to be moved to a community hall. The storm has been linked to 17 deaths in Pennsylvania, most from shoveling snow; five in North Carolina; three in Tennessee, Connecticut and Maryland; two in New York, and one each in Alabama, South Carolina, Massachusetts and Delaware. #11 DEGREES IN NEW YORK CITY In New York City, the temperature dropped to 11 degrees at 11 P.M. yesterday, according to the National Weather Service. The record low for the date was 6 degrees below zero in 1882 and the high was 61 in 1977. Complaints of inadequate heat in homes rose sharply yesterday in New York City, to 2,086 between 12:01 A.M. and 2 P.M., from 1,732 for all of Friday, according to a spokesman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

578-> U.S. OFFICIAL URGES A RIVERFRONT DEVELOPMENT PLAN
In a major policy shift, the region's chief Federal environmental official has proposed that a comprehensive plan for development on New York City's riverfronts be devised to avoid ''environmental gridlock.'' The proposal by the regional administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Christopher J. Daggett, effectively called for an end to the case-by-case approach the agency now takes in considering commercial and residential development along the Hudson and East Rivers. There are 59 riverfront projects planned or under construction by public and private developers in New York and New Jersey, drastically changing the shoreline. According to Mr. Daggett, without comprehensive planning, the rivers' natural resources could be harmed and there would continue to be long delays for developers. In a speech last week to the New York Water Pollution Control Association and in a later interview, Mr. Daggett said Federal, state and city agencies should devise a plan that would establish guidelines for how much acreage could be developed and how much left as protected coast or wetlands. Each developer's proposal could then be measured against the plan, he said, significantly reducing the two- and three-year delays that developers now face in securing Federal permission to build. In the past, Mr. Daggett has generally required builders to agree to protect as many acres of wetlands as they develop. Mr. Daggett's plan - which could set the stage for a fight between New York and New Jersey developers over how much space each side of the Hudson River would be allowed - was rejected by developers and cheered, with reservations, by environmental advocates. The proposal came a week after a state panel advocated development along the New York side of the Hudson ''on a suitably restrained scale.'' The panel, the West Side Task Force, also suggested that a new agency be formed to manage development along the Hudson from the Battery to 59th Street. Its recommendations are being reviewed by Governor Cuomo. Also, the city's Department of Planning is preparing a study that is to lead to waterfront-zoning recommendations this spring. An Innovative Official In New York, 32 major riverfront developments are under construction or being planned, including about 39,000 residential units, 21 million square feet of office space and 1,500 hotel rooms. In New Jersey, along an 18-mile-long strip at the foot of the Palisades from the George Washington Bridge to Bayonne, there are 27 projects, including 22,300 residential units, 13 million square feet of office space, 2,950 hotel rooms and 5,000 boat slips. Mr. Daggett is widely known as one of the nation's most innovative environmental officials and played a critical role in the decade-long battle that led the state to abandon the $2 billion Westway highway and development project. Although Mr. Daggett's recommendation to deny a landfill permit for the project was not followed by officials in Washington, environmental advocates eventually prevailed in the courts, echoing Mr. Daggett's argument that the landfill would harm the river's striped bass population. ''We simply can't keep looking at these projects one at a time or we will continue to run into situations like Westway,'' Mr. Daggett said in his speech. ''I'm not saying, 'Stop all work until such time as we do this,' '' Mr. Daggett said in the later interview. ''The potential exists for completing this process in a far more comprehensive and timely fashion than if you go at this one project at a time.'' Plan Called a Mistake But developers said the time consumed by devising the plan would slow the approval process for some of the major waterfront developments now being planned. ''It's a mistake to look at that type of a master plan,'' said the president of the city's Public Development Corporation, James Stuckey. The agency is developing 13 projects that would require construction of platforms in the Hudson and East Rivers. By putting an ''arbitrary'' ceiling on development, Mr. Stuckey said, Mr. Daggett's plan might force large companies that wish to expand in the city to move elsewhere. New Jersey's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Richard T. Dewling, endorsed Mr. Daggett's suggestion, saying, ''Developmental anarchy is impossible to undo.'' The director of the New York Clean Air Campaign, Marcy Benstock, called Mr. Daggett's proposal ''tremendously exciting.'' But she cautioned that by asking environmental agencies to work closely with developmental agencies in drawing the plan ''it raises questions of the foxes guarding the hen coop.'' In his speech and in the interview, Mr. Daggett suggested that a task force be formed among Federal, state and city agencies to draw up the plan, with comments from scientists, environmental group and business leaders. He said he would be sending a letter to the agencies by February. Mr. Daggett's proposal is modeled on the approach his agency has adopted with regard to the Hackensack Meadowlands, which spread across 17 New Jersey communities.

580-> GOING OUT GUIDE
NEW NEIGHBORS IN THE BRONX The news from the Bronx is that there has not only been a modest influx of new residents, but also that they have moved into spanking new housing. New developments have unfolded at the Bronx Zoo, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, for this latest bloc of Bronxites: eight slender-tailed meerkats. A meerkat, you should know, is a small African mongoose. Meerkats seem suited for city life because they live in colonies with members serving as security guards against predators. The newcomers have been settled in a new exhibit in the Carter Giraffe Building of the African Plains, at the zoo's southernmost section. The new exhibit comes close to reproducing the Kalahari desert in southwestern Africa, a native habitat for meerkats, although these meerkats hail from California's San Diego Zoo, where they were born. The meerkat exhibit sports a dirt floor with three termite mounds and stage lights that approximate the warmth of the African sun. Zoo hours: 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily. Admission: Fridays through Mondays $1.75 and children under 12, 75 cents; Tuesdays through Fridays, by donation. Parking, $3. Information: 367-1010. CINEMATIC RETROSPECTIVE The people running Film Forum 2, at 57 Watts Street, north of Canal Street near Avenue of the Americas (431-1590), have put together a package of 27 films you should already have seen at least once. ''Rediscovering World Cinema'' begins this weekend and continues through Feb. 26. The features have all been made within the last 35 years and are being screened in original, uncut 35-millimeter versions. Films in other languages have English subtitles rather than dubbing, the despair of some cinemaphiles. Today's films are to be Bertolucci's 1971 ''The Conformist,'' based on the Alberto Moravia novel, showing at 4, 7:40 and 11 P.M., and Truffaut's 1962 ''Shoot the Piano Player,'' at 2:15 P.M. Tomorrow, Marcel Carne's World War II epic, ''Children of Paradise,'' at 1, 4:30 and 8 P.M., and Monday at 4:30 and 8 P.M. Other directors represented include Bergman, Kurosawa, DeSica, Herzog, Fellini and Bunuel. Other films to be shown include ''Mr. Hulot's Holiday,'' ''Jules and Jim,'' ''The Bicycle Thief,'' ''Cries and Whispers,'' ''Fitzcarraldo'' and ''Amarcord.'' Admission: $5. WHISTLING AT WORK While patrons of the Eagle Tavern, 355 West 14th Street (924-0275), wet their whistles at the bar in front tonight, Joan Madden will be blowing hers in the backroom, where Irish concerts are a staple. Ms. Madden is the American All-Ireland champion flute and tin whistle player whose father, Joe Madden, was the same sort of champ on the accordion. The tin whistle is a six-hole metal tube that, in the hands of the novice, is often too shrill for musical ears but, in the hands and mouth of an expert, can become an addictive listening experience. Ms. Madden will be accompanied by Mary Coogan, a guitarist. At 9 and 10:30 P.M. Admission: $5. HOMELESS FILM IN BROOKLYN The condition of the homeless, which has been an acute problem of late, has really been an age-old affliction reflected in art and literature the world over. This is one of the messages of ''The Homeless Film Festival'' at St. Ann's, the church at 157 Montague Street, at Clinton Street, in the Brooklyn Heights section. The half-dozen movies, each to be shown at 8 P.M., are dedicated to the plight of the homeless and tell stories of those who have found themselves without shelter. Tonight's feature is a 1985 French film, ''Vagabond,'' by Agnes Varda. It follows a young woman, played by Sandrine Bonnaire, headed for nowhere in her wanderings. Next Friday, Henning Carlsen's 1966 drama, ''Hunger,'' tells of a starving author's last days. Next Saturday, in a double feature, the festival presents the Maysles brothers' ''Grey Gardens,'' a 1976 film and a true story of a mother and daughter in a decaying seaside mansion. It will be shown with ''Squatters: the Other Philadelphia Story,'' Charles Koppelman's 1984 documentary about a single mother and the squatters' movement. On Friday, Feb. 13, ''Sullivan's Travels,'' the 1941 classic by Preston Sturges, has Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake on the road in pursuit of ''the common man.'' The series is completed Saturday, Feb. 14, with F. W. Murnau's 1924 German silent film, ''The Last Laugh.'' Admission: $4. Box office: 718-834-8794.

581-> WESTCHESTER OPINION; LEGALLY BLAMELESS, BUT ACCIDENT-PRONE
THE bare facts are, I got in the car and just as I was passing my next-door neighbor's driveway, wham, slam! she backed up, bang into the side of my car. What a way to meet. I had not seen Kathie since she went off to college. Shaken up as I was, I could not help noticing what a pretty woman she had turned out to be. And I told her so. ''Kathie, are you hurt? I'm so glad. What a way to meet after all these years.'' She got off lucky - only her back bumper was knocked off. My car? One side of my shiny new Saab was crumpled and caved into a crescent. But I was able to drive it to the collision shop and left it there for a complete face-lifting. Taking me home, Dominick, the collision man, the one with the black curled-down mustache and the accent I could not identify (Italian, Greek or Yugoslav?), asked me, ''Whose fault was it?'' Immediately I felt guilty, even though I was ready to take an oath in any court in the land that I was innocent, that I was driving prudently, not too fast, not too slow and, much as I liked her, that it was Kathie's fault. But the sense of guilt lingered and I chewed on it at home. Was I not in a hurry to get to the bank before it closed? I could have been driving pretty fast, and how could she see me around the bend in the road? Was I not in a car accident only three years ago? Whose fault was that? There I was driving on a dark, dismal drizzly night and starting to turn off Route 133 into my own lane, when bang, a pick-up truck plowed into my left rear corner and spun the Saab completely around. My car, carrying me and my son, Paul, narrowly missed a huge oak tree. The other vehicle's insurance company paid the $7,000 repair bill. But again I felt guilty. Why? Well, Paul and I were talking at the moment of impact; in fact, having a rousing good argument about his stubborn refusal to let me plan his life for him now that he had graduated from college. I may have been distracted and signaled my left turn too late. Guilt! And how about the time on route 172, in broad daylight, when a lovely white-tailed deer sprang across my path and I drove smack into him, breaking his two hind legs, and he had to be destroyed. Taking out his service revolver, the police officer shot the suffering animal in front of me, but I turned my eyes away. Guilty, I felt guilty of murder even though, God knows, I was in no way to blame. Couldn't the stupid beast wait a half second while I shot by at 50? With an effort I reached back to the time I was living in Shenorock on the banks of the Amawalk in Westchester. A beautiful summer day, I was driving down to the lake to go swimming. The air was racing, by refreshing and fragrant, when a hornet stung me on the forehead. I clapped my right hand on the critter, releasing the steering wheel, and this time I hit a tree, totaled the car and came out of the hospital with 17 stitches across my chin. Of course, I felt guilty. I should have been aware of the hornet banging against the side window trying to get out and buzzing angrier and angrier. The only time I could remember an accident where I felt no hint of blame was way, way back when I was a kid on the East Side. I was driving my bike ''nunnies,'' with my hands off the handlebars and leaning far out to the right in order to balance the bike, a hand-me-down I had inherited from my rich cousin Ikey from Hoboken, N.J. The bike insisted, because of a skewed wheel fork, on turning to the left. Riding proudly down Henry Street, showing off before Malvina, my secret love, and her boyfriend whose name I forget, I skidded and fell ignominiously right in front of them. I can still hear Malvina's High C laughter and her friend's raucous harmony. I got up, my pants torn, my hands and knees bruised, pretending, so what? But inwardly I was humiliated. Humiliated, but certainly no sense of guilt attached. Anyone could see, who wasn't biased, that the bike was crooked to begin with, and all my friends knew I was the best nunnies rider on the block. As for the crack in the asphalt that caused the bike to spill, who could I blame, City Hall? This is the only instance I could remember where I felt no guilt, but that was long ago during the age of innocence. So these are the bare facts, but I ask myself, is that enough to establish guilt or innocence? If so many accidents happen to a man, even if on the evidence he is free of liability or culpability, could it be there is something deep within him that brings these accidents about? He may be accident prone, the psychologist says. He is star-crossed, the astrologer says. He is being punished for his sins, the theologian solemnly declares. But what do I think? If I drive across a bridge and the bridge breaks under the weight of my car, should I blame myself? Were I to survive I would not look on the naked facts alone. I would probably immediately get together with a compatible psychologist, astrologer or theologian to look at the circumstances in depth. Was I observant enough before I got on the bridge? Perhaps there was a warning sign I overlooked. Obviously, if I was the last straw that broke the bridge's back, surely that is a circumstance that may or may not call for a judgment of guilt, or blame, or innocence. What do you think?

582-> REAGAN OFFICIALS DEBATE AIDS EDUCATION POLICY
Education Secretary William J. Bennett and Dr. C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States, expressed divergent opinions today on the role of schools in combating the spread of AIDS. In separate remarks, they also disagreed over the advice the Federal Government should offer local school districts on the usually fatal disease. Mr. Bennett said in an interview that school districts, in consultation with parents, should decide what information on AIDS they should offer and to what age groups. But Dr. Koop, in a speech to the United States Conference of Mayors, said sex education programs offered in junior high schools were too little and too late, adding, ''I personally would urge that the material be presented earlier, among 9, 10, 11-year-olds.'' Domestic Policy Council Accord The two officials' disagreement dates to the publication last October of the Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS education has been the subject of two recent meetings of the Reagan Administration's Domestic Policy Council, which reached a consensus on the issue this week. According to Administration officials, the council agreed that Federal agencies should provide information on AIDS to local officials and leave decisions on dissemination to them. But Mr. Bennett said in the interview today that AIDS education should be ''value-based,'' aimed at teaching abstinence as the key to protection. As a parent, Mr. Bennett said, he would oppose AIDS education being offered before schoolchildren reach the eighth or ninth grade. He added that, given the ''morally ambiguous materials'' that has been used in sex education classes, he would probably prefer to have the schools leave his child's AIDS education to him. Moral Values Stressed ''With AIDS, harsh nature becomes the unwitting ally of responsible morality,'' Mr. Bennett continued, asserting that AIDS education, like sex education, requires a firm foundation of moral values. Dr. Koop maintained in his report that AIDS education should begin ''at the lowest grade possible,'' and that the threat of an epidemic demanded a sex education curriculum with ''a heavy emphasis on prevention of AIDS.'' In his remarks today, however, the Surgeon General appeared to be trying to accommodate Mr. Bennett's position, asserting that ''community standards'' should be taken into account and that ''developmental age'' was more important than ''chronological age.'' Gary L. Bauer, Under Secretary of Education, who attended a Domestic Policy Council meeting on AIDS education last week and another this week, declined to comment on what had transpired, but he said, ''The Administration's position is clear.'' ''The Federal Government should supply the latest health information to local officials,'' Mr. Bauer said. ''They ought to work with parents to determine how and when to introduce that information into the classroom. That education should be value-based and teach children first and foremost to abstain from sex.'' Another official familiar with the situation said the disagreement between the agencies had arisen from the perception last fall that Dr. Koop wanted to write a national curriculum for schools to use in fighting AIDS. Dr. Koop could not be reached for comment after his speech today. Information gathered by the Conference of Mayors last month from 73 of the nation's largest local school districts and from 25 state school agencies found that 54 percent of them were offering some form of AIDS education to public school students. Focus on Older Students According to the survey, which was made public today, most AIDS education programs focus on students in Grades 7 through 12. ''As called for in the Surgeon General's report, a small number of schools presently offer or are planning AIDS education programs at the elementary school level,'' the survey said. ''At this level, information about AIDS is taught on a very general level and does not cover the specifics of transmission of the disease, high-risk behavior or precautions to take in avoiding AIDS.'' Another report released today, by the Education Research Group, found that more than 50 percent of school administrators responding to a recent survey on teen-age pregnancy said birth control should be offered to students as part of school-based health services. Ninety-six percent of the officials said their districts did not provide contraceptive services for students. Thirty percent of those calling for such services to curb the problem of teen-age pregnancies said parental permission should be required, but 27 percent said they would favor such services even without parental permission. In the interview today, Mr. Bennett said he would strongly oppose efforts by schools to provide contraceptives to students. To do so, he said, would encourage interest in sexual activity and would make it appear that school officials condone it.

583-> REAGAN PRESSES FOR ARMS REQUEST
President Reagan said today that the United States approached the current round of the arms talks with a ''sense of anticipation'' and asked Congress to support the Administration's military spending request. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Reagan said the American military buildup had enabled the United States to deal with the Soviet Union from ''a position of strength'' in the arms talks. The latest round of the talks in Geneva began this week. The appointment of a new chief Soviet negotiator, Yuli M. Vorontsov, has prompted increased interest in the current round. But it is not yet clear exactly how the appointment of Mr. Vorontsov will affect the negotiations. Mr. Vorontsov told Max M. Kampelman, the chief American negotiator, on Thursday that he would not be present for the entire negotiating round and that he intended to travel back and forth between Geneva and Moscow. No Major U.S. Change The United States has not made any substantial changes in its negotiating position, officials said. An official said instructions to the American negotiators still called for a ban on long-range mobile missiles. The White House has been considering whether to lift its insistence on the ban. Mr. Reagan has proposed a budget of $312 billion for military spending for the fiscal year 1988. Last year, Congress appropriated $282 billion for the Defense Department. Mr. Reagan said Congress should support his request to insure that spending on the military is ''adequate and steady.'' He complained that the pattern of increases and cuts had spawned inefficiencies in military spending and had turned the military budget into ''a kind of crazy roller coaster.''

585-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; When West Is East
IN the gospel according to Rudyard Kipling, East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet. But then Rudyard Kipling was never in Giants Stadium when the wind was blowing. Yesterday the twain met. Yesterday east was west and west was east. And with a 17-0 victory over the Washington Redskins, the Giants rode that wind into Super Bowl XXI against the Denver Broncos. In the gray gloom of the 4 o'clock kickoff, winds of 17 to 23 miles per hour with gusts up to 30 m.p.h. were howling across the parking lots from the Pennsylvania border. But in the aerodynamics of Giants Stadium, those winds dipped over the western rim, slammed into the stands at the eastern end and careered back whence they came. Up on the western rim, flapping flags were flattened toward the east. But above the artificial surface, papers swirled toward the west. ''It was,'' Bill Parcells, the Giants' coach, would say later, ''the toughest wind we've played in since I've been here.'' It was the toughest wind a Giants team has played in since the 1962 team lost the National Football League championship game to the Green Bay Packers, 16-7, at Yankee Stadium. That day Y. A. Tittle talked about how his passes swerved ''like a diving duck.'' But this time the Giants won, because they scored 17 quick points after they had won the coin toss. Or rather, after the Redskins had lost it. ''They called it,'' said Harry Carson, the Giants' defensive captain who was out at midfield with six Redskin co-captains. ''They called tails and it came up heads.'' The coin used by Referee Pat Haggerty was an oversized silver coin. The heads side was an Indian, tails was a buffalo. And Russ Grimm's call was for the buffalo instead of the Indian. Moments earlier, Parcells had reminded Carson: ''The wording is very important. If we win the toss, we're going to defend that goal,'' meaning the east goal. Naturally, the Redskins then chose to receive. But the Giants kicked off with the wind and when their offense got the ball, it had the wind at its back. ''I knew we had to score early,'' Phil Simms said later. ''The wind's velocity was horrendous. You could feel it on your face.'' Bill Parcells had felt it on his face when he arrived at Giants Stadium shortly after 7 o'clock yesterday morning. ''I went out on the field around 8 o'clock, and three or four times after that,'' the coach said. ''I kept calling the Weather Bureau every so often, that recording. That voice kept saying the same thing - the temperature was going to be in the 30's, with winds gusting from 15 to 25 miles an hour, maybe over 25. I called so often I feel like I know that guy.'' But with or against the wind, the Giants rolled to a 17-0 lead. With the wind in the first quarter, Raul Allegre kicked a 47-yard field goal and Phil Simms found Lionel Manuel in the end zone with an 11-yard touchdown pass. Against the wind in the second quarter, Mark Bavaro turned a short pass into a 30-yard gain to the Redskin 16-yard line, Simms bootlegged round left end for 7 yards to the 1, then Joe Morris swept right end for the touchdown. Simms had accomplished what he set out to do -score early. At that point, Simms had completed 7 of 11 passes, including 5 of his first 7 with the wind. He would finish with 7 completions in 14 attempts for 90 yards, misfiring on his only two passes in the second half. ''Once we got the lead,'' Simms said, ''we sort of choked down our offense.'' Simms had more respect for the Giants Stadium wind than Jay Schroeder, the Redskin quarterback, did. At a Friday news conference, Simms had talked about how ''the wind is the big problem in our stadium. Once it gets to be above 20 miles an hour, it gets to be a factor.'' Schroeder, in contrast, minimized the wind, saying: ''You just throw the ball with more velocity and get the nose down. Other than that, I consider it no problem.'' But as he learned, it was a problem. ''For 15 yards, I could throw,'' Schroeder said later. ''Beyond that, for the receivers it was like catching a knuckleball.'' Too often, Schroeder threw long and longer with the wind, only to overthrow his receivers. Of his 50 passes, he completed only 20 for 195 yards, but when he began throwing shorter passes, the Redskins didn't have enough time to win and the Giants still had too much defense to lose. ''They had a couple long passes,'' said Bill Belichick, the Giants' defensive coordinator, ''that had they hit 'em, they could've made it close.'' But with or against the wind, the Redskins didn't hit those passes. Upstairs, the Giants' tabernacle choir was chanting, ''Dex-ter, Dex-ter,'' a reminder to Dexter Manley, the Redskins' noisy all-pro defensive end, that he had vowed to ''get even'' for not having had a sack when the Giants defeated the Redskins in Washington. He didn't have a sack yesterday, either. ''I feel I was a non-factor,'' Manley said. ''I felt I was invisible.'' Much more visible was the slogan scrawled on the chalkboard in the Giants' meeting room before the game. ''Remember,'' it said, ''This Is Our House.'' Next to it, scrawled after the game, was, ''66-3, 2 Weeks,'' a reference to the Giants' combined score over the San Francisco 49ers and the Redskins in winning the National Conference title. ''This is a stupid question,'' Bill Parcells asked, ''but who won the Denver-Cleveland game?'' The Giants' coach had been too wrapped up in the cocoon of his game to know that the Broncos will be the Super Bowl XXI opponent out there in Pasadena, also known now as East Rutherford West. But Rudyard Kipling wouldn't understand that either.

587-> O'ROURKE PUTS BLAME FOR CUTS ON DEMOCRATS
COUNTY Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke signed the 1987 budget last week but not without warning that he was holding Democratic legislators responsible for eliminating an estimated 55 county jobs that would require ''some cuts in operational services performed by the county.'' He said he was ''sorry'' that the Board of Legislators had ''cut back on the Hudson River Museum and the Council for the Arts, because they are quality-of-life issues for Westchester, and especially sorry they cut back on Youth Services because it's the wave of the future.'' Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican, said he thought the Republican majority ''did a good honest job of trying to cut back the budget in the face of the political flack they were taking from the Democrats,'' who made an issue this year of the ''phantom army'' of more than 900 unfilled but financed positions. ''The Democrats also voted against child care, against the aged, against youth and against the budget in general,'' he said. ''I intend to campaign against them personally in this next election,'' Mr. O'Rourke vowed, saying, ''I'm going to get out there and tell people exactly what they represent.'' Audrey G. Hochberg, a Scarsdale Democrat who took a leading role in this year's budget debate, said she would welcome Mr. O'Rourke's role in this year's county legislative campaign because, she said, it was the Democrats in some cases who backed Mr. O'Rourke's spending plan against Republican cutbacks. ''The Democrats wanted to maintain the full $100,000 appropriation for Youth Services and the Republicans succeeded in cutting it out, and that's why we voted against the budget,'' she said. Legislator John W. DeMarco of White Plains was the only one of six Democrats on the 17-member Board who voted for the budget. Mrs. Hochberg said: ''We even voted to restore some of the funding for the Hudson River Museum,'' where Mr. O'Rourke's proposed $975,000 allocation was cut to $500,000. ''We were willing to support it at $630,000, which was the 1986 appropriation, but the Republicans voted to reduce it to $500,000 and to say it should be phased out.'' The Democrat said that ''looking at the big picture, Mr. O'Rourke's budget contained a broken promise to the public, in that he had said we'd institute early retirement and use it as a way of reducing the county's work force.'' Instead, she said, he increased it by 32 jobs. ''We had an opportunity to reduce it by 400 jobs without damaging the county's ability to provide services.'' Mr. O'Rourke, as well as Edward J. Brady, the Thornwood Republican and Chairman of the Board, and Leonard N. Spano, Republican of Yonkers and Chairman of the Budget Committee, had argued in favor of retaining the unfilled jobs, both as a necessary element in staff fluctuations in a county work force of more than 8,000 and as a means of providing a fiscal surplus for unexpected expenses. ''Those jobs are in the budget,'' the County Executive said, referring to the 55 positions cut from the budget, ''because they are intended to be filled.'' Opponents of maintaining the unfilled positions say many unfilled jobs had been vacant since March, indicating that their elimination would not reduce efficiency. Mr. O'Rourke said he regretted that the Hudson River Museum did not have a ''constituency'' on the Board of Legislators. ''They don't appreciate the fact that this great countywide museum is very important.'' He said he would continue to do his best for the museum while ''hoping that what the Board said about cutting it down every year is not true.'' Joyce Green, Chairman of the Board of the Hudson River Museum, said the board of directors would meet Thursday to decide what to do about the reduced financing and the prospect of the institution being eventually phased out as a recipient of county funds. ''We have several options,'' she said. ''One is to close, another is to close partially and the third is to close the planetarium on July 4,'' when the museum's new fiscal year begins. ''Closing a planetarium is a serious matter in a county that prides itself on being a good place to live.'' Mrs. Green said that the museum had recently purchased a new Zeiss ''star machine'' for $450,000. ''We raised the money for it, but were looking to the county for operating money, about $250,000,'' she said. The museum's $1.6 million budget, she said, would represent $500,000 from the county, $400,000 from Yonkers, where it is located, $260,000 from foundations, $200,000 from corporations and the rest from individuals and other sources. Mrs. Green said they noticed in last year's budget that the Board said it would phase out its support for the museum, ''but we thought they were saying they wanted us to work hard, and we did.'' Now, she indicated, the museum will have to plan for such a phaseout. The reduction and possible elimination of funds will create new difficulties in seeking help from corporations, some of which ''say they'll hold off until they see what the county does,'' she said, and in finding a new director for the institution. ''We have several fine candidates, but with this slap in the face I don't know if they'll want to come.'' Christopher Bruhl, the executive director of the Council for the Arts in Westchester, said that while the $285,000 allocated by the Board was a reduction from the $495,000 requested by Mr. O'Rourke, it represented an increase over the $270,375 provided for last year. ''The impact is in lost opportunities, rather than in losing organizations,'' he said. ''Arts financing is complicated,'' he said, ''with the box office providing 50 to 60 percent of the cost of putting on a program and contributions and government grants doing the rest.'' As audience demand increases, and that is the situation in Westchester, he said, ''it becomes necessary that all parts of the pie get bigger.'' He said the that new or refurbished facilities in Peekskill, Tarrytown, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham and other areas were stimulating greater audience demand, ''but bigger audiences only make you go broke faster unless you have other sources of financing.'' He said the county's financing for next year ''won't mean doors will be shutting, but we won't see new ones opening.'' The Hudson River Museum once received funds from the Arts Council, ''roughly about $30,000 a year for a decade,'' he said, ''until Yonkers pulled out and the county stepped in.'' It received $600,000 to $700,000 in county funds in recent years, he noted, which was about 40 percent of its budget. The Arts Council's $270,000 went to 65 arts organizations, representing 3 percent of a combined budget of $9 million. ''It's all a question of scale,'' Mr. Bruhl said. Ann Spaeth, Executive Director of Family Information and Referral Services Teams, as well as convener of the Youth Services Coalition, said she was deeply disappointed that the Board had failed to provide the $100,000 requested by Mr. O'Rourke for the agencies needing help. ''Last year, we tried for $250,000 and it was eliminated; now the $100,000 was killed,'' she said. ''They're afraid of setting a precedent, especially during times of belt-tightening, but they don't recognize that it's sorely needed.'' She said it was the ''norm'' for counties to provide money and that, in fact, ''it's the state's intention to match county funds.'' Mrs. Spaeth said that ''we were addressing specific contracts of service'' in such areas as teen-age pregnancies, suicide and drug prevention, children of single-parent families, programs for latchkey children and problems associated with disenfranchised families. The county, she said, ''had been blessed with agencies such as Boy's Clubs and the Y's that have been able to operate programs as a sideline, but everybody's missions are more specific now and the problems are greater.'' It required sophisticated staffing, for example, to deal with multi-problem families, she said. The more than 50 organizations involved in providing or supporting these services have already started working on gaining support for another effort to encourage county funds for youth services, she said, and that would include efforts to gain support from town supervisors. Leaders of the Board's Republican majority had cited comments by Supervisor Charles G. DiGiacomo, Republican of Cortlandt, in turning down the Youth Services allocation, recalling that he said in testifying before the Board that the Youth Bureau's work was a ''duplication of efforts at the local level.'' Mrs. Spaeth said the state money that would match county funds ''would not be available to the towns; the state law says it must be used for countywide efforts.'' Mr. DiGiacomo, who had appeared before the legislators as part of a bipartisan panel of supervisors recommending budget reductions, said that the Board ''resented our appearance before them; we could feel it.'' He said he thought there would now be an ''ongoing dialogue between us.'' ''We are charged by law with collecting the county taxes, and as long as we have to do that they can rest assured that we'll say something about it,'' he said. The supervisors' principal interest this year, he said, had been to seek some reduction in the number of vacant jobs carried by the county government. ''We're pleased they responded to us and to other people,'' he said.

588-> 'The Common Good'
To the Editor: Peter Steinfels' review of Marcus G. Raskin's book ''The Common Good'' (Nov. 23) entirely missed the point. His major complaint - that Mr. Raskin failed to address possible ''ideologically conservaVive'' challenges to his proposals - ignored the fact that Mr. Raskin has developed a set of concrete alternatives for a more just and democratic America. Mr. Raskin's proposals offer a vision and a hope in a period when young people like myself are questioning what democracy is all about. KATHERINE ROBERTS New York

591-> INVESTIGATORS SEEK TO SOLVE MANY PUZZLES IN HOTEL FIRE
Investigators tried today to narrow the search for answers to the many puzzling questions concerning the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel. On one question at least, Federal arson investigators said that no evidence of structural damage consistent with a bomb had been uncovered. The possibility of a planted bomb was uppermost in the minds of many hotel guests who reported hearing two or three ''explosions'' emanating from the hotel in the first minutes of the fire. The police said today that they had been warned of a bomb threat or other form of assault at the hotel on Wednesday, just 90 minutes before the fire broke out. But the comments of the Federal investigators seemed to cast doubt on that theory. Three days after the fire, many other questions remain unanswered over the sequence of events leading up to the calamity, its cause and what transpired in the fateful minutes after it was first discovered. Arson or Negligence? At the heart of the mystery is whether the fire was set or if it was an accident, one perhaps caused by negligence. If it was set, what was the motive and what consequence was desired? If it was by negligence, what conditions contributed to it and what individuals could be held liable as a basis of claims against the hotel's designers or its owners? Political terrorism by anti-American, pro-independence groups has generally been directed against government and military installations or personnel in Puerto Rico, not average citizens or tourists. Yet Puerto Rican terrorists have been behind indiscriminate acts of terrorism on the mainland United States, most notably the January 1974 lunchtime bombing of the Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan in which five patrons were killed and 80 injured. Political and tourism leaders in Puerto Rico have been quick to say there was no political motive behind the Dupont Plaza disaster. But Federal investigators will not discount a possible link until they have a chance to take a close look at the bitter labor dispute at the hotel. Investigators will almost certainly want to question Jorge Farinacci, a San Juan lawyer who was negotiating a labor contract with the hotel on behalf of Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 250 of the hotel's workers. Was at Meeting at Hotel Mr. Farinacci was at a meeting of about 100 union members in the hotel's beach-level ballroom at 3 o'clock Wednesday afternoon to discuss a last-minute contract offer before a midnight strike deadline, according to the hotel management. Mr. Farinacci is currently free on $1 million bail after his indictment in 1985 on a Federal charge growing out of the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Conn. Twelve other defendants in that case have been linked to Los Macheteros, described by Federal officials as a Puerto Rican terrorist outfit. Los Macheteros has taken responsibility for several terrorist attacks, including the 1979 machinegun attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico that killed two sailors and wounded 10 others. Mr. Farinacci has denied any connections with terrorists. ''We want this fire to be investigated as fully as possible since we are dealing with a national tragedy,'' Mr. Farinacci said today. ''Only a madman would deliberately do something like this.'' Dupont Plaza officials said the fire broke out in the downstairs ballroom immediately after the close of the union meeting, in which last-minute negotiating strategy had been discussed. Bomb threats, work slowdowns and other acts of harassment have been tactics employed against hotels in past Puerto Rican labor disputes that have dragged on beyond the normal arbitration process and deteriorated into enmity, distrust and conspiracy. These tactics are designed to place economic pressure on the hotel to settle the dispute or suffer the consequences when guests complain about bad service or fear that their personal safety is being compromised. Chronic Shortage of Towels A guest who survived the Dupont Plaza fire said that in the week preceding it he and others had been made acutely aware of the labor dispute and the impending New Year's strike deadline. Many guests recalled a chronic shortage of towels, which could have been a result of a work slowdown or just a condition of what happens when a 423-room hotel is fully booked in a holiday week. ''Some of the other guests wanted us to complain to the management to bring pressure to settle the strike,'' said Jerry Kipnis, a 30-year-old psychiatric resident from Milwaukee. Other guests said they had heard dark hints of trouble from the staff. ''People wanted to check out and go to other hotels, but everything else was fully booked,'' said Christine Ryan, a Manhattan designer of financial software. Many people interviewed since the fire reported that the union had predicted trouble on New Year's Eve at the hotel. In fact, radio commercials and handbills paid for by the union gently advised guests and others planning to attend the New Year's Eve ball in the penthouse restaurant on top of the 22-story structure that labor problems at the hotel meant they could not expect to get quality service or entertainment in return for their money that night. There was no menacing tone to the messages, according to those familiar with them. What was menacing was two earlier fires - one on the evening of Dec. 27 and one the following afternoon - that appeared to have been set. The fire on Dec. 28 was discovered among furniture stored in a ninth-floor room, according to guests, and it disrupted the hotel and prevented many guests from returning to their rooms until later that night. There are conflicting reports as to how far the hotel management pressed for an official effort to track down the arsonists. But the management did hire 30 additional security guards to patrol each floor of the hotel to prevent a repeat of the arson. In that case, was the beach-level floor of the hotel, where the ballroom and adjacent kitchen were located, seen as an area where a smokey fire would go undetected until it had a chance to spread? Convinced of a Plot Surviving guests said they were convinced the fire had been plotted by the staff since they observed workers leaving their posts about a half hour before the bombs exploded. What they apparently saw, and after the fire gave great meaning to, were those staff members leaving the bars and restaurants to attend the union meeting in the ballroom. Then there is the question of explosions. Nearly everyone who was in the vicinity of the public ground floors of the hotel and pool patio recalled hearing ''explosions.'' They also said the smell of smoke preceded the explosive sounds by some minutes. Whether the fire ignited volatile materials that exploded or created a firestorm of heat that blew out large plate glass widows around the building with explosive force is still being investigated. The authorities say the hotel had been cited in the past by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency for the improper maintenance and storage of fuels used in the building. Union officials said these fuels in past cases had leaked and infiltrated into sewer lines on the grounds of the hotel.

592-> RACIAL BIAS INCIDENTS RISING IN CITY, POLICE SAY
Confirmed incidents of racial bias in New York City, after dropping sharply in most of 1986, have jumped more than 150 percent in the month since the racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, according to police officials who investigate crimes of bias. More than half of the confirmed bias incidents in the past month have involved violence against blacks or whites, including assaults, menacing with weapons or face-to-face verbal confrontations. Normally, most bias incidents are anti-Semitic and are non-confrontational, such as telephone harassment and the painting of swastikas and slurs. Since the Dec. 20 Howard Beach attack, the Police Department Bias Incident Investigating Unit has confirmed 39 racially or ethnically motivated criminal incidents, or about 10 a week, compared with an average of just over 4 a week for the rest of the year. In the climate of heightened public awareness and sensitivity to race relations since Howard Beach, it was likely, officials said, that the increased numbers reflected more reporting of such incidents, in addition to a possible rise in actual incidents. 'The Numbers Are There' ''We're not dealing with an exact science,'' said Sgt. Carl Zittell, executive officer of the anti-bias unit, which investigates all police reports of crimes involving racial or ethnic bias. ''The numbers are there,'' he added, ''but it's difficult to extrapolate the meaning from them. There's no way to measure under-reporting.'' But the sergeant said the statistics were ''a gauge for us,'' and it was clear, he said, that the Howard Beach attack - in which three black men were beaten by white youths and one fleeing victim was killed by a car -had abruptly reversed a downward trend in the statistical pattern of bias incidents in the city. During the first 11 months last year, the latest period for which statistics were available, the unit had confirmed a total of 209 bias incidents, a decline of 23 percent from the approximately 270 incidents in the same period in 1985. In addition to the crimes of bias, the police in the past month have investigated 40 incidents in which people shouted ''Howard Beach!'' as they committed robberies, assaults or other crimes that were eventually not classified as bias incidents. 'It's on Everybody's Mind' ''It's like that commercial a couple of years ago where the lady says, 'Where's the beef?' '' said Sergeant Zittell. ''Everybody is saying 'Howard Beach.' It's on everybody's mind.'' Those who shout ''Howard Beach'' as they commit crimes ''may be justifying what they're doing in their own minds,'' the sergeant said. Ordinarily, a majority of all confirmed bias incidents are directed against Jews, with about one quarter of the total against blacks and the rest against people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds, Sergeant Zittell said. But of the 39 confirmed incidents since Howard Beach, the sergeant said, only 7 have been anti-Semitic, while 15 have been directed against blacks, 11 against whites, 5 against people of Hispanic origin and 1 against an Asian. Of the 15 incidents involving black victims, 5 were assaults, 3 were crimes of menacing with a weapon, 3 were face-to-face harassment and 4 were aggravated harassment, defined as harassment by telephone calls, letters or in other non-confrontational ways, the sergeant said. Of the 11 incidents directed against whites, 6 were assaults, 3 were face-to-face harassment and 2 were aggravated harassment, he said. The 5 anti-Hispanic incidents included 3 assaults, 1 case of menacing with a weapon and 1 aggravated harassment. The 7 anti-Semitic incidents comprised 1 assault, 1 harassment, 4 cases of criminal mischief and 1 burglary. The anti-Asian incident was a case of criminal mischief, Sergeant Zittell said. The Bias Incident Investigating Unit, a 12-member team that works out of Police Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza and is commanded by Capt. Donald J. Bromberg, was formed in 1980 by the former Police Commissioner, Robert J. McGuire, to investigate all reports of crimes involving possible racial or ethnic motivation.

593-> THE REGION; TRANSIT AGENCY SETS GOALS, AND EVEN MEETS SOME
Given the evident difficulties of running New York's subways, as well as the bureaucracy they spawned, it might not seem wise to put 473 goals for the year in writing, much less project them in foot-high letters onto a screen at the front of a crowded auditorium. But so the Transit Authority did last week in what David L. Gunn, its president, has made an annual ritual. As managers gathered in Brooklyn for the first of this year's five goal meetings - there are so many new hands that it takes five days to accommodate them all -the proceedings even took on the air of a pep rally crossed with a victory party. To be sure, it seems that passengers ought to be able to take some of the goals for granted, like subway cars with accurate signs and lights to read them by. Should it be a strain to produce enough ''10-Paks'' of tokens or replace 300 benches? Some of the goals even seem to hint at backsliding, like the resolve that 97 percent of all subway cars have legible maps, which is actually one percentage point lower than what the authority says is the current level. ''It's much ado about a modest success,'' says Gene Russianoff, staff counsel of the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, although he notes that previous T.A. regimes ''couldn't keep maps in the cars.'' But other goals seem downright ambitious, especially since they are published in a half-inch-thick document that is freely distributed and discussed. The authority wants to increase from 57 to 75 the percentage of the subway fleet that is free of graffiti, raise the number of stations in the graffiti-control program from 201 to 248, place 610 more new cars and 540 more overhauled cars in service, overhaul 673 buses, raise $10 million by reducing turnstile jumping in the subways and ''short dropping'' on buses and see that 90 percent of the trains start runs within 15 seconds of the scheduled time. The transit police will seek to eject 5 percent more riders for smoking, playing loud radios or other ''illegal behavior'' - 4,500 were given the boot last year - and the track and structures department, which fell 8,800 feet short of its 1986 goal to install 110,800 feet of continuously welded rail, set a 1987 goal of 130,000 feet. When Mr. Gunn arrived at the Transit Authority in 1984, he said, he found fewer managers and no departmental objectives, at least none in writing. ''I was sure people had individual goals,'' he said, ''but there was nothing formalized.'' So he set up a system in which he and his top staff members set the direction and each department suggests steps it should take. The goals sessions provide an opportunity to pool promises and build esprit de corps. They also furnish a glimpse of the style with which Mr. Gunn is trying to lead the agency out of the bad old days. Relaxed and witty on stage last week, he paced the aisles anxiously when those at the podium threatened to stay there beyond their scheduled time. There is a back-to-basics quality to many of the goals, perhaps reflecting what some perceive as Mr. Gunn's distrust of high technology. There is also an emphasis on cleanliness and orderliness that he has tried to spread through his domain. Some goals unrealized in past years are stubbornly repeated. For instance, the agency is again promising that subway announcements will be made 90 percent of the time - the latest figure is 79 percent - and that 90 percent of the fleet will have fully working doors, as against 74 percent at latest count. The Record So Far The authority said it had a success rate of 82 percent in meeting the 450 goals it set for 1986. Sanford E. Russell, Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the T.A.'s parent, says he has not checked that tally, but he disagreed with the similarly high success rate the T.A. announced for its 1985 goals. Sonny Hall, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. said he was ''disappointed'' with what he said was a lack of emphasis on labor relations. And Mr. Russianoff of the straphangers' group wondered about the consequences of not meeting particular goals. ''They failed the last passenger survey on doors, and I have yet to get a straight answer on why they can't fix them,'' Mr. Russianoff said. ''So they have objectives, but the question is, are they managing by objective?'' ''Inherent in the goal-setting process,'' Mr. Gunn acknowledged, ''is that you're not going to meet some of them.'' But, he insists, it is a risk the managerial benefits far outweigh.

594-> Herbert Menzel Dies at 66; N.Y.U. Sociology Professor
Herbert Menzel, a sociology professor at New York University, died of a heart attack Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 66 years old. Dr. Menzel joined the staff of N.Y.U. in 1965, after teaching at Columbia and Carleton Colleges. He was co-author, in 1966, of ''Medical Innovation - a Diffusion Study.'' He was born in Carlsbad, Czechoslovakia, and came to the United States in 1939. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1947 and received a doctorate there in 1959. He also held a master's degree from Indiana University. He is survived by his wife, June Nash, a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York; two daughters from an earlier marriage, Lyla Menzel of Tokyo, and Miriam Menzel of Manhattan, and three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. Sunday at 58 Washington Square South.

595-> WHERE THE MIDDLE AGES LIVE
What does one call a city that has nearly 80 recorded names, 7 of them coined by Goethe's Mephistopheles as he was flying toward it on his magic cloak with Dr. Faust? To the Celts, who founded it around 500 B.C., it was Rataspona, from which the English Ratisbon and French Ratisbonne obviously derive. To the Romans, who made it an impregnable fortress under Marcus Aurelius in A.D. 179, it was Castra Regina, meaning camp on the Regen, a reference to the tributary that meets the mighty Danube there. Came the Baiuorri, ancestors of today's Bavarians, four centuries later, and they called it Regenespurc, which seems close enough to the accepted contemporary German name, Regensburg. The many names speak volumes. The age of West Germany's cities is frequently in dispute and the source of considerable rivalry between them. But Regensburg, 220 miles southeast of Frankfurt, 75 miles north of Munich, regards itself above such petty competition. By virtue of its documented past, the others are mere upstarts. Its past, moreover, has been preserved to make Regensburg a singular treasure chest of living history and art, a bustling museum of long-forgotten eras that seem vibrantly alive. First-time visitors to Germany say Regensburg is how they expected all German cities to look - like travel posters and brochures. Unfortunately, because of wartime destruction, postwar architectural mindlessness and the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle), the majority no longer do. But Regensburg is such an exception to what has happened elsewhere that even Germans express amazement that such a city still exists. Situated astride the Danube, and known for centuries as Germany's gateway to the Balkans and the Orient, Regensburg is an urban gem - a town for strolling, exploring and breathing in history, for admiring the art and craftsmanship of past epochs; a city of narrow lanes, cobblestone streets, secluded courtyards, gabled burgher houses, rich merchants' mansions, market squares, imposing defensive walls and towers, splendid palaces and majestic Romanesque and Gothic churches. Virtually undamaged during World War II, it is the largest - with a population of 130,000 - and most perfectly preserved medieval city in the country. It is a city, moreover, where the living past is treated with lighthearted humor. Amble through the town and you will come upon streets with such names as Frohliche Turkenstrasse (Cheerful Turks Street), Zur Schonen Gelgenheit (roughly translatable as Good Opportunity Corner) and Hundsumkehr (approximately Dogs' Turnaround Lane). Human foibles are as much the theme of murals and bas-reliefs on the ancient buildings as are monumental deeds. Even the statues on the fountains and the sculptures in the churches evoke a smile. To see Regensburg means to walk it, and not only because most of the historic center is a pedestrian mall or the streets and lanes are too narrow for modern vehicles. And although it is fairly compact - a rough half-circle about one mile by a half-mile, hugging the river - the kaleidoscopic maze of lanes, alleys, squares and worthwhile sights requires strong legs and a pair of sturdy shoes. During the city's time as Marcus Aurelius's Castra Regina, the Roman military contingent alone numbered 6,000 and with the usual codicil of families, campfollowers, merchants and other hangers-on, it was a fortified town of 12,000, with forum, temples, pottery and tile workshops and mint, which struck its last Roman coin in 408. The wall surrounding it, more than a mile long and 23 feet high, was built of huge limestone blocks without mortar. Massive gateways to the fortress, guard towers and other sections of the wall remain visible today, integrated into churches, hotels, a parking garage and shops. In Regensburg the Roman heritage is alive. Moreover, unlike other Roman frontier towns, Regensburg did not decay when Rome itself collapsed and the Bauiorri invaded in the fifth and sixth centuries. Somehow it just absorbed them, turning those pagan proto-Bavarians, who made Regensburg the first capital of Bavaria, into Christians long before Christianity took root elsewhere in Germany. The oldest Christian tombstones found in the city date from the late fourth and early fifth centuries. The first abbey was founded 1,300 years ago, and by the time St. Boniface, the Irish missionary monk known as the Apostle of the Germans, arrived in 739, Regensburg was, by the standards of the Dark Ages, a surprisingly civilized place. Charlemagne made it the most important town in southern Germany, and from the 10th through the 18th centuries it ranked as one of the greatest power centers of the German Holy Roman Empire. That first German Reich was less an empire than a confederation of baronies, duchies, principalities and little kingdoms. Nor was it very holy or Roman. But within it, Regensburg enjoyed a privileged position as an independent city-state and as the seat of the Reichstag, the imperial diet. This parliament of nobles met periodically in the ornate chambers and council halls of Regensburg's beautifully preserved 14th-century city hall, throughout the Middle Ages, and had its permanent home there from 1663 to 1803, when Napoleon disbanded the diet and abolished the empire. There are numerous daily guided tours of the building, in which the mayor still has his office, of its lavishly appointed Imperial Hall with the emperor's throne, the Electors' Chambers, Princes' Rooms and the torture cellar. But for all of Regensburg's role as a political center, its real power and influence derived from commerce, its advantageous position on the Danube, and its famous Steinerne Brucke (Stone Bridge) across the river, unaltered in appearance and still very much in use today. Completed after only 11 years of construction in 1146, it was one of the engineering marvels of the Middle Ages and for hundreds of years virtually the only bridge across Europe's chief artery. It also bolstered Regensburg's position as the principal crossroad of the trade routes between southern Europe and Scandinavia, the Orient, Middle East and Russia to France and the Netherlands. The city's merchants were of fabulous wealth, its coinage so solid that it was legal tender throughout Europe. Ties to the Italian city-states - Venice, Florence and Siena - were close and it was from there that rich Regensburgers imported an architectural style peculiar to the city: fortress-like tower houses, some of them 12 stories high. Although they never played the defensive role in trade wars between rival families that they did in Italy, the idea was to build them as tall as possible. The higher the house, the richer its owner was presumed to be. Sixty of these medieval skyscrapers once punctuated the city's skyline, making Regensburg a kind of Manhattan of the Middle Ages. Twenty have survived, in use today as much sought-after studio-apartment houses by students and artists. The two that are best preserved, both built in the 13th century, are the Baumburger Turm on Watmarkt, near the City Hall, and the Goldener Turm on Wahlenstrasse. Equally impressive is the seven-story tower of the Haus zum Goldenen Kreuz (House at the Golden Cross) on Haidplatz, one of the city's finest squares. From the 16th through the 19th centuries the Golden Cross served as Regensburg's imperial inn, the grand hotel of visiting emperors, kings, electors, princes, foreign emissaries and other potentates. Like any hotel, it had its share of scandal. The most famous affair was the 1546 tryst between Emperor Charles V (grandson of Spain's Ferdinand and Isabella) and 18-year-old Barbara Blomberg, a Regensburg saddlemaker's daughter 28 years his junior. She bore the emperor a son, named Don Juan de Austria, on Charles's own birthday, in the 13th-century Weinstube zur Stritzelbackerin at No. 6 Watmarkt. It was renowned then, as it is now, as an inn because of its wine cellar, good food and salty rolls called Stritzel. The tale of Emperor Charles' rendezvous with Barbara Blomberg is told in a mural on the facade of the House at the Golden Cross. Other symbols of commemoration are the delectable chocolate pralines, called Barbara's Kisses, that are made by the Cafe Prinzess, No. 2 Rathausplatz, Germany's oldest coffeehouse and pastry shop, opened in 1686. Don Juan was by no means Regensburg's only famous native son or frequent habitue. Albertus Magnus taught in the city from 1236 to 1240 and was its bishop from 1260 to 1262. Albrecht Altdorfer, considered the world's first landscape painter and founder of the Danubian School, was born in Regensburg in 1480 and died there in 1538. Though Altdorfer's greatest paintings are in galleries elsewhere - Vienna, Berlin, Munich and the Uffizi of Florence -the Regensburg Municipal Museum has a number of important pieces. His work is also represented in some of the city's churches. Johann Kepler, the mathematician and astronomer whose description of the elliptical movement of the planets is still valid, had numerous personal, familial and professional links to Regensburg, where he died in 1630, at No. 5 Keplerstrasse. That house today is a museum exhibiting many of Kepler's mathematical instruments, astronomical tools and manuscripts. Regensburg's wealth was also the foundation for its profusion of Romanesque and Gothic churches -26 in all - of which St. Peter's Cathedral, begun in 1250 and completed in 1525, is actually the youngest, though it ranks with those of Reims, Chartres and Cologne as one of Europe's most impressive. Its two lacework spires rise high above the city's other towers and can be seen for many miles. The interior is undergoing a major renovation and restoration that will keep it closed through April. However, the cloisters, the Byzantine-style 12th-century Allerheiligenkapelle (All Saints Chapel) and adjacent St. Ulrich basilica, built between 1230 and 1250, are open on thrice-daily guided tours (once a day during the winter months). One of the cathedral's greatest treasures can be heard in the Niedermunster, an eighth-century church adjacent to the bishop's palace. These are the Regensburger Domspatzen (cathedral sparrows), a boys' choir renowned for more than 1,000 years. Founded by Bishop Wolfgang in 975, the choir is part of the cathedral school. Although the performance of liturgical music remains the choir's primary work, since the early 1800's it has turned its attention increasingly to performing secular works in concert. The choir can be heard regularly on Sundays and holidays at 9 A.M. mass in the Niedermunster. Their performances of secular music take place throughout the concert season. Open too, despite the restoration work at St. Peter's, is the Domschatzmuseum, the cathedral treasury museum, an extensive collection of sacral art from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, including a 13th-century gem- and pearl-studded gold crucifix. To see all of Regensburg's churches and their artworks would take weeks, but several, besides St. Peter's, St. Ulrich and the Niedermunster, are worth a visit. One of them is St. Jakob at Bismarckplatz. A Romanesque building dating from around 1200, it was the chapel of an Irish-Scottish missionary monastery. The main portal is a dazzling example of Romanesque sculpture and masonry. Not far from St. Jakob, on Predigergasse (Preacher's Lane), is the Dominikanerkirche (Dominican Church), a 13th-century Gothic basilica that was the monastery church in which Albertus Magnus taught. The city's ecclesiastical crown jewel is St. Emmeramskirche, facing Emmeramsplatz. This is the oldest center of Christianity in Regensburg, having been founded in the fifth century by Christianized Romans and Baiuorri. It is named for a missionary monk, St. Emmeram, who was martyred in southern Bavaria and entombed in the church in 685. A Benedictine abbey was built soon after, adjacent to the church, and by the 10th century it was known as one of the greatest centers of learning in Europe. The library, with more than 200,000 books, includes many illuminated manuscripts. Many of the sculptures and tombs in St. Emmeram's, some from the 9th and 10th centuries, are of inestimable value to the history of art. The cloisters, late Romanesque and early Gothic in style, are among the largest and most beautiful in Germany. But there is more to St. Emmeram's than the church. The immense monastery, disbanded and secularized in the early 19th century, is now the gaudy neo-Renaissance palace of the princes of Thurn-und-Taxis, which can be toured when the current prince, Johannes, is not at home. The Thurn-und-Taxis family's business in the Middle Ages, as the prince candidly concedes, was ''robber barony, or to be more precise, piracy.'' Then, in the 15th century, the barons became mailmen. That is, they invented - and eventually gained a European monopoly on - postal service. By the 17th century, their network of stagecoaches, dispatch riders and postal relay stations spanned the Continent. They not only delivered but also had a penchant for reading the mail they carried. This made their services doubly valuable to intriguing and warring dukes, kings, emperors and popes, all of whom rewarded -or in some cases paid off - these odd postmen. The ''postage'' amounted to titles of nobility - and land. Besides the vast private park that surrounds the palace and St. Emmeram's, closed to the public, Prince Johannes owned, at last count, 80,000 acres of prime forest and farming country in southern Germany, 140,000 acres of rice, pepper and rubber plantations in Brazil, 12,000 acres of timber country in Canada. Once asked how many castles he has, he looked genuinely puzzled, turned to an aide, and said, ''I'm not sure. Is it 20 or 21?'' For many generations the Thurn-und-Taxis clan had their residence, and the headquarters of their Continental postal system, in Frankfurt, then in Brussels. In 1790 they moved to Regensburg, and when St. Emmeram's Benedictine abbey was secularized by Napoleon in 1808, they bought it and turned it into their palace. When the prince is not using the lavishly decorated formal rooms such as the state chamber, banquet and dancing hall, hall of mirrors and various drawing rooms, all crammed with priceless art, they are open for guided tours. So are the cloisters of St. Emmeram's and the stable museum with its 19th-century coaches and carriages, silver and gold harnesses and equestrian paintings. Another museum, across the square from the church and the castle entrance, is the Diozesan museum, which has a notable collection of ecclesiastical art spanning a millenium. For those with a preference for Celtic, Roman, early German and medieval artifacts, not to mention paintings by Altdorfer and other Bavarian masters, there is the Museum der Stadt Regensburg, the municipal museum, at Dachauplatz. Roman ruins, medieval gems of art and craftsmanship and extraordinary examples of architecture are not Regensburg's only attractions. Much of its appeal is intangible - an atmosphere and relaxed way of life influenced by the bucolic hinterland. It is provincial and proud of it. It is in the center of Lower Bavaria's rich farm belt and the open-air markets are as tantalizing as they are photogenic. Fist-sized, snowy-white radishes, regarded by Regensburgers as essential beer snacks, are sold by wizened farm women at a profusion of stalls near St. Peter's and on the Kornmarkt, bursting with purveyors of flowers and produce. There is also an element of academic sophistication, provided by the 10,000 students at Regensburg's university. Rataspona, Ratisbon, Castra Regina, Reganespurc and more than 70 other names, or just plain Regensburg? What does it matter? Among the smaller cities in Germany it has no equal. A VISITOR'S GUIDE TO REGENSBURG THEN AND NOW Touring the Town For an introduction and orientation, take a half-day guided walking tour, organized by the municipal tourist office (Fremdenverkehrsamt) in the City Hall (Rathaus); telephone, 507-2144 or 507-2141. From April through October, these are offered daily and on Sunday. From November through March, they are offered on Saturday and Sunday only. Tours must be booked in advance. The price is $3.15 a person for German-language tours and about $31.50 in English for a family or group, no matter how large. The guides have an encyclopedic knowledge of the city and a store of amusing anecdotes that make the sights and stones come alive. Or catch a riverboat for a ride on the Danube. The trip includes the harbor where barges from as far as the Soviet Union unload or take on cargo. You buy tickets ($3.75 for an hour's ride, $4.75 for two hours) and board at the kiosk (55349) on the embankment near the Stone Bridge. The boats do not operate during the winter. After that, strike out with a map and a guidebook. The best one in literate, unfractured English, available in the tourist office or any bookstore at $4.25, is ''Regensburg: Germany's Medieval Miracle.'' Restaurants and Taverns The most historic and colorful of Regensburg's aged inns is Die Alter Wurstkuche (the Old Sausage Kitchen) at 3 Thurndorferstrasse (561-810). It is on the Danube embankment at the foot of the old Stone Bridge and has been in business continuously for more than 800 years. It opened in the late 1130's to serve the workers who built the bridge. The famed pork sausages are four inches long, half an inch in diameter and charcoal broiled. They come in portions of 4, 6, 8 or 12, accompanied by sauerkraut, and taste best when washed down with Thurn-und-Taxis beer. A plate of 6, with sauerkraut and a pint, costs $4.75. Other than potato soup, there is little else on the menu. The cozy Historisches Eck zur Stritzelbackerin at 6 Watmarkt (52966), where Don Juan de Austria was born, is about a century younger. A light meal with a liter carafe of wine costs about $27 for two. The Alt Regensburger Weinkeller is a comfortable wine tavern, serving light tidbits, in the cellar of a 14th-century house at 4 Fischgassl (54747). A liter carafe of wine with soup, salad or hors d'oeuvres comes to about $27 for two. Good, solid Bavarian food, meaning roast meats and lots of dumplings, can be found in the City Hall Ratskeller at 1 Rathausplatz (51777). A three-course meal with a couple of beers apiece costs about $35 for two. For more sophisticated and also more expensive dining, try Gansbauer at 10 Keplerstrasse (57858), an old inn with wood paneling, rustic decor and an elegant nouvelle cuisine treatment of traditional German and Bavarian dishes. Considered Regensburg's finest restaurant, Gansbauer is open Tuesday through Saturday for dinner only. A three-course dinner with wine carafe is about $75 for two. Reservations are essential. Cafes and pastry shops abound. Besides the 300-year-old Cafe Prinzess across from the Rathaus, the best spots for those not counting calories are the Cafe Deutzer at 8 Pfauengasse; Cafe Prock, Kohlenmarkt; Orlando di Lasso at 2 Alter Kornmarkt, and Goldenes Kreuz, on Haidplatz, right inside the erstwhile grand hotel that once accommodated visiting emperors and kings. Hotels Regensburg hotels are surprisingly moderate in price. The most elegant and expensive is the Parkhotel Maximilian at 28 Maximilianstrasse (51042), a 19th-century neo-Baroque grand hotel in which a double costs $86 a night, sumptuous Continental breakfast buffet included. A notch below the Maximilian and romantically situated in a former patrician house across the square from St. Peter's, is the Kaiserhof am Dom at 10 Kramgasse (54027), with doubles priced to $58. Sections of the Bischofshof at 3 Krautermarkt (59086), where doubles are $57, are built into the old Roman wall. The Munchner Hof, 9 Tandlergasse (58262), is on a narrow medieval street and lists its most expensive double at $51.50.

596-> New Zealander Picked To Head Foreign Press
Roy Murphy, a correspondent for Television New Zealand, was elected last week to a third one-year term as president of the Foreign Press Association. The association includes more than 300 foreign correspondents from 60 countries, all of whom are based in New York or Washington. During his tenure as president, Mr. Murphy has lobbied for the release of journalists held hostage in Lebanon, and has protested the American detention and expulsion of Patricia Lara, a Colombian journalist. Comparing Miss Lara's case to that of Nicholas S. Daniloff, the U.S. News & World Report correspondent detained last year by the Soviet Union, Mr. Murphy wrote, ''If the U.S. wants its journalists treated responsibly overseas, the same treatment must be granted to foreign journalists here.'' In addition to Mr. Murphy, these members were elected as officers of the association: Harry Z. Bau, of El Economista, Argentina, re-elected first vice president. Werner K. Tillman, Foreign Trade News, West Germany, re-elected second vice president. Gianni Capra, La Voce Repubblicana, Italy, elected treasurer. John Fercsey, Interco Press, Argentina, elected general secretary. Igor Makurin, Tass, Soviet Union, elected assistant general secretary.

597-> THE NIGHT ROMMEL SAID 'MAZEL TOV'
NIGHT OF THE FOX By Jack Higgins. 316 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster, $17.95 NOTHING is quite as remote as a vice you do not share. At best, it will seem laughable, at worst repugnant. And since I do not share the vice for poorly written thrillers, ''Night of the Fox'' amused me for all the wrong reasons. Here, Jack Higgins falls far short of ''The Eagle Has Landed,'' the novel for which he is best known. His hero, Harry Martineau, an American, is a brilliant philosopher turned killer for his country during World War II. His intellectual background is deftly established by the author after a barroom altercation in which Martineau uses a hold he has learned in a ''silent killing course.'' The woman whose honor he has defended remarks on the speed of his response. '' 'When I feel, I act. I'm a very existentialist person.' '' 'Existentialist?' She frowned. 'I don't understand.' '' 'Oh, a new perspective to things a friend of mine's come up with. A French writer called Jean-Paul Sartre. When I was on the run in Paris three years ago, I holed up at his apartment for a couple of weeks. . . . The bit I like is the suggestion that you should create values for yourself through action and by living each moment to the full.' '' His credentials as a genius and a killer thus established, Martineau is ready for his assignment. Disguised as a high-ranking SS official, he is to rescue an American, Kelso, from the German-held island of Jersey. Washed ashore when his boat was torpedoed by the Germans, Kelso knows the plans for the Normandy invasion. As one character remarks: ''Wouldn't it be ironic if the greatest invasion in history had to be called off because one man with all the right information fell into the wrong hands.'' Rommel is also traveling to Jersey to meet with his fellow anti-Hitler conspirators. But how can he slip away undetected? By using a double, a German soldier named Baum who can do a perfect Rommel imitation. But Baum is in reality a Jewish actor who has sought refuge from the Nazis in the German Army and who himself says: ''A Jew impersonating Germany's greatest war hero. A nice touch of irony there.'' Mr. Higgins is very considerate of the reader and always tags his ironies. Baum's Jewishness is masterfully limned. As soon as he is alone he says ''mazel tov'' and ''l'chaim'' aloud to himself. This, however, he does once too often because Martineau is hiding behind a curtain, and the plot thickens to the point of congealing. PLOT is usually the strong suit of such novels. Mr. Higgins's story line, however, is welded out of devices that went out with the cliffhanger serials. Not only do people hide behind curtains, not only does everyone speak everyone else's language perfectly, but the key players are constantly revealing the most crucial information to each other on the principle - You won't be around much longer and so you might as well know who I really am. A thriller should at least deliver thrills. This is usually accomplished by detailed sadistic description. But what in another type of literature used to be called the ''good parts'' are rendered by Mr. Higgins with a curious lassitude. The multiple killings are quick and drab, with the exception of the indescribable confusion of a torpedo attack, economically compressed into the following: ''There was a scene of indescribable confusion . . .'' (It is only fair to point out that the reviewer is adding a touch of irony here.) When speaking of the ''twelve ways of killing someone with your bare hands,'' Martineau is asked if he can ''do that sort of thing'' and he replies: ''Anybody can be taught to do it. It's brains that's important in this game.'' In that respect, the art of killing and the art of writing are alike.

599-> MR. SHAWN
William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, is a legendary fussbudget. ''Questioning a comma,'' the critic Brendan Gill wrote of him, ''he will shake his head and say in his soft voice that he realizes perfectly well what a lot of time and thought have gone into the comma and that in the ordinary course of events he would be the first to say that the comma was precisely the form of punctuation that he would have been most happy to encounter at that very place in the sentence, but isn't there the possibility - oh, only the remotest one, to be sure, and yet perhaps worth considering for a moment in the light of the care already bestowed on the construction - that the sentence could be made to read infinitesimally more clearly if, say, instead of a comma a semicolon were to be inserted at just that point? And the author, touched by Shawn's sympathy, aghast with admiration for the skill of his circumlocutions, and determined at all costs to prevent Shawn from suffering the humiliation of having his proposed semicolon rejected, throws up his hands and exclaims, 'Much clearer your way!' '' Mr. Shawn, who retires next month, has been performing his extraordinary microsurgery for 55 of the magazine's 62 years. His authors and his fellow editors will miss that hawk eye very much. But the people to feel sorriest for are those writers and editors who haven't experienced it. For several generations of such folk, winning the chance to work with William Shawn was like being asked to dance with Fred Astaire. The magazine he inherited from Harold Ross, and that is now being handed on to another superb editor, Robert Gottlieb, was not, Mr. Ross said, to be edited for the old lady in Dubuque. Nonetheless, it has found some of its most devoted readers in small towns and sleepy cities, and among the old as well as the young. Many people still speak of the mourning wails of faraway trains, and of how they made them restless for everything that was not Dubuque, or Wauwatosa, or Columbus. That siren call was also sounded by William Shawn's New Yorker.

600-> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; IN ALBANY, BUDGET CIRCUS OPENS ANNUAL RUN
It is as thick as a phone book and about as entertaining. Every page has kept some state agency up nights and will now put some legislator to sleep. It is the 1987-88 executive budget, required reading for all state officials, or at least for their staffs. Over the last few days, in briefings before the Albany press corps, selected editors and finally the Legislature, Governor Cuomo has presented his budget - $40 billion in 600 pages - to the people. In so doing, he has set the stage for the annual drama of state budget negotiations, a drama that will build to a final curtain on March 31, when the old budget runs out. It is a show that is often high-spirited, and just about everybody gets into the act. When it was kicked off with presentations by the agencies, the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation brought in a juggler to illustrate its plight before the budget office; the Health Department's carried a cartoon of Commissioner David Axelrod with his pockets hanging empty. As some legislators took issue with the Governor's revenue projections and asked for greater tax cuts, Mr. Cuomo has suggested that any revenue above his projections be deposited in a ''Sunny Day'' or Taxpayer Dividend Fund to await return to the taxpayers. He recommended Wednesday that the money be deposited in some sort of receptacle on the Capitol lawn, where everyone could see it and have a laugh at his expense. He suggested calling it the Regan-Miller-Anderson vinyl basket, after the State Comptroller, the Assembly Speaker and the Senate majority leader. Members of the Assembly quickly suggested that the receptacle stand in front of the legislative offices. Then they pointed out that they had rejected similar proposals in the past, when the Senate was pressing for a so-called locked box, for surplus funds and that they would surely do so again. ''A lock box last year, a plastic basket this year,'' remarked Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, dismissing the proposal as already dead. ''God knows what it will be called next year.'' For members of the Governor's staff, Wednesday marked the end of a grueling month that began with a special session of the Legislature, went on to the inauguration and the State of the State address and culminated in the budget presentation. One of Mr. Cuomo's press secretaries, Gary Fryer, compared finishing the budget presentations to being reborn. But the Governor is not known to allow overwork to slow his stride. After the presentation Wednesday morning to the Legislature, he denied that the executive office had any reason to celebrate. ''There's no relief, and there will be no relief,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''My staff should know that. Otherwise, before you know it they'll be leaving here at 9, 10 o'clock.'' The Governor himself had no plans to knock off early, he said. He said he had had all the entertainment he needed last week, when he watched his favorite double feature on videotape - ''Gunga Din'' and ''King Kong.'' Trying not only to stay awake through the executive budget but also to understand it was a task many freshman legislators confessed they found daunting. One of them, Assemblyman Terence M. Zaleski, Democrat of Yonkers, said that to better comprehend the budget, he had asked some members of the Division of Budget to explain it to him. This zeal for information, he acknowledged, was considered out of the ordinary in the Capitol. ''A lot of people around here are reacting as if my requests are unusual,'' he said. ''But I look forward to sitting down and getting some answers.'' No sooner had the budget been released than many legislators started trying to discern where in it Mr. Cuomo was practicing fiduciary sleight of hand. The Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., Republican of Norwich, compared Mr. Cuomo to a card shark and a charlatan. ''He's giving us the fast shuffle, but he's good at it,'' he said, emerging from the Governor's presentation. ''He would have done well in the Wild West on a medicine wagon.'' The new chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, Saul Weprin, Democrat of Queens, said the committee's longtime staff members had pointed out to him ''exactly where things are buried.'' The chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, Jose Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx, noted that while the budget proclaimed a new $327 million program to reduce the school-dropout rate, most of the money was actually coming from old programs. ''What frightens me,'' he said, ''is that I'm beginning to catch on and understand all this.''

602-> HARVARD PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION REPORTED MISSING SINCE JAN. 17
Lawrence Kohlberg, a professor of education at Harvard whose book on moral development is used by teachers around the world to promote moral reasoning, has been missing since Jan. 17. According to the police in nearby Winthrop, there were fears he may have drowned. Professor Kohlberg, 59 years old, left Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge on a day pass on Jan. 17 in ''a depressed state,'' according to Lieut. Angelo A. LaMonica of the Winthrop police. His automobile was found Jan. 22 on a residential street in Winthrop about 75 feet from a tidal marsh, according to Lieutenant LaMonica, who said the professor's coat, hat and wallet were inside. The wallet had a small amount of cash, he said. There was no sign of foul play, he said, adding that Professor Kohlberg's family and friends had expressed concern over his depressed state. A search of the area, which is partly covered with ice, was not productive. At the Graduate School of Education at Harvard, Dean Patricia A. Graham circulated a notice Thursday that said: ''It is with great sorrow that I write to inform you that our colleague, Larry Kohlberg, has been missing since Jan. 17, 1987. Members of his family have advised us that Larry recently suffered a recurrence of a longstanding and painful medical condition. A thorough investigation by the authorities is continuing.'' In a telephone interview, Dr. Graham said that the illness was a tropical parasite and that when she last saw Dr. Kohlberg, at a party at her home on Jan. 6, he had discussed the condition. ''He didn't look well,'' she said. ''He didn't seem to be feeling well.'' Dr. Kohlberg became a professor of education and social psychology at Harvard in 1968, she said. Dr. Kohlberg's book, ''The Philosophy of Moral Development,'' defined six stages of moral development. It is known for formulating moral problems for use as classroom exercises. The intention is to use discussion of the problems to increase the level of children for moral reasoning.

604-> POINDEXTER AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL: A QUICK RISE AND A TROUBLED REIGN
Throughout his career in the Navy, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter was regarded as the consummate military aide, the man who carried out orders with alacrity and, at times, brilliance. That was the principal trait that President Reagan and Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, sought in December 1985 when Robert C. McFarlane resigned as national security adviser and Admiral Poindexter was promoted to the job, Administation officials said. But the skills that allowed Admiral Poindexter to perform well within the military restricted his knowledge of civilian politics and caused him to become drawn into the Iran arms affair, civil and military officials agreed. In the last week it became clear that Admiral Poindexter played a much greater role than had earlier been acknowledged in the program to sell American arms to Iran and divert money from those sales to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. Drafted Order on Arms Documents made public by the White House on Friday showed that Admiral Poindexter drafted President Reagan's order last January that the United States should continue selling weapons to Iran and did his best to keep the program secret, even misleading other senior Administration officials at times. A draft report by the Senate Intelligence Committee shows that Admiral Poindexter was an active participant in planning the operation from the early days in the summer of 1985. According to the report, Admiral Poindexter also played a pivotal part in January 1986, when he persuaded President Reagan to resume shipping arms to Iran after Mr. Reagan had decided to end the program late in 1985. Admiral Poindexter briefed the President on the necessity of the arms sale after he met with Israeli officials in December, soon after taking over as national security adviser, the report said. The report said that early last November he even persuaded William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, not to consult the White House counsel on the legality of diverting money to the contras. Admiral Poindexter said he worried that he could not trust the counsel to keep the matter secret. Admiral Poindexter would not agree to an interview or respond to allegations raised in the Senate report or elsewhere. Turmoil on the Staff According to colleagues on the staff of the National Security Council, senior officers in the Pentagon, White House officials and members of Congress, Admiral Poindexter had difficulties on the job from his earliest days as national security adviser. Until he resigned on Nov. 25, according to these officials, Admiral Poindexter's short term as national security adviser was marked by turmoil on the N.S.C. staff, distrust on Capitol Hill and a desire to conduct most affairs of the N.S.C. in an envelope of secrecy so secure that the Congress, the State Department, the Pentagon, the White House and most of his own staff members were not aware of some important developments, including many related to the Iran-contra affair. Senior officers who worked with Admiral Poindexter in the Navy said they were bewildered by his participation in the Iran-contra affair. ''He was a guy of unquestionable integrity,'' said Adm. James L. Holloway 3d, the Chief of Naval Operations from 1974 to 1978, who hired Admiral Poindexter, then a captain, to serve as his executive assistant. ''He was not a fanatic on any issue. He had no hangups. He was just very well balanced.'' But former National Security Council staff members, and top officers at the Pentagon who worked with him on issues ranging from arms control to terrorism, said Admiral Poindexter had difficulty in mastering his new role as national security adviser. He was abrupt with some staff members, they said. He was unwilling to listen to views that differed from his own and sometimes punished those who offered them. The staff members said he loathed the press and disliked dealing with members of Congress - even though dealing with them is among the essential duties of the national security adviser. ''He told us time and time again that he was more comfortable alone in his office with the door closed, reprogramming his computer, or at home tinkering with his car or making furniture,'' said a former N.S.C. staff member. ''Those are all kind of solitary endeavors.'' Key Aide Was Ailing ''He was a nuclear scientist and a military man,'' said another former staff member, who said he believed that Admiral Poindexter did not understand the politics of the situation. Admiral Poindexter was further hampered by the illness of a key aide, Donald R. Fortier, the deputy national security adviser and a well-respected member of the staff, who was hospitalized early in 1986 and died of cancer in August at the age of 39. Colleagues say Mr. Fortier had an aptitude for the larger geopolitical demands of the agency's work. ''When Donald left, nobody was there to deflect staff demands, or carry out all the paper chores, or be the principal deputy that staff members could trust,'' said a former N.S.C. official, who said he believed that Mr. Fortier would have exerted more supervision over Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. Mr. Fortier was also in charge of the political-military affairs staff, the group that included Colonel North as deputy director. Colonel North was dismissed in November because of his role in the Iran-contra affair. After Mr. Fortier became ill and left the agency, Colonel North quickly filled the role of principal adviser to Admiral Poindexter on Central American policy and was left free to roam almost at will, former staff members said. North His Own Boss Several staff members said Admiral Poindexter clearly indicated early in 1986 that Colonel North was his own boss. According to Robert S. Bennett, the lawyer for Howard J. Teicher, former director of political-military affairs, Admiral Poindexter specifically told Mr. Teicher in February 1986 that Colonel North would not be under his command. ''Poindexter also told Teicher that he would be establishing a separate directorate which would retain direct responsiblity for terrorism matters,'' Mr. Bennett said. Further, acccording to Mr. Bennett, Admiral Poindexter told Mr. Teicher that matters concerning the contras in Nicaragua would remain Colonel North's responsibility and that Mr. Teicher's directorate was not to get involved in those matters. Admiral Poindexter turned to a group of retired and active Navy officers to manage the staff and advise him. At one point, 10 N.S.C. staff members - 20 percent of the staff - were retired or active Navy men, including the executive secretary, the defense policy coordinator and the legal adviser, according to N.S.C. records. ''He had limited contact in the Government or in politics, and when things got tough, he turned to the men he most trusted and those were Navy men,'' said a foreign affairs expert who worked with the N.S.C. staff. The result, say many former N.S.C. officials, was that policies were considered and decisions made in a very tight circle of close Navy colleagues. Most staff members felt ''locked out'' of the process. Other foreign policy experts worried that Admiral Poindexter, who continued to serve as an active-duty officer, would be unable to perform the important role of mediating the views of the Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger, whom he continued to work for, and the Secretary of State, George P. Shultz. And they wondered whether Admiral Poindexter, who had no formal training and only modest practical experience in diplomacy, would be able to unravel and understand the complexities of the myriad of policy questions that had to be considered on most national security issues. Admired in the White House But within the White House, Admiral Poindexter was widely admired, according to former staff members. He had joined the staff of the N.S.C. in June 1981 as the military aide to Mr. Reagan's first national security adviser, Richard V. Allen. When Mr. Allen resigned in January 1982 and was replaced by William P. Clark Jr., Admiral Poindexter continued to serve as the military aide. Mr. Clark, who had been the Deputy Secretary of State, took several of his aides with him to the National Security Council, including Mr. McFarlane, whom he named deputy national security adviser. When Mr. Clark left the N.S.C. in October 1983 to replace James G. Watt as Interior Secretary, Mr. McFarlane was named to the top post and Admiral Poindexter became his deputy. So Admiral Poindexter was quickly catapulted from a role as a junior aide to one of the Administration's most senior positions. And he did so without sitting on the interagency committees, without having to cement relations with Congress and without having to talk with reporters - in short, without gaining the broad political and public relations experience most accomplished officials need before becoming senior members of an administration. During most of 1984 and 1985, Admiral Poindexter joined Mr. McFarlane, the President, the Vice President and other top Administration officers in the daily national security briefings. In Mr. McFarlane's absence he usually conducted the meetings. Admiral Poindexter also proved himself an able crisis planner and manager; he was credited by many in the Administration with developing much of the planning for intercepting the Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and diverting it to Italy in October 1985. And just as important, Admiral Poindexter carried out his duties in a manner that indicated he was more comfortable with assuming a role that was subordinate to his superiors. He did not attract attention. ''He wasn't the kind of officer who would do something without authority,'' said Adm. Daniel J. Murphy, the chief of staff for Vice President Bush from 1981 to 1985. ''He demonstrated an ability to communicate with the President. He showed he could run a staff. He was a natural when the job came up. Personally I thought he'd do a fantastic job.''

605-> Adams on Zionism
To the Editor: President John Adams was less a friend of Zionism than your correspondent suggests (letter, Dec. 20). Adams did, indeed, express the wish that Jews might enjoy national independence. But in his letter to Mordechai Noah he explained why: ''Once restored to an independent government and no longer persecuted they would soon wear away some of the asperities and peculiarities of their character and possibly in time become liberal Unitarian Christians.'' Adams's desire for Jewish assimilation should not be confused with the Zionist struggle for Jewish national liberation. JEROLD S. AUERBACH Prof. of History, Wellesley College Wellesley, Mass., Dec. 22, 1986

606-> IT'S PERTH: PUB-CRAWLS AND SANTA'S KANGAROOS
It was 10:30 on a Sunday morning, roughly when a New Yorker reaches for a second cup of coffee, as Kim Gibson ordered a beer at the Railway Pub and complained about her American ''protectors.'' ''It's a hassle walking around, because there are 50 American sailors at a corner, all asking you out to dinner,'' Miss Gibson, a physical therapist, said over her Swan beer. American sailors by the thousands regularly bound off their ships for shore leave in Perth. Mostly Navy men, and all instantly recognizable by their haircuts and accents, they prowl the pubs and shops for a few days before returning to sea. The Pentagon counts on ports and other installations in Australia, which have taken on greater importance recently. Events in the Philippines have raised doubts about the future of American bases there, while New Zealand has refused to allow nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships to call. That puts greater burdens on Australia, where the most frequent port of call for warships is Perth. Businesses love the free-spending visitors, and some other Australians seem equally enthusiastic. A welcoming service allowing families to offer home-cooked meals to young Navy men has been dubbed ''Dial-a-Sailor,'' because it is sometimes used by local women to get dates. Many Australians, like Miss Gibson, find this distasteful and say the sailors tend to be rude. This criticism was amplified when a guidebook to Australian iniquity, published by some sailors, was discovered and reprinted in part in local newspapers. Australia's anti-nuclear movement is concerned about nuclear-armed or -powered ships visiting Australian ports. Critics, particularly in the small Nuclear Disarmament Party, say that Australia's ties to the American Navy would make it vulnerable to nuclear attack in time of war. Aside from rare disturbances, most American sailors seem to leave a good impression. ''They're good blokes,'' said Phil Tapsell, a sporting goods salesman in Perth. ''You can get soused with them. Of course, it's different for a lady.'' Barbecues and Beaches It is summer in Australia, a gorgeous summer of sun and sand and clear blue skies. Despite campaigns against skin cancer, Australians are on the beaches in force, basting their skin with tanning oil as they barbecue themselves. It is illegal to bring the ''barbie'' to the beach, so after Australians are a chocolate brown, they retire to their backyards to throw steaks, sausages and onions on the grill. The surfing culture is giving way to wind-surfing, with young men and women using huge sails on surfboards to propel themselves at 20 or 30 miles an hour. Scores of bright sails color the vista in some bays. Color also comes from the zinc sunscreen creams that have become popular on the beaches. The white cream has largely given way to bright blue, red and yellow creams that adorn the noses of many young beach-goers. It is one of the few signs that Australians are concerned by the consequences of their reverence for the sun, including one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. Australian beachgoers may have bright red noses this time of year, but the reindeer do not. After a century of interpreting Christmas in traditional themes of snow, sleighs and a well-wrapped Santa, Australians are beginning to develop their own version of Christmas traditions. ''We're only just switching from Northern Hemisphere Christmas cards with Santa and snow and reindeer,'' said Malcolm Bryce, Western Australia's Deputy Premier. ''It doesn't snow here, and we don't have reindeer. So on cards we're now seeing kangaroos pulling sleighs instead of reindeer.'' Christmas Island, an Australian territory, went even further with a recent issue of postage stamps. They depict Santa Claus fishing, riding a power boat, relaxing in a deck chair and playing golf.

609-> The Cult Of Ceausescu
David Binder's article shows only the darker side of the President of Rumania. Mr. Binder reports that he had to submit his questions ahead of time when he requested an interview with Mr. Ceausescu. Is it not the same when you request an interview with a United States President? And what about protocol? Is there none in Washington? A cult of personality and nepotism are part of the history of Rumania, although, admittedly, a part it could do without. These are also characteristics of most Communist leaders. However, these characteristics exist to a certain extent in the West as well. For instance, in the United States, each President coming into office brings along his own team.

611-> GUINESS NAMES REPLACEMENTS FOR SAUNDERS
Guinness P.L.C., the big brewer that is under investigation by the Government, named an acting chairman and executive committee today to replace Ernest Saunders, who stepped aside Friday night as chairman and chief executive at least until the inquiry is completed. Whether Mr. Saunders, a 51-year-old marketing expert, will return after the investigation is uncertain. The Government inquiry could last several months. The inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry is concerned with share dealings during Guinness's $3.6 billion acquisition last year of the Distillers Company. Guinness won over a bid from the Argyll Group P.L.C., partly because the price of Guinness shares rose sharply during the final days of the takeover battle, lifting the value of the brewer's cash-and-stock offer. The company said Sir Norman Macfarlane, 60 years old, a Scottish businessman who joined the Guinness board last fall, would serve as chairman for the time being. An executive committee consisting of the company's three group managing directors will take over the duties of the chief executive. The three are Victor Steel, Brian Baldock and Shaun Dowling. ''The principal management task facing Guinness at the present time is to capitalize on the substantial progress which has already been made and further to continue the various development programs of the company,'' the committee said in a statement. Shares Have Dropped Most analysts predicted today that Mr. Saunders's announcement late Friday night would be regarded by the investment community as a positive development for Guinness, with the share price likely to rise Monday. The shares have fallen sharply since the Government announced its inquiry in early December. ''People will consider it a bullish decision for Guinness, a move viewed with relief after the recent uncertainty,'' said John Walters, an analyst for Chase Manhattan Securities, the London brokerage subsidiary of the American bank. Guinness shares, according to analysts, could rebound sharply if investors began focusing once again on the outlook for the big beer-and-spirits marketer's business and profits, which seem bright, instead of the uncertainties raised by the Government investigation. During the last month, Guinness was tarnished by its links with Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street speculator who has pleaded guilty to insider trading. Mr. Boesky was reportedly a substantial buyer of Distiller shares that he pledged to Guinness in the final stages of the April takeover. Then, Guinness disclosed last month that it had invested $100 million last May in a Boesky fund, without announcing it at the time. In mid-December, the company's financial adviser, the Morgan Grenfell Group, severed all ties with Guinness after reports that Guinness supplied funds for the purchase of its own shares, a possible breach of British corporate law. Guinness has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

613-> METRO DATELINES; Board Approves Cable Transfer
The Board of Estimate has ended a seven-month delay and voted to authorize the transfer of the two Manhattan cable television franchises to the American Television and Communications Corporation. Only Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin voted in opposition. The Koch administration had held up the vote since June in an effort to make the vote unanimous by getting the Comptroller's support, but Mr. Goldin remained opposed. Mr. Goldin argued Thursday night that the city should have extracted stronger guarantees from American Television that it would upgrade cable service in Manhattan. The Koch administration did not want the Comptroller to be in a position to criticize the agreement if there were problems later, but ultimately decided to proceed with the vote. It considered the franchise agreement fair and the guarantees for improved cable service the best that the city can get, administration officials said. Group W Cable Inc. currently has the franchise for the northern half of Manhattan and offers 26 channels. Manhattan Cable Television Inc. has the southern half and offers 35 channels. American Televison plans to offer 70 channels to subscribers in both halves of Manhattan by 1992.

614-> THE WORLD; A French 'Riposte' In Chad's War
France and Libya crossed an important line in Chad last week. Libyan planes bombed two towns south of the 16th parallel, the so-called Red Line established by French forces as the southern boundary for Libyan incursions. In retaliation, French jets bombed an airstrip in Libyan-controlled territory. The French, who have 1,200 troops and a squadron of fighter-bombers in their former colony, denied that the raid was an escalation in Chad's war against Libyan occupation. ''We will continue to make graduated and firm ripostes, but we don't want an escalation,'' said Denis Baudouin, the Government spokesman. An expansion of French air attacks on the Libyan occupying forces is exactly what Chad's President, Hissen Habre, wants. He is eager to take advantage of the recent split between the main Chadian rebel group and the Libyan troops, which together controlled much of the central African country's barren northern half. Last week, the guerrillas were under Libyan bombardment. The French contended that Libya's raids south of the 16th parallel represented no more than ''an insect bite'' and may have been in retaliation for its loss last weekend of Fada, a northern town, to the Chadian military and rebels. Although France and the United States have sent military supplies to Chad since the new fighting began last month, the French Defense Minister, Andre Giraud, cautioned against the ''internationalization'' of the war. Secretary of State George P. Shultz last week offered an optimistic view of Chad's ability to fight the Libyans, saying that it ''seems to be on the move.''

615-> OUT OF THE FIRE, ON TO THE FRYING PAN
IN John Sineno's kitchen, ''cooking brings something together - maybe it's because when the man upstairs did something important, he did it around a table with food.'' Mr. Sineno, a burly man, is known as ''Mama John'' to his fellow firefighters. He is also the author of the best-selling ''Firefighter's Cookbook,'' with recipes like Low Tide Chicken (''It will look like low tide on the beach'') and Popeye's Delight (with lots of spinach). The other firemen nicknamed him Mama John because, as one said, ''he's always watching over us.'' In spite of pranks like floating can labels in soup, the firefighters show their appreciation in many ways, including giving him a plaque for his ''never-ending contribution to curb the famine of his brother firemen.'' Mr. Sineno, who is 56 years old and lives in Bellerose, is now on lighter duty in Brooklyn after decades of fighting fires in Harlem. He has more time for his cooking, which started with his grandmother and made its way down through the generations, with a new generation of recipes. Some of these, like pina colada cheesecake or artichoke pie, have found immortality in ''The Firefighter's Cookbook,'' with the condition that if you eat them in a firehouse the meal is sure to be interrupted by a fire alarm. The up-to-date firefighters even include a vegetarian, who contributed Kenny's Vegetarian Dish to the cookbook. It also turns out, as proved by the name of a recipe from a fire medic, that firemen do eat quiche. For Mama John, fighting fires and cooking are family matters. That's why he wanted the cookbook to be not his, he said, but a ''team effort with as many names of firefighters as possible.'' From the time he served in the military, to his days collecting garbage and now fighting fires, Mr. Sineno said, he has always been ''into the family concept, working together.'' ''I believe in the real thing, not in the beard and the earring,'' he said. ''I was always part of a team.'' So deep is his commitment and loyalty to the family of firemen that he took along a fireman's widow when he appeared on the ''Phil Donahue Show.'' His culinary roots hark back to Italy. He grew up on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, the son of Italian immigrants. His grandmother, he said, was ''an ancient lady of immense proportions who takes credit for a large number of the menus enclosed in this cookbook. 'Mangia, mangia!' she told her family.'' When Mr. Sineno was 11 years old, his mother told him to cook while she worked in a sweatshop. First he did chicken cacciatore. Then, ''being a young fellow, you want to surprise Mom,'' he recalled. ''You use a little imagination. I did some broccoli with garlic and lemon. She liked it. There's nothing like Mom. When you lose them, you know you lost something.'' Those ''women from the other side'' gave their children a special birthright, he said, the ability to cook anything from a knish to a quiche. His book is a celebration of the way to the American heart, with its mix of Mulligan stew, scungilli, jambalaya, Arizona mountain soup and pot roast. American verities, from mom to apple pie, culminate in the final recipe of the book, a sort of poem entitled a ''Recipe for a Firefighter.'' The ingredients include ''strength, endurance, humor, humility'' and ''the glaze of love to make them shine.'' The recipe is a kind of American sampler of old virtues, like the ceramic sampler honoring mothers over John Sineno's kitchen sink. At home in Bellerose, his wife of 31 years, Pauline, is boss of the kitchen. Their five children, ages 16 to 24, all live and eat at home. Although Mr. Sineno has fed as many as 1,500 firemen and police officers over a short time during an emergency, his wife feeds this brood. Mr. Sineno is as proud of his wife and family as he is of his culinary renown. He tells his story in a spicy vernacular dug from Italian roots and mixed with the streetwise language of his children. He became a firefighter, he said. when ''I was a young fellow on the garbage truck and a couple of fellows talked me into taking the test - you know, let's get out of this job.'' The chief of the Harlem firehouse where he was assigned asked him if he could cook. He became chef of that ''always hungry group of muscular, loud, raucous and often profane characters.'' They fought fires and cooked in the busiest firehouse in the world. ''I cooked in times you may never see again,'' Mr. Sineno said. ''You're talking Malcolm X and riots.'' His culinary talents leaked out when he won contests. ''It started with rice pudding and just kept going,'' he said. He made a television appearance with his contest-winning rice pudding, and after the show more than 8,000 people asked for the recipe, he said. His cheesecake won him another firehouse cooking contest. ''I went with my best shot, the ordinary blueberry cheesecake,'' he said. ''Cheesecake seemed to win for me.'' As a result, he was asked to appear on the Donahue show. The cheesecakes proliferated - from pineapple cheesecake, which he called XC4 Experimental Cheesecake 4, all the way to the last, Passion Fruit Cheesecake No. 26. Perhaps his most unusual inspiration won him the McDonald's Contest for Cooking Firemen. Contestants could use only McDonald's ingredients and equipment. ''I came up with like a knish,'' Mr. Sineno recalled. ''I used some of their potatoes and mashed them with eggs, pancake mix and sausage patties. I told them you call it what you want. All I could think of was a knish.'' He won a plaque bearing a spatula. Despite his honors, he said, ''the firemen never compliment you, they drive you wacky - you find forks at the bottom of the pudding.'' He takes the pranks with a grain of salt, though, especially when the food disappears quickly. ''You know they have enjoyed themselves,'' he said. ''I look at the plate and say, 'What do you want to put it in the dishwasher for?' '' Mr. Sineno's bountiful gastronomy goes with his armchair philosophy, expressed in his feelings about the firefighter's job. ''You don't look at your own sacrifice,'' he said. ''It's the caring part of people, the thing that motivates living itself. One Easter morning I pulled out a girl about 6 from a fire. You say, 'Thank God there's another kid to enjoy the holiday.' '' His best cooking experience, he said, was for a firehouse reunion, when retired firefighters came from around the country. ''To see how they come when all you do is bring people together around food, that's great,'' he said. The reward, more than food, is ''the way they compliment you by insulting you.'' As an explanation for the success of his book, Mr. Sineno had this to say: ''Having five kids and a wife of 31 years, I know the woman today is handicapped. She has to go out and work, and where does she get time to learn to cook? One of the firemen's wives told me that all the pages of her copy of the book are stained, so I knew the book was helping. ''It's a tough ball game today. People need all the help they can get. I always said if it was simple, it would work.'' What is Mr. Sineno's favorite food? ''I go with the macaroni style, or I go the other route with the mussels and clams,'' he said. ''What you eat never kills you,'' he went on. ''It's the company you keep. If you're contented, what more do you want?''

616-> NEW YORKERS, ETC.
THE other night an executive, dining at a moderately sized restaurant, paid his check with a credit card and added a rather generous tip. When the young waitress returned his card she said, ''Thank you very much, Charles.'' The two had never met - she had seen his name on the credit card. The man was stunned, he said, but not outraged. That stage had passed some time ago, and he had grown weary of fighting the battle against indiscriminate use of his first name. In fact, he explained, in most cases he didn't even hear it anymore - he had become immune. The restaurant episode surprised him because that degree of presumption was a first. But there are people - and they're not all members of the younger generation - who like, and even prefer, being familiarly addressed by anyone and everyone. Jack Eastman, a trustee of the Skowhegan School, is one of them. ''I don't mind at all,'' he said. ''I think it's friendly. The only time I think it impertinent is from a telephone salesman.'' However, on the whole there's a fair amount of resentment about the casual taking over of what once was a sign of friendship and intimacy, an occurrence now so commonplace that it's frequently jolted into consciousness only by a particular incident. ''There's a kind of naivete, an ingenuousness, in the assumption that you want to be called by your first name,'' said Daniel Moriarty, a senior vice president of Revlon. ''My European friends tell me how amused they are that Americans presume it's a mark of friendliness to use first names on first meeting.'' Mr. Moriarty, whose business entails a good deal of traveling, said that he believed that much of the first-name informality had drifted in from the West Coast, and that a further refinement was possibly on the way. ''In Los Angeles these days, it's a mark of friendliness not to introduce people by their last names at all,'' he said. ''They say 'Edie and Bill, I'd like you to meet Tom and Mary.' It drives me berserk.'' It was difficult to make even a mild comment about the name situation without being considered stuffy, Mr. Moriarty said, but he allowed that there were exceptions. In hospitals, he pointed out, where young people frequently addressed critically ill older people by their first names, it seemed to communicate a feeling of caring. But generally, he believed, ''the indiscriminate use of first names is inappropriate.'' Frances Lear, whose new magazine, Lear's, will be out in August, said it was always a shock when she heard her first name being used by people she didn't know. ''I mind tremendously speaking on the phone to a very young voice and having it say 'yes, Frances,' '' she said. ''I tend to get very crisp. I think I've earned something more than that.'' ABOUT the only exception to the first-name taboo was a doctor, she said: I'm so used to doctors being authority figures.'' For Jane Evans, a doctor's use of a first name ''adds a bit of familiarity that breaks through the nervousness you feel about the medical profession.'' But from other virtual strangers, ''it puts me off,'' she said. Ms. Evans, former president of Monet Jewelers and now a partner in Montgomery Securities of San Fransisco, considered the practice ''demeaning,'' she said. She was especially indignant when it was done by a disembodied telephone voice. ''I'll bet this doesn't happen to men as often as it does to women,'' she added. Alice Tepper Marlin just returned from three months in Japan, and getting used to hearing first names strewn around like confetti took a bit of doing. But, she said, that didn't mean that she is completely against the practice. ''I don't like it on the telephone,'' said Ms. Marlin, president of the Council on Economic Priorities. ''But I don't mind it face to face.'' Did she have any preference about how she was addressed by younger people? She laughed: ''With my children's friends, I prefer Alice because it doesn't make me feel as old,'' she said. Reciprocity is the name of the game as far as Julie Robbins Greenwald is concerned. The associate product manager for Knoll International, Ms. Greenwald, who is in her mid-20's, said she didn't mind anyone calling her by her first name if she could use theirs. But, she said, she objected to doctors using patients' first names, because patients rarely had the same privilege. ''My husband is a doctor,'' she said. ''He often calls his patients by their first name and they like it. And yet they call him 'doctor.' I don't agree with that. I think it's insulting.'' And then, said one man, there are some situations that are half-and-half. This man recently joined a prestigious health club and the trainer asked whether he'd prefer to be called ''John'' or ''Mr. Jones.'' ''I prefer Mr. Jones,'' he said. ''But when I'm running around in my shorts, you can call me John.''

619-> Reagan Friends Buy Him a Place to Retire
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, may retire to a $2.5-million estate in the exclusive Bel Air section of Los Angeles, White House officials said today. A group of nearly 20 friends of the Reagans chipped in and purchased the home Aug. 21, according to Elaine Crispen, a spokesman for Mrs. Reagan. The friends, including Holmes Tuttle, a California businessman, set up a holding company to buy the home and are now leasing it back to the original owner, Mrs. Crispen said. The spokesman said the Reagans had not decided whether to purchase the home from the holding company when the President leaves office in January 1989. She said they had no legal obligation to buy the property. The Reagans own a ranch in the hills above Santa Barbara, Calif., but their friends thought the Reagans would want a larger residence. The estate reportedly has a pool, 6,500 square feet of living space and one and a quarter acres of choice real estate. The house was purchased by Ira Revich, a Beverly Hills lawyer, who acted in behalf of the holding company, said Dale Petroskey, a White House spokesman.

620-> 'REAL MONASTIC LIFE' LIES TUCKED AWAY IN THE SUSSEX HILLS
WHEN the Order of St. Benedict was revived in 19th-century Europe, one of its new congregations, the Ottiliens, set up abbeys in Africa, Manchuria, South America ''and other places.'' This Sussex County community set among rolling hills is one of those ''other places,'' and in 1924 Bavarian monks who had been exiled or imprisoned during World War I established St. Paul's here. The unlikely foreign mission is believed to be the only Ottilien outpost in North America. St. Benedict of Nursii (A.D. 480?-A.D. 543?) is the patriarch of Western monasticism. The congregation's namesake, St. Ottilien, was a seventh-century blind girl whose baptism was said to have restored her sight; thus, the congregation's motto: ''Light to the Blind.'' ''We live in the present while remembering our ancient past,'' said the Rev. Basil Wallace, a gray-bearded monk with a gentle manner and quick smile. Recent interviews here with a dozen local residents, historians, librarians and the so-called ''Black Monks'' showed that the congregation is not only an anomaly of religious life in New Jersey, but also one that has been ignored almost completely by history. For example, only two short pamphlets, written by the monks themselves, are on file at the Sussex County Library. They were published in the 1960's and 70's. Yet it is evident that St. Paul's is rich in the traditional humanistic spiritualism of the Benedictines, a serene way of life that has touched the many thousands of people who have come here on religious retreats or otherwise visited the abbey over the last 63 years. ''This is the real monastic life,'' said the Rev. Justin Dzikowicz, the abbot of St. Paul's. In some ways, life at the abbey has changed considerably since 1924. In a letter sent to superiors in Bavaria that year, one monk wrote that the congregation was being ''closely watched'' by the Ku Klux Klan and that ''religious intolerance'' of Catholics was prevalent in the county. Although some of the monks speak German, it is just as likely these days that they were born in Jersey City, like Father Dzikowicz, or in Brooklyn, like Father Wallace. St. Paul's comprises 500 acres of farmlands and woods on the east and west sides of Route 206. The monastery where the monks now live was built in 1962 and is on the east side of the road; the stately Nor-mandy Romanesque retreat house operated by the congregation is on the west side, concealing within its stone facade a small 1840's farmhouse that was the original monastery. Historic anecdotes about the abbey were obtained from interviews with older Newton residents, including 85-year-old William E. Linden, who was the Fire Chief in 1948, when the abbey's barn caught fire. ''They called and asked me what to do,'' Mr. Linden said. ''I told them to pray that the wind would shift, and it did. The barn burned down, though.'' Water finally was pumped to the fire from the center of town, two miles away, and the blaze was contained. Mr. Linden recalled how St. Paul's was established from the purchase of the Red Gate and Harry Fritts farms. In the early days, one of the monks was the fire company's chaplain, he said, adding:. ''They were a great bunch of boys and men.'' James E. Quinn, who formerly presided over Municipal Court in Newton and is a retired State Superior Court judge, remembered the founding abbot, the Rev. Michael Heinlein of Germany, as a ''very vibrant, outgoing man.'' Father Heinlein and the other monks who began the monastery, Judge Quinn said, became active in the community right away. Before St. Paul's was elevated to the status of abbey in 1947, it had become more than just a self-sustaining farm, maintaining as it did a full-size dairy with Holstein cows. Milk, poultry, wheat and alfalfa were sold to the public until the farming died out in the late 1950's. As Father Wallace and Father Dzikowicz explained it, by the early 1960's the Vatican had revolutionized the clerical life by restructuring the mass and the emphasis that it placed on lay participation in church activities, some of which had belonged to monks only. Orders such as the Benedictines lost many brothers, monks who were not ordained priests and who made PU JP MONKS up most of the 55 men then living at St. Paul's. The size and function of the abbey changed abruptly. There are now about 20 monks living here at any one time, and several members of the order are stationed in foreign missions, such as the one in Tanzania. However, the scaling down has not necessarily been for the worse, Father Dzikowicz said. The 55 monks had to be managed more like a small army, he recalled, adding that the current number is more manageable and makes for a more casual and personal way of life. ''The quality of life here has been enriched, I think,'' said Father Dzikowicz. Despite the changes, the Benedictines still follow a modern adaptation of the 1,500-year-old Rule of St. Benedict, a style of life that has been imitated by all orders as the standard of monasticism. The day begins at 5:40 A.M., and is divided into prayer, work that is designed to keep the abbey the autonomous and financially self-sustaining entity it must be, helping out others and study. The day ends at 7:30 P.M. The monks raise their own pick-and-cut Christmas trees, and in 1985 sold more than 5,000 at $20 each. They also cultivate honey bees, and the 50 or so hives produce a finished product that is sold, as are religious articles, in the small gift shop near the monastery. There are usually a couple of steers around to provide meat that, like most meals, is cooked and served by the monks themselves. Although the monks no longer can be found illuminating manuscripts or performing stern penances, their present duties sometimes are as demanding. For example, they must balance a budget that seldom leaves room for any amenities, or even such necessities as repairs to the aging retreat house and monastery. In 1984, the boiler in the retreat house failed, and people using the retreat helped raise $50,000 to purchase a new one. And then there is the earthy business of the monks maintaining their own sewage-treatment plant. Whereas the Christmas trees may find their way into the hearts of people, the retreat house is where the monks reach out for souls. People who use the retreat come from parish groups, groups organized by the abbey itself and self-help groups, as well as clerics and members of other faiths. The Rev. Joel Macul is the prior of the abbey, which means he is second in command. He said that the retreat was booked for just about every weekend and that about 3,000 people came to it each year. The basic weekend retreat has changed substantially over the years, according to Father Wallace. Whereas it once was a highly regimented two days of prayer, supplication and silence, he said, it is now less structured and more individualized. The cost is about $60 a person. Vestiges of the old monastic life, such as the bell that calls people in retreat to meals, are still evident, although guitar music and singing -not so monastic - could be heard in individual rooms in the retreat house. Father Wallace said that the customary rule of silence was now balanced with other activities and that the monks ''adapt the retreat to what the needs of the group or individual are.'' ''If you feel that you want to take a walk in the woods to get in touch with the Lord,'' he said, ''you can do that here. ''We offer the possibility that, by listening and prayer, the Lord can reach out. We let the Lord do His thing.''

621-> SUZANA AMARAL: HER 'HOUR' HAS COME
Suzana Amaral was married at age 20, and in the next 10 years had eight children. At 37, she entered the University of Sao Paulo film school, and went on to get a master's degree in film at New York University. She is now 54, and her first full-length theatrical feature, ''The Hour of the Star'' - a film about the troubled life of a young woman in Sao Paulo that the Brazilian director shot in four weeks for $150,000 - opens Wednesday at Film Forum 1, after having won awards at the Berlin, Brasilia, Havana and International Woman's Film Festivals and having been selected as Brazil's official entry for the best foreign-language film Academy Award. ''I think that Jung is right,'' Ms. Amaral says, showing no effects of a nine-and-a-half hour flight from Sao Paulo. ''It's in the second half of your life that your real life begins.'' The diminutive Ms. Amaral - certainly no more than 4 feet 10 or 11 inches tall, certainly nowhere near 100 pounds - smiles with the memories of the first part of her life. ''For 10 years I was just a mother,'' she says. ''I was totally dedicated to motherhood. It was sort of a creative time for me, raising all those children. I didn't have to cook, so I didn't. My ex-husband was a physician -we're divorced now - and we were living in the countryside, and we had maids, but I never gave my children to anyone to take care of - I brought them up myself.'' The legend in Brazil about Ms. Amaral is that she would fill the bathtub and put all eight children in at the same time. She'd let them play for a half hour, and then she'd dress them in the clothes they were going to wear the next day - including shoes - and put them to bed, so they would be ready to go in the morning. ''It's true,'' she says. ''When you have two or three children, you do a lot, but when you have eight, you have so much to do that you do nothing - and there were so many to bathe.'' She had always, though, had dreams about the movies. ''I was brought up in the star-system generation,'' she says. ''I went to the movies every Sunday, and I admired American films, and I wrote to actors and actresses and got letters back. And so I had a secret need. First, when I was a child, I wanted to be an actress. I said to my grandmother, 'When I grow up, I want to be a star.' And she said, 'Well, Rin Tin Tin is also a movie star.' So I gave up this idea, but I still had the secret wish of really wanting to work in the movies.'' In the late 60's, she and her husband moved with their youngsters to Sao Paulo, where her relatives were longtime members of the intellectual and artistic community - her brother is an artist and her sister an art critic and museum director. ''The oldest children were getting into adolescence,'' she says, ''and I didn't have as much to do, and I said to myself, well, I always thought that for the second half of my life I would like to have a career. My eldest son was 17, he was just about to go to university, and I said, I think I should go to university, too, because I had given up my studies to get married. By that time, the film school had opened, and I said that's it, that's what I want to do. So I went to university with my son - we were in some of the same classes together.'' While still in film school she had her ninth child - ''I think it was sort of a try between my husband and myself - or what my husband did to see if he could keep me at home.'' It didn't work, because soon after they were divorced. After graduating, she went to work for a television station - ''sort of like Channel 13 in New York'' - first as a news reporter and then in documentary production. ''I'm still part of the station today,'' she says, ''and over the years I've done 50 documentaries, films and plays for them.'' Then, in 1976, she decided she wanted to make feature films - ''but I didn't know how to.'' So she applied for a grant, and came to N.Y.U., where she stayed for three years, in the same class as Jim Jarmusch (''Stranger Than Paradise,'' ''Down by Law'') and a year ahead of Susan Seidelman (''Desperately Seeking Susan''). ''N.Y.U. was a wonderful place to learn about making films,'' she says, ''and I will be forever grateful to it. And New York is magnificent, too. I lived at Third Street and Sixth Avenue for three years, and I found out how special this city is. It takes a long time to get a friend here, but once you do, it's for a lifetime. New York is like bubble gum - once you step in it, it sticks to you, and you can't get it off.'' It was at N.Y.U. that Ms. Amaral first thought of making ''The Hour of the Star,'' which is based on a short novel by Clarice Lispector, a writer well known in Brazil who has been called the premier Latin American woman prose writer of this century. ''I had just heard that Clarice Lispector had died,'' Ms. Amaral says. ''She had been someone I had respected since my adolescence, when I had first read her, and I went to N.Y.U.'s library and the first of her books I saw on the shelf was 'The Hour of the Star.' I took it home and read it, and felt right away that I had to make a movie from it.'' The short novel tells of Macabea, an impoverished, unattractive and unintelligent 19-year-old girl who moves to Sao Paulo from the northeast of Brazil, long a poor, rural and backward area. ''I'm a virgin, a typist and I like Coca-Cola,'' Macabea says in the film. Her boyfriend describes her as ''a hair in my soup.'' ''When I read the book,'' Ms. Amaral says, ''I had two feelings. First, that when I first came to New York I felt a little like Macabea when she first comes to Sao Paulo - so I had an empathy with her. And second, Macabea seemed to me - she still does -to be a big metaphor of my country. She's an antiheroine. What's a hero? A hero dramatically speaking is the one who acts. Macabea does not act; she's an antihero, she is acted upon, she waits for all those people to act upon her, and she reacts. I always said to myself I would like to make up a story about a character who would symbolize the Brazilian people, and Brazilians are sort of antiheroes. ''When you are out of your own country, you learn about your own country. If you are an American and you go to Brazil, you start learning about America. The perspective is different when you are away - when you are here you are too close to see clearly. And when I was out of Brazil I discovered Brazil. In Brazil, people do not act, they react. The government makes laws, changes laws, makes economic plans, and people do not act, they only react. Most of the things that happen in my country, if they were to happen in this country it would make a revolution, but not in Brazil.'' After graduating from N.Y.U., Ms. Amaral went back to Brazil and back to television, saving money to buy the rights to the book, which she was able to do in 1982. She stayed in television, worked on the screenplay and tried to raise money to make the film. Then Embrafilme, the Brazilian national film institute, advanced her 70 percent of her projected budget. ''But I still needed the other 30 percent, so I went to private investors. One of my sons is an investor - he has 2 percent.'' ''It's funny in a way,'' she says. ''I wanted a certain Brazilian director of photography, and my producer said it would cost us about $2,000 more and we didn't have the money, so I said, 'If I get the $2,000, can we hire him?' and he said yes. So I called one of my kids and said would you become one of my investors and give me $2,000, and he said O.K. And the next day I called the producer and said, 'We can hire him. I've got the money.' '' Then began the search for the actress to play Macabea. ''I wanted an actress who was not known,'' Ms. Amaral says. ''And I would surround her with well-known Brazilian actors. I started looking for an actress in very small theater groups - in Sao Paulo very often many groups from the rest of the country come to do their plays. And in one of the groups from the north I saw Macabea - I saw this actress, and from the moment she got on stage I knew she was the one. It was the economy of her acting. She never overacted. I said, this girl has a very low voice that wasn't that good for theater, but she's going to be a marvelous film actress.'' Marcelia Cartaxo, Ms. Amaral's Macabea, won the Silver Bear award last year as best actress at the Berlin Film Festival and the award for best actress at the 1985 Brasilia Film Festival. Ms. Amaral shot the film in four weeks - ''because I had to,'' she says. In addition to the acting prizes, the film was selected as best picture and Ms. Amaral as best director at the Brasilia festival; it won first prize at the 1986 Havana Film Festival, and Ms. Amaral won the first prize as best director at the 1986 International Woman's Film Festival in France. The film ran for six months in Sao Paulo, five in Rio, has taken in about $1 million and is scheduled to open in nearly a dozen cities worldwide this year. Ms. Amaral says she isn't quite sure how to explain its success so far. ''I wanted to make a good film,'' she says, ''but I didn't expect all the awards it's received.'' One reason for the acclaim, she believes, is the audience's identification with and empathy for Macabea. ''I feel that Macabea is really a universal person,'' she says. ''All of us have Macabea in us. You know the story of the ugly duckling - there's an ugly side of all of us, a failed side, no matter how successful we are, and that's what people identify with.'' She also thinks that one of the main points of the story is the lack of communication between people, something everyone faces in his or her daily life. ''Macabea isn't very well cultured, she doesn't know what to talk to people about. She's from the north of Brazil, which is so very different from the south she has come to - even the same words sometimes do not mean the same thing. It's the same Portuguese, but it's different, it's a different way of talking, a different way of behavior, everything is different. And then there's the lack of communication between Macabea and her boyfriend, Olimpico, the lack of communication that sometimes happens between men and women. Both of them are ignorant, but he is pretentious. I try to portray reality, and this is too often the relationship between men and women in Brazil, because of the macho thing.'' Ms. Amaral feels that the film can be read on different levels. ''You can take it literally, as a very simple and naive story, and that's it. But then if you start thinking about it you can think about the Brazil metaphor, male-female relationships, a social level about the rich and the poor, or whatever else you find in it. I think a good film is a film that starts when the lights go on. When the film is over, that's when the film should start in your head. When you leave the theater thinking about the film and you go to have coffee with your friends and you cannot forget what you've seen and you start talking about the film, it's a good film.'' She is now working on the screenplay for her second feature, also based on a Clarice Lispector novel, ''Near the Wild Heart.'' But she has also had an offer to direct a film in Mexico, and she is thinking about other options. ''I think it is important for a woman to acknowledge the fact that when they are around 35 or 40, they should start thinking about the second half of their lives,'' she says. ''I don't know if it's different in this country, but in Brazil too many people who are between 40 and 50 think they should sit around waiting for death - they don't think they can start something new in their lives. I think that's wrong. That's when it really starts. I'm full of energy. I'm still a mother, but to be a mother is not a profession. It's a condition of life. Women should not take motherhood as a profession - a profession is other things.''

622-> MUSIC: FOSS AND 'MODERNS'
LUKAS FOSS, that indefatigable champion of contemporary and American music, brought his customary zeal and a widely diversified program to Cooper Union Friday night as part of the Brooklyn Philharmonic's ''Meet the Moderns'' chamber series. Robert Stern's ''Ancora una Fantasia,'' a brief, felicitous amalgamation of Renaissance madrigal and third-stream jazz, began the program. John Downey's ''Discourse for Oboe, Harpsichord and String Orchestra'' combined expert, Modernist continuo writing for the harpsichord, buzzing clusters for the strings, and a gracious cantilena for the oboe, complete with genuinely musical use of multiphonics. The work lingered rather too long, but made, for the most part, engrossing listening, and included a surprise or two - such as lyrical passages that reminded the listener of nothing so much as the pastorales of Vaughan Williams. Henry Schuman and Kenneth Bowen were the excellent soloists. Richard Trythall's ''Bolero'' for four percussionists was also overlong, but made a grand noise as it tapped, rattled, clattered and thundered the bolero rhythm, surging and abating by turn. Ivan Tcherepnin's ''New Rhythmantics IV'' was built on short snippets of the scale played by a chamber ensemble, enhanced by a synthesizer and nurtured until they metamorphosed into a celebration of echo and repetition. Leo Kraft's Clarinet Concerto, in its world premiere, combined idiomatic solo writing with a dense accompanimental web of orchestral sound. The concerto is a work of scope and dignity -which did not preclude a jaunty central scherzo and a concluding wail that seemed to have escaped from the klezmer repertory. Steven D. Hartman played with passion and finesse. The program closed with Dr. Kenneth A. Altman's ''High Flight'' for soprano and orchestra, a simple, hymn-like creation from a gifted musical amateur; Diana Walker's singing was appropriately heartfelt.

624-> THEATER; 'DAVID LEVINSKY' MATERIALIZES AGAIN
IN the various embodiments of his stage life over a decade, the fictitious character David Levinsky has materialized in such diverse settings as the auditorium of a synagogue on Manhattan's Upper East Side and a regional theater in New Jersey. Tommorrow night, in its newest incarnation, ''The Rise of David Levinsky,'' the musical about a Russian immigrant who comes to America as a Talmudic scholar and winds up as a clothing manufacturer and entrepreneur, is scheduled to open at Off Broadway's new John Houseman Theater Center, 450 West 42d Street. Essentially, this is the version seen at New Brunswick's George Street Playhouse last spring - or at least 80 percent of it, by the estimation of Eric Krebs, George Street's founder and producing director and the sole producer of ''Levinsky.'' The show's author and lyricist (Isaiah Sheffer), its composer (Bobby Paul) and, among others, its director (Sue Lawless), its conductor (Lanny Meyers) and its sets, costume and lighting designers (Kenneth Foy, Mimi Maxmen and Phil Monat, respectively) were all included in the George Street list of credits. The saga of Levinsky's materialistic success - and moral bankruptcy - began as a novel by Abraham Cahan, who was editor of The Jewish Daily Forward. The novel was published in 1917, and Mr. Sheffer and Mr. Paul used it as the source for a stage musical that was presented by the American Jewish Theater at Manhattan's 92d Street Y.M.H.A. in 1983. Seven years earlier, the musical ''Levinsky'' was seen at the Central Synagogue auditorium in Manhattan in a Yiddish version. The George Street ''Levinsky,'' which ran from last April 16 through May 11, was the most expensive production of the theater's season. It cost $150,000, Mr. Krebs said; the Off-Broadway staging is budgeted at $400,000. For all that, a ''more-simplified period feeling'' was being sought for the intimate Houseman Theater (which has 68 fewer seats than the George Street Playhouse). A synthesizer in the orchestra was eliminated, reducing the number of instruments to two: a piano and a violin. And material was ''trimmed,'' Mr. Krebs said. The show's running time was shortened by about 20 minutes -to under 2 1/2 hours. About the show's content, Mr. Krebs said: ''The story of Levinsky is a metaphor for the American dream of success. We believe in equality and in 'me first.' Levinsky gets caught up in the whirlwind of competition and becomes a driven man. Can he still be decent?'' To put him in touch with lost idealism, Levinsky is constantly confronted by his younger self, David, the musical's central image. David represents his conscience and the possibility of redemption. In the Off-Broadway show, Levinsky is played by Larry Kert, a veteran of Broadway musicals. He was the original Tony in ''West Side Story'' in 1957 and also the original Bobby in ''Company,'' the Stephen Sondheim musical. He is now making his Off-Broadway debut. Before a recent preview, Mr. Kert analyzed the Levinsky character. ''I don't feel like he's a user,'' he said. ''Levinsky cares about getting ahead. He justifies the occasional shady deal, but it's not premeditated. ''And even though he says 'bye-bye' to his studies when he sees his first $25 a week, his passion for learning never stops.'' During the first week of previews, which began Dec. 25, changes were being tried out: a speedier beginning, a less-ambiguous ending and a sharper focus on the contradictions and complexities within Levinsky's character (his steeliness and sensitivity and the defining and resolving of the relationship between Levinsky and David). The previewed performances were extended and the opening night postponed from last Wednesday to tomorrow. ''In the songs,'' said Mr. Kert, who is noted for the range of his lyric baritone voice, ''I go for the drama. I don't think of this as a musical comedy. ''The show's opening needs tightening, but we have the luxury and guidance of a secure and strong director and a concentrated story about one man's dream.'' Inevitably, Mr. Kert referred to the last theatrical venture in which he co-starred: The $6 million musical failure ''Rags,'' which opened and closed in the same week last August. That show also dealt with the immigrant experience but, Mr. Kert said, ''Rags'' was ''fragmented.'' It also suffered a change in concept brought about by a change of directors during tryout performances. Ever the entrepreneur himself, Mr. Krebs, who lives in Highland Park, developed and had the 299-seat Houseman Theater built at a cost of $1 million. He has produced several Off-Broadway plays and musicals and is a faculty member at Rutgers University's Mason Gross School of the Arts. ''I produce in New York around my George Street schedules and between semesters,'' Mr. Krebs said. As for the New York prospects for ''Levinsky,'' he said: ''The audiences at George Street loved it, but we knew more work had to be done. Fine-tuning a musical is a monstrous process, but now we really have something powerful. I'm not Jewish, but I know this is the best show I've ever produced.''

625-> RECORDINGS; NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC UNDER VARIOUS BATONS
For both general and specific reasons, the New York Philharmonic records far less often than it used to. Still, on two labels with three conductors recorded in three locations, the orchestra has been represented on four new releases in recent months. Before we get to them, however, let's consider why the orchestra's recorded output has been both reduced and fragmented. In the good old days, the Philharmonic, like all the major American orchestras, had an exclusive contract - in its case, with CBS - under which it made a myriad of recordings in the 1960's, when Leonard Bernstein was music director. Actually, as the orchestra's manager, Albert K. Webster, points out, the Philharmonic-CBS contract was an anachronism when it finally expired in 1982. By then, the more common pattern was for orchestras to freelance among interested labels for specific projects. One reason for the decline of the exclusive contract was the increasing disparity in labor costs between the recording of American orchestras and their lower-paid European competition. Another was the concentration by record companies on star conductors, rather than star orchestras. As with nearly all American orchestras today, the Philharmonic's recordings usually get made only if the orchestra itself, through a variety of mechanisms, helps sponsor the project. Labor costs can be included as part of the musicians' regular services, paid by the orchestra. Or the orchestra can accept reduced royalties. Or special funding can be invoked to pay for recording sessions. The Philharmonic is hardly being recorded less today because it has deteriorated as an ensemble. Far from it: its new recordings reveal playing that is better than ever. But the orchestra has a specific problem, in that its current music director, Zubin Mehta, doesn't sell many records, at least with the Philharmonic and especially in Europe. Christine Reed, until recently vice president for artists and repertory at CBS Masterworks, was quoted in a recent High Fidelity magazine article as saying that the label ''couldn't give away the orchestra and Zubin Mehta in Europe.'' Perhaps as a result, CBS has had a Mehta-Philharmonic-Brahms First Symphony recording ''in the can,'' recorded but unreleased, for several years. Another problem seems to be indecision as to where to record the Philharmonic. Critics complain about the strident sound of concerts in the orchestra's home, Avery Fisher Hall. But Mr. Bernstein, for one, likes to record concerts live, so his Philharmonic disks are done at Fisher Hall, along with the inevitable touchup sessions. But the orchestra has also made studio recordings at the Manhattan Center in midtown and the State University of New York at Purchase. Even with all these difficulties, Philharmonic recordings do get made, with Mr. Mehta and others. In recent years there have been three Wagner disks with Mr. Mehta, among them a first act of ''Die Walkure'' with Eva Marton and Peter Hofmann, along with a George Crumb-William Schuman pairing for New World Records conducted by Arthur Weisberg and Mr. Mehta. Right now, already completed or soon to be recorded, are Paine's Symphony No. 2 and an Itzhak Perlman violin showpieces collection with Mr. Mehta; the Third Symphonies of Mr. Schuman and Roy Harris with Mr. Bernstein; a Strauss tone poem set with Giuseppe Sinopoli and, again with Mr. Bernstein, live recordings of this springs's Ives Second and Fourth Symphonies and Mahler's Second (''Resurrection'') Symphony. The fact is that the Philharmonic seems to record at least as much for Mr. Bernstein, its ''laureate conductor,'' and Mr. Sinopoli as for Mr. Mehta. Mr. Bernstein is the most active, and Deutsche Grammophon recently issued his accounts of the Mahler Symphony No. 7 (419 211, two CD's; all releases come in all three configurations) and Aaron Copland's Symphony No. 3, with his ''Quiet City'' (419 170). Both disks are very fine, but both invite comparisons with earlier CBS recordings by Mr. Bernstein and the Philharmonic. Mr. Bernstein's Philharmonic Mahler symphony cycle in the 1960's was a noteworty event in phonographic history - and musical history, since it did so much to popularize Mahler. These performances, recently reissued on CBS compact disks (the Seventh is with the Ninth and the Adagio from the Tenth on M3K 42200, three disks), still sound very good - lean and impassioned, with an intensity that validates their emotional extremism. The DG Seventh inaugurates a new Bernstein Mahler cycle, using the Philharmonic, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and the Vienna Philharmonic (the Concertgebouw Ninth is already out in Europe). In the Seventh, tempos for each movement are just a little slower, and the orchestral tone is weightier. Those who love Mr. Bernstein's original Mahler, now that it has been sonically revitalized on CD, don't have to rush to buy this new performance -especially since the new Seventh, slightly over 80 minutes long, on two CD's represents poor value for the money. That said, the new performance is marginally superior to the old one, when you take orchestral execution and sonic realism into account. The same distinctions inform Mr. Bernstein's old and new Copland Thirds -the old one is presently out of print, although a CBS official said the label would be releasing it at some point on CD. Twenty years ago, Mr. Bernstein and the orchestra sounded trimmer, more youthful and perhaps slightly more intense. The new version is slower in every movement by a small amount, better played and recorded, and in this symphony especially, with its quiet grandeur, marginally more effective. All four performances, it should be added - the two Mahlers and the two Coplands - are absolutely first rate. DG has also released a Wagner collection conducted by Mr. Sinopoli (419 169). This fine-sounding disk offers the ''Meistersinger'' Prelude, the ''Flying Dutchman'' Overture, the ''Siegfried Idyll'' and the two ''Lohengrin'' Preludes. Mr. Sinopoli is an interesting conductor, simultaneously analytical and impassioned. His performances will not set aside those of, say, Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch and Klemperer. But they're well worth hearing. Mr. Mehta crops up among these latest releases with a new-music record on the honorable if not highly visible New World label, which receives philanthropic financing - in this case, from Francis Goulet (an active Philharmonic board member), the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts - for its explorations of neglected American music both old and new. This release (NW 335), a most attractive one, offers George Rochberg's effectively lush, Romantic Oboe Concerto, with the Philharmonic's principal, Joseph Robinson, as soloist, and Jacob Druckman's ''Prism.'' This last filters music by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Cavalli and Cherubini through a Modernist ''prism'' in a disturbing, ultimately moving way. Mr. Mehta conducts efficiently, without revealing much love for or insight into the music.

626-> LONG ISLAND OPINION; SEEKING THE PULSE OF THE ISLAND
IT always makes me laugh to see a segment on a national news program in which the correspondent signs off, ''And this is so-and-so reporting from Long Island, New York.'' To a non-native, it would seem that Long Island was a specific place. But what resident sees it that way? Despite having grown up on Long Island and living a number of my adult years there, I have never been able to see it as a unified, homogeneous place. On Long Island, you would never say that you are a Long Islander; people identify with their town or village. A place that stretches over one hundred miles is bound to have an identity problem. What or where is the core, the heart, of Long Island? Most localities have a characteristic atmosphere. I have lived many places and found it easy to find the pulse of those areas: Buffalo with its serious dying-industrial solidity, Seattle with its energetic lifestyle and sparkling vistas, Charlottesville, Va., with its Jeffersonian legacy of expansive landscapes and open-minded people, and even Geneseo, N.Y., with its tenuous balance between the college community and rural traditions. But with more than 20 years of living on Long Island, its complexity and diversity only increase. Growing up in the suburban sprawl of Nassau County, I had no idea of the small-town, almost rural nature of Suffolk. When I returned to Long Island to live in Suffolk, it was a shock to change L.I.R.R. trains in Babylon, once the terminus on my South Shore line, and to continue almost another hour eastbound. I had not only passed into another county, but almost another world. What resemblance did my high school, with its graduating class of almost 600 students have with the school district, Eastport, that I now taught in? Eastport is a central school district with a total enrollment of 600 students in grades kindergarten through 12. The opportunities and environment in this rural duck-farming area were drastically different than in the suburb I experienced. Were those both Long Island? Why did I always feel that the North and South Shores were so different? Could the more dramatic, rocky North Shore communities really be more intellectually and artistically oriented, or was that an illusion created by craft festivals, antiquarian bookshops, and so on? And what about the relaxed, windswept, ''always summer'' feeling along the South Shore? I frequented both Port Jefferson and Bellport, both perched in line on opposite shores of this Long Island, and found them charmingly different. Which was the true Long Island? I loved the diversity that the skinny island geography generated. I often thought how much like a beautiful necklace the Island was, with each village a bead linked to the next and together forming a new, unexpected jewel. However, the geography also frustrated me by creating the decentralized nature of the Island. I remember the joke I kept running into that everything on Long Island is a half-hour drive away - unless it is an hour away. At first I optimistically scanned calendars of events so that I could participate in the best that the Island had to offer. Soon I was discouraged by the physical scattering of events: a poetry reading in Sag Harbor, a good movie house in Huntington, the Sesame Street Live performance in Uniondale. The recreational and intellectual opportunities were there; you just had to spend an inordinate amount of time getting to them. The very limits of the island geography finally forced us to explore another world. Like so many others, we discovered that perhaps the real beauty of this landscape is the surrounding water, and the best way to experience the land is from the openness of the water. One fall we canoed the lower Carmans River, never encountering another person. The dying reeds, the brisk winds and the ever-present birds were our only companions as we were transported not only down a river, but back to a Long Island lost to time and progress. It was not long after that we bought a sailboat, moored on the Carmans, that allowed us to explore the Great South Bay and reach the expanses of Fire Island. It is mostly the memories of those sails and the ever-changing water that make me feel nostalgic for Long Island now. I have left my native ground again, this time I feel forever. I live amid the mountains and the ever-changing light patterns created by the swift-moving clouds. I am excited about my new home, Reno. I live at the outskirts of the city, and yet in only moments I can take advantage of any cultural, recreational or entertainment opportunity that this interesting city has to offer. I am so glad to live in a place that has a center, a pulsating heart. For all that it has to offer, and for all the years that I tried to give Long Island a chance, I was never really able to feel the pulse of Long Island. I will always wonder at the naivete of the news correspondents who are able to see it that way.

627-> SUSPECT SEIZED AFTER THREAT IS MADE ABOARD PLANE
The police seized a Brooklyn man who had demanded to speak to the leader of a Black Muslim group today after passing a threatening note aboard a Continental Airlines plane that had flown from Newark to Washington, the authorities said. ''The situation has been stabilized,'' said Tom Holderness, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. ''The gentleman is in custody. There have been no injuries.'' The incident ended about three and a half hours after the suspect permitted the 44 passengers and 5 crew members to leave the DC-9 after the jet landed at Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs near Washington. The man was identified as Norwood Emmanuel, about 50 years old, according to Joseph Krahling, assistant agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Northern Virginia office. The man had passed a note threatening to set the plane afire with chemicals, said Tom Deakin, an F.B.I. spokesman. Mr. Krahling said the suspect was carrying a cigarette lighter and ''a very small packet'' but declined to say what was in the packet. Trained dogs detected something in a box belonging to Mr. Emmanuel while searching the flight luggage. Mr. Krahling would not say what the dogs had found but said the box and the packet would be handled by a bomb disposal unit. Mr. Krahling said that after the plane was taken to a secure area of the airport the pilot conversed with the suspect while ''the crew went about quietly telling the passengers to deplane.'' Mr. Deakin said the man demanded to speak to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, a Black Muslim group that has headquarters in Chicago. The suspect then allowed the pilot to leave. Mr. Krahling said F.B.I. agents eventually entered the plane and gave Mr. Emmanuel a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes, which he had requested. Shortly afterward he was persuaded to leave the aircraft. Mr. Krahling said the suspect had been living in ''some type of mental treatment facility, halfway house if you will.'' He was taken to Alexandria, Va., for questioning and after arraignment was held without bail. The incident occurred on New York Air Flight 681, although the plane had the markings of Continental Airlines. The two airlines were recently purchased by the Texas Air Corporation. A passenger, Rose May of Robbinsville, N.J., said she did not realize a threat had been made until the plane landed. ''Everybody just did what they were instructed to do,'' she said. ''I felt the crew handled it very well. Nobody panicked.'' ----Eastern Airlines Gets Threat PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 10 (AP) -An Eastern Air Lines jetliner was forced to land in Philadelphia today after a caller to an airline office said a bomb was aboard the plane, but a search turned up no explosives, officials said. The Lockheed L-1011 was carrying 210 passengers from Newark to Miami when a reservations desk for the airline ''somewhere in the Newark area'' received the call, said Jim Ashwak, an airline spokesman. The airplane was just south of Philadelphia when the pilot turned around to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport, said Pete DiDominico, a police officer stationed at the airport.

628-> TALKING: Insurance; Covering Mortgage Payments
WHEN a borrower takes out a mortgage loan, the lender customarily offers insurance to cover payment of the outstanding balance in the event of the borrower's death or disability. It is usually noted in the offer that the rates are particularly favorable if the individual can become part of a group - in this case, the borrowers doing business with the lender. Another advantage is that, unlike regular life insurance, the premiums will not fluctuate as the borrower gets older, or even if interest rates and monthly mortgage payments rise. But lenders will concede, if asked, that fewer than 30 percent of their borrowers take the offer. Anthony Giaccone, president of Intermarket Insurance Agency of Huntington, L.I., a property-insurance specialist, notes that the need for some kind of coverage is clearly highest among couples with young children, particularly if no one else in the family could cover the payments if the primary earner dies. Before signing up, however, the borrower should explore comparable ways to protect family members in the event of the death or disability of the primary breadwinner. There are many alternatives, and much will depend on the age and circumstances of the family. Comparison shopping should begin with a call or visit to a local independent insurance broker and the district sales agent of a major insurance company, such as Prudential or Allstate, that markets directly to the public. These people will explain that they can match the offer with a similar product known as ''decreasing-term'' or ''mortgage-cancellation'' insurance. It resembles the one offered by the lender in that the premiums remain constant throughout the life of the loan rather than rise with the age of the insured, although the benefit decreases as the mortgage balance decreases. The critical difference in these forms of insurance is that upon the death of the borrower, a named beneficiary is paid rather than the lender, thus giving the survivor more financial options. For example, the benefits could be invested and the interest used to pay off the mortgage, which could be advantageous if the mortgage had a low rate and the investment income was greater than needed to cover the monthly payments. Further, the beneficiary may prefer to keep the mortgage, since the interest being paid provides a tax shelter that would be lost if it were automatically paid off by the lender's insurance. And to be forced to refinance is costly. Borrowers over 45 years old or in poor health, however, may have no choice: Many conventional insurance companies will not accept them, and they must seek mortgage coverage through a lender. But assuming there is a choice, the next consideration is comparable cost. For example, Globe Mortgage, with offices in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, charges $28 a month to cover a 30-year-old male borrower taking out a $100,000, 30-year loan. The rate does not differ much from lender to lender. A couple of about the same age buying a property jointly will pay $42 a month for the same $100,000 coverage on each of them. As an inducement, Globe offers the coverage free for the first six months of any loan. John Caruso, senior vice president at Globe, adds that its insurance may be more efficient since the premium is added to the monthly mortgage amount, eliminating the need for a separate check. BUT if the same 30-year-old borrower buys the same policy from a conventional carrier, he can probably obtain better rates. Lynn Gregorio of Robert S. Weiss and Company, insurance agents in Stamford, Conn., is quoting a rate for such a borrower of $20.92 a month ($39.67 for the couple). Coverage would be through Old Line Life Company of Milwaukee. Mr. Giaccone on Long Island can offer a rate of only $13.20 a month ($22.28 for the couple) through Aetna Life and Casualty of Hartford. Sales agents for Prudential are offering the 30-year-old borrower a policy for about $27 monthly. These premiums are based on the loan being taken out now at an interest rate of around 10 percent. However, these are not the only options. Regardless of whether the bank or an insurance company is used, accidental-death coverage is cheaper and probably more useful for the younger person with less income to spare and whose risk of an accident is greater than that of a terminal illness. Disability coverage, which can be taken out in addition to either term insurance or accidental death coverage, is considered desirable for self-employed people or those not covered adequately through an employer. Globe, for example, offers accidental-death coverage with premiums of only $10 a month for the 30-year-old, $15 for the couple on the $100,000 loan. Its disability coverage makes payments of up to $750 a month directly to the lender on a premium of $37.50 monthly with benefits starting 30 days after the disability begins. Those benefits last until the borrower reaches 50 or, if he is over 50, for 12 months. Mr. Giaccone can offer a 30-year-old nonsmoking male disability benefits of $1,000 a month for a monthly premium of $23.60. Checks start arriving after the borrower has been disabled for 90 days and last until he reaches age 65. An added advantage of this method is that the borrower receives the cash each month rather than the lender. But again, anyone over 45 or in poor health may be refused conventional coverage. CONVENTIONAL insurance agents counter all these options with even more alternatives. Ms. Gregorio would show the 30-year-old borrower that for $9.66 a month, he could get $100,000 of straight-term life insurance that would have no tie-in with a mortgage. It would take until age 40 for premiums to catch up with the cost of the same amount of mortgage insurance. Mr. Giaccone also favors a ''universal-life'' mortgage cancellation policy, especially for higher earners. The cost is $38.50 a month for a 30-year-old. This type of insurance acts as an enforced savings plan. Premiums accumulate tax-deferred interest and, assuming no claim is made, the total is returned at the end of the term or if the house is sold, rather than being lost. The policy could be cashed in for $4,536 after 10 years and up to $13,386 after 20 years, an accumulation that Mr. Giaccone noted could be used to pay off the mortgage early.

629-> REAGAN TO PRESS FOR $6 MILLION ATOM SMASHER
The Administration announced today that it would immediately ask Congress for funds to start planning and building a giant $6 billion atom smasher. The device, a superconducting supercollider in a 52-mile oval tunnel, would dwarf existing machines used to probe the secrets of matter and energy. The project to build the world's largest research machine, in which subatomic particles moving at high speed would collide and burst, is as scientifically significant as America's 1969 manned landing on the moon, Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington said. The device would accelerate atomic particles to an energy level 20 times greater than possible in existing laboratories. Mr. Herrington said that on completion in 1996, the supercollider would ''bring answers to unsolved questions that have fascinated the world since the earliest times, such as what are the fundamental building blocks of matter.'' The need for the device has been debated for years. Some scientists say it is crucial if the United States is to stay on the frontiers of particle physics. By enabling scientists to experiment at higher energies and smaller scales than before, proponents say, the supercollider may provide new insights into the elementary forces and particles of the universe. Opponents of the project contend that it is too costly and unlikely to produce commensurate results. At least 20 states have sought to be the home of the supercollider, but Mr. Herrington said a site decision was still months away at least. The announcement by Mr. Herrington at a news conference this afternoon followed a showdown at meetings at the White House on Thursday. Mr. Herrington was reported to have persuaded President Reagan to support the huge project over the objections of high Administration officials concerned about its effect on the budget and the opposition of other Cabinet members who one Administration official described as feeling that ''the country didn't need it.'' But one Administration official said today that after ''a lot of missionary work in recent months by Secretary Herrington, the decision was not close.'' The fact that the President did not mention the project in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday was described as ''just a scheduling thing - it didn't get through the Cabinet and the Domestic Policy Council until yesterday.'' Foreign governments, and perhaps the state in which the project is eventually set up, will be asked to share in the costs and will share in the scientific and economic benefits, the Secretary said. Construction of the above-ground research facilities and the vast oval underground tunnel would create 4,500 jobs, the Energy Department said. A staff of scientists and technicians would total at least 2,500, with 500 others to have visitor status. How Collider Would Work The accelerator will send two beams of protons speeding through the tunnel in opposite directions. At several junctures the beams will cross and collide, creating a flash of energy out of which subatomic particles will burst. The belief is that such collisions, taking place at energy levels higher than ever achieved before, will disclose the existence of a host of new particles and forces. The speeding protons will be contained in their path by powerful electromagnets cooled by liquid helium to temperatures so low that their coils lose all resistence to electricity; that is, they will be superconductive. Among the states vying for the project are California, Colorado, Illinois, New York and Texas. Alvin W. Trivelpiece, the department's director of energy research, said some states were offering $10 million to $15 million in inducements. Mr. Herrington said the ''fair and open'' site-selection process would take months or years. Asserting firmly that ''there is no front-runner'' among the states, he promised to say more about site selection at another briefing on Feb. 10. The project would be a costly venture into basic research yielding possibly major scientific insights into the creation of matter - of the universe and the world - but with few firmly predictable practical applications. 'No Military Applications' Mr. Herrington stressed that there would be ''no military applications,'' adding: ''The nature of basic research is that you don't know, going into it, what you will find. But the American track record in this has been good.'' At the Secretary's hurried presentation today, called suddenly after Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said Thursday night that the President would approve the project, Mr. Herrington seemed to give as much emphasis to the psychological and national morale implications as to the scientific. Reflecting the President's emphasis on American ''competitiveness'' in the State of the Union Message, Mr. Herrington said Mr. Reagan had made ''a watershed'' decision for the United States. ''This is a watershed for America's scientific and technological leadership and another clear sign that President Reagan is committed to keeping this nation on the cutting edge of world leadership and competitiveness,'' Mr. Herrington said, reading a statement. Calling the decision ''of tremendous scientific significance and historical consequence,'' the Secretary said: ''It is a tremendous leap forward for America and for science and technology. Once again, this nation has said there are no dreams too large, no innovation unimaginable and no frontiers beyond our reach. By virtue of this decision we are embarking on an adventure of unlimited opportunity, tremendous promise and a new scientific world to be won.'' Major Atom Smashers The world's largest existing atom smashers, circular devices four miles in circumference, are at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., and at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva. Larger devices are on the horizon. Soviet physicists are building a 13-mile atom smasher, and in Western Europe, physicists are constructing a 16-mile accelerator. Throughout the development of the supercollider plan, the project has had passionate supporters and bitter critics. One advocate restrained his glee today. Dr. Stanley G. Wojcicki, of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California, said no champagne corks were popping because the team's efforts, both technical and political, would have to be redoubled. ''Everybody is obviously very, very pleased,'' he said. ''But it's just the first step. The next is to convince the Congress and the American public that this is a scientific project that justifies the expenditure.'' Critics have contended that the project would sap Federal funds from less glamorous, but equally important, areas of scientific research. They also say there are no guarantees that the giant facility will yield more discoveries than current or planned facilities. 'Approaching a Budgetary Limit' The supercollider ''may be close to the end of the line of large science projects,'' said John E. Pike, associate director of the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. ''The assumption has always been that we're going to be able to understand everything,'' he added, but with this project ''we're approaching a budgetary limit.'' ''These devices are becoming so expensive, and what they're trying to find is so obscure, that we may be at the point where scientists can no longer justify the cost,'' he said. Dr. Arno Penzias, a Nobel laureate in physics at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, has criticized the supercollider as a threat to the rest of physics research in the United States, much of it based in small laboratories at universities. ''For scientists the question to be answered is, what contribution of resources should the rest of science be asked to make to permit high-energy physics to build and operate the superconducting supercollider?'' he has written. ''The supercollider's capital cost will clearly squeeze capital expenditures for the other sciences.'' Asked by reporters to be more specific in describing the collider's scientific importance, Mr. Herrington said he would do that at his Feb. 10 briefing. The Secretary said the $60 million required for an immediate start on design and site selection could come from funds appropriated for other projects. He predicted bipartisan support for it in Congress. Preliminary studies begun three years ago have cost about $20 million a year.

630-> Helping the Elderly Keep Their Homes
IN an effort to help elderly homeowners trying to hold on to their houses, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority will begin offering low-interest loans to finance the construction of accessory apartments later this month. Carol A. Montesi, a spokesman for the authority, said funds for the program would come out of the agency's surplus assets, which consist of monies paid back on other authority loans. ''We're confident we can meet the demand,'' Ms. Montesi said. ''We will provide the necessary resources.'' The program, to be called Apartment Conversions for the Elderly, will be open to homeowners 62 or older and will provide as much as $80,000 in 30-year fixed-rate financing with interest rates as low as 7 percent, Ms. Montesi said. The accessory apartment must be within a single-family owner-occupied house, with its own bath, kitchen, living and sleeping areas, she said. ''What we're attempting to do,'' Ms. Montesi said, ''is provide an option for people of limited income who want to continue living in their own homes but who need to supplement their income.'' According to figures from the State Housing Department, about 400 accessory apartments have been created each year since 1982, when it started keeping records. The apartments are most popular in urban areas, according to the Housing Department. Last year, 51 accessory apartments were approved by building permit in New Haven, 48 in Danbury, 39 in Bridgeport, 37 in Stamford, 28 in Greenwich and 16 in Hartford. In Stamford, however, a recent residents' initiative voted down the ordinance allowing accessory apartments, said Richard S. Eigen, staff assistant for the Housing Task Force for Fairfield County 2000. ''I was surprised when we first heard about it,'' he said. ''But my experience people who live in areas of very small lots often oppose accessory apartments. ''A lot of people think this is going to lead to four or five cars in each yard and more traffic ln local streets,'' Mr. Eigen said. ''A lot of people are afraid of that overcrowding.'' He added, however, that low-interest financing for accessory apartments will be a good program for other southwest Connecticut communities that allow them, because of the severe housing shortage in that area. ''The committee is looking at a number of directions we should take to ease the housing shortage,'' he said, ''and accessory apartments are one area you always look at.'' Housing and planning officials say there are many more accessory apartments not reported in the state housing statistics because of zoning that prohibits accessory apartments or excessively restricts them. Duncan M. Graham, director of the Central Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said a recent study of 47 communities in western Connecticut showed that only 16 allowed accessory apartments, and that of those, most impose restrictions that severely limited who could construct them. WHERE there are restrictions, Mr. Graham said, illegal development of accessory apartments is encouraged. ''It's too bad there have to be so many restrictions,'' he added, ''because from a planning standpoint, accessory apartments are a good way to create affordable rentals in towns where rental apartments might be scarce, and help homeowners reduce the cost of ownership.'' Marguerite P. Reich, director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, said that in recent years, several towns in that area have adopted ordinances that allow accessory apartments of one type of another. ''More and more towns are starting to specifically address the issue,'' she said, ''as more and more people come before them asking to create accessory apartments.'' Ms. Montesi said the authority hoped that the new program would spur more communities to relax their regulations regarding accessory apartments. ''Our role is to stimulate the housing market, but our role is somewhat limited,'' she said. Ms. Montesi added, ''We're not going to take an advocacy role in this, we're not going to encourage towns to change the zoning the regulations to allow for these conversions.'' Ms. Montesi said the loans for accessory apartments must be first mortgages, although some of the funds can be used to pay off existing first mortgages and loan-origination expenses. It can be used to build an apartment within the house or in an addition, she said, and the apartment can be either for a tenant or for the elderly homeowner to occupy himself and free the rest of the house for rental. Those whose incomes are below the authority's limits, with maximums that range from $25,800 to $33,000 depending on the location of the house, qualify for 7 percent financing. Others still quality for the program, but at an 11 percent rate. ''We're trying to make the program as flexible as we can,'' Ms. Montesi said. She said the program is the second operated by the authority geared solely to elderly people. Two years ago, the authority began writing reverse annuity mortgages of as much as $100,000, which provides elderly people with a regular income. That mortgage is paid if the house is sold. Of the 230 mortgages totaling $12 million disbursed so far under that program, the average recipient is 74 years old with an income of $10,200, Ms. Montesi said. The average house in that program is valued at $119,000, and the average mortgage is $70,000, she said.

632-> PHILIPPINES PUTS TROOPS ON ALERT AGAINST A MUTINY
The armed forces were placed on alert and roadblocks were set up outside Malacanang Palace on Saturday after reports circulated that armed groups were planning a new move to destabilize the Government. Military sources said the Manila constabulary command had been ordered to arrest any uniformed troops moving during the night. As of early this morning, however, they reported no unusual incidents. The sources said intelligence reports had been received that Moslem rebels who had been involved in the series of attacks last week in the southern island of Mindanao might strike in Manila. They said these rebels might be planning to move in coordination with dissident soldiers close to the former Defense Minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, and with armed groups loyal to the former president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. Emergency Meeting Called Following these reports, the sources said, General Fidel V. Ramos, Chief of Staff of the armed forces, called his commanders to an emergency meeting Saturday. The sources said he remained at his headquarters through the night. Military officers said the alert order was first issued at 8 A.M. Saturday. They said the alert would be maintained until after a plebiscite Feb. 2 on a new Constitution that has developed into a vote of confidence in President Corazon C. Aquino. The sources said the military's largest fraternal organization had circulated a radio message warning that ''splinter groups'' within the armed forces were attempting to ''create another plot to destabilize the present Government.'' Armored personnel carriers, water cannon and riot troops with shields were posted early this morning on streets leading to the palace and check points were set up. Military Camps Seem Quiet The main military camps appeared quiet. No troop deployments were seen around the government television station as they had been during alerts called when troops threatened to move against the Government last November. There were reports this morning that increased mobile patrols had been sent into two Moslem neighborhoods in Manila. Mrs. Aquino, who traveled Saturday to Mindanao to campaign for ratification of the new Constitution, returned as planned to Manila. She was due to travel to Mindanao for a second day of campaigning today. Last November, the troops associated with Mr. Enrile were reported to have come to the brink of military action against the Government three times. The last aborted attempt, early in the morning of Nov. 23, led to the dismissal of Mr. Enrile. A Call for Supporting Aquino Most of the officers loyal to him have since been removed from their posts at the Defense Ministry, though one of them said in an interview last week that they remain in touch with each other and with Mr. Enrile. The radio message, from the leaders of the Guardian Brotherhood, urged its members to ''pledge our support to the present Government and observe the chain of command.'' It said the reported effort at destabilization involved another smaller group called the Guardian Foundation, whose titular leader is Col. Gregorio Honasan, the former chief of Mr. Enrile's personal security group at the Defense Ministry. There was no indication that Mr. Enrile himself was involved. The former Defense Minister was campaigning on the central island of Cebu this weekend against the draft constitution. When Mr. Enrile, as Defense Minister, appeared to be attempting to destabilize the Aquino Government in a bid for power, ratification of the Constitution was seen as a deadline for him.

633-> HIRING ALIENS: THE NEW RISKS
Businesses across the country are struggling with the new immigration law's attempts to curb the hiring of illegal aliens, and perhaps nowhere is the concern more evident than in southern California, where several million illegal aliens are believed to be employed. From the strawberry fields of Orange County to the hotels of Beverly Hills and the garment factories of downtown Los Angeles, illegal aliens have become a significant -and routinely accepted - part of the work force here. Now many businesses in the region are worried that the legislation could shrink the pool of low-wage laborers. Their most immediate concern, however, is how they will cope with the law's regulations governing hiring practices - including provisions for stiff fines and jail sentences. 'Everybody Is Nervous' ''Everybody is nervous about it,'' said Gerald Breitbart, the director of chapter relations for the California Restaurant Association, ''because nobody knows how it's going to work out.'' Indeed, while the millions of illegal aliens already in the United States scramble to sort out their fate under the portion of the law that would grant legal status to many of them, employers in California and elsewhere appear to be adapting only haltingly to their new role as important enforcers of immigration policy. The law makes all employers responsible for checking that everyone they hire after Nov. 6, 1986, is legally entitled to work in the United States. It sets penalties for those companies and individuals who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The rules for farm workers are somewhat different than for other laborers. Part of the problem, company executives and business groups say, is that more than two months after the legislation was signed by President Reagan, many employers remain unsure of its requirements, while others have made little effort to understand how the changes will affect them. ''We haven't gotten the impression that they are ready for it or aware of it,'' said Virginia Lamp, a labor relations lawyer for the United States Chamber of Commerce who is a specialist in the new legislation. ''Whenever we start talking with companies about the fact that the law will affect all of their hiring practices, they're shocked.'' Moreover, some companies worry that the law will burden them with additional paperwork and bureaucratic snafus, and that any mistakes could subject them to heavy fines, even if they make a good-faith effort to comply. Other businesses fear offending prospective employees, exposing themselves to discrimination suits and having to pay higher labor costs, experts on the new law said. 'Very Real Concern' ''There's a very real concern, especially among small and medium-sized companies, about how much more paperwork and checking they're going to have to do,'' said Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. ''That can have a very real effect on a growing company.'' Immigration officials said that most of the concerns were unfounded or would be allayed as companies learned more about the law. They said that much of the confusion should be alleviated after the Immigration and Naturalization Service finishes translating the vague language of the legislation into detailed regulations. That process should be completed by the end of next month, they said. ''It's no more complicated than O.S.H.A. or Social Security or any other Federal regulation that everybody deals with as a matter of course in business,'' said Howard W. Ezell, the Western regional commissioner of the immigration agency. Mr. Ezell's reference to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, however, is exactly the type of comparison that many employers make in worried tones. Among many executives, O.S.H.A. is considered a prime example of an overly bureacratic regulator, and they fear the new immigration law will produce a similar situation involving their hiring processes. The law requires employers to ask for identification such as birth certificates, passports, driver's licenses, immigration papers or similar documents that would establish that an applicant is a citizen or an alien who is authorized to work, officials said. Employers would not be responsible for authenticating documents, but they would have to sign a statement saying they had been shown proof of legal status. They would also have to keep a record of the document check. Employers found to have knowingly hired illegal aliens would be subject to civil fines starting on the first offense at as little as $250 for each undocumented worker but rising to as much as $10,000 per worker on the third or subsequent offenses. In the case of repeated violations, criminal penalties, including up to six months in prison, could be invoked. The law provides for a ''shakedown'' period lasting until May 31, during which the sanctions will not be enforced. For the succeeding year, until June 1, 1988, only warnings will be given to first offenders, although repeat offenders will be subject to fines. Forms to Be Distributed Next month, the I.N.S., the Labor Department, the Small Business Administration and other Government agencies will begin distributing forms on which employers are to swear that they have properly documented new employees, Mr. Ezell said. The I.N.S. is also beefing up its enforcement staff, he added. For the most part, businesses in California have welcomed the law insofar as it removes the prospect of raids on the workplace by the Immigration Service seeking illegal aliens. They also praise the amnesty provisions for workers who have been in the country since 1982 because that should make their current work force more stable. But they also worry that what they approve of in principle may prove burdensome in practice. ''Business felt that changes needed to be made in immigration law, but there is concern about the employer sanctions,'' said Mr. Remy of the Chamber of Commerce. Some employers fear that no matter how diligent they are in following the rules, they will still hire some illegal aliens inadvertently and be penalized if the immigration agency takes a hard line with them. ''It's darn near impossible to avoid hiring some illegals,'' said Jack A. Wick, executive director of the California Association of Nurserymen, which represents growers employing 50,000 people. Fake Identifications He and others said that many illegal aliens carry fake identification, some of it nearly indistinguishable from valid documents. They worry that the regulations being formulated by the I.N.S. might place some additional burden on them to authenticate documents, or that the demands on them to verify identification might be increased in the future. ''What constitutes proof that they are here legally? That is our biggest problem,'' said Marvin Kroner, president of Acme Thread and Supply Inc. and a vice president of the Mark Textile Company in Los Angeles. Many employers, Mr. Wick said, ''still are concerned that on audit, the Government will say, 'You should have been doing it this way, you're guilty on these 12 people, so hand over $12,000.' '' Employers, he said, ''didn't mean to miss those 12, but it happens.'' William R. McDonald, the senior vice president for human resources at the Hilton Hotels Corporation, which is based in Beverly Hills, said he feared that the law might shrink the pool of low-wage laborers, a concern expressed by executives in several other industries that need large numbers of unskilled workers. 'Back-of-the-House' Jobs Mr. Breitbart of the restaurant association said, ''If the law truly does what it's intended to do, it's going to create something of a labor shortage in what today is the back-of-the-house, minimum-wage job.'' Higher labor costs would lead to higher prices on the goods and services produced by those workers, executives said. Some executives fear that they could be placed in a difficult position if they suspect that the documents shown by an applicant are not genuine. If they ask for further proof of legal status or decide not to hire someone on the basis of suspicious documentation, the applicant might have grounds to sue, contending discrimination. ''You have to walk a very fine line,'' Ms. Lamp said. ''We anticipate a flood of litigation on the civil rights side.'' Civil rights lawyers, in fact, are concerned that some businesses might rule out hiring any applicants from certain ethnic groups in an attempt to avoid the risk of hiring illegal aliens. ''We are going to be monitoring that very closely,'' said Antonio Rodrigues, director of the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice, which represents many aliens. The immigration service is holding a series of seminars around the country to explain the law to employers and answer questions. Turnout in California has been high, and, after the sessions, most business people seem satisfied that they can cope with the new regulations, Mr. Ezell of the I.N.S. said. ''I've yet to have any employers' group say to me, 'We're finished, this is too much for us, we're taking our business overseas,' '' Mr. Ezell added. The United States Chamber of Commerce is also offering an education program. It will soon mail to its 184,000 member companies some basic information about the law. ''We're surprised at how few questions we've gotten from companies,'' said Ms. Lamp, who attributed the lack of queries to ignorance of the law's scope. ''It's going to hit them all of a sudden.''

636-> NEW JERSEY JOURNAL; WHEN STUDENTS ALSO HOLD JOBS
THOSE who track the efforts of the United States Department of Education to stem the ''rising tide of mediocrity'' characterizing American education may know that, under the department's aegis, a new report (completed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching) has just been released. The foundation finds the undergraduate college a very troubled institution. It seems to this teacher, who has been working to stem the tide for many years, that the department would have done better to save its $1 million (the cost of the report) and paid $17.95 for the findings revealed in a new book, ''When Teenagers Work: The Psychological and Social Costs of Adolescent Employment,'' by Ellen Greenberg and Laurence Steinberg. In their book (published last year by Basic Books, with an introduction by Urie Bronfenbrenner of Cornell), the authors set forth the facts about adolescent employment: * One of every four high school sophomores works the equivalent of a half-time job, mostly in the fast-food and small retail and service industries. * These students are simply young suburbanites embracing the life style and values that the term signifies, often to disastrous effect, in terms of school work, character development and ultimate career satisfaction. The validity of these revelations about employment and the luxuries it supports came to my attention in a rather serendipitous way. I had just suggested to my freshman composition students that they watch a certain TV program pertaining to AIDS, a topic they had been writing on (after having read a segment of Barbara Tuchman's ''A Distant Mirror,'' about The Black Death). To a man (and woman), they shouted: ''We can't watch it because we have to go to work, but we'll tape it on our VCR.'' Learning that they owned VCR's and that VCR's ''only cost $300,'' I began (in a general way) to ask how many of my students worked and why. Responses revealed even more alarming facts than those reported in the book. My students work more than a half-time job (between 20 and 35 hours a week) and, after paying for gasoline and car insurance, many work to provide themselves with luxuries. Such facts must have far-reaching effects on the whole teacher-student contract because any teacher with a modicum of sense and/or compassion, and mindful of what little time the student has for study, must temper lectures, assignments and expectations. The lesson she finds academically significant, and even exciting, as she plans it in her study becomes unthinkable and even a bit absurd (in terms of both subject matter and demands) within the real context of students' lives, a context in which the impetus is not really to learn but to be taught something, to take the test, to get a grade - and to get to work. Such students do not see themselves as students in the traditional sense. Because they do not, they apply the same quantitative measurement and pragmatism here as they do in the workplace (''How many Whoppers, sir? Two coffees?'') When given a writing assignment, their first and often only questions are: * ''How long does it have to be?'' * ''How many words do I need to write?'' * ''How many sources do you want?'' Such students barely have time to complete assignments in this minimal way; they certainly do not have time to think about their work. The former hockey star Ken Dryden points out in his book, ''The Game,'' that Pele, di Stefano and Puskas typify players whose minds and bodies invented their game - one having scope and culture - in their free time. Dryden discusses the matter thusly in what may serve as a metaphor for the whole education problem: While skills are necessary, setting out as they do the limits of anything, more is needed to transform those skills into something special. Mostly, it is time -unencumbered, unhurried, time of a different quality . . . time to find your own right answer, time to settle and assimilate and become fully and completely yours, to organize and combine with other skills comfortably and easily in some uniquely personal way, then to be set loose, trusted, to find new instinctive directions to take, to create. Free time is usually a part of adolescence, and the psychologist Erik Erickson may have been right in favoring a long adolescence. Students who are a bit poky and unsullied by commerce with contemporary American life often produce better, more inspired work. My Polish newcomer writes, ''I dream of being a nurse,'' and my African student writes on the meaning of ''nobility.'' These students aren't spending time out of school trafficking in burgers, fries and shakes; they're spending time in the library, following up on the teacher's leads, making connections and discoveries on their own, inventing their own game. According to statistics, such students will, in the long run, settle into more-prestigious and satisfying jobs than working students, who usually have greater access to work immediately after graduation. Why? Because, as the authors Greenberger and Steinberg state, ''The current marketplace needs, most of all, students with broad general education backgrounds.'' Of course, today's teacher does not expect students to loll about the College Center discussing Norse myth the way C.S. Lewis did with Tolkien at Oxford, nor does the teacher expect them to take walking tours the way Robert Graves did with Siegfried Sassoon on the Continent. But both the teacher and the students would benefit from a classroom in which less pragmatically motivated students convened, a place where both teacher and students were enthusiastic about the book (or idea) and where one might, sometimes, hear the word ''Moliere'' instead of ''muffler'' and ''Genet'' instead of ''jean.'' How to convert these suburbanites into students? Perhaps our egalitarian commitment to universal education does not preclude our saying, as part of freshman orientation: ''Welcome to college. You've entered a new and special place: the learning community. It may strike you as a bit quaint, even monastic, for here you will find men and women who still care about books and language, finding in them truth, goodness and beauty. ''In opting to come here, you've made a choice, of sorts. You've opted to delay your entry into the world of malls, VCR's and the other suburban icons. In a word, coming here means that you've decided to change your life!'' But, then, what commission would ever be brave enough to even suggest that we utter these words?

637-> What Went Wrong?
Leon Wieseltier's analysis of the relationship between the press and the public was insightful. However, in mentioning ''that the news media, most of all television, mesmerize the population and its politicians with these melodramas,'' he neglected to mention the complicity of all the players in this dynamic. It is a maxim of hypnosis that you cannot ''mesmerize'' the unwilling. For six long years, the media played to the mass audience the lines it yearned to hear: ''The President is popular . . . so likable . . . the economy is rebounding . . . we have recovered,'' creating the context for the President's power and Rambo-like arrogance. They did the same thing in reverse to Jimmy Carter, repeating enough times, ''He's weak . . . he's weak,'' until the public was sufficiently programmed to believe, without much thought, that President Carter's restraint, reflectiveness and compassion were tantamount to weakness. As for the polls, mesmerized zombies regurgitate the myths with which they themselves have been programmed. It has been a tribute to the intelligence of the American public that a sizable minority of citizens all along refused to be ''mesmerized.'' But minorities do not win elections, and all of us are stuck with leadership determined by the media myth-makers and myth-breakers, not by properly informed voters. TIMOTHY WRIGHT New York City

638-> Q and A
Mortgage Tax on a Co-op Question: When my husband and I closed on an equity loan on our co-op apartment, we paid a $600 mortgage tax to the title company, which it said would be disbursed to New York State. Later we realized that there is no mortgage on a co-op but a loan that is a lien not on real property but on shares of the co-op corporation. Neither the title company's lawyer nor the bank's lawyer could explain why it had been collected. Are we due a refund? . . . M. J., Rego Park, Queens Answer: No, according to David L. Smith, a real estate lawyer with the firm of Shaw and Reed. The first lien-holder on your co-op, he said, is the bank that issued the original co-op loan and as such, it took possession of the stock certificates and of the proprietary lease at the closing. The bank that issued your equity loan is in a secondary position. ''To protect its position as the junior lienholder,'' Mr. Smith said, ''your bank insisted that a security agreement covering the stock, the proprietary lease and fixtures be recorded with the City Register as evidence of its claim.'' The City Register's position, in turn, is that when these instruments are recorded, a mortgage recording tax is paid. ''This was a superconservative position for the bank to take,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Many banks do not want to issue equity loans on cooperatives, but when they do, it is standard for them to secure their second position by requiring that financing statements be filed.'' Reverse Mortgages Question: We are a retired couple who live in our own home in a good neighborhood, but we have a limited income. We have heard that some banks will provide a ''reverse mortgage'' that will help older people live better. Do any banks in New York offer this type of loan? . . . K. W., Queens Answer: The loans to which you are referring are known as reverse annuity mortgage loans. Some financial institutions began offering them a few years ago to allow elderly homeowners to turn the equity in their homes into income while continuing to live in them. The loan principal is paid to the homeowner in monthly installments, and the bank is reimbursed with interest in a single payment at the end of the loan period when the home is sold or the owner dies. In New York State, these loans at present are available only to qualifying elderly residents of Long Island, who must apply either through the Nassau County Department of Senior Citizen Affairs or the nonprofit Family Service League, which is based in Huntington in Suffolk County. Rent on Co-op Sublet Question: Is there any restriction on the amount of rent the owner of a co-op apartment can charge when subletting the apartment? . . . G. G., Manhattan Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the only restriction would be in the case of a renter-occupied unit in a rent-regulated building converted under a noneviction plan. When any rent-regulated apartment is sublet, the rent may be no more than 10 percent beyond than the regular rent. The owner of a rent-stabilized co-op may not unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet, and the unit may be sublet for two years out of any four-year period. If the unit is rent-controlled, the owner need not consent to a sublet unless that right was specified in the original lease.

639-> SALES OF U.S.-MADE CARS FELL 37.1% FOR JAN. 11-20
Sales of new domestically made automobiles plunged 37.1 percent in the second 10-day sales period of the year, the nation's eight major auto manufacturers reported yesterday. The drop continued a new-year slump, attributed to large sales incentives and unusual buying ahead of the change in the tax law on Jan. 1. Meanwhile, the General Motors Corporation, whose sales have dropped the most sharply of the Big Three, announced a round of division-by-division sales incentives. The inducements include rebates of up to $1,000 by Chevrolet and discounts on options packages by Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick. No incentives were offered by Cadillac. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for the Jan. 11-20 period was 5.3 million, down from 9.3 million in the same period in 1986 but up slightly from 5.1 million in the early part of the month. There were eight selling days in the period in both years. Analysts attributed the sagging sales to the aftereffects of advance buying last year, but some cautioned that underlying demand might also be softening. ''We're going to come in about a million below our forecast on an annualized basis,'' said Michael Luckey, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''If it goes on like this for a few more periods, we may have to rethink our assumptions.'' G.M. reported that it sold 67,549 cars in the period, a decline of 42.2 percent, while Ford Motor Company reported sales of 33,838, a drop of 31.8 percent. The Chrysler Corporation was off 33.6 percent, with sales of 16,306, and the American Motors Corporation was down 47.2 percent, with estimated sales of 810 cars. Volkswagen of America reported sales of 842 cars, down 48.6 percent. The only sales increases were reported by Japanese companies that are receiving additional supplies of cars from plants in this country. Sales by the Honda Motor Company increased 41.3 percent, to 4,018, while the Nissan Motor Company's sales increased nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,027. The Toyota Motor Corporation, which was not manufacturing cars in this country at this time last year, reported sales of 384 in the period. Sales of light trucks declined as well in the period, but by a lesser amount than autos. Truck sales, which include mini-vans and sports utility vehicles, totaled 69,945, down 18 percent. Chrysler recorded a gain in trucks in the period, with sales of 11,191, up4.7 percent. But G.M.'s total of 23,817 was off 33.7 percent, and Ford's sales of 27,539 were down 11.9 percent. Jeep Sales A.M.C's sales of 5,500 Jeeps equaled last year's level, while Nissan's 1,844 were down 12.1 percent. For the year to date, light-truck sales were down 21.2 percent. Car sales in the first two selling periods were off 37.9 percent. G.M. lost car market share in the period, declining to 53.9 percent, from 58.7 percent a year earlier. Ford gained, however, climbing to 26.9 percent from 24.9, and Chrysler was up to 13.0 percent from 12.4 percent. A.M.C. was off slightly, to six-tenths of 1 percent from eight-tenths of 1 percent, while Volkswagen was also down, to seven-tenths of 1 percent from eight-tenths of 1 percent. But Honda gained, to 3.2 percent from 1.4 percent, while Nissan was off slightly, to nine-tenths of 1 percent from 1.0 percent.

640-> TENANT'S LAWSUIT COULD HELP UPGRADE HOUSING
FAIR-HOUSING advocates say that a case now before the courts could help provide a remedy for the problem of substandard housing on Long Island. Lawyers will file papers in State Supreme Court tomorrow in the case of 4-year-old Alicia Marie Gonzalez, who was burned in October 1984 when she grabbed the cord of an electric frying pan containing hot oil and pulled it off the counter in her Huntington apartment. In the civil suit, Alicia's father, Edward M. Gonzalez, is seeking $10 million in damages from a Northport landlord, Donald A. Pius, arguing that Alicia's injuries resulted from what he called Mr. Pius's negligence in not providing a stove. The case, one of the first negligence suits by low-income tenants against landlords in Suffolk County, is considered significant because a favorable outcome for Mr. Gonzalez could prompt landlords to upgrade their buildings at a time when housing experts see a general downturn in living conditions. ''Landlords in low-income areas are cutting corners at the slightest opportunity,'' said Richard Bellman, the New York City lawyer representing Mr. Gonzalez. ''But this could open up the possibility of litigation and legislation against them.'' While there was disagreement on the extent of the problem, many people feel that substandard conditions are spreading as the result of widespread noncompliance with housing codes in low-income areas throughout Long Island. ''There was unfortunately an unconscionable reluctance to adhere strictly to housing laws,'' said Gerard Twombly, executive vice president of the Long Island Board of Realtors. ''Certain communities have been better served than others, but there has been, across the board, a worsening of the problem in the last couple of years.'' Janet Hanson, executive director of Suffolk Housing Services, a Smithtown-based fair-housing advocacy group, agreed. ''In my opinion,'' she said, ''the problem has gotten worse since 1980.'' The statistics generally bear her out. Compared with 1980, there are currently nearly three times the number of ''substandard renter-occupied housing units'' reported to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development by municipalities in the so-called Suffolk County Consortium: all county towns except Huntington, Islip and Babylon. Suffolk County Health Department figures on the number of complaints, meanwhile, fluctuate widely and reveal no particular trend, according to James Herriman, department program supervisor for housing and sanitation. But statistics from the County Welfare Department show that in 1986 the department was forced to withhold rent 96 times from landlords who refused to rectify ''substandard'' conditions, almost double the number of times it did so throughout the early 1980's, according to Douglas LaLone, the department's director of housing. Mr. LaLone said that as the problem has intensified, so have efforts to deal with it. Before the department installs a client in any housing unit, it conducts a pre-rental inspection, searching for ''life-endangering'' defects such as open wires and cesspool leaks. Of the 230 or so units inspected monthly, about 27 percent are found to have defects serious enough to warrant rejection as habitable units, he said. But, he said, not all of the 73 percent of rental units found to be habitable necessarily meet housing code standards. Although the department has done away with conditional approvals because too many landlords disappeared or lingered in making the repairs upon which the tenant's occupancy was conditioned, the overall ''availability of rental units is lots worse,'' he said. ''As a result, pressures are greater than ever to house the poor in facilities that are not up to code.'' Because these pressures are so great and enforcement powers of the various agencies are so weak, Ms. Hanson said, housing advocates have turned to the courts for relief. And because the issue of negligence in the Gonzalez case falls into what seems to be a gray area, it could be useful claifying the kinds of violations for which a landlord is liable. Mr. Pius declined to comment on his case on the advice of his lawyers. But in a motion filed in November to dismiss the charges, the lawyers ''dispute'' that a failure to provide a stove constitutes negligence. They further contend that, even if such a failure did constitute negligence, it was not the ''proximate cause of Alicia's injuries or a substantial cause of the events which produced the injuries.'' Mr. Herriman said it might be ''general practice for an owner to provide a stove or similar device,'' but he declind to say whether the failure to do so was a violation. Although a landlord was found not to be liable in a previous case in which injuries resulted from an unrepaired boiler, Mr. Bellman expects to be more successful in this case. One reason is that the State Court of Appeals, the final arbiter, is now composed of judges appointed by Governor Cuomo, who he expects to be sympathetic to his cause. But, he said, it could be years before the case is resolved. He is set to file a response to the dismissal motion tomorrow in State Supreme Court. The case must pass through the Appellate Division of Supreme Court before reaching the Court of Appeals. One possible outcome, Ms. Hanson said, would be legislation calling for higher fines for code violations. Currently, she said, ''the losing nature of the battle is that landlords make more money not complying with the laws.'' ''That's a lot of nonsense,'' Mr. Twombly said. ''Fines are high enough right now to hold people accountable if they are acting maliciously.'' Mr. Herriman agreed. ''I haven't found an attitude among landlords that the fines are a cost of doing business,'' he said. Mr. Twombly called for ''better ways to expedite the discovery process and the judicial system.'' And he seeks more education. He said, ''If there is a violation, Pius should have been conversant with it.''

643-> MEMORY IS HER WORK
BREAKING BREAD By Joyce Reiser Kornblatt. 206 pp. New York: A William Abrahams Book/ E. P. Dutton. $16.95. IN her 1985 novel, ''White Water,'' Joyce Reiser Kornblatt told the story of the Fry family at a moment of transition, the marriage of a daughter and granddaughter, through five first-person accounts, each an independent short story. The form itself was a metaphor for the author's theme: however separate and alienated these people may be from one another, family connectedness and domestic love provide the only ''buffer against the world's travails,'' the only ''raft in white water.'' Her new fiction, ''Breaking Bread,'' is a chain of stories. Here are five lives told by a single narrator for whom their revelations were crucial stages in her own development, from the immigrant grandfather whose devotion surrounded her earliest years to Lila Frank, who journeyed with her to the country of childbirth, ''no map adequate, each of us immigrants, as it were, without possessions, new arrivals like the infants we took to our transformed, milk-throbbing breasts.'' It was Lila Frank whose struggles toward autonomy informed her own, as Lila's death by cancer raised once and forever the fact of the narrator's own mortality. The theme of the book, and its title, are from W. H. Auden: ''Through art, we are able to break bread with the dead, and without communion with the dead a fully human life is impossible.'' The lives in ''Breaking Bread'' are the narrator's sacred dead. Whether they are also the author's is a speculation she invites and evades. The narrative voice is strong, clear, womanly - this is someone you believe, whether she is relating the simple and circumstantial events of daily life or the convoluted histories of flight and resettlement she can only have heard second- or thirdhand or, as she tells us, ''dreamed.'' One of the many pleasures is the richness of detail, the layering of meanings - and the suggestive uncertainty whether this is augmented memoir or elegant fiction sculpted on the slight armature of memory. Sometimes Ms. Kornblatt flags her inventions as dreams, research, probability, but the ambiguity persists. The Russia of Alexander II and the Cleveland of the mid-1960's are as much creative inventions as the Continued on next page inner lives of people she barely, or never, knew. The narrator's consciousness begins in the 1940's in a small Boston flat dense with the history of her grandparents' European past. She remembers little of those years with certainty - her grandfather died when she was ''barely tall enough to see out a window to the street below'' - but the household survives in her adult consciousness as a hive of memories, conflicting and incomplete, demanding to be ordered and understood. In these stories she can ''remember'' or devise solutions to all the riddles. She will dream the details of her grandfather's migration from the place of his birth near St. Petersburg through a magical apprenticeship - as in a fairy tale, the plucky small boy outwits the giant and is rewarded with his freedom, setting out on his great quest, as in the tales, with the added impedimenta of a fearful younger sister. In the second story, the young girl who grew into the narrator comes to know a woman called Fela Skolnik Teplitsky, who was renamed Flo by some functionary during the course of her dangerous transit from the Nazis. ''Memory was her work,'' we are told, as we are told of her husband, an obsessively overworked salesman of storm doors and windows, that ''when he's working, he forgets.'' Remembering and forgetting are the themes of immigrant life. Flo remembers, and tells, as a way of taming the past. The child learns that everything can be borne when it is ordered; that in shaping the story she transforms it. Daniel Rock was a contemporary, the privileged, graceful boy who was her protector and idol from her early school days. He was the first American she knew who seemed afflicted with ''History,'' inculpated in affairs beyond his own life. Until then she had believed that ''History . . . belonged to Europeans - all that terror and turbulence. . . . In America . . . I believed that one of the guarantees of citizenship . . . was a life apart from History.'' But Daniel Rock's grandfather was summoned by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and his father was said to be connected to the mob. History, the wider political reality, is here and now. The day after their high school graduation, Daniel Rock committed suicide. Susan Perry, an antiwar activist with a husband fighting in Vietnam, shared the narrator's tiny office, turning out brochures on drugs and rat control for Cleveland's first black mayor. Susan does not understand her own life, but she displays it, revealing without intent the ''ghostly dark'' in which young American women lay awake in those years wondering about their lives, not yet able to marshal themselves to wonder aloud or to any purpose. Only after Susan is dead of an overdose, after the narrator herself has borne a child, does she begin to see that her own life in history is a matter of inventing, forming, imposing her will on shapeless matter. ''Perhaps all women die to their old lives when a new one grows inside them,'' the narrator says. It is her companion of childbirth, the woman in the same labor room, whose Lamaze breathing she heard through the white curtain, who is her guide, first to transformation, then to the imagining of her own death, not as an untimely mischance but as the mundane fatality that awaits everyone. If there is any criticism to be made of this dense and beautiful book, it is that the form - stories of the dead - drains ''Breaking Bread'' of forward motion, narrative drive. For while we always know that life ends, and rarely well, we manage most of the time to hold that knowledge in suspension. Even in the early stories, wonderful tapestries of the past within the present, one longs to have more of the child's mind pressing forward into the future. And in the later stories of her contemporaries, for all their powerful presence, one wants something more than death as the answer to the reader's most basic question: what happens next? THE JOE MCCARTHY SHOW My parents might talk politics from time to time. We watched the McCarthy hearings on television - my father maintaining a running critique of [ the Senator ] , my mother more distressed that Roy Cohn, ''a nice Jewish boy like that,'' should be McCarthy's devoted counsel - but how did that spectacle impinge on our lives? How different was it, really, this public purge, from the other shows we watched together, my mother bringing out a steady supply of snacks - a bowl of fruit, cookies on a plate, a bag of potato chips she warned us ''makes a mess if you're not careful.'' If my family existed in such unworldly innocence, I imagined for the Rocks an even more protected world, affluence invoking a pristine order in their daily lives. From ''Breaking Bread.''

644-> GIANTS DEFEAT REDSKINS BY 17-0, REACH SUPER BOWL WITH BRONCOS
A decade ago, the Giants were a losing football team: disorganized, disheartened and seemingly doomed. Today, they won their way into their first Super Bowl. Before an adoring crowd of 76,633, the largest to watch them in the 10-year history of Giants Stadium, the Giants overwhelmed the Washington Redskins, 17-0. That made the Giants the champions of the National Football League's National Conference. This was their 11th consecutive victory, and it raised their record to 16-2: 14-2 in the regular season and 2-0 in the playoffs. It was their 10th home game this season, and they won all 10. The Giants had contributions from many sources. On offense, Phil Simms passed infrequently but well and Joe Morris ran well against a defense waiting for him. On defense, the Giants smothered George Rogers's running and Jay Schroeder's passing. Constant wind gusts up to 30 miles an hour hurt the Redskins much more than they hurt the Giants. Favored in Super Bowl Now the Giants will face the Denver Broncos two weeks from today in Super Bowl XXI in the Rose Bowl at Pasadena, Calif. Bob Martin, a leading oddsmaker in Las Vegas, Nev., installed the Giants as 8-point favorites. Earlier today, the Broncos won the American Conference championship with a 23-20 overtime victory over the favored Browns in Cleveland. The Browns led, 20-13, until the Broncos drove 98 yards for the tying touchdown on John Elway's 5-yard pass to Mark Jackson with 37 seconds left in regulation time. Then, after 5 minutes 48 seconds of overtime, the Broncos won on Rich Karlis's 33-yard field goal. The Giants beat the Redskins twice during the regular season, and they were 7-point favorites to do it again. They did it with workmanlike efficiency. They built a 17-0 lead in the first 23:04 and that was the end of the scoring and the Redskins. Weekly Ritual The efficiency was there even for what has become a weekly ritual - the dousing of Coach Bill Parcells with a bucket of icy Gatorade at the end of a Giants victory. With 1:56 left in today's game, the Giants stopped the Redskins on fourth down on the Giants' 22-yard line. It was the Redskins' last gasp. It was also the signal for Harry Carson, the Giants' 11th-year linebacker, to sneak up on Parcells with the Gatorade. Not more than 100 cameras followed Carson as he performed the deed. Parcells spotted him and tried to spill the Gatorade on Carson, but Carson's superior strength won the day, and Parcells was doused. Parcells, who is unusually close to his players, grinned the grin of a happy coach. He grinned more seconds later when Jim Burt, the Giants' enthusiastic nose tackle, dumped another bucket of Gatorade on Carson. ''I didn't plan it,'' said Burt, ''but I figured I'd get the old man once.'' Burt did more celebrating. When the game ended, he climbed into the stands and hugged his wife and celebrated with fans there. Then he returned to the field and danced with Pepper Johnson, the Giants' rookie linebacker, amid the confetti that started pouring down from the stands with three minutes left in the game. Subdued Locker Room Almost strangely, the Giants' locker room was subdued. There was no champagne and no yelling. ''We're businesslike people,'' said Billy Ard, the Giants' offensive guard. ''We haven't finished our business yet.'' Did the coach tell the players that? ''You know he did,'' said Ard. ''We have to keep things in perspective,'' said Carson, the team philosopher, ''because we've got a job to do on the field. We're going to Pasadena not just to show up, but to win. It ain't over yet.'' To many Giants, the game was won with the opening coin flip. The Redskins, as the visiting team, had the choice of heads or tails. They called heads. The coin came up tails. The Giants had the choice of receiving, kicking off or defending either goal. They chose to defend the east goal, meaning they would play the first quarter with the wind to their backs. It turned out to be a wise move. Parcells said he had arrived at the stadium at 7:15 A.M. for the 4 P.M. game and had gone on the field four times before the game to check on the wind. ''That's the toughest wind I've played in since I've been here,'' he said. ''It's windy every day in practice,'' said Simms, ''but not like this.'' Still, said Coach Joe Gibbs of the Redskins, ''we were all on the same field together.'' Short Punts Hurt Redskins Perhaps, but in the first quarter the Giants were on the better part of the field. Steve Cox of the Redskins punted three times in the quarter for just 23 yards, then 27 yards, then 24 yards. The Giants took advantage of the first two punts to set up scores. Their first possession started on their 47-yard line. Six plays later, Raul Allegre kicked a 47-yard field goal, the longest since he became a Giant in the fourth week of the season. The next Redskins punt gave the Giants the ball on the Redskins' 38. Eight plays later, Simms passed 5 yards to Bobby Johnson for an apparent touchdown, only to have the play nullified by a penalty against Maurice Carthon for illegal motion. The penalty was supposed to be 5 yards; the officials measured off 6 yards. It made no difference. On the next play, Simms scrambled, looking for a receiver. Lionel Manuel raced to the middle of the end zone, and the Redskins, in a zone defense, did not pick him up quickly enough. Simms drilled the ball to Manuel, and the Giants led, 10-0. In the second quarter, the Redskins had the wind to their backs. They also had a scoring play misfire, and that led to the Giants' second touchdown. On fourth down from the Giants' 34, the Redskins lined up for a 51-yard field-goal attempt by Jess Atkinson, a former Giant. But Jeff Bostic's snap skimmed along the ground and bounced past Schroeder, the holder. Carl Banks recovered for the Giants on the Redskins' 49. Five plays later, on second down from the 9-yard line, Simms bootlegged the ball and was stopped a foot short of a touchdown. ''It was a busted play,'' said Simms. ''I turned the wrong way. If I wasn't so startled, I might have scored.'' The touchdown was merely delayed. On the next play, Morris ran to the right and kept sliding outside until he stepped into the end zone. That made the score 17-0. Though 36:56 remained, in the game, no one scored again. 37 Plays, 34 Passes In the second half, the Redskins had 37 offensive plays: 34 passes by Schroeder, two sacks and only one run. They did not run at all in the last 27 minutes. Pressure from the Giants' relentless linemen and linebackers forced Schroeder to abandon his protective pocket time after time. He finished the day with unimpressive figures, 20 completions in 50 attempts for 195 yards, with four sacks. The 50 attempts were the most ever in a National Conference championship game. The Redskins have won 26 straight games in which they have had someone run for at least 100 yards. Here, Rogers, their best runner, carried 9 times for 15 yards and Kelvin Bryant 6 times for 25 yards. Meanwhile, Morris kept the Giants moving with 29 carries for 87 yards. Simms completed 7 of 14 passes for 90 yards and did what he had to do. ''It wasn't a pretty game for us,'' said Morris. ''It was hard to pass in the wind. You have to run the ball and they know you're going to run the ball, so it's hard. They're a tough team. They don't die.'' ''It was probably one of my worst games blocking,'' said Carthon, one of the league's best blocking fullbacks. Carthon also fumbled away the ball in Giants territory twice in the last five and a half minutes, but each time the Redskins were stopped when a fourth-down pass fell incomplete. In the first quarter, Gary Clark of the Redskins dropped a sure touchdown pass because, he said, ''I tried to run with it before I caught it.'' So the Giants won their first championship game since the 1963 season, three seasons before the Super Bowl began. In the last five seasons, the Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers have played in four Super Bowls and won three. On the last two Sundays, the Giants have beaten those two teams by a combined score of 66-3. After the game, Wellington Mara, the Giants' 70-year-old president and half owner, was a happy man. He wore a ring symbolizing the Giants' 1956 league championship and a tie clip marking their 1962 conference title. A finger was available for a Super Bowl ring. ''The Super Bowl starts tomorrow,'' he said.

645-> Gooden's Ex-Fiancee Held
Personal troubles continued to hound Dwight Gooden yesterday when his former fiancee was arrested and charged with carrying a stolen, loaded pistol at La Guardia Airport, where she was meeting the pitching star of the Mets for a reconciliation. Gooden was inbound from his home in Tampa, Fla., when the Port Authority police arrested his friend, Carlene Pearson, as she was passing through the security checkpoint at the Delta Airlines terminal. She was detained after a loaded two-shot derringer was detected in her handbag, and was taken away for questioning before Gooden's plane landed. She was charged with criminal possession of stolen property and criminal possession of a weapon, both felonies. ''I don't know where she got the gun or what she was doing with it,'' Gooden said later, after going to his condominium in Port Washington, L.I. ''I'm as surprised as anyone. We were getting back together. I don't think it's possible she intended to harm me.'' The 22-year-old pitcher flew to New York just one week after he had been placed on probation for three years after pleading no contest to two felony charges of fighting with police officers in Tampa. Engagement Was Broken In October, on the night the Mets won the World Series, he and Ms. Pearson broke their engagement. Then Gooden acknowledged that he was the father of a nine-month-old son born to Debra Hamilton, who had been a high school friend. ''But they were reconciled by telephone only in the last week or so,'' said Jay Horwitz, public relations director of the Mets. ''They made plans to go furniture shopping. She came up from her home in Philadelphia on Thursday, and Doc was flying up from Florida to meet her.'' Ms. Pearson, who is 21, went to La Guardia Airport with Meade Chasky, a friend of Gooden from Long Island. She was going through the security checkpoint in the Delta terminal about 10:30 A.M. to meet Gooden when his plane arrived at the gate. Armando Arrastia, a spokesman for the Port Authority, gave this account of what happened next: ''In a routine investigation of her handbag, the Delta security person noticed the pistol and notified Vincent Russo, the Port Authority officer on duty there. She was taken to the Port Authority police building at the airport, and they checked with the Florida authorities on the weapon. They were advised by the Hillsborough County Sheriff that the weapon had been reported stolen in 1982. It's a .38-caliber, two-shot derringer, and it was fully loaded.'' Ms. Pearson, according to police sources, said that the pistol had been given to her ''by her boyfriend a year ago,'' and she had forgotten that it was in her handbag. But Gooden denied later that he had been involved, and said: ''I have no knowledge of the gun.'' Ms. Pearson was arraigned last night before Judge Melvin Glass in Criminal Court in Queens, and was released when she posted bail of $1,500 in cash. She was told to return Feb. 20 for a hearing. Gooden, after his flight had landed, went to Shea Stadium and then to his condominium in Port Washington without seeing Ms. Pearson. He indicated last night that he would probably return home to Florida tomorrow.

646-> REAGAN TO NAME NEW DOMESTIC AIDE
President Reagan will appoint Gary L. Bauer, a political conservative who is now Under Secretary of Education, as his chief adviser on domestic policy, Administration officials said today. The appointment of Mr. Bauer, whose views on domestic issues have been popular among the President's right-wing supporters, comes at a time when Patrick J. Buchanan, the director of the White House Office of Communications, who is a staunch conservative, has indicated that he expects to leave his White House post soon. A White House official said Mr. Reagan would probably announce the appointment of Mr. Bauer on Friday. Reached today, Mr. Bauer said, ''I have no comment until there is official word from the White House.'' Influence on Policy Varies Mr. Bauer, a 40-year old lawyer who headed a special study group on the family last year, worked in the White House Office of Policy Development before joining the Education Department in October 1982. In previous years the role and influence of the chief White House adviser on domestic policy have varied considerably with the occupant of the office. Mr. Reagan's last two advisers, John A. Svahn and Edwin L. Harper, had low-key styles and avoided the public spotlight. By contrast, Martin C. Anderson, the President's first domestic policy adviser, was a major figure in shaping the Administration's domestic policy in Mr. Reagan's first term. Mr. Bauer, who replaces Mr. Svahn, will take over at a time when White House officials have said Mr. Reagan hopes to use his last two years as President to achieve some top domestic goals, such as a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced Federal budget. An Administration official said that ''feelers'' had been put out to see if Education Secretary William J. Bennett would be interested in the domestic policy job, but that Mr. Bennett had indicated he did not want to leave his Cabinet post. Report on Family Values Mr. Bauer, who speaks frequently about family values and the need for building character in young people, drew fire from Democrats when he released a report on the family last fall that was the result of a seven-month study by a 22-member interdepartmental working group. The report, mostly written by Mr. Bauer, credited the Administration with bringing to a ''crashing halt'' the ''antifamily agenda'' of preceding years. ''Two liberal decades'' frayed the fabric of American life, he said, bringing increased crime, illegitimate birth, drug use, teen-age pregnancy, divorce, sexually transmitted disease and poverty. The report also said that the ''easy availability of welfare in all of its forms has become a powerful force for destruction of family life through perpetuation of the welfare culture.'' Mr. Bauer was born in Covington, Ky., and was graduated from Georgetown Law School. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the No. 2 post in the Department of Education in July 1985. As Under Secretary, he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the department and became an outspoken defender of the Administration's views on education and social issues. Mr. Bauer and his wife, the former Carol Hoke, have three children and reside in Fairfax, Va.

647-> STATE AIDE SEEKS VICTIMS' VERSION IN QUEENS CASE
The special state prosecutor for criminal justice in New York City appealed yesterday to lawyers for black victims of the Howard Beach attack to substantiate their charges that the police and the Queens District Attorney had mishandled the investigation. Stepping into a case riddled with contradictions and stymied in court, the special prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, publicly asked the lawyers to reach him over the weekend and provide evidence that the authorities were ignoring or covering up vital elements of inquiry. But the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, promptly rebuffed the appeal and repeated their demands that Federal prosecutors or a special state prosecutor named by Governor Cuomo take over the prosecution of the case from the District Attorney, John J. Santucci. The impasse appeared to set the stage for a full-scale investigation next week by Mr. Hynes into charges by the lawyers that the authorities had mistreated their client, Cedric Sandiford, and had suppressed his account of the death of his 23-year-old stepson, Michael Griffith, who was killed by a car while fleeing an attack by white youths. Mr. Sandiford, 36, who has made no public statements on one of the worst racial incidents in the city in years, said he would attend a public forum at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem today and tell what happened in Howard Beach early on Dec. 20. As the complex case moved into its third week, there were these other developments: * Mayor Koch met at City Hall with black and white leaders of Queens and Howard Beach and expressed concern that the community's name was being equated with racism. ''We should not pillory a whole community,'' the Mayor declared. * An interracial group calling itself Concerned Citizens of South Queens denounced the attacks but defended Howard Beach as a fair-minded community and called on clerics to preach sermons and hold prayer vigils encouraging racial harmony. * A coalition of black groups called for a citywide ''day of mourning and outrage'' for the black victims on Jan. 21 and said they were considering plans for a black boycott of businesses and schools that day. * New York City school officials said security in the schools - including John Adams High School in Ozone Park, where three white youths accused in the attack are enrolled - was being reviewed to insure safety when classes resume Monday. * Judge Ernest Bianchi of Criminal Court in Queens, who dismissed murder, manslaughter and assault charges against the whites last Monday for insufficient evidence, defended his actions in a passionate courtroom statement during a hearing for three black youths accused of attacking a white teen-ager as they chanted slogans of revenge for Howard Beach. The judge upheld assault charges against two of the black youths and dismissed the charges against the third. Attack on 3 Blacks The Howard Beach case stems from an attack by a group of white youths on three blacks - Mr. Griffith, Mr. Sandiford and Timothy Grimes - early Dec. 20 as the blacks walked through the community just west of Kennedy International Airport after their car broke down. The whites beat them with fists, a baseball bat and a tree limb in an eight-block chase that ended at 1 A.M. at 156th Avenue and 86th Street, beside a chain-link fence of the Shore Parkway. Mr. Grimes had escaped earlier. The police said Mr. Sandiford told them that he and Mr. Griffith ran through a hole in the fence to escape and that he saw a dark car involved in the chase appear again on the parkway. They quoted him as having said he did not witness the fatal crash. Mr. Griffith was struck and killed by a car driven by Dominick Blum, a 24-year-old court officer, who left the scene, returned an hour later and was not charged after telling the police he thought he had hit a tire or an animal. The police later said their investigation showed that Mr. Blum was not part of the attack and that he had killed Mr. Griffith accidentally. Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason have contended that Mr. Sandiford saw the crash, that Mr. Blum was an accomplice of the white youths and that he deliberately killed Mr. Griffith. They have charged that the police and the prosecutor are covering up Mr. Sandiford's evidence and have said their client will not cooperate unless Mr. Blum is charged with murder and the case is turned over to an independent prosecutor. But the lawyers have not given detailed evidence to support their charges, and while the police have denied the allegations and cited details to support their accounts, numerous gaps, discrepancies and contradictions in the official version have left doubts among many about what happened. In an effort to determine if authorities mishandled the case, Mr. Hynes, whose title is Deputy Attorney General and Special Prosecutor for the New York City Criminal Justice System, appealed yesterday to the lawyers to provide him with evidence of their contentions. He said he would be willing to meet ''anywhere, anytime.'' ''Right now, we have nothing more than allegations,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''I haven't seen any evidence to support them. If by Monday I haven't heard from them, then I'll take the next step. I think these are very serious charges and there has to be some resolution.'' Mr. Hynes did not say what his next step would be, but legal experts said he would probably open a full-scale inquiry into the charges and into the handling of the case by the police and the prosecutor. The experts said Mr. Hynes would not supersede Mr. Santucci as prosecutor in the case. Mason Assails Hynes's Role By late yesterday, Mr. Hynes said he had not heard from the lawyers. But Mr. Mason, in an interview, criticized Mr. Hynes's intervention as inadequate and said Mr. Sandiford would not cooperate until either Federal prosecutors or a special prosecutor named by Governor Cuomo took over the case from Mr. Santucci. ''With all due respect to Mr. Hynes,'' Mr. Mason said, ''he is not the proper prosecutor to deal with this case. We want a comprehensive and thorough investigation on a state and Federal level and the appropriate thing for the Governor to do is appoint a special prosecutor.'' Mr. Mason said Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, and James Bell, president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, had both asked Mr. Cuomo to name a special prosecutor. The lawyer said Mr. Sandiford would cooperate with Mr. Hynes if a special prosecutor were named to supersede Mr. Santucci. But he accused the Governor of maintaining a ''wall of silence'' and of showing an absence of ''moral leadership.'' He said Mr. Cuomo had not condemned the attack or visited the families of the victims. ''If he has national ambitions,'' Mr. Mason said, ''we don't intend to sit silently by and allow him to project himself to the nation that he is the Governor of all the people in this state. He is not.'' Cuomo Aide Denounces Maddox The Governor's press secretary, Martin Steadman, who denounced Mr. Maddox Thursday as having ''zero credibility,'' retorted that the charges against the Governor were ''totally untrue.'' He said Mr. Cuomo had repeatedly condemned the attack and had not visited the families because he was tied up with state business in Albany. Mr. Cuomo's Director of Criminal Justice, Lawrence T. Kurlander, who asked Mr. Hynes to look into the case, said the Governor did not intend to name a special prosecutor to supersede Mr. Santucci because ''we already have in place a special prosecutor designed to deal precisely with this kind of thing - a man whose reputation is one of honesty and integrity and who is fully capable of dealing with these matters. Possibility of Civil Rights Case After the dismissal of the most serious charges against the white youths -an action that left only reckless endangerment charges pending against Jon L. Lester, 17; Scott Kern, 17, and Jason Ladone, 16 - law-enforcement officials said Mr. Santucci faced a difficult decision on whether to take the case before a grand jury. Without the testimony of Mr. Sandiford - the only person besides the suspects and their friends who saw what happened - chances of a successful prosecution were doubtful, legal experts said. But some law-enforcement officials said that Mr. Santucci might turn the case over to Federal prosecutors as a civil-rights matter.

649-> Raiders Of the Sacred Sites
As a former Bureau of Land Management ranger, I witnessed firsthand the archeological-site destruction in southern Utah and Colorado documented by Derek Goodwin in ''Raiders of the Sacred Sites'' (Dec. 7). Artifact collectors are professional and elusive; despite back-country patrols and aircraft surveillance, most of my time was spent reburying the remains of Native Americans scattered across the surface of prehistoric sites. One bulldozed site I visited had a stack of five sun-bleached human skulls. Some of the bones I discovered had been gnawed to pieces by wild animals. Yet when ''collectors'' loot Indian graves and are arrested for it, they rarely see the inside of a jail and are fined a mere fraction of the value of the artifacts they dig from the ground.

650-> SALINGER V. RANDOM HOUSE, A GRAY AREA FOR PUBLISHERS
Publishers and scholars, traditionally opposed to legal restraints on publishing, have not rallied to the defense of Random House, which was prohibited by a Federal appellate court on Thursday from publishing an unauthorized biography of J. D. Salinger. ''It's a tricky situation, because it directly confronts the right to privacy and the public's right to know,'' said Brooks Thomas, the chairman of Harper & Row and a lawyer. ''But I don't think the public's right to know what is in Salinger's letters is greater than the author's right to decide whether to publish them and when.'' The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held that the book - ''J. D. Salinger: A Writing Life'' by Ian Hamilton - borrowed too heavily from Mr. Salinger's unpublished letters. Harriet F. Pilpel, a noted First Amendment lawyer and a co-chairman of the National Coalition Against Censorship, agreed that the case presented an interesting clash between the right to privacy and the right of the public to know. ''I usually resolve that dilemma by saying, unless there is almost some life or death reason for suppressing something, I am in favor of letting it be known,'' she said. ''But the First Amendment includes a right to be silent as well as the right to talk or publish.'' 2 Courts, 2 Decisions Charles Rembar, who in the 1950's and 1960's successfully argued the right to publish ''Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' ''Tropic of Cancer'' and ''Fanny Hill'' in the United States, read the Court of Appeals decision yesterday and said, ''I can't say whether it's right or wrong, but I think both courts understood the law and just saw the situation differently.'' Two months ago a judge in Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected Mr. Salinger's request for an injunction in the suit, ruling that the biography made only minimal use of material that was entitled to copyright protection. This week's decision reversed that ruling. Under Federal copyright law, the right to ''fair use'' of an author's work - for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research - is an exception to the author's exclusive right to control the publication and distribution of it. But the actual definition of ''fair use,'' according to Mr. Rembar, depends on such things as how much of the original document is used, how large a part it constitutes of the work in which it appears, whether there is competition between the two works, and the purpose for which the material is used. ''If you're writing a review you can quote extensively from the book, because that may be the only way you can express your opinion of it,'' Mr. Rembar said. ''On the other hand, if you're writing about songs and you use 4 of the 16 bars of a chorus, you're taking too much.'' Beyond the Limits The Court of Appeals said that the Hamilton book, by its extensive use of ''close paraphrases'' of the Salinger letters, had gone beyond the permitted limits. The letters, which were written between 1939 and 1961, were donated by the recipients or their representatives to university libraries. Based on what she has read,Mrs. Pilpel said, the Court of Appeals decision is important because it finds that one can quote from unpublished material, including letters. ''The law has been quite hazy on this, although it was generally thought you could not make fair use of such unpublished material,'' she said. ''But this case seems to raise a question in that regard.'' Because the matter is so important, she added, ''It will no doubt be the subject of future litigation and possibly legislation.'' Random House was still deciding yesterday whether to revise the manuscript further or appeal Thursday's decision to the United States Supreme Court. ''We think the decision is wrong, and a serious blow to scholarship and publishers,'' said Annik La Farge, the company's publicity manager, ''but at the moment we are still reviewing the options avilable to us.'' If the publisher does appeal, legal scholars say, precedent is not on its side. ''The Supreme Court has on occasion shown itself very sensitive to rights of copyright holders,'' Mrs. Pilpel said. In 1985 it ruled that The Nation infringed the copyright of the memoirs of Gerald R. Ford when the magazine printed unauthorized quotations from the book several weeks before its 1979 publication by Harper & Row and The Reader's Digest.

651-> WESTCHESTER OPINION; RURAL AREAS BECOME DEBRIS SITES IN WAKE OF DUMP CLOSING
SINCE the closing of the Croton landfill last summer many towns have discontinued or limited pickup of bulk trash. Commercial carters, the alternative to municipal pickup, refuse to remove a lone discarded sofa or refrigerator, while the larger loads that they agree to remove are likely to cost homeowners more than four times as much as a year ago. Fees for disposing of construction debris have also risen by as much. The result is that growing numbers of homeowners and small contractors are discarding household goods and construction debris in parks, along roadways, on undeveloped private property and along the hundreds of miles of the Croton reservoir system. Towns, the State Parks Department and New York City, which owns the Croton Reservoir, are spending increasing amounts of money to clean up the trash; and they voice frustration over the lack of an imminent solution. Dumping has been especially severe along portions of the Croton Reservoir system, particularly those bordered by roads. Because development is not permitted near the reservoir, such isolated roads have become favorite dumping sites. ''There has been a marked increase in dumping near the reservoirs,'' acknowledged Andrew McCarthy, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which manages New York City's reservoirs. ''Regrettably, we've been the recipients for trash that people can no longer take to the town dumps and that private carters have started to refuse.'' ''There are more and more mattresses, couches, assorted furniture, the leftovers from garage sales and a tremendous amount of building material all along Lake Road by the reservoir,'' said Peter Berman, a resident of the that area in Yorktown. Other neighbors who jog or bicycle along winding Lake Road confirmed his assessment; they said that Lake Road and other roads near the reservoirs are being used as dump sites. Mr. McCarthy added that an increasing portion of the illegally dumped trash consisted of construction debris, probably dumped by small contractors. Although the trash does not affect water quality, he said, his department is concerned with the unsightly appearance and with the mounting amount of refuse that needs to be cleaned up. While the problem affects the reservoirs in other parts of Westchester as well, it is those in the less-developed areas of northern Westchester that are affected the most. The Croton Acqueduct Trail, a 26-mile linear park that runs from Croton-on-Hudson to New York City, has always been a favorite dumping site because it is accessible from many points, explained Jayne McLaughlin, manager of the park. But now, she said, there are growing numbers of contractors dumping as well. Ms. McLaughlin, who is also manager of the Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park, said her staff was cleaning up several times more trash at the two parks than before the closing of the landfill. Municipal highway departments are also having to deal with what they termed a mounting trash problem along unpopulated roads and on dead- end streets. ''It's getting much worse,'' said Clayton Osborne Jr., Somers' Highway Superintendent. ''People dump on dead-end streets and along the reservoir. And the big problem is, when we clean it up we have no place to put it.'' ''Sometimes you come in on Monday and you have a nice surprise with your dumpster full of shingles dumped by someone who redid his roof over the weekend,'' said Drew A. Outhouse, North Salem's Highway Superintendent.. He added that, having little recourse, people took advantage of an open dumpster, especially because businesses locked their dumpsters now to avoid having them filled by others. The average cost for disposing of the 10 tons a dumpster holds is about $900, according to Frank Nello of Nello Carting in Brewster. The Highway Department staff in Yorktown is also spending more time cleaning up trash from roadways, particularly the less-populated ones in the southern end of town, where ''it's getting much worse,'' according to Brian Slavin, Superintendent of Parks and Recreation in Yorktown. Joseph M. Caverly, the county's Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, said there was a problem with periodic illegal dumping at some of the more remote county parks but that there had been no increase since the Croton landfill closing. He attributed what appears to be an exception of the county parks to supervision and ongoing public-conservation programs. The county's fine for illegal dumping is $250, or 30 days in jail or both, and there are no plans to raise that figure, according to Marc Moran, a county spokesman. Individual municipalities and state parks also have fines, ranging from $50 to $1,000, but they are rarely imposed, officials noted. In order to convict someone of dumping illegally, he usually must be caught in the act, and that almost never happens, the officials said. ''If they dump at night, with no traffic, no one can see them,'' Mr. McCarthy said of the dumping along the Croton Reservoir. Both town police departments and the Water Supply Police patrol the roads, but almost no dumpers have been caught. Stakeouts have also been tried, but they have not been successful, he said. ''They've been eluding all of these combined forces,'' Mr. McCarthy said of the illegal dumpers. Towns have been no more successful in catching the culprits. ''Sometimes we are able to get the names by checking through the trash and we try to prosecute. But they always have excuses,'' Mr. Osborne of Somers said of the illegal dumpers. Mr. Slavin said: ''We've never caught anybody. The only way we've been able to stop dumping in selected areas was to put up fencing.'' Ms. McLaughlin said the state park police had been concentrating on identifying and prosecuting the contractors who dump construction debris along the Croton Aqueduct Trail and more park police have been requested. The park police are sometimes able to trace the trash back to the source; because the trail is populated, the culprits are sometimes seen by residents. Violations are now being written under the conservation rather than the parks law, with a fine of $1,000 rather than the previous maximum of $250, which made it cheaper to pay the fine than to dispose of the trash properly, Ms. McLaughlin said. Cleanup is thus an increasing strain on the staffs of towns, the parks and New York City's Water Supply Bureau. The dumpsters, which used to fill up once a week with garbage collected from around the reservoirs, are now filled much more often, and the cost of disposing of the trash along the reservoir has more than doubled, according to Mr. McCarthy. The state parks' cleanup budget has not increased, so the money ''comes out of something else we could have done,'' Ms. McLaughlin said. As long as any ''unlatched open spot remains a target,'' according to Ms. McLaughlin, the common cry is one of helplessness. And the situation is likely to get worse in the spring. ''Spring cleanup always meant an increase, but this year we expect the problems to get much worse,'' Mr. McCarthy said.

652-> CRITICS' CHOICES; Dance
French dance is enjoying a renaissance. And the venerable Paris Opera Ballet is not the only important French choreographic center today. The enterprising Lyon Opera Ballet opens Tuesday at the City Center with Maguy Marin's ''Cinderella,'' which promises to be like no other version of the fairy tale. All the action takes place in a dollhouse and a jitterbugging Cinderella rides off to the ball in a pink convertible. Another French company, the Paris-based Ballet de France, established in 1985, will also offer an unusual treatment of a familiar story. Gray Veredon's ''Romeo et Juliette,'' to be danced by the troupe Saturday night at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, retells Shakespeare's classic tragedy - but to Berlioz, rather than to the Prokofiev score most choreographers employ. (For an interview with Francoise Adret, artistic director of the Lyon Opera Ballet, see the Dance page of the Arts and Leisure section.) Among the American choreographers who are influential in France is Kansas-born Karole Armitage, whose works often combine classicism with punk. A ballet-trained dancer who was formerly a member of both the Geneva Ballet in Switzerland and Merce Cunningham's modern-dance company, Ms. Armitage has organized a new group, the Armitage Ballet, which opens Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Guest artists will be Stephanie Saland and Robert La Fosse of the New York City Ballet, and Robert Blankshine, formerly of the Joffrey Ballet. American, Canadian and European dancers will participate in ''Festival of Dance Stars 1987,'' Saturday night and next Sunday afternoon at Brooklyn College. The program features several premieres. But what makes it unusual is the fact that it includes an excerpt from George Balanchine's ''Mozart Violin Concerto,'' a work choreographed in Buenos Aires in 1942 that has never before been seen in the United States.

653-> QUESTION OF THE WEEK; ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
I think it's only natural that in a free enterprise system some ''market correction'' develops. It was the owners who were responsible for the explosion of player salaries in the 1970's; they have now realized the risky economics of continued bidding wars and longterm contracts. There is no premeditated ''collusion'' here - it's just that they're all thinking and acting the same way. Personally, I think baseball players are paid quite enough. However, there is nothing wrong with a man (player or owner) trying to get the best deal he can. It's what made salaries skyrocket a decade ago; it's what's making salaries level off now. MICHAEL B.

655-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Ramsay Wins 800th
AFTER two years as the Philadelphia 76ers' general manager, Jack Ramsay, who had coached St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia for 11 seasons, decided to take a crack at coaching in the National Basketball Association. He has been at it ever since and four different teams have rolled to victories under his guidance. But one of his most memorable regular-season successes came Friday night in Indianapolis when the Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 116-106. It was Ramsay's 800th career victory. Only Red Auerbach accumulated more victories in the N.B.A. -938 - during his 19-season tenure as coach of the Washington Capitals, Tri-Cities and the Boston Celtics. ''All teams are challenging,'' said Ramsay, in his first season as the Pacer coach. ''There are different levels of expectation for each team. For this team if we make the playoffs we would consider that an accomplishment. For a contending team, merely making the playoffs doesn't achieve that.'' The Pacers have made the playoffs only once (1981) since joining the N.B.A. for the 1976-77 season.

Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, who is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring with 36.9 points a game so far this season, has tallied 4,233 points for an average of 30.0 during 141 games in his first two and a half seasons as a pro. He was limited to 18 games last season because of a broken bone in his foot. Until now, only three players who eventually totaled at least 400 games and 10,000 points in their N.B.A. careers completed their first three seasons with a higher average.

To the Sports Editor: Regarding the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup campaign, I would like to note that although it is the first time since the inception of the America's Cup in the 19th century that the club has not been involved in the final series, it is also the first time the New York Yacht Club has had to compete to be involved in the final series. Yachting has changed dramatically since the 19th century. STEPHEN HICKS New York

662-> CORPORATE POWER, CONT.; Bad Bosses
To the Editor: ''When the Boss Is Unbearable'' (Dec. 28) omits discussion of why a boss acts that way. If the employee can understand the boss's motives there is a wider choice available than quitting the job or saying, ''When you...I feel...'' If the employee can learn to view the ''bad'' boss as a parent figure with justified anxiety or low self-esteem, it becomes easier to reverse roles and provide ''parental'' guidance. Being a good parent to one's boss may involve setting an example: praising an achievement of an overly critical boss who was likely criticized by his or her own parents. Making an appointment to see an elusive boss can show understanding of a boss's fear of people or shyness. Or the task may require asking the boss what effect yelling was intended to accomplish, listening carefully and showing an understanding of the boss's purpose. Then it may be effective to point out the effect of yelling on the employee. It's not the technique that counts so much as the understanding that the big bad wolf is having a bad day or has a vulnerable skin or yearns to be taken by the hand. DAVID C. BELGRAY New York, Dec. 31

663-> JETS ELIMINATED BY BROWNS IN OVERTIME
The season finally ran out on the Jets today, but it took the third-longest game in pro football history and a magnificent Browns comeback to close it. At the end, it came down to Mark Moseley, the erratic, 38-year-old kicker closing out his 15th season. After missing a 23-yard boot earlier in sudden-death play, he kicked the winner, a 27-yarder toward Lake Erie. That shot gave the Browns a 23-20 victory after 17 minutes 2 seconds of overtime and sent them into the American Conference championship game here next Sunday. The Browns (13-4) will play the winner of the divisional playoff game between the Broncos and the New England Patriots Sunday in Denver. The Jets held a 20-10 lead with a little more than four minutes remaining in regulation despite an injury to Pat Ryan, their starting quarterback. O'Brien Replaces Ryan Ryan, who replaced Ken O'Brien as the starter in the wild-card playoff victory over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, reinjured a groin pull he had suffered during today's warm-ups. So O'Brien relieved him in the second quarter, with the Jets trailing by 10-7. Though the Jets opened a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, neither quarterback was able to generate much offense. The Jets managed only 2 third-down conversions in 18 attempts, and 9 sacks by the Browns equaled a playoff record. O'Brien had been at the helm in the Jets' five straight season-ending losses, when their record plummeted to 10-6. Yet, the Jet defense, despite giving up a playoff record of 558 net yards, kept the Browns from catching up until the final minutes of the fourth quarter. That's when Bernie Kosar, with only one timeout remaining, led a pair of scoring drives. One went for a touchdown (helped by a key roughing-the-passer call against Mark Gastineau), and the other ended with Moseley's tying field goal with only 7 seconds remaining. Records for Kosar On his longest day, Kosar equaled a playoff record with 33 pass completions and set post-season records for passing with 64 attempts and 489 yards. It was Cleveland's first playoff victory since 1969, and the first playoff victory for a Central Division champion after one-game elmininations the previous three years. This Browns team, though, knows how to hang in. To Coach Marty Schottenheimer of the Browns, it was ''the opportunity to experience one of the finest games in the history of this sport.'' But it was something less to Coach Joe Walton of the Jets, who said, ''It's a very empty feeling.'' Overtime in the playoffs does not end after a 15-minute quarter, as it does in the regular season when tie games are possible. So after 15 scoreless minutes today, the teams went into a second overtime, which ended after 2:02 on Moseley's kick. The only longer games were in the 1971 playoffs when the Dolphins defeated the Chiefs 22:40 into overtime and a 1962 American Football League playoff game in which the Dallas Texans beat the Oilers 17:54 into overtime. Moseley prevented this one from going any longer, even though he had missed three of his first five field-goal attempts today. ''It's phenomenal the opportunity I've had to win games over the years,'' said Moseley, who earlier this season was cut by the Redskins in his 12th year with the team. Despite the constant din produced by 78,106 fans at Cleveland Stadium, this was often a dull game. And the Jets were seemingly in control with only 4:14 left while holding a commanding 10-point edge thanks to a 25-yard Freeman McNeil run. The score had been positioned by Jerry Holmes's interception. That was the second straight Browns drive that had ended with an interception. Earlier in the fourth quarter, Russell Carter became the first player to intercept Kosar after 133 straight passes. Kosar had not been intercepted the final three games of the regular season. With McNeil's score, the Browns seemed finished. Kosar had a first and 20 after a penalty and was sacked by Marty Lyons. With second and 24, Kosar threw an incomplete pass, but Gastineau was called for a late hit. It kept alive the drive, on which Kosar completed 6 of 9 passes. ''I've hit quarterbacks later than that and wasn't called,'' Gastineau said later. But Kevin Mack completed that drive with a 1-yard touchdown run and with 1:57 remaining the Browns trailed by 3. But McNeil was unable to run at peak performance at this point. On the previous drive he was poked in the eye, and this time the Jets held the ball for less than a minute. One of Dave Jennings's playoff-record 14 punts allowed the Browns to start from their 33. A penalty to Carl Howard, the Jets' cornerback, and a 37-yard completion to Webster Slaughter brought the Browns to the Jets' 15, from where Moseley sent the game into overtime with a 22-yard field goal with only seven seconds showing on the clock. In the overtime, three Jet drives failed and O'Brien was sacked twice. Over all, he was dumped six times and Ryan three times. The Jets won the toss, received the kick and were forced to punt. But on the Browns' first possession, they got to the Jets' 5-yard line. On first down, Schottenheimer didn't hesitate: He called on Moseley. But the kick was wide to the right. The Browns started the winning drive on their 31. After the first 15-minute overtime period had expired, the teams changed sides, and the Browns started to run the ball with Mack. A Tired Defense Bud Carson, the Jets' defensive coordinator, said his pass-rushers were simply too tired at that point and that he had to use lighter defensive backs to protect against Kosar's passes. So when Kosar handed Mack the ball, he was often running against smaller players. The Browns ground it out, including runs of 4 yards by Mack, 8 yards by Mack, then Herman Fontenot for 7, Mack for 15, then 4, then 7 more. At the Jets' 9, on second down, Schottenheimer again called for Moseley. This one was true. The end came 4 hours 5 minutes after the opening kickoff. The Jets' highlight had occurred hours earlier, when Ryan handed off to McNeil, who ran a few steps to the right, then lateraled back to Ryan, who found Wesley Walker in the end zone. That 42-yard score put the Jets on top, 7-0, but it did not diminish the Browns' enthusiasm. They immediately produced a 98-yard march that ended with Fontenot snaring a 37-yard touchdown pass from Kosar. Moseley and Pat Leahy traded second-quarter field goals, but Leahy kicked a 37-yarder to put the Jets ahead by 13-10 in the third quarter. But when McNeil put the Jets ahead by 20-10 in the fourth period, very few people deserted the cavernous, old stadium. MCnEIL HELD IN CHECK McNeil averaged only 2.8 yards a carry despite his 25-yard touchdown run, as 25 carries gained 71 yards. . . . Ryan was able to hold for Leahy on field-goal attempts even though he was unable to pass. Neither Ryan nor O'Brien threw an interception, and the Jets did not turn over the ball. . . . The Jets' secondary, meanwhile, was hampered by some new pass routes the Browns employed. Kosar's favorite receiver was the veteran tight end Ozzie Newsome, who caught 6 passes for 114 yards. Ten Cleveland receivers caught passes.

664-> CORPORATE POWER, CONT.; Battling Imports
To the Editor: Mr. Pearlman's article gave the exact picture of what is happening to the brush industry. We are innovative in our business but no sooner do we introduce a new product than it is copied in Taiwan and offered at less than half our cost of production. Thus, foreign companies save money on research and market development, because they get both free from us. Our patents are not of much help because it is impossible to sue hundreds of importers. We have taken up these infringements with the International Trade Commission, hoping that through the Customs Service they can put an end to such illegal importation. But any ruling they make will come long after the novelty of the product fades, with no damages awarded to the patent holder for infringements that were taking place through the years of investigation.

666-> LONG ISLANDERS; TEACHER'S LESSON: INVESTMENT
YOU can take David Lerner out of the classroom, but you can't take the classroom out of David Lerner. Less than a dozen years ago, Mr. Lerner, a resident of Jericho who is now 50 years old, was teaching history and social studies at Bayside High School in Queens. Today, he is owner and president of David Lerner Associates, a privately held, Syosset-based, 300-employee investment concern that, he says, marketed $750 million in securities in 1986. ''My background - I'm a schoolteacher,'' Mr. Lerner said. ''I think what I've done is bring that same philosophy to the investment world. We view ourselves to a large degree as an educational institution. Our stock in trade, we believe, is in educating the public to the various conservative income opportunities.'' Mr. Lerner's corporation, with offices in Syosset; Lake Success; Stamford, Conn.; Teaneck, N.J.; New City, N.Y.; White Plains; Boca Raton, Fla., and on Wall Street, sells a variety of investment vehicles. ''Tax-free municipal bonds,'' he said, ''Ginnie Maes, mutual funds of all descriptions, limited-partner real-estate syndications, annuities, interest-sensitive life insurance.'' ''The only thing we don't sell and have no intention of selling is common stocks,'' he said. ''It's antithetical to our philosophy. Our appeal is to the conservative investor, and stocks simply don't fit that category. Stocks are too volatile, much too uncertain. Our appeal and our approach is one of showing people how to conservatively invest their money to enhance their yields without taking great risks.'' As the new Federal income tax structure takes effect, Mr. Lerner sees increasing attractiveness in what he calls old standbys: high-yielding income funds, municipal bonds, Ginnie Maes. ''Because of the imminent reduction of taxes,'' he said, noting the disinclination of the new code to encourage tax shelters, ''income now becomes much more attractive.'' His close involvement with the workings of capitalism is a far cry from his youth. ''I grew up thinking of myself as a socialist,'' said Mr. Lerner, one of four sons of a house painter and housewife who spent his early years in the South Bronx area known as Fort Apache. He was educated at Public School 54 and Junior High School 40, spent a year and a half convalescing from polio as a charity patient at the Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., and graduated in 1954 from Morris High School. He continued his education at Hunter (now Lehman) College in the City University of New York and began teaching, picking up a master's degree from the City University. He started out as a social studies teacher at J.H.S. 55 in the South Bronx. He moved in the early 60's to Bayside High School, where he remained until 1975, when he left the profession and started his current business in his home. ''I think my life was evolving for a number of years before I left teaching,'' he said. ''I had worked part time selling securities and life insurance.'' His introduction to the business had come in 1960, when, newly married (he and his wife have two children), Mr. Lerner was awaiting a response to his application for summer work at a playground in the New York City school system. ''I never took a vacation,'' he said. ''I always worked three or four jobs.'' Through his wife, the former Lois Breitman, Mr. Lerner was introduced to an investment salesman, who suggested he drop by the office. ''I recall going up there wearing chino pants and a black T-shirt,'' Mr. Lerner said. ''I think in retrospect I was letting out a very strong message. I was looking upon this in a contemptuous way. It had to do with making money and the world of business. I thought that was not in keeping with the image I had of myself.'' But when shown the various investments the company marketed, he said, ''My reaction was, I can't believe I'll be paid to show people how to do this. These were mutual funds, the product seemed to be attractive and I became enthused by it.'' In 1968, Mr. Lerner began selling securities and insurance on his own while teaching full time. He began David Lerner Associates with 10 part-time employees, all schoolteachers. ''We grew very rapidly,'' Mr. Lerner said. ''I developed sales presentations, not very much different from the lesson plans I used to use as a schoolteacher, and the training materials were not very much different from the curriculums I used to work on when I was a schoolteacher.'' And to this day, Mr. Lerner speaks regularly at his company's investment seminars for the public. ''I believe now,'' he said, ''that what I've done, I've just really continued my teaching career.''

667-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Brotherhood
Brothers sitting simultaneously in Congress are not precisely rare, but they are unusual. In recent years there were the Burtons of California, Phil and John, both members of the House; the Mortons of Maryland, Thruston in the Senate and Rogers C. B. in the House; the Cranes of Illinois, Dan and Phil, also in the House, and, of course, the Kennedys, Edward and Robert, of Massachusetts and New York, who overlapped in the Senate from 1962 to 1964. Earlier, in the middle of the last century, three Washburn brothers occupied seats in the House: Cadwallader of Wisconsin, Israel Jr. of Maine and Elihu of Illinois. The very first Congress, in fact, had a pair of brothers from Pennsylvania: Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, who became Speaker of the House, and John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, also in the House. There are now only two brothers in the Congress, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Representative Sander Levin, from Detroit. Now the pair claim another distinction, a philatelic first, as it were. They say they have produced the first cachet, or seal on an envelope, ever created by brothers who are members of Congress. The seal, which commemorates the Michigan sesquicentennial, to be celebrated Jan. 26, is taken from the state seal. It depicts a man with a rifle watching the sun rise over a lake and is inscribed ''Tuebor,'' or ''I will defend.'' The siblings are printing 1,000 copies of the envelope to go on sale as first-day covers at $10, the proceeds to be donated to the American Philatelic Society's youth activities fund.

668-> NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Columbus, Ohio; Recycling A Courthouse
THIS city's original United States Courthouse and Post Office, a Romanesque and Gothic Revival structure on the National Register of Historic Places, has undergone a $10 million renovation in time for its centennial this year. But it might never have reached its 100th birthday had it not been for an unusual partnership between a prominent local law firm and municipal officials. The 75,000-square-foot structure in Statehouse Square was once the center of Federal operations here. But the post office moved in 1977, the last remaining Federal office workers left in 1982 and it was declared surplus property. The law firm of Bricker & Eckler began negotiations to buy the building in 1983, feeling that renovating the courthouse for its new headquarters would not only enhance its image but also make it eligible for lucrative preservation tax credits. But the firm needed the city's help to weave its way through a maze of Federal regulations that threatened to derail the deal. Richard C. Simpson, the administrative partner who handled the negotiations, said Bricker & Eckler wanted to use tax-exempt, low-interest industrial development bonds to finance the purchase. But to get them it first had to own the building, or at least have an option to buy it. The catch, Mr. Simpson said, was that the Federal Government will not sell real estate to a private party except through sealed bids. ''We didn't want to risk submitting a bid without financing,'' he said, ''and we couldn't get financing without the site.'' The firm solved the problem by persuading the city, which had an option to buy the building, that it could expand the tax base and create jobs by buying the building with $3 million to be advanced by Bricker & Eckler, then leasing it back to the firm for 20 years to repay the $3 million. But to get the necessary industrial development bonds, the firm also had to obtain an Urban Development Action Grant, required by law for all such projects exceeding $10 million. Bricker & Eckler planned to spend a total of $13 million to expedite the purchase and do the renovation. The law firm initially qualified for a UDAG in the spring of 1984, but the approval was withdrawn the following fall in a Federal budget cut. ''We had to have that UDAG or we were sitting here with a $3 million white elephant that could not be financed,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''It was pretty gloomy around here for a while.'' In desperation, the law firm asked the city to expand the boundaries of a nearby redevelopment project, which did have a UDAG, to include the Federal building. The city agreed and the project was saved. Bricker & Eckler has promised to repay $550,000 as its proportionate share of the UDAG. The renovation was completed last year and the building was dedicated last November in ceremonies led by former President Gerald R. Ford.

669-> 160 Homes for 160 Babies: Now
Why can't homes be found for the ''boarder babies,'' the abandoned or abused infants who languish in city hospitals? New York City is dragging its feet on accepting Albany's help, charges Cesar Perales, the state Commissioner of Social Services. Albany promises much but is slow to deliver, responds Eric Brettschneider of the city department responsible for foster children. Meanwhile about 160 babies, many born to drug addicted mothers, are spending their first precious months living in city hospital cribs. Some of the babies have been there so long they can walk. To them, it doesn't matter who's right. What they need is a concerted effort by city and state officials to find foster parents as soon as possible. This crisis results from an unanticipated increase in the number of abandoned, neglected or abused children eligible for foster care in the last two years. From January 1985 to the present, the foster care population has grown from 16,230 to over 17,000. Many of these children have been forced into makeshift arrangements because city officials failed to respond with sufficient urgency to a severe shortage of foster care beds. The plight of the ''boarder babies'' is especially heart-wrenching. Lack of consistent care and nurturing jeopardizes their development. Yet state and city officials quarrel over which side is to blame and what to do next. Mr. Perales says his agency has identified a handful of licensed foster care beds in nearby counties. He also offers Mr. Brettschneider's agency, Special Services for Children, three full-time workers and extra funding. That would shorten from months to weeks the process of recruiting suitable foster parents. Mr. Brettschneider and other city officials welcome the additional staff and money from the state. But they note that their request for Albany's aid dates back to December 1985. Though they will now consider beds in any location, they prefer beds within reasonable visiting distance for the natural parents. Recent publicity now prompts faster approvals of foster parents and placements. But the number of boarder babies stays alarmingly high. Adequate screening is certainly warranted. The recent deaths of two babies in foster homes underlines that. But the process need not be lengthy. The test, for city and state, is when they can make the supply of foster homes meet the demand. With so many children in need, mutual finger-pointing is worse than petty. Do city and state officials mean they can't find 160 homes for 160 babies, and fast? And what of those to come?

670-> PERSPECTIVES: FIRE EGRESS; Escape Route as Design Element
IT did not take the New Year's Eve inferno at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan to focus Alfred Menziuso's attention on the subject of designing safe means of escape from burning high-rise buildings. Mr. Menziuso is a partner in the architectural firm of Wechsler Grasso Menziuso in Manhattan; he concentrates on residential buildings, and his current special interest is the fire staircase. He has introduced a new look in this specialized element of the Manhattan apartment building, and he hopes the Puerto Rico tragedy will bring it more attention. His new look also provided a zoning advantage to the two builders who have used it, allowing them to get more floor area and better apartment layouts than they could have had with conventional design. But that incentive apparently will not continue: Charles M. Smith Jr., the Buildings Commissioner, says future exterior stairways will be counted as floor area for zoning purposes. In a typical high-rise residential building, the fire stairway is part of the central core - windowless, artificially illuminated and fully enclosed within the building perimeter. But the Menziuso fire stairway is a concrete affair that is open to the elements above its three-foot-six-inch concrete guard rail. Like the interior variety, it actually is two staircases criss-crossing each other in scissors fashion. It is as external to the building as an old-fashioned fire escape, and although it is placed on the side or behind the building, it is just as visible from afar. ''It works best on smaller sites,'' the architect said. The stairway runs the full height of the building - 22 floors at the Bentley, a 54-unit condominium at 161 East 30th Street nearing occupancy, and 26 floors at Handman House, at 22 West 66th Street, a building that started out to be a 43-unit condominium and is 80 percent complete, but is stalled and may resume construction as a hotel. At the street level of each, the stairway ends at a door opening into the lobby. There are drains in the landings at each floor, and heating coils in the concrete to prevent freezing. Standpipe connections at each floor allow firemen to move upwards to the fire floors to make their hose connections. In many ways, the Menziuso fire stair is similar to the fire towers in New York City high-rises that were dropped after 1968. These also are outside the building perimeter, but they are enclosed. They are not entered directly from the hall, but from an external platform or balcony. And they are not a visible architectural element. To Mr. Menziuso, the external fire stair is a superior form of fire safety. The tenant leaves by way of a naturally lit fire terrace of about 40 square feet outside the hallway, and is easily assisted by firefighters moving up the stairs. There is a lessened danger of panic, in Mr. Menziuso's view, with tenants able to walk up or down without difficulty in the smokefree, naturally lit outdoor environment, fully shielded from the fire. ''The problem with the interior staircase is that it can get clogged with smoke,'' said William Webb, manager of the Dearborn, Ill., office of Rolf Jensen & Associates, consultants on fire safety. On the other hand, he added, the outdoor stairway is more susceptible to unfavorable weather conditions. What has made the exterior staircase particularly attractive to developers is that it has provided a modest bonanza in usable floor area and a better ''floorplate'' for apartment design. Both the Bentley and Handman House are on fairly small lots, and a large core in the center of the floors would have detracted from flexibility in apartment configurations. Under the zoning law, floor space in ''open or roofed terraces, exterior balconies, bridges, breezeways or porches'' does not count for purposes of calculating allowable floor area on the building lot. For the Bentley, the Buildings Department therefore allowed the developer an extra 250 square feet per floor, which was used to produce one additional full floor plus a penthouse floor. NO less important, perhaps, was the fact that there is less wasted corridor space in the layouts of the apartments themselves because they do not have to bend around a large interior shaft. Thus the buyers' usable space is improved, although the additional usable area per floor is only slightly changed. ''There are fewer internal corridors, and more space per room,'' Mr. Menziuso said. ''The total square footage is about the same, but there are better proportions.'' On the 13 tower floors (the 10th through the 22d floors) there are two apartments per floor, one a 670-square-foot one-bedroom and the other a 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom. The base floors have mostly one-bedrooms, some with sleeping alcoves, and there is a line of studios. The Bentley swings around the northwest corner of 30th Street and Third Avenue, with curved corner windows and broad views to the east and south. It uses development rights from midblock properties to reach a gross floor area of 56,500 square feet on a 60- by 60-foot plot. Stucco, paint or some other material may be used to beautify the exterior appearance of the stairway, which runs down the Bentley's north wall. Joseph Garay, the developer, said he made no decision on the surface treatment. TO Commissioner Smith, the exterior stairways have so far provided ''too great a windfall in developable floor area.'' The plans for Handman House and the Bentley were approved by the department before he became commissioner. ''If you put the stairs outside the building,'' he said, ''we would count it as floor area and you could not benefit by more rentable area.'' He added that from the standpoint of providing means of egress, exterior stairs offer advantages and should be considered further. ''But no one can say it will provide any better protection than an enclosed stairway that is sprinklered,'' he said. Mr. Menziuso says the open exterior stairway is desirable both for fire safety and apartment planning even without the zoning advantage, although many smaller sites would be unbuildable if the space were counted in the floor area. Irving Minkin, a lawyer with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who was deputy buildings commissioner for many years, described the open exterior stairway as ''a positive thing that provides a smokefree means of egress.'' And at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, Paul R. DeCicco, director of the Center for Fire Research, said, ''The more we can avoid highly articulated mechanical systems the better off we are.'' In the Dupont Plaza fire, many guests were rescued from the roof by helicopter after making their way upwards through smoke-filled stairways. Most of the deaths occurred in public spaces, including the casino, on the lower floors. Mr. Menziuso, the architect, said he had discussed his open-stairway plan with fire officials and received a positive response. ''The zoning law should bonus them, not merely allow them as-of-right,'' he said. ''If they can bonus trees and plazas, they should bonus this.''

671-> SMOKING BANS BEING EASED IN
IN NEW JERSEY, where the right of the nonsmoker to breathe clean air supersedes the right of the smoker to smoke, it is a punishable offense to light up at the wrong place and time. But while some people may cry ''Nineteen-Eighty-Four'' and ''Big Brother'' at the notion that a misplaced puff may result in a fine, albeit just $25, in reality there are no undercover officers lurking around the next corner ready to whip out a summons at the first sniff of smoke. In fact, since the state's package of nine laws governing smoking and nonsmoking areas began to take effect, the Department of Health has not yet imposed any fines. The laws were passed in 1985 and have been phased in. Those governing state, county and municipal government buildings, for example, went into effect on Sept. 1. The Health Department reports, however, that it has received close to 3,000 telephone inquiries about the laws and that 79 formal complaints have been filed. Together, the laws ban smoking in public areas of all state, county and municipal government buildings and require that all businesses that employ 50 people or more have a written policy designed to protect nonsmokers. Restaurants must post signs notifying customers whether they offer smoking and nonsmoking sections or if they have installed air cleaners. Smoking is prohibited in grocery stores 4,000 square feet or larger. The laws require owners of most public buildings, such as theaters, libraries, museums and auditoriums, to control smoking so that non-smokers can use them without being subjected to smoke. For now, the Health Department is relying on self-enforcement. According to Dr. Lawrence Meinert, director of adult health services for the department, ''the legislative intent was not to set up a heavy-handed legislative enforcement agency.'' Although fines eventually may be imposed, he said, he doubts there ever will be ''more than a handful.'' Next spring, however, the department will take a step beyond self-enforcement and begin evaluating compliance and considering modifications to the laws. ''We will be doing some random surveys by mail and telephone and going ourselves to look at private employer and restaurant compliance,'' said Dr. Molly Joel Coye, the state's Commissioner of Health. ''We will be comparing our laws with those of other states and looking at our impact on cigarette sales and on our population's smoking patterns. ''We won't just be looking to see if restaurants have a sign posted. We will look to see whether it's made an impact on how many have a smoking or nonsmoking section.'' Of the 79 written complaints the Health Department has received so far, 37 have been from employees at private work sites. ''When we get a complaint from an employee in a business, we respond with a certified letter informing the business of the complaint,'' Dr. Meinert said, adding that repeated complaints will result in a site visit from a local Health Department official. According to Dr. Meinert, the site visit generally has resolved the problem. He said that about 10 cases had reached the site-visit point to date. Some places are doing more than just meeting the letter of the law. For example, although the law mandates that only offices with 50 or more employees working in one enclosed location have a policy protecting nonsmokers, Thomas J. Lipton Inc., headquartered in Englewood Cliffs, has instituted its policy in all its New Jersey locations, including the two or three offices where it is not required to do so. ''If the premise of protecting the nonsmoker is a correct one, why just do it for locations over 50?'' asked John McSweeney, manager of employee relations for Lipton. ''So we do it everywhere.'' Many of the calls that the Health Department has handled have been from those who work in offices with fewer than 50 people. Dr. Meinert said the department was trying to encourage ''voluntary protection'' in such cases. Regina Carlson, executive director of the New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution (GASP), which lobbied for the laws, said she had heard complaints from people about their employers. ''Usually, it's just ignorance of the laws,'' she said. To help spread the word, GASP has put together a pamphlet describing the laws, indicating where copies are available and noting the address where violations can be reported. The group also has published a pamphlet on smoke-free dining places and a handbook for the business community, ''Toward A Smoke-Free Workplace,'' which points out the health advantages of going smokeless and lists businesses that have such a policy. Dr. Meinert, who has spoken at seminars across the state to explain the laws, said that he did ''run into negative feedback,'' but that ''it's a lot less than you would anticipate.'' The type of comments he hears includes ''This is another Big Brother issue,'' but, he said, ''there has been surprisingly little of that.'' Clark Martin, a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute, which initially opposed the laws, said that they had been ''modified to the point that they were fairly rational'' and that the institute was not pressing for their repeal. A positive side effect of the laws, Dr. Meinert said, is that they can have ''a dramatic impact in providing an extra support for smokers who want to quit.'' He cites his own department as an example. ''The Department of Health instituted a moderately restrictive smoking policy in June 1985,'' he said. ''Prior to that, we had one-third of the [ 1,500 ] employees who smoked. A year and a half later, 22 percent now smoke. ''If we see a number of 10 to 20 percent drop in the overall number of smokers, that's a phenomenal impact. That's probably one of the most significant interventions on a public-health basis to come down the line.''

672-> WASHINGTON TALK; Portrait of a Power Broker Without the Power
As legislators streamed into town for the start of the 100th Congress, James Robert Jones, for almost 25 years one of this town's political power brokers, contemplated sleeping late and catching up on his reading. He was out of it, no longer a member of the House of Representatives. No more Congressional receptions. ''A pain in the neck,'' he said. No more working weekends back in Oklahoma or in his Capitol Hill office. ''In private life you can really schedule your weekend,'' he noted with evident pleasure. And yet, this is not an entirely pleasurable time for a man who has been involved in politics most of his adult life and, in fact, first worked in a campaign when he was only 12 years old. ''I thrive on it,'' he once said of politics. Mr. Jones did not leave it voluntarily. He lost an election. So although he can now sigh in relief from legislative pressures, the former Congressman from Oklahoma, who was considered a master politician and strategist, finds himself forced to adjust to no longer being a ''player'' on the Congressional scene. He is trying to assess just what his new role will be in a political capital where, he says, those out of power quickly learn the difference between ''friends'' and ''the friends of convenience.'' Mr. Jones, a Democrat, was first elected to the House in 1972 at the age of 33 and served in the key post of House Budget Committee chairman for four years. Last November, he gave up his House seat in a bid for the Senate, but lost out to the incumbent, Don Nickles. And that brought him to the end of a long political journey, or at least to a serious detour. The journey began in his hometown of Muskogee, Okla., with volunteer work at the age of 12 on the campaign staff of his local Congressman, Ed Edmondson, and he later used that experience as a stepping stone to a full-scale career in politics. At 21, he moved to Washington to attend Georgetown University Law School by night and to work by day as legislative assistant to Mr. Edmondson. Four years later he caught the eye of President Johnson and joined the White House staff, then became White House chief of staff at the age of 29. 'It Is Truly a Public Trust' ''I always recognized that I was lucky to be able to work in public service,'' Mr. Jones said as he reminisced about his political years. ''It is a noble calling, but you don't have a right to it. It is truly a public trust that you give up from time to time.'' He first learned that lesson, he said, when he left the seductive world of Washington to return to Oklahoma to practice law in Tulsa and build a voting constituency. ''It was a great lesson in recognizing who you are and where you come from and never forgetting that,'' he said. ''In the White House everyone is trying to massage you and tell you how great you are. It was good to learn at an early age to never believe your own press clippings.'' He equates the practice of politics with ''teaching and preaching.'' ''I put them all in the same category,'' he explained. ''They are noblest of professions because they touch lives and set social and moral values in a way that no other profession can.'' It was from his mentor, President Johnson, that he learned the art of practical politics: compromise and persuasion. But it was from a Congressional colleague, he says, that he learned the importance of doing one's homework. ''When I came to the House, Tom Steed told me that knowledge is power and in the political world knowledge means power to influence public policy. If you have it, people gravitate to you.'' Although he has not ruled out another run for the Senate and although he plans to keep a second home in Oklahoma, he and his family will continue to live in Washington in their 1830 Capitol Hill town house. ''If you are interested in ideas and people,'' he explained, ''you can find it all here.'' He is currently mulling over job offers. As a former Budget Committee chairman and influential member of the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, he is being eagerly sought by several investment bankers and two dozen law firms. He has narrowed his list to seven law firms and says he is confident of just one thing: He has no plans to go into business with his wife, Olivia. ''When we moved back to Oklahoma to run for Congress, we opened up a law firm, Jones & Jones,'' he recalled, ''and we found out very quickly that we are wonderful marriage partners but lousy law partners.'' (Mrs. Jones, incidentally, not only has a law degree from Harvard and is a licensed plumber, electrician, carpenter and interior designer, but also writes on the side. Her novel, an international spy thriller, is currently making the publishing house rounds.) Mr. Jones says he turned down several lobbying jobs that would have paid close to the million-dollar mark. ''I will be doing legislative law work, counseling, briefs, presentations and things like that because it is an area in which I have experience and credibility,'' he said, ''but I will not be a lobbyist.'' To him, the practice of law is similar in many ways to the practice of politics. ''There is entrepreneurial spirit in the practice of the law today that deals with a whole range of problems and goes directly to public policy issues,'' he said. In talking about his years as a legislator, he bemoans, as have others, the high-pressured Congressional world that leaves little time for reading, study or reflection. But yes, he concedes, he loved every minute of it. ''I like a high-pressure situation,'' he said. ''I like to be doing things that matter, and I like solving problems. Every day I couldn't wait to get to work because you never knew what problems would be there to be solved or what kind of crises would be coming up.'' Since his defeat, he says, he has spent more time with his two boys, Geoffrey, 16, and Adam, 13, than he had in the previous 14 years. ''I think my defeat was good for another reason as well,'' Mr. Jones said. ''In their entire life all I was doing was winning and beating the odds. They had begun to feel that Pop was invincible and it could have made them afraid to take on some risks of their own. We've talked about it - that in order to really enjoy life you have to take risks. Defeat is temporary. You learn from that, you pick yourself up and take off again and get ready for the next challenge.'' Keeping a Hand in Politics Mr. Jones intends to keep a hand in politics, continuing to serve on the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and on the Democratic Leadership Council as well as doing some lecturing at Harvard. He has also accepted positions on the board of the American Stock Exchange and Facet Industries in Tulsa, and he hopes ''one day'' to get back into public service. But first, he says, he is working on a list of things he has always to wanted to do. He enumerates: ''Practice law, run a business, write a book and tap dance in a Broadway show.''

673-> ANALYSTS EXPECT BIG SWINGS INS TOCK MARKET TO CONTINUE
The wild gyrations in Friday's stock market, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring first by 64 points, then plunging by 114 points and ending the day with a 44.15-point decline, have stunned the financial markets. And although few analysts said yesterday that they understood what happened or what it would mean for the nation's economy or the markets, they are predicting the wild swings will continue. The analysts carefully distinguish, however, between the surge in the stock market that occurred in the first three weeks of January and Friday's pandemonium. The 250-point rise in the Dow Jones average in the first three weeks was a ''natural market,'' said John D. Connolly, an investment strategist for Dean Witter Reynolds. He said the strong upswing reflected the desires of buyers who wanted to hold their stocks, expecting them to rise in value because of underlying economic conditions. But Friday's volatility was attributed to the practice of rapid buying and selling on a number of markets to take advantage of differences in prices between those markets. These exchanges by people involved in such arbitraging are made possible by computer technology that enables big investors to play one market against another and rapidly move huge amounts of funds. Playing the Futures Markets A main reason for the swings involved attempts by large investors to play the futures markets, where stocks are bought or sold for delivery at some specified future date, against what the stocks were selling for on that day. Such calculations are extremely complex but can be made in fractions of a second by computers. And because these practices carry little risk, investors are willing to put up huge sums. Not everyone agrees, however, that such trading is as riskless as it seems. ''New investment vehicles always come in with the belief that they are risk free,'' said A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic adviser. ''They usually get pushed to the extremes and you get a real problem going. We haven't had a bloodbath yet, but I think we'll see a shakeout at some point.'' Mr. Shilling cited the possibility that if futures prices were to fall, investors would be asked by their brokers to put up more money and that if the investors could not raise those funds they might be forced to sell the stock. Such sales could create a downward price spiral that could affect both the futures and stock markets, he said. Whether such dangers exist, the new technologies have speeded the time in which decisions are made. ''It's important for people to realize that, because of technology, expectations are compressed in time,'' said Allen Sinai, the chief economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''When there is an event in the United States or Japan or Germany that affects interest rates, currencies are quickly affected, and when currencies or interest rates move, so do stock prices.'' Several Factors Converged Although the technology itself is not brand new, the use of computers and high-speed communication in market trading has been evolving. And on Friday, as the result of a convergence of several factors, the use of technology seems to have come into full bloom. Most important was the market gains of the previous three weeks, which stimulated confidence throughout the market. Next was the declining value of the dollar. That further spurred confidence that American companies, especially larger ones, would enjoy increased sales, both overseas and at home. A lower-valued dollar makes American goods cheaper in foreign markets and makes foreign goods more expensive in the United States. In addition, with a weaker dollar the overseas earnings of American corporations will have a higher dollar value, which also is expected to increase corporate profits. At the same time, because it costs less for foreigners to buy dollars, any American product, including stocks, can be bought for less. As a result, many foreigners are believed to have shifted money into the United States stock market. Lower Interest Rates Overseas Further, because Japan and West Germany were unhappy about the sharp decline of the dollar, fearing that American goods would become more competitive in world markets, their central banks have reduced interest rates, hoping that investors would exchange their low-yielding yen and mark securities for higher-yielding American securities. But those moves also stirred expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would follow the Japanese and West German moves and reduce interest rates further in the United States. Indeed, much of the four-year rise in the American stock market reflects lower interest rates here. Not only do lower rates directly reduce a corporation's cost, they generally spur economic growth, which in turn, stimulates corporate profits. Lower interest rates also indicate that the Federal Reserve had been generous in creating money, and as a result, American investors have been flush with cash. And as the rates have fallen, many have been looking for more profitable returns on their investments. Analysts say that has been a major reason for the boom in the stock market. Rising Futures Prices In the midst of such bullishness, prices of stocks in the futures markets began to soar early Friday. But when the premium - the amount by which the futures contract exceeds the actual index - reached a certain point, there was a wave of selling, creating a tremendous discount in the futures market, and that caused both markets to rise again. That, according to Mr. Connolly, is what drove the stock market first to a 64-point gain and then to the sharp loss. In contrast to the stock market's rise in the first three weeks of January, there seemed to have been no economic reason for Friday's gyrations. ''I see no way to relate these movements to any rational way of thinking,'' said Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of finance at Harvard University. Mr. Friedman said that he did not think anything could be done to stop the volatility and that he did not think it would cause problems as long as people do not borrow heavily to invest in the stock market. And David Levine, an economist for the investment banking firm of Sanford Bernsein & Company, said he saw no great danger in it. ''The little investor gets terrorized a bit,'' he said, ''but for every guy who has an unfortunate day, there's another who wins.''

674-> POSTINGS: Coming Attraction; Builders' Show
For nine days, starting next Saturday, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center will the scene of what is being confidently billed as the first annual Greater New York Home and Apartment Show. The show, sponsored by the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, the trade association of the real-estate industry, will run through Sunday, Feb. 1. More than 350 exhibits arrayed below the center's glass roof are expected to provide visitors, both professionals and laymen, with a chance to view new developments and products in building, renovation and remodeling. The Associated Builders annual trade show, known as ABO XPO, has been merged with the new exposition and will run for three days from Jan. 26 through Jan. 28. Among the special features of the show will be the presentation of a full-scale, furnished and landscaped model ranch home - designed by Poloron Homes and furnished by Eleanor Leonard Associates - in which new products and techniques will be shown in a realistic setting. The 3,200 square-foot model house will include three bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a family room with fireplace, a living room, a dining room, an eat-in kitchen and a two-car garage. There will also be a seminar program that will include a panel of industry experts, a ''how-to'' demonstration area and a kitchen-and-bath-design showcase.

675-> THEATER; AVANT-GARDE WORK TO BE STAGED
IF Michael Rush has his way, New Wave theater will not be new to New Haven for long. As founding director of the recently formed New Haven Artists' Theater, Mr. Rush is determined to present multi-media stage works that cannot be conventionally categorized. ''The Yale Repertory and Long Wharf do straight theater in top form,'' Mr. Rush said, referring to New Haven's leading regional theaters. ''What I'm trying to present is an experimental alternative on a professional level.'' The theater company's premiere production, ''The Dream Theater of Anna O.'' by Ann Wilson, is to be presented in ''preview segments.'' Part I was seen in November; Part II was done last month. On Friday and Saturday Part III is scheduled to take place at 8 P.M. in the Dome Room of the Educational Center for the Arts, 55 Audubon Street. A presentation of the whole work, in a larger space, is planned for March. Each segment of ''Anna O.'' - lasting one hour - is self-sustaining; the three parts are not sequentially arranged, Mr. Rush explained. ''Audiences at one do not have to have seen the other two,'' he said. To reinforce that point, Part III has been retitled, ''New Work From Anna O.'' ''Presenting the work in segments gives the company the chance to keep developing the piece - and it's not too heavy a dose for the audience to sit through all at once,'' he said. Anna O. is a pseudonym for Bertha Pappenheim, who was a patient of Sigmund Freud and the subject of his first intensive study of hysteria. In Ms. Wilson's theater piece she is also meant to symbolize chaos in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Part III involves Anna, her nurse, her physician and his wife. The character of Freud appears on videotape. Part III is an abstract amalgam of stylized movement and minimal dialogue. Music, culled from the work of such composers of the period as Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler, also includes contemporary compositions - one Japanese and one by the Connecticut composer Suzin Green. After her hysterical episode, Anna became a social worker and a leader of the women's suffrage movement in Germany, said Mr. Rush, who also plays the physician in ''Anna O.'' ''Anna is not reducible to a case study or a history lesson,'' he said. ''She is a woman transformed; an individual who came out of neurosis and functioned.'' With its psychological depth, historical significance and dramatic details, why, Mr. Rush was asked, is the tale of ''Anna O.'' not told in customary narrative terms? ''The emotional and visual content of the piece is stressed,'' he explained. ''Our theater supplies a human form - movement and life -to abstract elements, which become representational. Even if it is not understood, one way or another it is felt first; it has an impact.'' Mr. Rush cited a moment from Part I, when an icy mood between Anna's physician and his wife was established through stark lighting, casting a shadow upon the two figures. Then, the sounds of a requiem pierced the stillness, with all elements intended to contribute to a sensation of separateness. Throughout ''Anna O.'' stage pictures abound, in still life and in motion. Each scene begins with a tableau vivant, and at times the effect is of a painting sprung to life. Yet, the piece has a text and can be considered a play, Mr. Rush said. Ms. Wilson, the playwright, who is also the director of ''Anna O.,'' has been influenced by the works of the purveyor of avant-garde theater, Robert Wilson, to whom she is not related. A section of Mr. Wilson's recent work, ''The Civil Wars,'' which was conceived as a 12-hour opus, was presented last month as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. Ms. Wilson's previous projects, among them ''Cafe Pittoresque'' and ''Electric Affinities,'' have been referred to as ''art environments'' and ''dramatic collages.'' ''Anna O.,'' Mr. Rush said, ''creates an atmosphere for your own impressions and interpretations - and it invites you to bring your own fantasies.'' For ticket information call 248-6562. Ticket prices are $4; for students and the elderly, $2.50.

678-> SENATE VOTES $50 MILLION IN AID FOR THE HOMELESS
The Senate tonight approved $50 million in emergency aid to the homeless. The vote was 77 to 6. The House of Representatives has already approved the $50 million in additional aid, but the Senate added several amendments to the bill that require it to be returned to the House for further consideration. One of the amendments is a resolution disapproving the pay increases for judges, members of Congress and the executive branch that are scheduled become effective Wednesday. The Senate added this resolution to the bill in an effort to force a vote on the raises in the House. To block the raises, both the House and the Senate must approve resolutions against them, but the House leadership has indicated it would not schedule a vote on the raises. A second amendment added by the Senate would specify that $5 million of the $50 million go to homeless veterans who are mentally ill. Funds Would Be Transferred The $50 million would be transferred from the disaster relief program in the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the agency's food and shelter program. This program provides assistance to nonprofit organizations and local governments that provide food and shelter for the homeless. Although the Senate approved a transfer to avoid increasing Federal spending, Senator Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that the disaster relief fund would have to be replenished later this year. Because of this, he forced the Senate to vote on waiving the spending ceiling set by the budget balancing law. The Senate approved this waiver, 67 to 22. As in the House, senators raised questions about whether the additional aid for the homeless was necessary. 'Not an Emergency' ''This $50 million is not an emergency,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, adding that the emergency agency fund had $70 million in it now. ''But nobody can resist voting for it,'' he added. He later voted for the $50 million in aid. Mr. Domenici said the House voted for the aid ''to sort of prove that they are a little more for the homeless than anybody else.'' The Reagan Administration opposes the transfer of the money, saying it would deplete the disaster fund and require a supplemental budget to restore the $50 million. The Administration also says that only $3 million of the $70 million in the emergency agency's food and shelter program for this year has been spent. In the House, the aid for the homeless is one of three pieces of legislation the leadership wanted to have approved in the first month of the new Congress. In all cases - the homeless bill, the Clean Water Act, and the highway and mass transit bill - Congress is challenging the Administration on priorities and would be spending more on programs than the Administration proposes.

679-> RECALLING THE DAYS OF 'WE SHALL OVERCOME'
Chapters of American history most regretted by Americans have sometimes been those for which people in the rest of the world have most admired the United States. Watergate comes to mind. What many in the international community remember most about Watergate is not the criminality of a President but the effective working of the civil machinery that removed him from office - the way in which the will of the people truly prevailed. Similarly, the struggle for black civil rights in the United States is remembered abroad less for its tragedies than for its triumph in achievement - the realization of the national ideal through the dedication of black Americans. Watching the superbly crafted documentary series ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil-Rights Years 1954-65'' brings back many memories of that time, the period in which the United States made its biggest advance toward the concept of equal civil rights for all citizens. [ The initial hourlong installment in the six-part chronicle will be shown Thursday evening at 9 on WNET/Channel 13. ] The series is a vivid reminder of the raw courage required during that time, and the appalling sacrifices that were made to win the prize. It is a reminder, too, of the inspirational gifts of Martin Luther King Jr. and other black American leaders in achieving heights of eloquence in oratory that extended the language of Shakespeare as few statesmen -Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln among them - had previously achieved. During that time, we in the rest of the world, especially in South Africa, watched America stumbling, lurching, being pushed, pulled, nagged and dragged into living up to its own vision of itself. The prize was achieved primarily because black Americans insisted on entering into their American inheritance. But another reason, brought out indelibly in the series, was that enough white Americans were in sympathy with the cause. There lies the first major difference between the black struggle in the United States and its counterpart in South Africa. As a white South African, I was raised as conservatively on the racial issue as the average white Southerner of that time. The views of Orval Faubus, Ross Barnett and George Wallace reflected in the series echoed what I had heard from my parents and peers in South Africa since childhood. In time, my views changed, not through any sudden conversion on the road to Damascus but through a number of experiences culminating in my friendship with the remarkable South African black leader Stephen Biko. As a young journalist in 1960, I had gone to Little Rock, Ark., and other parts of the South to compare American segregation with our South African apartheid. I had found unsurprising similarities and surprising differences, and when I watched ''Eyes on the Prize'' recently, I was struck anew by these similarities and differences. The similarities were obvious. There were equivalent numbers of blacks in the United States and in South Africa - around 30 million at the last realistic estimate, though the official estimates in both countries were considerably lower - and the arguments against equal rights in the Deep South of the United States in 1960 were identical to those in the Deeper South of South Africa: Blacks were culturally ''different'' (decoded, read ''inferior''); white identity was under threat; people elsewhere didn't understand our unique problems; we had nothing personal against kaffirs (niggers), we just didn't want them to marry our sisters; segregation was ''traditional''; it was in the Bible; blacks didn't want integration any more than we did - trouble came only from the uppity ones with their fancy ideas. Et cetera and so forth. So much for the similarities. The differences are more significant. Rosa Parks could not have made her point in South Africa by refusing to yield her seat on a bus; apartheid prescribed separate vehicles entirely, and even different bus stops. Therein lies the answer to the question people often ask: If a black minority could win its rights nonviolently in America, why can't a black majority win its rights the same way in South Africa? The answer is that black South Africans are subject to a far more comprehensive system of racial oppression than black Americans were, and the instruments and manifestations of white racism in South Africa are far more sophisticated than they ever were in the United States. During my visit to Little Rock in 1960, I interviewed a black war veteran, Cartelyou Walls, whose house had been dynamited by white extremists the day before. Mr. Walls had won a medal during World War II. A black war hero? In the same war, black South Africans were in the army only to serve white soldiers. They weren't allowed to carry weapons, even in combat. And this was even before the apartheid administration of the Afrikaner National Party came into power in 1948, with its code of 317 racial statutes to illegalize interracial sex, marriage, sport, social activity, church worship, politics, unions, elevators, park benches, city suburbs and beaches. The lynchings and Ku Klux Klan terrorism in the American South were never mirrored in South Africa: The army and police did it all, professionally. Nonviolence worked in the United States because black Americans had the legal right to meet in political assembly, to plan and organize campaigns openly in pursuit of their goal. Black South Africans do not have that legal right. Black Americans also had access to unfettered media. The images on American television screens of ''Bull'' Connor's excesses in Birmingham, Ala., and of mob assaults and police assaults on peaceful marchers stimulated a wave of revulsion across the United States and helped to mobilize the American conscience. South Africans aren't allowed to see such scenes on their television screens. Black Americans could point to their Constitution and demand its implementation, but in South Africa the Constitution specifically excludes blacks from equal civil rights. Black Americans could organize voter registration drives and could vote for or against candidates for national office. Black South Africans have no such vote. When the modern era of black resistance began in South Africa in 1912 with the founding of the African National Congress, it had much of the character of the black struggle in America. Heavily influenced by Christianity, the A.N.C. meetings invariably began with hymns, and the movement was committed to the principle of nonviolence. For half a century, this commitment to nonviolence persisted, and black South Africans relied on peace marches, petitions, boycotts and delegations to the white government with a view to negotiation for gradual reform toward full civil rights. But successive South African governments responded with military or police violence; ultimately, even peaceful protest on a large scale was outlawed and the two most representative black organizations, the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress, were banned. In American terms this would have meant it was a serious crime to belong to such bodies as the NAACP or CORE or to be convicted of ''furthering their aims,'' and leaders such as Dr. King and Roy Wilkins would have been imprisoned for long terms, possibly for the rest of their lives, as Nelson Mandela has been imprisoned for more than 20 years. Nonviolence as a form of resistance to political oppression had been launched in South Africa by Mahatma Gandhi shortly after the turn of the century, but for black South Africans long committed to it the last straw was the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960, when police fired on black protesters and shot 156, many in the back as they ran from the fusillade, killing 69. Thereafter, the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. abandoned nonviolence and turned to sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Another difference between the two black struggles is that in the United States there was a black middle class, whereas in South Africa the grinding poverty among blacks is so endemic, so characterized by malnutrition and disease that even basic organization and communication is difficult on a nationwide basis. To give a mundane example, during the period covered by ''Eyes on the Prize,'' many black American homes had telephones. Even second-and third-echelon leaders could communicate easily from region to region and city to city. In South Africa, fewer than 1 percent of black homes have telephones. Educational standards, too, are so inferior for blacks under ''Bantu Education'' that there is a serious shortage of even primary school teachers - and that is also reflected in the difficulty of coordinated political action by South African blacks. In short, black Americans had a lot more going for them in their struggle than the black South Africans do; yet, on the other hand, the black South Africans have a lot more to gain. Their eyes are on a different prize. Black Americans had their eyes on the prize of full citizenship. As a minority, they never aspired to rule the United States - only to claim their fair share of rights as Americans. Black South Africans aspire as a majority to rule their country, and, faced with the full might of governmental and constitutional obduracy, many see their struggle not as a campaign for civil rights but as a progression to revolution. Although I have been out of South Africa for nine years, I have stayed in close touch with developments there, and tensions within the country under the state of emergency declared by the government are escalating alarmingly. In view of this, I had a feeling of envy while watching ''Eyes on the Prize'' - envy of the organized unity of black Americans during that time, and of the scale of white support that made their victory possible. Produced under black leadership, ''Eyes on the Prize'' was made by Blackside Inc., a Boston-based company whose president, Henry Hampton, served as executive producer of the series. Mr. Hampton said in a recent interview that the production staff had been ''fully desegregated'' - that whites had helped in the making of the series. If the South African liberation struggle were as ''desegregated,'' if more than a handful of South African whites would show the courage and commitment of the white Freedom Riders seen in ''Eyes on the Prize,'' the apartheid system might be shorter-lived. As a white, I felt one of the most stirring moments in ''Eyes on the Prize'' was when President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent Federal troops into Little Rock. It was good to see a white-led government doing something decent.

681-> DANCE VIEW; A TROUPE THAT REVELS IN MIME AS SATIRE
The Adaptors, whose ''movement theater'' piece ''Autobahn'' has just enjoyed a resounding critical success, are not billed as mimes. Nonetheless, the troupe's founders, Tony Brown and Kari Margolis, both studied in Paris with the master of classical mime, Etienne Decroux, and they performed with the Montreal mime group Omnibus. At first glance the Adaptors seem light years away from the whiteface purity of classical mime. How could Mr. Decroux have spawned both Marcel Marceau, the French Everyman Pierrot, and the sitcom-style Adaptors, whose acerbic satire on traditional Middle America values is indeed so American? Mr. Marceau's mime is illusionist: He makes us ''see'' invisible objects. The Adaptors are realists-in-caricature: The characters in ''Autobahn'' include Howdy Doody and Richard M. Nixon. Metaphorically - on another level - the whiteface Pierrot lives in a world of illusions. Hence, his despair when they are dashed. Groups like the Adaptors have no illusions at all. Hence, their ability to play with cynicism. Like all members of the current New Mime movement in North America, the Adaptors have absorbed a variety of influences. Ms. Margolis and Mr. Brown, in recent interviews, have specifically cited the West German choreographer Pina Bausch in this respect. Strange as it may seem, performers as different as Mr. Marceau and the New Mime groups do come out of the same tradition, argues Thomas Leabhart, editor of the Mime Journal. In an article published a few months ago in Ballett International, the West German dance magazine, he tells us why. Mr. Leabhart, an American mime who has been highly instrumental in promoting the New Mime movement, starts out by saying that illusionist and whiteface exercises were only a small part of Mr. Decroux's teaching and that they could also be found in the school of Jacques Lecoq, a teacher not usually associated with whiteface (the Mummenschanz troupe and Avner the Eccentric, the American clown, are among his former students). Mr. Leabhart's main point is that current mimes are linked to a still deeper influence, from which Mr. Lecoq and Mr. Decroux both stem - the vision of the late French theatrical director Jacques Copeau (Mr. Decroux trained with Mr. Copeau; Mr. Lecoq with Mr. Copeau's son-in-law, the director Jean Daste). Mr. Copeau's interest was in a noncommercial total theater. His actors were trained in movement skills and the use of masks - integrated with speech. The New Mimes now ''share a synthetic view of theater which embraces any theatrical device required to express an idea, communicate an emotion, evoke a response in the audience, regardless of theatrical ideology or philosophy,'' Mr. Leabhart writes. It is not surprising, then, that the New Mime groups now use speech - traditionally absent from mime - as well as mixed-media devices (television is a strong component in ''Autobahn''). Mr. Leabhart emphasizes that most American New Mimes studied with Mr. Decroux and Mr. Lecoq. Therefore, they are Mr. Copeau's ''grandchildren.'' They use the elements present in the Copeau theater school of the 1920's - masks, circus skills, text and song. Mr. Copeau's total-theater concepts have been passed down to them through his disciples, and these concepts re-emerge now in new ''re-integrated'' forms. In Mr. Leabhart's view, the line of descent from Mr. Copeau to the New Mimes fits into the highly eclectic esthetic of the current post-modern period. At its best, he argues, post-modernism offers ''a vision of completeness, an integration of disparate elements into a resonant whole.'' Categories are breaking down, but they are also being re-integrated. The distinctions between actor, dancer, mime and clown are no longer rigid, and Mr. Leabhart signals the emergence today of ''hyphenated arts,'' in which several separate art forms are combined. This analysis hits home. One has only to recall the debate two years ago over whether Miss Bausch's work was dance or theater. She herself solves the problem by calling it ''Dance Theater.'' The New Mime groups are often billed under the rubric of ''Movement Theater.'' Hyphenated or not, such terms provide a context for the kind of work done by the Adaptors (founded in 1982 and now based at the Brooklyn Arts and Culture Association). ''Autobahn'' is a series of skits that comment on American compulsions - on attitudes toward materialism and consumerism, on national tics and biases. The viewpoint behind this social and political satire is not necessarily original. It is not what the Adaptors do but how they do it that renders their commentary both fresh and mordant. The title of their piece is somewhat confusing. A program note explains: ''Like the West German speedway of the same name, 'Autobahn' takes a look at life from the fast lane, sweeping you through a potpourri of impressions from our recent past and our uncertain future.'' The imagery itself is more to the point. A prologue, ''American Safari,'' is in progress as the audience enters. The scene is reminiscent of the Central Park episode in Miss Bausch's ''1980,'' where performers simultaneously engaged in various activities while spread out on a lawn. Through their dress and expressions, the characters here are instantly identified with the surface wholesomeness of the pre-counterculture 1950's and early 60's - pedal pushers, madras shirts, garish sunglasses, wigs and polyester. A man who looks like Howdy Doody sits with a Howdy Doody doll (who reflects whom on television?) A couple, grinning but looking murderous, roasts hot dogs at a barbecue. A sunbathing woman grapples with her lounge chair. Three men in flight suits manipulate a huge hose - we find out later they are astronauts. A Carol Burnett lookalike turns a real video camera on the performers, the audience and herself. The images are projected on three television sets. The woman kisses the image of herself. The Adaptors' approach is instantly communicated. There is a constant rhythm of movement through flowing images that define character. Yet the figures are rendered grotesque and stereotyped. The fact that television can be innately grotesque in its results - in the distortion of a close-up - is a major point. Television is used here to satirize a television culture. Pop culture can be used as a critique of itself. The message is that we are what we hear and see. Even when speech is used by the Adaptors, it is usually heard on tape. The live actor is still a mime. In ''The Homecoming'' episode, the Nixon figure welcomes the astronauts back from the moon - mouthing the words spoken by his television image. As he exhorts all to reach for the stars, an explosion on the screen blows all offstage. Ed Alleto, mannequin-like and mouthing words on tape, then extolls the virtues of an atomic explosion heard on stereo. A belly dancer, Sonie Davilla, flits around him for no discernible reason. The sharpest episodes concern women's liberation. ''Cardboard Ladies'' has Erica Babad, Jeannie Kranich, Kari Margolis, Beth Margolis and Joan Merwyn dancing with ironing boards as partners, unliberated housewives wondering aloud if brains are any good, while their husbands - Mr. Brown, Frandu, Bob Modaff and Larry Picard - caress identical cardboard cutouts in puffed-sleeve dresses as their ideal mates. In ''The Hair-Dryer,'' a woman has an erotic duet with a hair-dryer as her fellow clients at a beauty salon squeal over movie magazines and pant, literally, for the kind of soap-bubble romance defined marvelously here - by real soap bubbles that float onstage. Mr. Brown is a nobody turned into dictator in ''The Microphone.'' Inarticulate at first, he finally raves unintelligibly as stocking-masked figures with inflated plastic airplanes swoop in. A baby's cry is heard at the end. A more potent image has Beth Margolis crooning, ''Let's bring back World War I,'' as small robots, with television screens as torsos, advance toward the audience. The fun will be different next time. Not everything works with the Adaptors - sometimes they seem as wound up as their dolls. They are at their best when the human dimension is obvious, albeit inflated. Thus, Frandu, a short man with an expressive face and a musician's sense of rhythm, emerges triumphant in ''Breakfast.'' Here is the commercial to end all commercials. We see an adult child in winged baseball cap attack a box of cornflakes. He is clumsy, but his radio is full of typical optimism. ''Just around the corner, there's a rainbow in the sky,'' a singer sings and a television monitor shows two figures on a highway to Oz or some other nirvana. Our hero creates his own happy ending - by dumping the entire box of flakes into his bowl and plunging in with his spoon. Rabelais would have loved it.

682-> HOWARD BEACH; RANCOR AND CONCERN
Good intention piled upon heightened concern last week as political, civic, religious, education and labor leaders denounced racism and condemned a white gang's attack on three black men in Howard Beach Dec. 20. But rancor persisted, too, as attorneys for two men who survived the attack continued to insist that the authorities were covering up facts about the death of the third victim, Michael Griffith, who was struck by a car as he fled the whites. Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward criticized Alton H. Maddox, Jr., one of the lawyers, for refusing to let his client, Cedric Sandiford, cooperate in the prosecution of three white youths charged with participating in the attack. Mr. Maddox demanded an apology, and a group of his supporters demonstrated outside Mr. Ward's home. Meanwhile, a coalition of black leaders called for a one-day protest action in memory of Mr. Griffiths, Governor Cuomo said he would establish a task force on bias-related violence and Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones unveiled a new human rights curriculum. A group of 20 presidents and other leaders of union locals condemned racism and the attack, with some of them also expressing support for Mr. Maddox's strategy and the protest, which is planned for Jan. 21. Amid the flurry of related activity, the case against the accused white youths appeared static. Mr. Sandiford, the victim who refused to cooperate, said the Queens District Attorney, John Santucci, was pursuing a ''masquerade investigation.'' Mr. Sandiford and Mr. Maddox say they have not cooperated because no charges have been filed against the driver of the car that struck and killed Mr. Griffith. The police have said the driver, Dominick Blum, was not an accomplice of the attackers and had hit Mr. Griffth accidentally. Mr. Santucci said he was considering asking Federal authorities to prosecute the Howard Beach youths on civil rights charges. Federal officials said they would do so only if the state cannot ''achieve substantial justice.'' State manslaughter charges against the three were dropped and charges of reckless endangerment instituted after Mr. Sandiford refused to testify. Meanwhile, one of the defendants, Jon L. Lester, was sentenced to one-to-three years in prison in an unrelated case.

683-> IN TODAY'S OPERA WORLD STARS CAN CALL THE TUNE
The first thing to understand about bidding for the services of opera's superstars is that it's a singer's market. There are far, far more blank slots on opera house calendars waiting to be filled by a Domingo or a Freni than there are nights in Placido Domingo's or Mirella Freni's datebooks waiting to be filled by an opera engagement. Dozens of theaters around the world need to present at least a few of the top singers each season, and a few of the most prestigious houses are expected to deliver the whole list on a reasonably frequent basis. The second thing to understand is that the bidding isn't principally done with dollars. When you are dealing with the very top stars, those whose names are known to the vast public and who put the sold-out signs on the posters, you are dealing with men and women who could easily make more money by singing a gala concert across the street from your opera house. Or more yet in a stadium down the road. The third is that this bidding process shapes - sometimes more than any other single factor - the repertory the public is offered as well as the casts who sing it. Competition in this area has become yearly more urgent for the major houses: Fewer and fewer top-level singers are being sought by more and more customers. The Metropolitan Opera, for one, has now begun to marshal its resources in a new effort to present more of these singers each season, and in more performances, than in the recent past. The top fee at the Metropolitan is $8,000 per performance (rising to $9,000 next year). Elsewhere it runs higher, and not everyone is telling how high, but informed sources say that no major international house has yet broken the $15,000 level. Most of the great ones pay something closer to the Met figure; there is, generally speaking, an inverse relationship between the theater's prestige and its fee ceiling. For solo concerts, the fees for artists like Marilyn Horne, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Dame Joan Sutherland, Miss Freni, Mr. Domingo, Montserrat Caballe and a handful of others are said to range from about $20,000 to more than twice that amount, and Luciano Pavarotti commands $100,000 plus a percentage of the house for his popular stadium concerts. To get these exotic creatures on the stage requires bidding in favors and services. The opera house's bargaining chips include radio broadcasts, telecasts, the plum of opening night, premieres of lavish new productions and the presentation of specialty operas beloved of particular singers. Also concessions on rehearsal time, releases for concert work, engagement of favorite col leagues or proteges, and indulgence about renegotiating signed contracts. Also, with certain admirable artists, the promise of extra rehearsal and other laudable attentions to artistic quality. And, as back-up resources, the cultivation of personal relationships and an atmosphere that makes artists feel well-attended. The plums are different for different singers. For some it may mean one more time around in their favorite old parts. When Leontyne Price decided to retire from opera, she went from house to house repeating the parts she had first sung there, whether it was a glamour role like Leonora in ''Trovatore'' or a part in an ensemble drama like ''Dialogues of the Carmelites,'' which she sang in San Francisco. For others it may be the revival of an obscure or neglected piece. The Paris Opera recently asked Samuel Ramey, a favorite in France, what he'd like in the way of a major French revival; the result was a rare look at Meyerbeer's ''Robert le Diable.'' Marilyn Horne has gone nearly every year to Venice because Venice has done the special revivals that suit her unusual voice - Rossini, Handel and the like. ''The smaller houses,'' observes the impresario Matthew Epstein, ''have found that they can get a higher level of singer by mounting something for that singer. Certain theaters establish a rapport with specific artists who are favorites there. The Monnaie in Brussels has done a lot for Jose van Dam - 'Simon Boccanegra,' 'Boris,' 'Falstaff,' 'Don Giovanni' - and in return their seasons have had the special interest of a lot of 'firsts' from him,'' roles he had not previously done elsewhere. Indeed, this is one of the principal means by which houses without a long history of star-bidding have put such a strain on the historically dominant theaters. With names like Caballe, Sutherland, Kraus and Horne regularly on the bills of Nice, Vancouver, Houston, Geneva and San Diego, there is inevitably less left over for Milan, New York, Paris, London and Vienna. ''The big houses,'' Mr. Epstein notes, ''are not as well-positioned to meet the requirements of the specialist singer,'' since they generally need productions that can work year after year with different singers. Some smaller companies have also broken the fee barrier, bidding in amounts competitive with the concert purse - though often only for quick guest appearances in familiar operas, requiring scarcely more time and effort than a concert from the visiting star. ''It's much harder now to have your best artists every year,'' says Ardis Krainik, general director of the Chicago Lyric Opera, who has been with the company since its infancy in the 1950's, and where the top fee is only slightly higher than the Met's. ''When I started out,'' she said, ''London had international singers for one month each year, not for the season. Munich did not hire internationally; a guest company would come for a short period - otherwise you had singers who lived in Munich and did their work there. There are dozens more companies competing at this level now.'' She points to several factors in Chicago's relative success at attracting the stars: ''I've heard from many singers' friends that the artists love to come back, and the only way to keep that happening is for things to be more or less tranquil. Tender loving care is my specialty. I think it's important for the artists to know that I am there personally in the house at every performance - and when I can't be, I at least stop by to speak to them in their dressing rooms before I go off to do what I have to. If they're not feeling well, I call to check on them at the hotel. There is no way they will feel that something else is more important to the management here than their well-being.'' She has also taken the opportunity to present major stars in their special vehicles - for instance, in recent years, Jon Vickers in Handel's ''Samson,'' Marilyn Horne in his ''Orlando'' and Joan Sutherland in Donizetti's ''Anna Bolena.'' Both Chicago and San Francisco have a list of special projects for Miss Horne stretching ahead for the next several years. All this is a matter of keen local concern, because the Metropolitan Opera has come under considerable criticism for letting certain opportunities slip through its fingers in recent years. Never mind that its season-by-season track record still compared pretty favorably to that of, say, the Vienna State Opera; the point is that Met audiences were accustomed to having some performances from Joan Sutherland every year, and for six out of the past 10 there were none. ''Bolena'' was heard here only in concert form, at Avery Fisher Hall. Luciano Pavarotti, Marilyn Horne and Jon Vickers are some others whose Met visits, once annual, have lapsed for two or more seasons during that time, and several other singers have given New York less of their time than formerly. Not, in most instances, because the Met had failed to ask - but sometimes because it did not ask persuasively, insistently, invitingly, imaginatively or accommodatingly enough. The new general manager, Bruce Crawford, has made it one of his top priorities to persuade, insist, invite, imagine and, where possible, accommodate. The results are about to start showing. Take the case of Mr. Pavarotti. Obviously, the Met wants to present him every season, but he requires a certain extra effort about choice of roles, choice of colleagues, flexibility of scheduling. And he is one of the singers who like to appear in new productions often. In 1984-85, things didn't work out and he was absent from the house except for a concert. In the current season he had agreed to sing ''La Boheme'' and ''Ernani,'' both revivals, but delayed signing the contract and eventually pulled out. A revival of the ''Idomeneo'' the Met produced with him had been agreed upon for a future season, but when he learned that James Levine would not be available to conduct it, he announced himself unwilling to sing it with anyone else. This spotty record was not good for nerves or subscriber contentment. So early on in his tenure Mr. Crawford sat down for talks with the tenor, his manager, Herbert Breslin, and the Met's casting director, Jonathan Friend. One of the fruits is the gala concert Mr. Pavarotti is to sing this evening, a consolation to Pavarotti fans who mourn his absence from the regular roster. More substantively, a five-year plan was agreed to, guaranteeing the tenor's prominent participation up to 1991. Next season he will sing in five performances of ''La Boheme'' and inaugurate a new production of ''Il Trovatore'' with Joan Sutherland. In June 1988 he will sing ''L'Elisir D'Amore'' with Kathleen Battle in Central Park; then open the '88-'89 season in ''Trovatore'' and reprise ''L'Elisir'' in the house. In each of the following seasons, he will do a new production featuring one of his best roles, and sing one revival. The ''Boheme'' series, moreover, represents a major coup of the kind that the Met hopes to pull off more frequently. One of the most oft-deplored absences from the Met has been that of Mirella Freni; she will be the Mimi. One of the most sought-after and elusive conductors in the world is Carlos Kleiber; he will lead the performances. Don't expect to amble up to the box office for this one the day after tickets go on sale. Moreover, Miss Freni will return not only for ''Boheme,'' but for ''Eugene Onegin'' in the following season, and one of her most successful roles will be reprised in 1989-90 (the Met does not yet want to disclose details past 1989). If all goes as planned, this will be the first time she will sing three consecutive Met seasons since the mid-1960's. That kind of continuity is what every first-line opera house would like, though none achieves it with every artist. Nevertheless, the Met has considerable resources - first and foremost its own prestige - and it has begun to bring them into play in a more organized fashion than hitherto. ''There are things we can do for their careers,'' says Mr. Crawford, ''and there are things we are going to expect them to do for the house.'' To illustrate, he offered some previously unannounced details of the coming Met seasons - always subject to change, as opera always is, but promising a stabler presence of some of the big names. Some examples: * Miss Horne seemed destined to make her Met farewell this season in ''Samson et Dalilah.'' For the future, she had been offered Rosina in ''Barber of Seville'' - a standard role she has done often before, which wasn't enticing enough in itself - and Amneris in ''Aida,'' a standard role she no longer wants to sing. Now an agreement has been reached to do one of her major specialty operas -probably Rossini's ''Semiramide'' -in 1990-91. ''And they've promised to do it big,'' she says, ''not the budget nonsense we've had before.'' In the meantime, she will sing those Rosinas. * Placido Domingo will open the house next season in ''Otello,'' revive Hoffmann and perhaps one other role, inaugurate a new production of ''Aida'' in '88-'89 and sing some ''Bohemes,'' and return for at least two operas in each of the following seasons. He will also open the parks series in 1987 in ''Tosca.'' * Kiri Te Kanawa will share opening night with Mr. Domingo next season and revive ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' both with Mr. Levine conducting, and will do one role in each of the following three seasons. * Eva Marton will sing Tosca and Lady Macbeth next season, open the house and star in a new ''Salome'' in '88-'89, join in a pair of major revivals the following year, with another new production to come in the early 90's. * Kathleen Battle, back next season in ''Ariadne'' and ''Elisir,'' will do Cleopatra in ''Julius Caesar'' in '88-'89, as well as reviving ''Barbiere'' two seasons in a row, with a new production to follow in '90-91 * Mr. Ramey and James Morris, two top-level bass-baritones, each has two new productions in the next five-year period - and each will sing at the house every year during that time. * Jessye Norman will sing Ariadne next season, two more revivals in the future, and the single most interesting new project on the Met's boards at present - a triple bill in which Miss Norman will sing in two of the operas - Schoenberg's ''Erwartung'' and Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' directed by Peter Sellars and conducted by Mr. Levine. (The third part of the bill is to be Debussy's ''Le Martyre de Saint-Sebastien.'') Miss Norman's preference for unusual challenges over standard warhorses - she came to the Met in ''Les Troyens,'' returned for Jocasta in ''Oedipus Rex'' and this season will sing in ''Dialogues of the Carmelites'' - is one example of the diversity of interests among the big-name singers. Nor does everyone demand the special exposure of television. The elusive Mr. Kleiber, for instance, has repeatedly been wooed with the usual inducements - new production, TV and the like, ''but in effect,'' according to Mr. Crawford, ''he said, 'let's see if we can manage a few performances of a standard opera satisfactorily in revival, and then we can talk about those other things.' '' Other special requests - such as the desire of a number of artists to have friends, spouses or proteges engaged by the houses where they sing, or Placido Domingo's fondness for conducting engagements - present tricky questions of artistic policy; how far a house should go in these directions to please a star is a matter of keen debate within the profession. The sponsors of the Met's forthcoming Far Eastern tour, for instance, reportedly insisted that either Mr. Domingo or Mr. Pavarotti be on board. It's going to be the former - and though no one says he made it an absolute condition, numerous eyebrows have been raised by the conducting roster of the tour, which consists of two names: James Levine and Placido Domingo. Playing the telecast card also has its hazards: An opera house can lure a star with TV, but generally speaking it takes a star's presence to lure TV into the house. This was dramatically demonstrated in San Francisco last year, when Placido Domingo abruptly canceled opera engagements there and elsewhere while he finished filming ''Otello'' with Franco Zeffirelli. Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera'' had been scheduled. When the star tenor defected, the telecast was canceled. When the telecast was cancelled, the other star - Margaret Price - defected. And specialty operas become white elephants on any night the star isn't around: London's Royal Opera House, for example, elected to substitute ''Madama Butterfly'' for ''Esclarmonde,'' at the expense of paying refunds, rather than engage in the pointless exercise of putting on the Massenet opera without Miss Sutherland when she was ill one night. So there are reasons for opera houses to be wary of dependence on star vehicles. But a certain part of what should constitute a great opera season can't be achieved without them. All this is not to say that the money never enters the picture; even the singers who are already clustered at the fee ceiling can ask for little extras at some theaters - a hotel bill here, a limo there, advances on fees, travel for spouses or retainers. But the dollar cost here is so small that these are really status symbols, perks, gestures. But when the contracts today are compared with those of almost any time in the past, what is immediately apparent is that star fees - whether measured in purchasing power, as a percentage of opera-house outlays, or in comparison to earnings elsewhere in show business - have dropped drastically, even though they have risen in absolute dollar amounts. According to the operatic historian William Seward, who is at work on a biography of Adelina Patti, that 19th-century diva was regularly earning between $4,500 and $5,000 per American performance in the 1880's and 90's. She was the biggest draw of all, the Pavarotti of her day in box-office terms; ''no one ever lost money on Patti,'' Mr. Seward says, and Mr. Breslin says exactly the same of Mr. Pavarotti. One measure of the relative value of Patti's take comes from the memoirs of one of her impresarios. ''Patti,'' wrote Maurice Grau, ''was at all times in her career able to command a $10,000 house in New York.'' Ticket prices rarely topped $5 for the best seats at the priciest events. Around the turn of the century, when the Met was paying and Nellie Melba $1,850 per night, the weekly salary of its music librarian was $48.20. If Luciano Pavarotti could take home half the ticket value of a full Met, he would be a far richer man than he is. And if Mirella Freni were offered a nightly fee over 38 times the weekly pay of the current librarian, the Met would have no trouble at all getting her for weeks at a stretch. Even compared to opera fees of the 1950's, today's are only little more than double; inflation has done far more than that. In this context, Mr. Pavarotti's enormous concert fee is not so much a grab for unheard-of fortunes as a very partial restoration of the financial rewards operatic singing used to bring to its highest achievers. But what he makes in concert - or even what the more economically priced superstars make - cannot be matched by the opera houses as it was in Patti's day. Operatic priorities have long shifted away from solo singing toward production values and ensemble strength, and the shift has been accelerated by the responsibilities to strong musicians' and other unions. Those priorities are expressed in dollars. So for the foreseeable future, when a singer sells to the highest bidder, it won't necessarily mean selling out. To the extent that bidding consists in putting the best singers in the best surroundings, singing music they sing well and want to sing, offering operas that engage their imagination, then everyone who likes good opera and good singing stands to be a winner.

684-> CONNECTICUT GUIDE
MORGAN BEQUEST ON VIEW Five years ago, the Wadsworth Atheneum began assessing its bequest of European decorative arts, made decades ago by J. Pierpont Morgan Jr., son of the railroad and steel leader, who collected them. In 1917, four years after his father's death, young Morgan gave 1,325 objects to the Atheneum. His ties to the museum stemmed not only from his father, who was born in Hartford and was a lifelong contributor to the museum, but also to his grandfather, Junius Spencer Morgan, an investment banker and a founder of the Atheneum. The rest of the collection was given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or remained in the Morgan Library and in the family. The result of all the research is the opening today of the first exhibition of the Atheneum bequest. It will remain on view until March 15 and travel to the Morgan Library in Manhattan for an April 17 opening, commemorating J. Pierpont Morgan Sr.'s 150th birthday. From there, it will go to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. Approximately 100 pieces will be on display, including ancient bronzes, glass, majolica, silver, ivory and Meissen and Sevres porcelain. About 80 objects will travel to New York and Texas. Among the more unusual pieces are a bronze warrior sculptured in the sixth century B.C., an ancient Egyptian bronze cat, German silver goblets from the 17th century, a Meissen porcelain of the Judgement of Paris from 1762, and a Sevres vase that is believed to have belonged to Madame de Pompadour. A series of free Sunday lectures accompanies the exhibition, beginning with ''The Hidden Career of J. Pierpont Morgan'' at 3 P.M. today, presented by Linda Roth, curator of European decorative arts. Morgan's relationship with the city and the Atheneum, and his legacy in terms of today's corporations and their acquisition of art, is to be discussed by other museum officials Feb. 1 and 15. Sir Geoffrey de Bellaigue, Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art in Britain and a contributor to the exhibition catalogue, is to give a talk comparing Sevres porcelain in the royal collection of England with pieces at the Atheneum at 11 A.M. Thursday. Tickets are $3. The museum hours are 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. from Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for students and the elderly and free to children under 13 years old. Admission is free all day Thursdays and 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. Saturdays. Call 278-2670. BENEFIT FOR CHORALE The harpsichordist Igor Kipnis is to be the featured performer today with the Christ Chorale Chamber Orchestra in a concert to benefit the year-old Christ Chorale of Danbury. The performance gins at 3 P.M. in the Ives Auditorium, White Hall, Western Connecticut State University, White Street. Tickets are $10. The chorale is made up of 30 people from the Danbury area who rehearse once a week from September to June at St. Paul's Lutheran Church. There is no charge to join or to attend concerts, which are given three times a season in churches. However, donations are welcomed. The chorale is supported entirely by contributions. Two more concerts are to be held, April 5 and May 31, at Immanuel Lutheran Church at 32 West Street. The program today consists of two harpsichord concertos by Boccherini and Bach, a sonata by Buxtehude and a concerto for two cellos by Vivaldi. The Rev. Donald S. Larsen is the director. Call 743-6675. ART AS THERAPY Cecily Reynolds, an art therapist at St. Raphael's Hospital in New Haven, is to give a free talk, ''In the Mind's Eye - Pathology Revealed in Portraiture,'' on Thursday at 5 P.M. in the Hope Building at the Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street. She is to show self portraits drawn by some of her patients and talk about what is to be learned from them. ''Most psychotics know more about what is wrong with them than they are able to express in words,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ''What we learn through their drawings is an aid to their doctors in making a diagnosis.'' All her patients participate in the program, going through five drawing exercises in an hour. ''We downplay talent,'' Ms. Reynolds said, ''emphasizing that this is not a drawing class, but a means of relieving tension and permitting free expression. By the end of the hour, patients have loosened up enough to reveal a great deal about their psychoses.'' One of her patients did three quick portraits in succession, achieving ''something of a likeness in the first one,'' she said, ''a very bizarre second attempt, and the third turned out to be a map of Afghanistan.'' The patient was obsessed with the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan at the time, she added. ''Art therapy has nothing to do with whether Van Gogh, or any other artist, is crazy or not,'' Ms. Reynolds added. ''In fact, we know that when someone is in a psychotic state, he or she is too disorganized to get the canvas up on the easel, never mind paint. Even Van Gogh, whom we know did have some mental problems, painted only during lucid periods, and his work reflects that in careful craftsmanship and organization.'' When an artist becomes a patient, ''therapy doesn't work as well. ''Artists are so used to focusing on art as a product,'' she said. VOLUNTEER TRAINING Since 1971, volunteers of the Greenwich Hot Line have been providing a helpful service to the disabled and elderly homebound, others in crises and children alone at home in lower Fairfield and Westchester Counties. More than 17,000 calls a year are handled by staff members who have learned how to hold nonjudgmental, confidential and reassuring conversations with callers. A new five-session training course will begin Tuesday from 9:30 A.M. to noon and from 7:30 to 10 P.M. at the Greenwich Health Association, 189 Mason Street. Volunteers who complete the course are expected to fill a three-hour shift once a week for a minimum of six months. Continuing training is offered in the form of workshops and lectures. Hot-line phones are manned from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. weekdays and 3 to 10 weekends. Call 661-4378.

685-> COLOMBIA'S PRESS UNITED TO FIGHT DRUGS
Colombia's newspapers and radio and television stations, reacting in concert to a surge of drug-related violence, are warning that this country is in danger of falling under the ''total domination'' of narcotics traffickers. In a statement published on front pages and broadcast as the top news item Thursday, they expressed their ''astonishment'' that the Government had so far done little to defend the country in the ''open war'' declared by cocaine traffickers. The protest was circulated one month after the editor of a major Bogota daily was killed by drug gangs and two days after a former Justice Minister, Enrique Parejo Gonzalez, the Ambassador to Hungary, was shot and wounded in Budapest, apparently in reprisal for past anti-narcotics efforts. The statement was considered significant because the press appears to be one of the few sectors of Colombian society that have not only dared to denounce the expanding power of cocaine traffickers, but have also escaped being seriously infiltrated or corrupted by drug money. 'Point of No Return' ''The speed of events is such that we have now reached the point of no return, where the country has to do everything to save itself,'' said Hernando Santos, editor of El Tiempo, the country's largest daily. The Government had no immediate reaction to the statement, although the Defense Minister, Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina, told reporters after a meeting of the country's Security Council on Thursday that new enforcement measures would be announced soon. But he acknowledged that ''it is not easy'' to capture major traffickers. According to foreign diplomats and well-placed officials, the influence of Colombian traffickers, who supply more than 80 percent of the world's cocaine, is already being felt through corruption or intimidation in the police, the armed forces, the judicial system and Congress. In regions of Colombia where cocaine operators are powerful, notably the northeastern city of Medellin, they have also frequently won over public opinion by dedicating some of their profits to community welfare, including housing programs for the poor. In contrast, most newspapers here, led by Bogota's two main dailies, El Tiempo and El Espectador, have spoken out against the narcotics traffic and have endorsed a controversial 1979 extradition treaty with the United States under which 13 people have been deported to face trial on drug charges. #30 Journalists Killed Apparently in retaliation, about 30 journalists have been killed over the last three years in a string of incidents that culminated in the assassination Dec. 17 of the highly respected editor of El Espectador, Guillermo Cano Isaza. He was an outspoken critic of the impunity enjoyed by major cocaine operators. The journalistic profession's first response was a march of silence on Dec. 19 that coincided with a 24-hour suspension of the activities of all newspapers, radio stations and television stations. Many top editors, facing new death threats, have also begun to use bulletproof cars and armed bodyguards. At the same time, President Virgilio Barco Vargas began an offensive against drug trafficking after Mr. Cano was killed. He mobilized the army and the police to undertake raids, seize cars and helicopters owned by prominent traffickers and make arrests, which in the last month have totaled several hundred. Public Expects Inaction Nevertheless, the impression has grown that none of the drug traffickers in what is called the Medellin Cartel -specifically, such well-known traffickers as Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Carlos Lehder Rivas and Jorge, Juan David and Fabio Ochoa - will be arrested. That impression prompted the country's newspapers and radio and television stations to issue their protest. In their joint declaration Thursday, the newspapers and broadcasting organizations pledged to form ''a united front'' to demand that the Government, political parties and society take ''effective measures'' to defeat the multi-billion-dollar cocaine business.

686-> FILM VIEW; 'PLATOON' FINDS NEW LIFE IN THE OLD WAR MOVIE
''I kept thinking about all the kids who got wiped out by 17 years of war movies before coming to Vietnam to get wiped out for good,'' Michael Herr remembers in ''Dispatches,'' his book of Vietnam memoirs published in 1977. ''Most combat troops,'' he goes on, ''stopped thinking of the war as an adventure after their first few firefights, but there were always the ones who couldn't let that go. . . A lot of correspondents weren't much better. We'd all seen too many movies, stayed too long in Television City, years of media glut had made certain connections difficult. ''. . . even after you knew better you couldn't avoid the ways in which things got mixed, the war itself with those parts of the war that were just like the movies, just like 'The Quiet American' or 'Catch-22'. . . just like all that combat footage from television. . .'' In ''Living Room War,'' his 1969 collection of essays, Michael J. Arlen takes exception to those who were saying at that time that television was making ''the hazards of [ the Vietnam ] war. . . 'real' to the civilian audience.'' Those hazards, he suggests, are ''also made less 'real' -diminished, in part, by the physical size of the television screen, which, for all the industry's advances, still shows one a picture of men three inches tall shooting at other men three inches tall. . .'' Whether the images are 30 feet tall or three inches, movies and television work on us in similar ways. The images are drugs whose side effects aren't immediately recognized. They do inform us, but with whatever ''truth'' they hold to be self-evident, which may be Rambo's or Walter Cronkite's. Movies and television can make the wildest fiction look like fact, and lethal facts look as harmless as fiction. Even at their most reasonable, movies and television must distort their subjects to the extent that they find esthetic order in chaos, conferring on events a romantic vision or, at least, a comprehensible overview. They put at a safe distance those unmentionable, unrecognized things that otherwise are allowed to enter our minds only as nightmares. Now, nearly 12 years after the fall of Saigon and nearly 20 years after the particular time it recalls, comes Oliver Stone's ''Platoon,'' the best fiction film yet made about the fighting in Vietnam. Here's an exceptionally good, serious, foot-soldier's view of the war that, in spite of its sense of desolation, could well inspire the fantasies of some future generation of American soldiers. It's something of a circle. As the film maker's imagination shapes his movies, those movies shape our imaginations. Thus, as Mr. Herr writes, the war itself gets mixed with those parts of the war that are just like the movies. Though ''Platoon'' is a far cry from John Wayne's gung-ho ''Green Berets,'' it's still a work of fiction. It comes out of a long tradition of ''war'' movies - everything from ''Battleground'' to (don't laugh) ''The Green Berets.'' It also uses a number of war-movie conventions, but so effectively that it's as if they'd been reinvented. ''Platoon'' finds in the experiences of the members of a single platoon of soldiers some equivalent to just about every horror story we've ever read about Vietnam, including the My Lai massacre. This is the license that can be granted to a film that - until its final few minutes - so rigorously keeps its eye at ground level. It shares with its soldiers the pervasive physical discomforts of heat, damp, insects and exhaustion that, somehow, are made bearable by (because they seem less important than) their fear. Never before, I think, have I seen in a war movie such a harrowing evocation of fear, which functions like adrenaline but feels like a headache, the kind that rises and falls but never quite disappears. As much as anything that actually happens in combat, it's day-to-day fear - the will to survive, attached to the awareness that there's no earthly reason one has to -that alters the psyche. Mr. Stone's achievement is not in the creation of a new kind of war movie but in the degree to which he rediscovers new life in the old, which he virtually redefines by cleaning away the debris that has accumulated over the years. ''Platoon'' is a lean film, beginning with its dusty, hazily golden opening shots on a Vietnam airstrip, where new arrivals from the States are being deposited from a giant transport plane that looks like a World War II LST, though one that magically flies. Very little is specifically stated. Mr. Stone doesn't have to announce his meaning (though he eventually does, in the film's only major lapse of judgment). The film's talk is mostly to the point of what's happening, or might happen, or can't happen, which is what most vividly describes the soldiers' boredom. Its three principal characters are Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), the young college dropout, who's the film's hesitant mouthpiece, and the two sergeants who have effectively split the platoon between them. They are Barnes (Tom Berenger), a seriously out-of-control, life-sized, clay-footed version of the ''fighting machine'' Sylvester Stallone glorifies in ''Rambo,'' and Elias (Willem Dafoe), a man no less tough than Barnes, but whose tours of duty have transformed him into a soft-spoken, almost embarrassed prophet of doom. The other members of the platoon don't wear labels that immediately characterize them. They take some time to get to know and, even then, they tend to merge, not as stereotypes but as the same sorts of men. ''Two years of high school, mostly poor and unwanted. . . They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it,'' is the way Chris Taylor describes them. The differences that finally do distinguish them are all the more prized and moving for being so finely graded. Mr. Stone appreciates the singularity of the grunts without italicizing them. It's part of the film's revivifying mystery that when the members of this particular platoon find themselves on the verge of wiping out an entire village, the identities of the men who cave in to the hysteria (and of those who hang back) haven't been predictable. ''Platoon'' is about war as seen by men for whom the only goal is daily survival. There are no great issues here, no debates about good and evil. It's about fighting for anonymous pieces of jungle, to hold positions that may well include the enemy, in a landscape of code names and numbers, where there are no points on the compass. It's to the film's credit that it manages to bring moral order to this confusion without celebrating it. Whether or not this is what the public wants to see, I've no idea. At Loew's Astor Plaza the other weekday afternoon, there was a small but noisy claque that kept trying to respond to the film's reluctant heroes, and to its grim battle footage, as if ''Platoon'' were really another ''Rambo.'' It wasn't easy. The My Lai-like sequence began promisingly, but the resolution clearly left some of the claque unsatisfied. Does ''Platoon'' romanticize its grunts? I suppose it does, at least to the extent that all movies somehow lend larger-than-life importance to whomever they acknowledge. There are also occasional moments when Mr. Stone allows a self-conscious image to repeat an idea that requires no amplification - as in the Christ-like image of a betrayed American soldier being crucified, not on a cross but by bullets. Not having been in Vietnam, I've no idea how accurate ''Platoon'' is in some of its details. Is the ratio of black ''grunts'' to white grunts correct, and does Mr. Stone soften the bitterness of racial antagonisms? Someone else can answer those questions. Anyone who fought in Vietnam will bring to the film a set of expections far different from those of someone for whom Vietnam was, first, the living room war, then the war of written recollections and, most recently, the war as refought in the case of Westmoreland v. CBS. It must say something about the American public's feelings toward the entire Vietnam experience that it's taken this long for the producers of a commercial film to attempt to make such a movie. As fine as they were, both ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''The Deer Hunter'' more or less floated above the concerns of the American foot soldiers and saw the war in terms of mythology. ''Rambo'' and Chuck Norris's two ''Missing in Action'' films jumped the gun, giving us revisionist views of a war whose sad end had scarcely been admitted by movies - with the exception of ''The Deer Hunter'' - in the first place. Clint Eastwood's new film, the hugely popular war-comedy, ''Heartbreak Ridge,'' acknowledges the Vietnam defeat, but then goes on to buck us up with a reenactment of our military triumph in Grenada. If I interpret ''Heartbreak Ridge'' correctly - and I'm not sure it makes complete sense - it seems to suggest that the only wars we can win from now on must be of the scale of the invasion of Grenada. I've no way of knowing, but I suspect that in any future, nuclear-free engagements, the men who fight it will, in their fantasies, be seeing themselves not as any member of ''Platoon's'' Bravo company but as good old Clint. Mr. Eastwood still exemplifies the glamour that, in most of our war movies to date, disguises the true consequences of mortality. There's very little glamour in ''Platoon.''

687-> BLACK MUSLIM CHARGES IN SLAYING OF ISLAMIC SCHOLAR AND HIS WIFE
A man identified as a Black Muslim was arraigned here today in the fatal stabbing of an internationally known Islamic scholar and his wife, but the authorities said they did not know what motivated the slayings. The defendant, Joseph Louis Young, was charged with killing Isma'il al-Faruqi, a 65-year-old proponent of Palestinian rights, and his American-born wife, Lois, 59, on May 27 in the couple's home in the Wyncote section of Cheltenham Township, said Lieut. Robert Krauser of the Police Department. He said a 15-inch knife was the weapon used. The defendant was also charged with stabbing the couple's pregnant daughter. She and her baby survived. Mr. Faruqi, a religion professor at Temple University, where his wife also taught, was the last governor of the Galilee region before the United Nations created Israel in 1948. Tip Led to Arrest Mr. Young's arrest in the case Friday, at a jail in Philadelphia, where he was being detained on other charges, came after information was received by a group offering $50,000 for information leading to a conviction in the case, according to Jawad George, a Washington lawyer who is the group's coordinator. Mr. George, who identified Mr. Young as a Black Muslim, said the suspect had known the Faruqis and had visited their home. Lieutenant Krauser declined to comment on Mr. George's statements. The police and officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said earlier they were investigating whether political differences might have been the motive for the slayings, since little was taken from the couple's home and because of Mr. Faruqi's stand on Palestinian rights. Nearly 4,000 mourners attended the couple's funeral at a Philadelphia mosque, and telegrams of grief and outrage arrived from nearly 50 embassies and from Moslem dignitaries in Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa. Mr. Faruqi, an American citizen, had taught at Temple since 1968 and was director of Islamic studies at the university. Mr. Young was arraigned on charges including murder in the first, second and third degrees; voluntary and involuntary manslaughter; aggravated assault; criminal trespass, and robbery. He was held without bail pending a preliminary hearing Jan. 27, the police said.

688-> CITY FAULTS STATE OFFER TO HELP PLACE BABIES
State officials say they have offered to help New York City find foster homes for the growing number of healthy babies in hospitals who are awaiting placement, but the city says the state's proposals are inadequate. The State Commissioner of Social Services, Cesar A. Perales, said yesterday that his agency had presented a wide range of proposals, including placing the babies in homes upstate, in an effort to move them out of the city's hospitals more quickly, but the city has not responded to the proposals. However, city officials said the state's proposals were either not specific enough or unacceptable. At least 175 healthy infants are now living in cribs in city hospitals, a situation that doctors say is jeopardizing the babies' psychological and physical development. Some of the babies have stayed so long that they have learned to walk and must be tethered to a crib to keep from falling out. City's Efforts Questioned The babies have attracted growing attention as their numbers have increased and complaints about their plight have intensified. Child-care groups say the city's bureaucracy is discouraging prospective parents. Mayor Koch has acknowledged that the city is not doing enough to place the babies. Mr. Perales said that in meetings last week the state offered to place the infants in foster homes outside New York City, to send three or four state workers to New York City to work round-the-clock to help process applications from foster families more quickly and to provide $400,000 to private agencies to hire additional staff. In addition, he said, he asked city officials to re-allocate workers within the city's office of Special Services for Children to reduce the time it takes to approve foster parents to two or three weeks, from as long as six months. But, he said, city officials refused to do so. Their refusal was particularly disturbing, he said, because of the Mayor's statement about the city's efforts to find homes for the infants. The Mayor has also recommended that the city reduce to 10 to 14 days the time it takes to approve foster parents. #400 Families Waiting At least 400 willing families are waiting to receive children, Mr. Perales said, but private social service agencies are having trouble processing those families' applications because the agencies do not have enough staff. ''That does not even include the homes S.S.C. has yet to investigate,'' he said. Mr. Perales also said that private agencies in Suffolk and Delaware Counties and in Albany had offered the city dozens of foster homes, but city officials have not told them when or how many babies are eligible. However, the Commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, William J. Grinker, said yesterday that the city had told the state it was willing to place children in homes in other counties as long as they were not too far away for the natural parents to visit. But the state had not given the city any specific foster homes or locations to inspect, Mr. Grinker said. He said the city welcomed the additional staff and money from the state, but the city could not reassign its child-care workers to process prospective families because they were needed to investigate reports of child abuse and neglect, which under court order must be done within 24 hours, and to monitor the quality of private child-care agencies.

689-> Cold Wave in Russia Alarms Soviet Chiefs
Soviet leaders have expressed alarm at the possible harm to the economy by the exceptionally harsh weather that has gripped the Soviet Union since the start of the year. In a special telephone conference Friday ordered by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Communist Party leaders, Government officials and economic managers across the country were urged to take emergency action. From the Railway Ministry in Moscow, Yegor K. Ligachev, a high-ranking Politburo official, told them that inadequate preparation for the winter could reverse last year's economic momentum. The cold wave, with temperatures of minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit and lower in much of the country for days at a time, has disrupted freight deliveries and heat and electricity supplies to towns and cities. The number of deaths from the severe weather rose to 81 today with reports that three people died when their homes were swept by avalanches in Georgia and a bus driver was killed by steam from a ruptured pipe in Gorky.

690-> CONCERT: MUSICKE CONSORT
THE Consort of Musicke's Wednesday night concert at Weill Recital Hall, devoted to English and Italian music of the 17th century, provided an ample impression of the group and its charms even to this listener who was pushed into an early departure by the flu. Through their many recordings, the lutenist Anthony Rooley, the soprano Emma Kirkby and the bass David Thomas are all well known in the United States. Mr. Rooley plays with sensitivity and finesse, Ms. Kirkby's voice is small, bright and expressive with a minimum of vibrato, and Mr. Thomas's voice is toffee-smooth, flexible and endowed with some startlingly rich, almost instrumental, low notes. One particularly admired the vocal blend in several duets, which called to mind those distant, enigmatic spacings in the late piano sonatas of Beethoven, where one hand is at the top of the keyboard and the other at the very bottom. The Consort's onstage manner was easygoing, friendly and informative, although some of the stage blocking and characterizations bordered on the cute.

691-> FOOD; A Menagerie of Delights
WHEN ANTONY WORRALL-THOMPSON MADE up his mind in 1978 to learn the secrets of the great chefs, he went about it methodically and boldly. He purchased a Michelin guide and traveled through France to visit the 18 restaurants that had been awarded its coveted top rating of three stars. At the end of each meal, he would ask the chef for his autograph. But when he went to the restaurant of Paul Bocuse in Lyons and sent a request to the master chef for his signature, the book came back unsigned. ''I was considerably embarrassed,'' recalled Mr. Worrall-Thompson, the chef-owner of the recently opened Menage a Trois restaurant in New York. ''But then Bocuse came to my table. He ordered a bottle of a fine Bordeaux and sat down. Then four additional main courses arrived. We talked for hours, and at 5 A.M., we went to market. And then he asked me to spend the day in the kitchen.'' Less than a decade later, Mr. Worrall-Thompson, a 34-year-old native of Cornwall, England, is himself being sought out by food enthusiasts attracted by his novel combinations of exquisitely fresh ingredients and artistic presentation. The dishes are being served at his new restaurant in New York, as well as at his establishments - also called Menage a Trois - in London and Bombay. Mr. Worrall-Thompson studied cooking at the hotel school of Westminster College in Surrey, England. His professional introduction to the field came in the mid-1970's, when he was serving as the dining-room manager of a small hotel in Essex. ''One morning the head chef didn't show up,'' recalled Mr. Worrall-Thompson, whose only experience at the stove had been home cooking from cookbook recipes by Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Michel Guerard. ''I volunteered to go into the kitchen and I suddenly wound up as head chef.'' He smiled. ''I told the second chef what to do and then watched how he did it. I adapted his techniques. It was a bit of a con but it worked.'' From then on, in a series of head-chef positions in London's East End and more fashionable West End, Mr. Worrall-Thompson learned by doing and watching. The Italian kitchen crew at one establishment ''taught me how to bone a haunch of veal and how to cook pasta to the proper degree of al dente,'' he recalled. ''I taught them how to make lighter sauces and to use fresh ingredients instead of canned.'' He found two financial backers and opened his first Menage a Trois in London, naming it in honor of the partnership. The restaurant gained considerable fame shortly after its premiere because it was patronized frequently by the royal family. Mr. Worrall-Thompson eventually bought out his partners. These days, when he is away from the London establishment, his wife, Militza-Jane (they have two young children), takes charge. The chef came into my kitchen on a cold, wintry day recently to prepare a few of his specialties, including black pasta with lobster in a Thai-inspired sauce; another dish he calls ''tuna and salmon patchwork,'' made with raw fish and served with a chilled, unmolded gazpacho mousse; cheese with a truffle vinaigrette, and a salad of smoked chicken and lobster with a walnut-oil dressing. Mr. Worrall-Thompson's cooking has been referred to as ''British nouvelle cuisine,'' a term he treats gingerly but does not reject. ''Prior to the advent of nouvelle cuisine, menus throughout the Western world were repetitive,'' he said. ''But to my mind, nouvelle cuisine has got to get away from inedible garnishes, things like tomato roses, crawfish shells and sprigs of rosemary. Garnishing should be totally edible.'' The chef has utilized American ingredients to expand the boundaries of his cooking. He uses, for example, the baby vegetables that abound here in specialty food markets but do not exist in France or in England. He also has great admiration for domestic foie gras, native duck breast, and other examples of the new American emphasis on quality ingredients. SALAD OF SMOKED CHICKEN AND LOBSTER WITH A WALNUT-OIL DRESSING 1 1/2 cups fresh, firm cucumber (about 1/2 pound), peeled, seeded and cut into very thin strips 4 scallions, cut to the same length as the cucumber sticks 1 head curly endive or chicory, cored and cut into very fine shreds just before use 1 1/2 cups peeled, seeded tomatoes, cut into very thin strips 1 lemon rind, blanched and cut into very thin strips 1 smoked chicken breast, skinned, boned and cut into very thin strips 2 cups cooked lobster tail, cut into bite-sized pieces Salt to taste, if desired White pepper to taste 6 ounces ( 3/4 cup) walnut-oil dressing (see recipe) 1 pear, peeled, poached, cut into quarters and core removed Corn-salad or field-salad (mache) leaves 3/4 cup peeled, seeded and diced tomatoes. 1. Toss together the cucumber, scallions, curly endive or chicory, julienned tomatoes, lemon rind, chicken breast and lobster tail with the walnut-oil dressing. Sprinkle with salt and white pepper to taste. Divide among four small salad plates. 2. Arrange the pieces of pear around the plates. Dip the corn-salad leaves in dressing. Arrange the salad leaves and equal portions of the diced tomatoes symmetrically between the pear pieces. Yield: Four servings. WALNUT-OIL DRESSING 1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard 1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar, preferably champagne vinegar, plus more as needed Juice of one lemon, or to taste 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/2 cup walnut oil 1/2 cup peanut oil Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper, preferably white, to taste. 1. Beat together the egg yolk, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, shallots and sugar. 2. Beating rapidly with a wire whisk, slowly add the walnut and peanut oils. Add salt and pepper to taste. Yield: One-and-one-quarter cups of dressing. TUNA AND SALMON PATCHWORK WITH A GAZPACHO MOUSSE 1/4 cup virgin olive oil 4 very small, hot, dried red chili peppers 8 ounces well-trimmed, fresh, skinless, boneless raw salmon 6 ounces well-trimmed, fresh, skinless, boneless raw tuna 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice 4 teaspoons sour cream 1 teaspoon caviar, preferably beluga or sevruga, although red salmon caviar may be used 4 individual molds of gazpacho mousse (see recipe) 1/4 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard 1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar, preferably champagne vinegar Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tablespoon peeled, seeded, finely chopped cucumber 1 tablespoon seeded, deveined, finely chopped sweet red pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped scallion 8 unblemished salad leaves, preferably arugula. 1. Combine the oil and chilies and let stand at least 24 hours. 2. When ready to prepare this dish, place four round cookie-cutter molds, each about one-and-one-half inches in diameter and one-and-one-half inches in height, on a flat surface with the sharp edges up. 3. Cut enough of the salmon into small cubes to make four tablespoons. Cut enough of the tuna into small cubes to make four tablespoons. Place the cubes in a small bowl and add the lime juice, sour cream and salt and pepper to taste. Blend well and set aside. 4. Cut the remaining salmon on the bias into very thin slices. Arrange one slice at a time over the upper edges of one mold covering the inside bottom of the mold and slightly overlapping at the top. Let the slices hang over the edges. Use only enough slices to line the mold. Line the other three. 5. Spoon one-quarter teaspoon of the caviar inside each of the salmon-lined molds. Spoon equal portions of the cubed fish mixture on top of the caviar. Fold over the overhanging bits of the salmon slices to enclose the filling and cover the top of each mold neatly. Unmold each serving on large, white dinner plates. 6. Cut the remaining salmon and tuna into very thin slices. Arrange equal portions of the tuna and salmon slices, edges slightly overlapping, in a neat pattern in the center of the plate. 7. Unmold one portion of gazpacho mousse onto each plate, opposite the filled salmon molds. 8. Put the mustard and vinegar in a small mixing bowl and start beating with a wire whisk. Remove the hot chilies from the oil and beat the oil into the sauce. Add salt, pepper, cucumber, sweet red pepper and scallion. Blend well. Spoon equal portions of the sauce over the salmon and tuna slices. Garnish each serving with salad leaves. Yield: Four servings.

692-> BEYOND REAL ESTATE AND RIGATONI: Henry A. Lambert; Stirring Up the Next Course
CAN Henry A. Lambert do for stews and pot pies what he did for pasta? Lambert's Pasta & Cheese grew from its 1976 start in one shop -where New Yorkers interested in fresh, healthy food showed a willingness to pay premium prices for spaghetti and its fancier relatives - into a full complement of retail stores, restaurants, and a national wholesale business. When the company went public on Nov. 4, 1985, annual revenues exceeded $10 million. And last November, the Carnation Company, a subsidiary of the Swiss-based Nestle S.A., paid $56.3 million for the Pasta & Cheese name, for its 35-state distribution system and for the company's factories. The value of Mr. Lambert's 43 percent ownership: $21 million. Not bad for a man who ran Pasta & Cheese while working full time as president of the Reliance Development Group, the real estate development unit of the diversified Reliance Group Holdings Company. Even when Mr. Lambert started Pasta & Cheese in 1976, he was fully employed elsewhere as executive vice president at the Canal-Randolph Corporation, a New York real estate developer. But the real estate market was in a slump and he had little to do. ''Sometimes it is a virtue not to make a deal,'' he said. A year later, when Saul Steinberg, the chairman of Reliance Holdings, was looking for an executive to head his new development group, he raised no objection to Mr. Lambert's sideline business. And one job has apparently not interfered with the other. Since Mr. Lambert became president 10 years ago, all but one of the dozen or so $100 million Reliance commercial properties have done well, with a good mix of tenants, high rents, and high profits when sold. ''Mr. Steinberg seems to like the idea of his executives having other projects,'' said Mr. Lambert. Mr. Steinberg, to whom Mr. Lambert reports directly, refused to discuss Mr. Lambert's food business or his performance as a Reliance executive. And Mr. Lambert, who is 51 years old, must like an absorbing outside project, for he is using part of the Pasta & Cheese proceeds to develop a new enterprise, August & Company. Since he has promised Carnation not to sell Italian foods, Mr. Lambert will eschew pasta in the new company, concentrating instead on breads, stews and pot pies. In good part, the new company depends on the leavings of the old one: Mr. Lambert spent $1.1 million to buy back from Carnation all nine of the Pasta & Cheese stores and the four restaurants. He has since invested $1.5 million to buy a commissary in Long Island, where he will produce food products. So Mr. Lambert is back in business - but with the weakest elements of his old company. The stores, for example, faltered as Pasta & Cheese products were distributed to more and more groceries and department store gourmet sections. But this weakness has not affected his plans to ask former Pasta & Cheese shareholders and new investors for $6 million to reposition the retail stores under the August & Company name, expand the restaurant business and develop new products. ''I am planning to come up with a three-meat stew,'' said the intense but soft-spoken executive. After a holiday trip to Paris, he became convinced that American consumers were ready for a savory beef, pork and lamb stew in a thick, brown sauce. Standing at a four-burner gas range, in old pants and loafers, he made the stew at home a last week with the help of a half-dozen cookbooks. ''I jot down my recipe changes,'' he said, so he can duplicate the dish. A successful recipe may be passed on to Steven Philips, the executive chef at August & Company who will develop a mass-market version by altering the spices and finding ways to produce the dish cheaper than Mr. Lambert makes it. Mr. Lambert, who will be a consultant to Carnation on the Pasta & Cheese business, wants August & Company's products to have the same qualities that made his old pasta and sauces popular - a simple homemade appearance, fresh ingredients, no preservatives and a minimum of preparation time. Back when he paid $17,000 for the first store, a small cheese shop near 79th Street on Manhattan's Third Avenue, Mr. Lambert had no idea his cooking would bring him this far. With $30,000 of his own money and $30,000 from six investors, he bought pasta equipment and hired two helpers: an out-of-work Italian mime and a Phi Beta Kappa from Tufts who had an Italian last name. By 1979 the products were so popular that retailers like Macy's and Zabar's, a Manhattan food store, asked to sell them. Soon Mr. Lambert was in the wholesale business, with the green and white Pasta & Cheese packages selling in 35 states. Even Mr. Lambert's greatest fans would not call August & Company -August is his middle name and the Lambert name belongs to Carnation - a sure bet. While few question his judgement about food, his three-sided business strategy has not been foolproof. HE HAS proved less than adept at optimizing different arms of his business. ''The wholesale business grew to the detriment of the retail stores,'' said John Stahl, former vice president and treasurer of Pasta & Cheese and the new president of August & Company. Mr. Stahl's strategy for August & Company calls for an exclusive line of products for the retail stores in addition to products that may eventually be sold wholesale. Mr. Stahl manges the financial side of the new company, while Mr. Lambert is in the kitchen. For Pasta & Cheese, the wholesale business became the main source of profits when the company's stores faltered. As earnings rose to $890,000 in the last fiscal year, retail sales were shrinking from 72 percent of total company sales in fiscal 1983 to 39 percent in fiscal 1986. Retail profits dropped precipitously, too. August & Company must depend heavily on the same troubled stores, although Mr. Lambert expects his restaurants, which are primarily in office buildings and geared to the lunch-time crowd, to keep cash flowing until the shops turn around. Restaurants are one of the few areas in which Mr. Lambert's life as a developer and an entrepreneur-cook dovetail. ''When you work with Henry, every building has an eating facility,'' said A. Eugene Kohn, president of Kohn, Pedersen Fox Associates in New York, which has designed three buildings for Reliance. Mr. Lambert's own restaurants -one, the Cafe Marguery, is in the building where Reliance has its headquarters - are not easily identifiable as part of the Pasta & Cheese family, since they all have different names. The lone exception is his first restaurant, the Pasta & Cheese Cafe at Bergdorf Goodman, a Manhattan retailer. Under a special dispensation from Carnation, the restaurant will keep the Pasta & Cheese name and serve Pasta & Cheese products in addition to new products. At Reliance, Mr. Lambert's associates say he is a hands-on manager who involves himself in every facet of the company's real estate projects from location to the color of the elevator walls. The buildings Mr. Lambert has worked on, including Denver's bold 36-floor Amoco Building, and Philadelphia's Eight Penn Center, with its curving blue-green glass facade, all share unusual, sometimes controversial architectural features, says John Cushman, president of the Cushman Realty Corporation, a large real estate brokerage company. ''Henry is completely unorthodox, but he is one of the best,'' said Mr. Cushman, who concedes he ''has never been on the same side as Henry during negotiations.'' Mr. Cushman's company represents commercial tenants. MR. LAMBERT'S day at Reliance begins about 8:45 and ends at 6, although he travels several days a month to Reliance's domestic offices and foreign projects. According to those who work for him, he is able to involve himself in all aspects of the business - and still be efficient - because he delegates the analysis and research to others while reserving the decision-making for himself. When Mr. Lambert is in New York, he often holds food company meetings at 7:45 A.M. at his home. As in the Pasta & Cheese days, he works for August & Company early and late in the day and on weekends, although he still finds time to socialize in a manner appropriate to one of New York's most eligible bachelors. He is serious about his work, but to close friends, Mr. Lambert is a formidable, and sometimes ribald, practical joker. ''He is like a jack-in-a box,'' said a friend. ''He seems quite harmless; then he surprises you.'' Not long ago, he called Mr. Kohn's office to say that a stripper at one of New York's more notorious flesh palaces had found his wallet. ''My secretary dutifully came in to tell me during a meeting,'' said the architect, who has been a friend of Mr. Lambert's for 18 years. ''Henry does things like that.'' Mr. Lambert's female friends are not spared, Mr. Kohn said. ''He called a woman lawyer he was dating and told her secretary that he was from Hustler,'' Mr. Kohn recalled. ''He said that the lawyer's centerfold had been accepted.'' Mr. Lambert's friends say that he has been a mischief maker since childhood. Never malicious, they say, his pranks are primarily aimed at keeping them humble. Mr. Lambert goes out of his way to appear ordinary and to hide his Park Avenue upbringing. His grandfather founded Lambert Brothers Jewelry Inc. in 1877 - and his father sold the company to the Zale Corporation a century later. Shortly thereafter, his father made headlines by buying the $3 million 69.42 carat diamond that Richard Burton had given to Elizabeth Taylor. Although Mr. Lambert owns a house on Long Island and hasjust bought a brownstone on Manhattan's East Side, he likes saying that his primary home in Manhattan has one bedroom and one bath. DESPITE his success with Pasta & Cheese, Mr. Lambert seems shy about becoming a public figure - in distinct contrast to his 49-year-old brother, Benjamin, the president of Eastdil Realty Inc. and a well-known Wall Street real estate deal maker who was described in a recent magazine article as ''a Hollywood figure'' who dines with famous people. ''Henry is not a jet setter,'' said Benjamin Lambert. ''He likes family.'' For his part, Henry Lambert admits to ''a little bit of sibling rivalry,'' particularly since both brothers are in real estate, but quickly adds ''we are close.'' The two brothers, their mother and Benjamin's children -Henry was divorced 20 years ago and has no children - were together on the recent Paris trip. Mr. Lambert says that his familywealth may have been a deterrent. He was not motivated to study hard. ''I couldn't have gotten into Harvard,'' he said. When people ask him why he chose Bucknell University, he tells them he had a football scholarship. He didn't. ''It was a joke because I was so skinny,'' he said. When he graduated in 1957, the 6-foot-1 sociology-psychology major weighed 150 pounds - and despite his love of food, he is still slim. After college he went to work selling commercial real estate space for Webb & Knapp, a New York developer. In 1961, he left to become a vice president at the Canal-Randolph Corporation, another local developer. He was promoted to executive vice president in 1967 and remained in that position for 10 years, because there was little chance of moving up in the tightly knit company. When the real estate market nearly collapsed in 1976, he turned to his cooking. ''I love to cook,'' said Mr. Lambert. ''Sometimes, I get as much satisfaction from a sauce that works as I do from a successful deal.'' Mr. Lambert has always taken cooking seriously: he has taken classes from several New York City restaurant chefs. But unlike his brother, Mr. Lambert did not see cooking as a way to business independence. ''He likes being in a corporate structure,'' said his brother, Benjamin. And Henry Lambert admits that he might not have have a company now if the real estate market had remained strong a decade ago. ''Lots of us are latent entrepreneurs,'' he said. ''Our skills don't surface until there's a need.''

693-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; OF BALKY DOORS AND REAGAN VISITS
FOR a long time, hundreds of automatic garage doors in San Bernardino, Calif., mysteriously failed to open. But only on certain days. After some electronic sleuthing, Larry Murdock, who sells automatic openers in the city and was inundated with complaints, came up with an answer last April: Scrambled communication signals transmitted by satellite to President Reagan's E4-B command plane were interfering with the operation of the doors. This occurred whenever the President was vacationing at his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., and the plane, designed to be a command center in the event of war, was parked at March Air Force Base, 10 miles south of San Bernardino. Part of the problem has been solved, Mr. Murdock reports. ''On a lot of the openers, I have changed the frequencies,'' he says. But on garage doors where this cannot be done, he adds, ''we still have a terrible problem.'' He says the interference is ''in the 300-megahertz cycle - from about 310 megahertz to 390.'' Before he changed frequencies, he says, he got up to 1,000 complaints during Presidential visits. Now, he says, it's more like 200 to 300.

694-> BEYOND THE COURT FIGHT: DEEP LOVE FOR BABY M
To the world, the infant known as Baby M is the central figure in a landmark custody fight. In human terms, she is a 9-month-old who weighs 25 pounds and has eight teeth, brownish hair, bluish-gray eyes and a chubby, cherubic face. The now-contested agreement that led to Baby M's birth has left her parents and the surrogate mother who is fighting for her custody with starkly different relationships with the baby, perhaps best reflected by what she is called: Melissa by her parents, William and Elizabeth Stern; Sara by her natural mother, Mary Beth Whitehead. For Baby M, home is now a three-bedroom house that the Sterns own in Tenafly. Trial Recessed But Mrs. Whitehead talks wistfully of the baby's ''coming home,'' her hope that Judge Harvey R. Sorkow will grant her custody at the end of the trial, which recessed Friday until Feb. 2. Since Oct. 6, Judge Sorkow has permitted Mrs. Whitehead to see the baby for four hours a week - two hours on Tuesdays and two on Thursdays - at a county home here for troubled youths. On Friday, the judge denied Mrs. Whitehead's request to have the baby every weekend and every third week. ''It's an institution,'' Mrs. Whitehead said of the county home. ''They try to make it homey. But it's like a doctor's office kind of place.'' For Mr. Stern, ''high point number one'' of each day comes about 6 A.M. with the first rustling from the baby's crib. ''I'll go into her room, and she's always standing in the corner of the crib facing the door, smiling,'' Mr. Stern said. ''High point number two comes at night when I come home and she starts crawling across the floor as soon as I come in. If I don't pick her up right away, she starts crying.'' Inquisitive Little Girl To Mr. Stern and his wife, the baby is an inquisitive, active little girl with a love for mechanical toys, rice cereal and just about anything that makes noise. Mr. Stern seems most taken by her curiosity. ''She looks at every little thing I do,'' he said in a brief conversation Thursday. ''That's the really amazing thing. When I measure out her cereal in the morning - four tablespoons - she watches. When I open the refrigerator door, she tries to stick her head in. If there's a single thing in the middle of a room, she crawls to it. And she tends to crawl after things she shouldn't -lamp cords, newspapers.'' Often, he said, she paws the newspapers and winds up with ink-smeared hands. Mrs. Whitehead, the 29-year-old wife of a sanitation worker with two children of her own, brings a bag of toys and lunch to her twice-weekly visits. A sheriff's deputy oversees them. ''I'm supervised,'' Mrs. Whitehead said Friday outside of court. ''I'm told what to do with the baby and when to do it. It's a pretty difficult situation the judge has put me in as a mother.'' Different Views of Baby M ''When I walk in she knows I'm her mommy,'' Mrs. Whitehead went on, a broad smile breaking her usual somber visage. ''I don't know how to explain that; you just know.'' ''She usually sleeps about 45 minutes of the 2 hours,'' Mrs. Whitehead said. ''Then I feed her lunch and a bottle. She usually eats a jar of fruit.'' On most visits, Mrs. Whitehead brings a jar of baby lotion with her. ''I put it all over her because she's got real dry skin,'' she said. Sometimes the two families do not quite see the baby in the same light. Mrs. Whitehead says she has baptized her a Catholic. The Sterns said they plan to raise her as a Unitarian. The choice, they say, is a theological compromise because Mr. Stern is Jewish and his wife is a Methodist. Mr. Stern says the baby is learning her first few words. ''She says baby and hi,'' he said. Mrs. Whitehead's perception is different. 'Nobody Recognizes Us' ''She's not saying any words yet, just making baby noises,'' Mrs. Whitehead said. Occasionally, the Sterns take the baby to the supermarket. She's strong enough now to sit upright in the folding babyseat in the grocery cart. ''She's always grabbing for everything as we walk down the aisle,'' Mr. Stern said. Sometimes after court the Sterns go out to a restaurant near their home for dinner. ''Thank God, so far nobody recognizes us,'' he said. Recently, the Sterns took Baby M to the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. Her favorite attraction? ''Reaching for the diamonds,'' Mr. Stern replied. ''We got to the diamond showcase and she started kicking at the glass. It was really bright. She loves bright things.'' He went on: ''You know, I never understood when friends talked on and on about their kids. It's hard to describe that feeling, but I know now.''

695-> COOPERMAN TENURE MARKED BY UNUSUAL RATE OF SUCCESS
SOON after Saul Cooperman became the state's Commissioner of Education in 1982, he attended a meeting with some nationally prominent educators and began to talk about his ideas for change, especially his plan to overhaul the state's system of teacher certification. Who was this cheeky parvenu, the closed club of education powerhouses groaned, who was knocking holes in established practices and rambling on about ''what's right for the kids''? Members of some groups smirked, others yawned and most disregarded what the little-known former Madison Superintendent of Schools had to say. But no one is laughing now as Dr. Cooperman completes the final months of his first five-year term in office. Having brought about a number of major changes that have caught the attention of even the most jaded educators, he has emerged as one of the country's most visible and productive educational innovators. While most state school chiefs call for new approaches and tougher standards, what distinguishes Dr. Cooperman is the high degree of success he has had in seeing his ideas through. Despite strong resistance to many of his proposals, nearly all have been approved with only minor modifications, in part because of Governor Kean's strong backing. The changes Dr. Cooperman set into motion are beginning to crop up in other states. His alternative route to certification - once an almost heretical idea - has won widespread interest. Several states are considering establishing academies where teachers can hone their pedagogical skills. Last August, all 50 Governors recommended adopting Dr. Cooperman's notion of ''school bankruptcy,'' the philosophy that some schools are in such bad shape that the state must take them over. Nearly 50 other initiatives, many of them pioneering efforts, have put New Jersey squarely in the spotlight of educational change. Last month, Dr. Cooperman told Governor Kean he was willing to take on a second term when his post expired July 1. The Governor is expected to accept his offer, which is subject to the Legislature's confirmation. ''There are pros and cons to this job, but the good outweighs the problems,'' Dr. Cooperman said in a telephone interview. ''I think I have a lit-PU JP COOP tle vision as to how to make things better, and this gives me a chance to translate the vision into coherent plans and ideas. That overcomes all the headaches associated with the job.'' By his own account, Dr. Cooperman is a different man from the ''naive'' person sworn into office five years ago. ''There are some people who live to bait you, trap you, distort what's said,'' he said, without being more specific. ''They say their interests are students, but their interests are themselves.'' ''If they ask me, 'Cooperman, were you drunk today?' or 'Saul, did you beat your wife today?' and I say 'No,' suddenly I'm a drunk and a wife-beater. It's that type of subtlety to get you on the defensive.'' Despite this skepticism, most observers say that Dr. Cooperman has lost little of his drive or his optimism. Although he may have cut back to a 70-hour work week, the boyish 52-year-old educator still grabs every chance he can to expound and proselytize, documenting his opinions with everything from ''The Federalist'' to Xerox's latest annual report. And his pet saying, ''What's right for the kids'' - a phrase that has at times exasperated even his most ardent fans because of its frequency -is still very much in evidence. Most people agree that Dr. Cooperman has changed in one major way. The once-stanch believer in the primacy of local control now advocates state intervention in school districts that repeatedly fail to pass muster. ''I've looked at our monitoring for three years and at some of the information we've turned over to the Attorney General, and I saw that a few districts don't play it for the kids,'' he said. ''They play it for themselves: patronage, outside interference, reward and punishment, and the money not going where it should.'' To assist school districts that cannot or will not correct deficiencies, Dr. Cooperman has devised a controversial plan that would let his office remove local school boards and top school officials and install the Department of Education's own people. The plan, now before the Legislature, has provoked widespread negative reaction from many quarters because it conflicts with a cherished premise in New Jersey: Local control in school matters. ''I've done a good job of alienating every major education group in the state,'' said Dr. Cooperman, who nevertheless is ''cautiously optimistic'' that the Legislature will approve his plan. A few years ago, the Commissioner himself would have found the suggestion of a massive state takeover unpalatable. ''The first three and a half years, I never would have come out for intervention,'' he said. ''It just wasn't me. Like Anne Frank, I believe that 'in spite of everything, people are really good at heart,' and I thought that only a district itself could solve its problems. ''I've learned, though, that there has to be a stick as well as a carrot, although I don't like to use it.'' Although Dr. Cooperman feels that the threat of outside interference is necessary now and then, it is the ''carrots'' of his first term in office he is most proud of. is most proud of. For the teaching profession, there are $15,000 grants to design effective classroom strategies, scholarship programs to attract bright high school students to the field and a recognition system that last year honored 1,300 outstanding teachers. ''We're the only state in the U.S. that has increased the quality and quantity of teachers in the last three years,'' Dr. Cooperman said, ''and I'm proud of that.'' For schools, there are cash incentives to improve basic skills performance, money to reduce student disruption and grants to adopt model programs under the so-called ''effective schools'' initiative. Many of the Commissioner's reforms have been uphill battles, like a standoff with the teachers' unions over certification and seniority revisions and his current fight over intervention. Quoting the management consultant Peter Drucker, Dr. Cooperman things and not do things right.' We could have played around and nibbled at unimportant things and had a nice five years.'' The Commissioner, some people have said, should take his own advice when it comes to urban schools. In what may be the most vulnerable aspect of his administration, urban schools seem to be slipping further behind their suburban counterparts in financial resources and a number of other academic criteria. Dr. Cooperman has acknowledged that an attempt to ease the plight of city schools - his ''Urban Initiative'' - has met with only mixed results, and there are those who say even that program is a token gesture. But the Commissioner makes no apologies for his efforts to improve urban education. ''We're second in the U.S. in dollars we spend per pupil,'' he said. ''Governor Kean has given more to education than any other New Jersey Governor. We don't have to hang our heads or look away.'' As to his priorities in a second term, Dr. Cooperman said that his first goal would be to nurture the changes he had instituted. In particular, he would like to see the minimum salary level remain high enough to attract bright newcomers, and the alternative route and the traditional collegiate training courses become ''stronger and tougher.'' ''They're very vulnerable now,'' he said. ''We've challenged some sacred cows, and I'd like to see their roots sink and they continue to grow up.'' On a more immediate agenda, Governor Kean, in his State of the State Message last week, charged Dr. Cooperman with reviewing the certification procedures for school business officials and with studying the advisability of an 11th-grade graduation test. With next year's kindergarteners graduating from high school in the year 2000, the Commissioner has been looking at the skills students will need in the 21st century. ''I worry when 75 percent of our major corporations have to teach kids the basic skills,'' he said. ''If our democracy is going to be preserved, we're going to have to have people who think straight, think for themselves, respect other people's viewpoints and understand dissent. We must go beyond the basic skills, with reading, writing and arithmetic under our belts by eighth grade.'' Dr. Cooperman regrets that he did not involve parents more in his earlier initiatives, and he said that a second term would be accented by an attempt to work with them on issues such as antisocial behavior, drug use and teen-age pregnancy. While leaving to local districts the decision as to whether schools should dispense birth-control pills - an idea he does not encourage - Dr. Cooperman nevertheless believes that the state must insure that ethical behavior is taught. ''Kids aren't taught to say no,'' he said. ''Home is so very, very important. I'm going to try to get into the home and talk about such things as less television, sitting with your child for 30 minutes a day, setting limits for your children, having them do chores, less permissiveness and more standards.'' Dr. Cooperman occasionally thinks wistfully of his own home life and how his $90,000-a-year job has impinged on it. ''I look at some of the things I don't have, like walking the beach, reading a novel, seeing a ballgame or being with friends or my son and daughters,'' he said. For those reasons, he indicated that, even if reappointed, he probably would not complete a full second term as Commissioner and would most likely leave office in 1990, when Governor Kean does. But the indefatigable Dr. Cooperman is not ready to go yet. ''Only 20 people have occupied this seat before,'' he said. ''I can say what I truly believe is right. I'm not beholden to any organization or constituency. That's what makes me want to stay.''

696-> WARSAW JOURNAL; HIPPIE FOES OF THE DRAFT HANDLED WITH KID GLOVES
As they waited outside a local court where their confederates were on trial for taking part in an illegal demonstration, the members and supporters of Freedom and Peace, Poland's draft resistance movement, presented a picture of protest that stylistically, at least, seemed closer to 1960's American hippies and yippies than to the banned Solidarity movement. The young men, all in their 20's, included some with long hair and some with single earrings. One wore one red sneaker and one blue one, and another was dressed in tails, a rhinestone on his satin lapel. With them were women who hugged them and joked openly about police efforts to keep them from the courtroom, where 22 detained members of the organization were being charged with staging a sidewalk protest urging the release from prison of two members who refused military service. The men were released a few days after the protest. Angry stares of young police officers at the courthouse seemed like flashbacks to construction workers in New York heaping abuse upon antiwar protesters of the Vietnam era. 'A Personal Thing' ''Yes, I felt the police hatred was a personal thing,'' said Jacek Czaputowicz a short time after the court aquitted half the demonstrators and fined the rest. An economist, 32 years old and unemployed, he is one of the leaders of Freedom and Peace group. ''It was not just professional disdain,'' he said. ''It is personal, passionate hatred. I think it is because we are spontaneous and that, among other things, we are ridiculing the military myth so powerful in this country while they are so neat.'' ''But, there was also something else,'' he went on. ''It was clear that the police were under orders from the top to handle us like eggs - no hitting, no rough stuff - and that must have infuriated them.'' In November, 51 supporters of the group, including 2 West German antiwar activists, were detained for several hours by the police near the town of Tarnow as they prepared to place a wreath on the grave of Otton Szimek, a German soldier executed by the Nazis for refusing to kill civilians. ''We were kept from the grave,'' said one of the group. ''But here, too, the police officials who questioned us acted as if they had gloves on.'' 'Respected Our Views' ''They said they respected our views and our goals but that they were only concerned that our wreathlaying ceremony might be exploited by those German revanchists who yearn for the formerly German parts of Poland.'' Why exactly should this still small group of antiwar. political oppositionists and ecologically concerned young people be accorded deferential treatment is a source of wonder and debate within the wider opposition where Freedom and Peace has allies and supporters. After all, some of the older opposition had told the young Freedom and Peace people they seemed particularly vulnerable. Though small in membership the group is the most cohesive organization to have arisen since Solidarity, reflecting ideas and tactics of a generation swept up by hopes unleashed in Solidarity's bloom while its members were still in school. It was mostly made up of students lacking the protective validity of prominent workers such as Solidarity still enjoys. Moreover, by stressing draft resistance, the group's members were aware that they might arouse disapproval among pious Catholics and Government critics who still widely regard military service as a patriotic obligation. Remarkable Victories And yet, despite the warnings from their older mentors, the group has not only thrived and expanded, but has won remarkable victories. ''With our hunger strikes, demonstrations and petitions, we have won the release of people from prison who refused to take the oath of military service and more recently we pressured the Government to extend the amnesty for political prisoners to embrace people who went to prison rather than report for army service,'' Mr. Czaputowicz said. The group is eclectic in its goals and amorphous in its membership, including conscientious objectors, pacifists and even some quite militant anti-Communists. A minority is concerned with ecological issues, pushing for plans to have draft resisters allowed to clean up the environment. Links With Western Groups Pamphlets and leaflets are prepared secretly and members have established links with antiwar groups in Western countries while developing less close contacts with men and women interested in independent social action in the Eastern bloc. Perhaps the group's most extensive campaign was its support of those young men who were prepared to go to the army but not to swear, as all new soldiers must, that they will uphold the interests of Poland's military allies, which is understood as an act of fealty to the Soviet Union. Freedom and Peace has suggested that some army units be set up for those unwilling to swear what it views as subservience to a foreign power. The group has never received any direct response from the Government, but Mr. Czaputowicz maintains there is a continuing process of ''negotiations through protest and fact.'' Another demand put forward by Freedom and Peace has called for a system of institutionalized alternate service for those whose world views will not allow them take arms. At present, Poland does permit some young men to work off their army time in community service, but Mr. Czaputowicz said the decision in these cases is made entirely by military authorities and it never includes those in the top health category. Right of Alternate Service He said Freedom and Peace wanted all young men to have the right to perform alternate service outside of the military if they wanted to, by working in hospitals or on squads repairing ecological damage. Mr. Czaputowicz, a former leader of the independent university student movement of 1980, said Freedom and Peace had about 100 full-time, fully involved campaigners but that there were about 10,000 variously involved supporters associated with chapters in all large Polish cities. Among its members are people with well-known names and well known genealogies. For example, one of the leaders of Freedom and Peace in Cracow is Konstanty Miodowicz, a lecturer at Jagelonian University, whose father, Alfred Miodowicz, is the head of the labor unions set up by the Government to replace the outlawed Solidarity unions. The elder Mr. Miodowicz is also a member of the Communist Party Politburo. Also, Jan Jozef Lipski, an internationally respected historian and opposition patriarch, has lent his name and stature to the Freedom and Peace group. The presence of such people in the ranks is at times offered as explanation for a degree of official tolerance. But Mr. Czaputowicz thinks that what has so far provided his group with the greatest protection has been the support it has gained from those Western, mostly West European, antiwar groups, which have been singled out by Moscow as important factors in Soviet disarmament and European strategies.

698-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Reagan Supporters Unite
After some initial disarray and hesitancy, President Reagan's grass-roots supporters appear to have formed a united front. A coalition, America at Risk, organized last month, has now coalesced with the active support of three of the Administration's point men. Education Secretary William J. Bennett, along with the White House political affairs director, Patrick J. Buchanan, and the budget director, James T. Miller, will conduct a briefing Jan. 26 at the White House as part of a kickoff for the coalition. The organizational meetings will include ''workshops'' at the National Press Club, and among those being pressed to participate is Lieut. Col. Oliver North, a central figure in the Iran-Nicaragua arms affair. Among the coalition's 20-odd member organizations are the central core of the President's grass-roots organizational support, including the American Security Council, a 30-year-old anti-Communist organization whose active advisers until recently included Colonel North. Other members are Citizens for Reagan, the political pressure group that tried in the 1986 elections to engineer the defeat of Congressional opponents of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels; the American Conservative Union, the Conservative Leadership PAC, Concerned Women for America, Citizens for America and a range of other groups that have supported Mr. Reagan's anti-Communist foreign policy agenda. ''Basically, we're saying Forget about Iran-a-smear and concentrate on continuing the Reagan agenda,'' said Fran Gemma, a spokeman for the coalition. The group plans an advertising campaign on the theme, ''Support the High Principles of the Reagan Administration,'' and a series of satellite video hookups to reach and consolidate Reagan supporters around the country.

701-> Executive Who Lost His Job Leaps 18 Floors to His Death
A former vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, who had recently lost his job, killed himself Friday night by jumping out the window of his 18th-floor penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side, the police said yesterday. The man, Allan Jones, who was 40 years old, was despondent over the loss of his job, a police detective, Charles Mattera, said. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch, William Clark, said Mr. Jones's position as vice president of project and lease financing was eliminated because of changes in the tax law that reduced the division's workload. A relative told the police that Mr. Jones, who was married but had no children, was a Rhodes Scholar and an Oxford University graduate. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.

703-> DR. OTTO NATHAN, AN ECONOMIST
Dr. Otto Nathan, an economist who served as executor and co-trustee of the estate of Albert Einstein, died of heart failure Tuesday at Van Etten Hospital in the Bronx. He was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan. Dr. Nathan, who was born July 15, 1893, in Bigen, Germany, was an economic adviser to the Weimar Republic from 1920 to 1933. He served as a German delegate to the World Economic Conference in Geneva in 1927. With the rise of Hitler to power, Dr. Nathan fled to the United States, where he joined the faculty of Princeton University in the economics department. It was at Princeton that he began his friendship with Dr. Einstein. Dr. Nathan was the sole executor of Dr. Einstein's estate after the scientist's death in 1955 and was co-trustee of his literary property along with Dr. Einstein's secretary, Helen Dukas, who died in 1982. In the last three decades of his life, Dr. Nathan's primary interest was the Einstein archive, which he trebled in size. The archive was turned over to the Hebrew University of Israel in 1982. Dr. Nathan, who earned doctorates in economics and law at Freiburg and Munich Universities, taught economics at Princeton, New York University, Howard University and Vassar College. He also served as a consultant on economic literature to the Library of Congress. In the mid-1950's, Dr. Nathan had difficulty obtaining a passport and later became a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He declined to answer questions from the committee, saying he believed that ''no Congressional committee has the right to inquire into the political beliefs of American citizens.'' In 1955, he forced the State Department, by court action, to grant him a passport after he swore that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. And in 1957, he won an acquittal on a contempt of Congress charge stemming from the confrontation with the House committee. Dr. Nathan was the author of numerous books, including ''The Nazi Economic System: Germany's Mobilization for War,'' and ''Nazi War Finance and Banking,'' both in 1944. He also helped Heinz Horden write ''Einstein on Peace'' in 1961. Dr. Nathan, who became a naturalized citizen in 1939, is survived by a niece, Doris Nathan, of Manhattan.

706-> CHESS; A SACRIFICE, BUT NOT SOUND
Speculative sacrifices run a wide gamut from ''What kind of a stunt is that?'' through ''Well, he's a great tactician, maybe he can bamboozle his opponent,'' to ''Of course, it's so fantastically complicated that one cannot speak of a clear refutation.'' The speculative sacrifice is supposed to be the work of inspired, far-ranging judgment, not of ironbound calculation that forces and foresees the end of the combination right from the beginning. So it is not surprising that it will usually be open to doubt, if not criticism. For example, one, perhaps the greatest, of Savielly Tartakover's speculative sacrifices was denied a special prize because the judges decided it was not subject to exact calculation. If there ever was a speculative gambit to inspire complete confidence, it should be something like the one that Joel Benjamin, a Brooklyn grandmaster, sprang on Nick DeFirmian, an Oakland grandmaster, in the eighth round of the United States championship in Estes Park, Colo. What started as a Queen's Indian Defense was transformed into a Benoni formation after 4 ... P-B4; 5 P-Q5, PxP; 6 PxP. After 6 ... P-KN3, the sharp character of this opening was trebled by Benjamin's new gambit with 7 P-K4! DeFirmian would have been well-advised to decline the aggressive offer by 7 ... B-KN2 - he would not have had to worry about 8 P-K5 because 8 ... N-N5 will start Black on a rapid counterattack against the overextended white center. But he bravely took up the challenge with 7 ... NxKP - and was surely sorry quite soon, perhaps after the cramping 11 P-Q6! DeFirmian tried to unclog his position with 12 ... BxN; 13 QxB, but after 13 ... N-B3; 14 N-N5!, his king was uncomfortably placed, he could not activate his KR and a plan for shaking off Benjamin's bind was hard to come by. To play 14 ... N-K1 and threaten 15 ... P-QR3 would not do: 15 B-KB4!, BxP; 16 R-R2, B-N2; 17 R/ 2-K2 would just be crushing. On 16 B-B3, DeFirmian might have tried 16 ... K-R2, except that 17 N-B7, R-QB1; 18 R-K2, R-B1; 19 R/ 1-K1, which threatens 20 R-K7!, ties a knot around him. At this point, Benjamin's superiority was quite clear. After 17 ... BxB, Benjamin could have picked up the black queen for rook and knight with 18 R-K8ch, QxR; 19 NxQ, but with 19 ... B-K4; 20 N-B7 (20 B-B4?, N-N4 costs White a piece), R-KB1; 21 Q-Q5, N-B3; 22 Q-R2, K-N2, Black could ensure the gain of a second pawn with a solid position. Considering the trouble he was in, DeFirmian did well to reach the exchange-down ending that arose after 23 ... RxQ. However, All Benjamin needed now was good, solid technique. Exchanging rooks, after 25 R-K7, by 25 ... RxP; 26 RxPch, KxR; 27 RxR would not yield Black any real chances for a draw. The best DeFirmian could manage was to keep the white rooks at bay defending the QP after 34 R/3-Q3. But now Benjamin was ready to arrange for a king march to K5. Benjamin's 41 P-N5! broke Black's resistance - on 41 ... P-B4, there would have been no answer to 42 R-K1, threatening 43 R-K7ch. After 50 RxNch!, it was fruitless to play 50 ... RxR; 51 RxRch, KxR because 52 K-R6! forces a new queen, so DeFirmian gave up.

He said the sinking was under investigation.

709-> About Men; The Comfort of Pals
RECENTLY, WHILE I WAS CON-valescing from an operation, Bert and Buddy, two old friends whom I rarely see because they live far away, visited me. I couldn't use the stairs, so my wife brought them up to my study and left us alone. For hours, we talked nonstop, pouring ourselves out for one another, drinking one another in, joyously celebrating the sacrament of friendship. Yet, after they left, I felt saddened; the visit had been only a fleeting revival of something precious that has been largely lost to me - intimate male friendship. I thought back to a summer night in Atlantic City when Bert and I, at 17, decided it would be a lark to sleep on the beach. At midnight, we sneaked onto a couple of beach chairs owned by a hotel, but, instead of going to sleep, we talked about life, love, the universe and ourselves until we saw the first pale wash of dawn. We not only understood each other but rejoiced in our similar reactions to the world. As the Oxford scholar C. S. Lewis once wrote, companionship blossoms into friendship when two people say to each other, in effect, ''What? You too? I thought I was the only one!'' I remembered, too, a time in my 40's, when my friend Norman and I went sailing on Long Island Sound in a 34-foot sloop. We'd known each other for years and considered each other friends, but during the five days of our cruise we became friends of another order. It wasn't just that we shared the many experiences of sailing through sun and storms, making landfalls and anchoring overnight in quiet coves. What mattered was that, bit by bit, we told each other about the unraveling of our marriages, confessed our guilt and dismay, traded fears and hopes about our futures and exchanged a thousand private thoughts until we were woven into each other's beings. Not for a long while have I had that kind of relationship with any man. Bernice, my second wife, a wife of 15 years, is my closest friend, my confidante, and my alter ego, the human being I most rely on and reveal myself to, and who does so in return. Our union leaves me no psychological space for intimacy with men friends; it would seem disloyal, an adultery of heart and mind, were I to share myself with a male friend as I did when I was single. When women didn't read or didn't work outside the home, a man had to go to the public square, coffeehouse, or club for friendship and understanding. He couldn't find them at home, for, as Tennyson pictures the ideal wife: Her faith is fixt and cannot move, She darkly feels him great and wise, She dwells on him with faithful eyes, ''I cannot understand; I love.'' But today, a marriage lacking in friendship is deemed a failure, and a wife who can love but not understand is likely to find herself in a no-fault divorce. I, happily, have a best friend in my wife, so why should I miss and yearn for the other kind of friendship? And I am not alone in doing so; from allusions my male friends make, I sense that many whose marriages are close and warm feel as I do. For in even the most intimate male-female relationship, something is lacking that is special to an intimate friendship between men - something about the way we communicate and respond to one another's communications. A man may explain to the woman in his life why at times he finds it necessary to do something daring or risky. Even if she doesn't consider it puerile machismo and seems to understand, the best she can do is sympathize with his need; a male friend would empathize with it - he'd share the feeling, not just understand it. Or a man may comment to a friend about a particularly pretty young woman passing by; the friend knows - because listening, he feels - the unuttered longing and regret beyond the actual words. If the man who makes the comment has an extraordinarily secure wife, he can make the remark to her, but the message will reach her via a kind of translation; she'll comprehend the overt meaning but miss the visceral subtext, for she never felt that way about a passing pretty woman. It's in the rare, odd moments when another man and I communicate on that level that I'm aware of what I miss. My dear friend Morrie and I both like to bake bread, and when my wife and I visit him and his wife or they us, he and I often discuss the joy of baking. We use the same words as when we speak to our wives about it, but he and I wordlessly convey to each other that we're not afraid to do something traditionally associated with housewifery and, indeed, take pleasure in the very anti-machismo of it. The way we look at each other and chuckle at such times reminds me of what it was like to have such fellowship in extenso. The friendship of a loving husband and wife can be wonderfully warm and deep; what it can't be is identical to the friendship of two men. But how could it be? Boys and girls have different sets of formative experiences, not only because of their dissimilar bodies but because the world treats them somewhat dissimilarly from their very first day. Even relatively nonsexist adults, according to research studies, tend to interpret a girl infant's howling as signifying unhappiness, a boy infant's as rage, and to act accordingly. And that's how things go from cradle to grave. Which is why it can be anywhere from pleasant to rapturous for a man to be with the woman he's closest to, but comfortable to be with a man he's close to, another human being who vibrates to the same frequencies, another him. I'm not denigrating or belittling married love, which, despite the fragility of contemporary marriage, can be far more complex, sharing and intimate than ever before. But it can't be everything to a man, and what it can't be is something I cherish and miss.

711-> ONE YEAR LATER, A SECOND CHANCE
They have seen the future, and the view has not always been pretty. As they approached the climax of an unprecedented month of buildup to a game that should produce an indisputable winner of the college football polls, the teams from the top-rated University of Miami and second-ranked Penn State had one extra day to consider the business of a trip that is worth $2.4 million to each school. The Hurricanes (11-0) and the Nittany Lions (11-0), the only undefeated teams in Division I-A of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, will compete in the Fiesta Bowl for a championship that is not officially recognized by the N.C.A.A. and yet has ballooned into higher education's version of the Super Bowl. Season of Controversy At the end of another season of nationwide controversy involving accusations of academic abuses, outcries for reforms, the introduction of drug-testing for bowl-game participants and instances of misconduct by players, the Canes and Lions will meet in the desert dusk, surrounded by a sellout crowd at 70,021-seat Sun Devil Stadium in nearby Tempe. A prime-time audience for the national telecast on NBC, with the kickoff scheduled for 8:15 P.M. Eastern standard time, could grow as large as 70 million. And that audience will expect to see the determination of a championship of the nation's major colleges, and presumably - with the introduction of testing for 84 banned or restricted substances - of the drug-free football world. Beneath the emotional frenzy, which has contributed to name-calling, charges and denials this week, can be found the essence of this Fiesta Bowl, a 16-year-old event that did not exist when the outstanding Penn State teams of the late 1960's were omitted from the top of the news-agency polls. Bad Memories The matchup of two unbeaten independents, who could come together because they were not bound by agreements that send conference champions to specific games, provides a rare opportunity for two experienced, balanced and extraordinarily talented teams to erase the memory of humiliations they suffered simultaneously last New Year's night. Penn State, which was ranked No. 1 going into the Orange Bowl, committed uncharacteristic breakdowns in a 25-10 loss to Oklahoma. John Shaffer, the unspectacular but nearly always efficient quarterback, threw three interceptions that contributed to the undoing of a defensive effort that had created serious problems for the Sooners. ''We walked off that field feeling we were better physically than Oklahoma,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''We didn't play well. We kicked the ball around. We felt there were a couple of points when we had Oklahoma hanging on. I think that game has had a tremendous bearing on the attitude of this squad.'' The nature of the loss turned the 1986 season into a continuation of the process. And while Miami's experience at the Sugar Bowl was more shocking, the 35-7 loss to Tennessee that ended any Miami hope of a top ranking last year led to a determined approach to the season that ends Friday evening.

713-> U.S. Is Still Excluding People for Their Beliefs
To the Editor: To Jerome Ogden, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for visa services, ideological exclusion of aliens is ''a myth'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 10). He contends that the United States does not keep people out of this country on ''ideological grounds,'' such as their membership in a Communist party, but bars only actual spies and terrorists. Those who call for the repeal of the McCarran-Walter Act by citing such instances, Mr. Ogden argues, are simply keeping alive a myth that no longer reflects the reality of United States policy. Mr. Ogden should meet Margaret Randall. Nobody would like better to find that ideological exclusion is a myth than Margaret Randall. Nobody knows better than she that it is not a myth. On Aug. 28, 1986, Ms. Randall, author of many books on women in Latin America and a professor at the University of New Mexico, was ordered to leave the United States for a single reason - an immigration judge had concluded that her writings ''advocate the economic, international and governmental doctrines of world communism.'' Although Ms. Randall was born in the United States, the Government considers her an alien because, while living in Mexico in 1956, she took out Mexican citizenship to be able to find work and support her three young children. The Government has moved to deport her, and in defense, Ms. Randall has applied, as an alien, for permanent-resident alien status. The statutory basis for the immigration judge's denial of Ms. Randall's request is found in the very McCarran-Walter Act whose enforcement Mr. Ogden labels mythical. This particular ground, which looks solely to advocacy of ideas, is perhaps the most purely ideological of all the statutory grounds for exclusion, yet according to the immigration judge, it is the only ground upon which Ms. Randall is excludable. She is not a terrorist, a spy, not even a Communist -she has simply written books that a judge believes advocate ''world communism,'' whatever that means. For that reason alone, the United States has told Ms. Randall that she must leave the United States, leaving behind her job at the university, her elderly parents (who live next door in Albuquerque), her home (built for her by her father) and her 18-year-old daughter (who lives with her). It is true that Ms. Randall was not actually denied a visa to visit this country. The McCarran-Walter Act, as amended by Senator George McGovern in 1977, doesn't allow that treatment any longer for someone who merely advocates ''world communism.'' But the Reagan Administration has found a loophole in the McGovern Amendment that allows it to force those who allegedly advocate such views to leave once they're here, and it is pressing this fervently in the Randall deportation case. The only thing mythical about Margaret Randall's deportation is the vision of Communism upon which it is based - as something so evil and dangerous that those who are adjudged merely to have advocated it should be expelled from our midst. Mr. Ogden would do well to acquaint himself with the reality of Margaret Randall's case and with the continuing reality of ideological exclusion in this country. That reality will not become the myth Mr. Ogden claims it is until the McCarran-Walter Act is repealed. DAVID COLE New York, Jan. 13, 1987 The writer is a staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents Margaret Randall.

715-> BEAUTY; ENHANCING BLACK SKIN
WITH BLACK MODELS among the stars of the fashion industry, and with the proliferation of skin-care and makeup lines for black consumers, the 1960's slogan ''black is beautiful'' is finally reaching commercial fulfillment. As Susan L. Taylor, the editor in chief of Essence magazine, explains: ''Black skin is such an incredible canvas. White against black skin is startling. The primary colors against black skin delight the eye. But what's exquisite about the black race is that it has every representation of humankind, from pale alabaster skin to cafe au lait to ebony.'' Black skin also has the physiological advantage of resisting sun damage. This protection comes from minute packages of pigment, or melanin, that are larger in black skin than in white. Because these granules act as a natural sunscreen, black skin develops fewer wrinkles than white skin as it ages. However, black skin, like white skin, has special care requirements. Accordingly, several small, new companies have come up with skin-care products designed specifically for nonwhites. Patricia French, the black owner of Gazelle International, introduced her collection in Paris last September. The products are expected to reach New York stores by April. Naomi Sims, the former model who has written books on skin and hair care for black women, is coming out with a line of skin-care products under her own name this spring. Although some black people, including dermatologists, contend that such specialized products may be unnecessary, others, like Coco Mitchell, who models for the Ford agency, says that black women ''have skin that shows bruises very easily. Ashiness is something that happens to our skin. I think on the whole, it is true that black skin is oily.'' Most dermatologists believe that black skin is no oilier than white skin, but that oil is more visible against a dark background. Dr. Carmen Myrie Williams, an associate professor of dermatology and pathology at George Washington University, says, ''The tendency to have oily or dry skin is pretty much genetic and equal among the races.'' Dr. Linda J. Higginbotham, a staff physician in the department of dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, believes otherwise. She says oil glands in black skin like hers seem to be more active than those in white skin. When dead cells build up on the skin, the dull finish that results is especially visible on black skin. The removal of the dead cells, a process dermatologists call exfoliation, may relieve the problem. Dr. Higginbotham recommends using a toner or astringent, or a clay mask to peel away dead skin cells. Skin is left with what she calls a ''glow.'' Regular exfoliating and moisturizing can also prevent the ashy film that tends to cover dry black skin, says Dr. Higginbotham. ''Too many people apply grease directly on the ashy area and run into other problems, such as acne.'' To clear away ashy spots, Dr. Higginbotham advises first swabbing the face with an astringent and scrubbing the body with a loofah sponge or Buf-Puf, then applying an oil-free moisturizer. But there is a downside to using exfoliators. ''They can cause more harm than good if you overdo it,'' says Dr. Higginbotham. ''If skin is overdried, it can become inflamed. Sometimes it repairs normally and sometimes it heals with a dark patch. You run that risk.'' Skin-care people disagree on the subject. Miss Sims, the former model, says the risk is too great and doesn't use exfoliating products at all. As to the oiliness of black skin, she says the problem ''is related to the old Aunt Jemima myth. The most derogatory look for a black woman is a heavy, shiny face. It's a negative thing, a class thing. That myth does a lot of damage to black skin. Black women believe that and use harsh chemicals on their skin to compensate.'' Many women, black or white, are sensitive to some ingredients in cosmetics, but the consequences of an allergic reaction can be especially troublesome for blacks. As a result of irritation, black skin can change color, and the damage can be permanent. To play it safe, Dr. Higginbotham recommends hypoallergenic, fragrance-free skin-care and makeup products to her black patients. A line of Fashion Fair products, for instance, and the makeup and skin-care products devised by Jamaican-born Juin Rachele, are fragrant free and allergy tested. Exposure to the sun, breakouts and hormonal imbalance can also produce dark patches or a rash that can cause light spots on the face and body and may require a dermatologist's attention. Chloasma - a condition that shows up as a dark mask on the forehead, bridge of the nose, around the mouth and temples - may fade slightly over time. Dermatologists can hasten the process with bleaching creams containing hydroquinone. Using a bleaching cream, however, can be risky. ''There are some people who have allergic or irritant reactions to them,'' Dr. Williams says. ''If the cream is too strong, it can overcorrect, leaving the area too light.'' Medical explanations aside, pure economics favors the success of a cosmetics line for black skin. ''Blacks tend to have a higher per-capita spending on beauty items than whites,'' says Diana K. Temple, a vice president of Salomon Brothers. ''Anyone who does it correctly could have a great success'' with products for black skin, says Allan G. Mottus, an industry consultant. However, Revlon discontinued its Polished Ambers collection, a line of makeup and skin-care products for black women, in 1982. Mr. Mottus believes that marketing problems caused the line's demise. Today, he says, Revlon's broad range of color cosmetics sell well to black, white and Hispanic customers. One reason black women are being asked to support black skin-care products has to do with more than cosmetics. The American Health and Beauty Aids Institute, a trade association of 21 black-owned companies, plans to spend $3 million this year on a promotional campaign that encourages black consumers to buy products made by black-owned companies. Since its inception in 1981, the institute has represented manufacturers of cosmetic and hair- and skin-care products. Bethann Hardison, owner and president of Bethann Management Inc., a model agency in Manhattan, says the specialized products make ''black people believe that someone is thinking about us. And it puts money back into the black community.''

716-> SCOUTING; Faculty Calls Foul on Knight
Bob Knight has a temper, and as one who sets high standards for his Indiana University players (and even higher standards for referees), he has frequent occasions to lose it. That, coupled with a coaching style that might best be described as leadership through intimidation, has helped him mold winning basketball teams. It has also made him a bit of a pariah to some faculty members. Now, after more than a year of study, the Indiana faculty council is moving to mend Knight's ways. By an 18-16 vote earlier this week, the council adopted a statement of student-athlete's rights that seems as much a code of coaching conduct - and one aimed directly at Knight. ''Just as students lose no citizenship rights in joining the university,'' the statement begins, ''athletes forfeit no student rights in joining their teams. Athletes shall not be subjected to physically or verbally abusive, intimidating, coercive, humiliating or degrading behavior. The student-athlete is entitled to be treated with the same dignity, respect and civility to which all members of the academic community are entitled.'' After the vote, a number of professors cited various cases of what they called Indiana coaches' abuse of athletes. But Knight, described by some council members as a ''flagrant offender'' who subjects his athletes to public ''humiliation of the worst kind,'' was the only coach whom any of them named. ''I see no evidence that anyone has ever attempted to discipline Bob Knight's behavior, and that's the reason we need a resolution like this,'' said Elmus Wicker, a professor of economics. Some faculty members, to be sure, defended Knight, scoffing at the need for the resolution. ''A student who joins an athletic team, especially a Bob Knight team, has a good idea what he is getting into,'' said Kurt Zorn, a professor of public and environmental affairs. Knight himself had no immediate response, printable or otherwise. But as even his severest critic, Professor Wicker, seemed to acknowledge, he had at least one reason to be unfazed by a statement that urges abused athletes to report ''any violations of these policies.'' ''Isn't it a bit naive,'' Wicker said, ''to think that one of Bob Knight's basketball athletes, who are carefully trained to accept humiliation, will bring a complaint that will jeopardize their playing time?''

718-> NEW YORKERS ENDURE A DAY WHOSE BYWORD WAS 'IMPOSSIBLE'
Even Donald J. Trump couldn't fix the Wollman Rink yesterday. The skating oval was still open at midafternoon, with its manager insisting that the ice was relatively clear and the day positively romantic. But two stalwart women skating through the gathering drifts knew better. ''It's impossible,'' said one of them, as a Zamboni and a snow blower circled the rink in an increasingly pointless ritual. ''Just impossible.'' ''Impossible'' seemed the prevailing word yesterday for New Yorkers, who faced their first major winter storm of the season, with blinding swirls of snow, gusting winds and the occasional crack of lightning and rumble of thunder. Icy Ruts The day was punctuated with the scrape of snow shovels on sidewalks and the whine of automobile tires caught in icy ruts. This was a storm that at its blustery peak shut midtown Manhattan offices, forced the closing of airports and produced long lines at grocery stores as people stocked up for a long siege indoors. It was also a storm that the wise and the wary watched through their windows, leaving parks and playgrounds nearly empty and silent, with benches, lampposts and waste cans sculpted in white. Like the Zamboni operator at the Wollman Rink, sanitation workers driving plows and maintenance men pushing shovels could not keep up with the steadily falling snow. ''As fast as we clear it away, it's back,'' said Alfred DiCanio, a sanitation worker at the Gansevoort Street garage in Lower Manhattan, where a fleet of plows and a squadron of drivers took turns battling the snowfall. ''You loop around the block and come back and it's already dusted.'' 'Shovel and Salt' A similar sense of powerlessness bent Pat O'Donnell's shoulders as lunchtime came and went and he kept shoveling the sidewalk in front of a building on the Avenue of the Americas. ''Shovel and salt, shovel and salt,'' was Mr. O'Donnell's weary mantra. Hard at work, too, was Helen Castro, the manager of Kraus Hardware Store at 93d Street and Second Avenue. ''Shovels have been going out like mad,'' she said. Some requests at the hardware store were less conventional, like the one from a French tourist who was seeking foul-weather gear for her little daughter. George Bell, an employee, thought for a moment, disappeared into the storeroom and reappeared with large garbage bags. Three holes later, mother and child were back on the street, gamboling through the snow. For children, some freed from school early and others comtemplating a day off today, such weather is pure pleasure, a time for snowmen and Flexible Flyers, for hot cocoa and grilled cheese sandwiches. Cheering Children At the Nellie K. Parker Elementary School in Hackensack, N.J., youngsters cheered the annoucement that their day would end at 1 P.M. And, at the Reese School in Manhattan, on 93d Street between Second and Third Avenues, teachers said students were ''excited all during their day.'' ''This feels like fake snow,'' a boy named Joey said, holding out a gloved hand to catch the evanascent flakes as he left the school building. ''Believe me, Joey, it's not,'' said Lisa Van Roelke, an assistant teacher who shoveled because she misses the snow of her native Iowa. Grown-ups, too, got unexpected time off as many offices throughout the metropolitan region closed early. Hours before the normal rush, buses and subway trains were jammed with homeward-bound commuters. ''If we get home by 5, we'll be lucky,'' grumbled a secretary. She waited on the Avenue of the Americas for an express bus to Queens along with more than 50 other people, all shivering under umbrellas and wiping stinging flakes from their faces. On a midtown subway platform nearby, a businessman studied the N.J. Transit timetable, seeking an unfamiliar afternoon departure. ''Locals, all locals,'' he muttered, grateful that he was not a strike-stranded Long Island commuter. Then there were those special few who made it to work only to discover that work had been canceled. New Jersey Assemblyman Joseph V. Doria was one of those, leaving his Bayonne home at 10:30 A.M., slip-sliding past jack-knifed trailers and disabled cars along Route 1 and arriving at the State Capitol at 2:30 P.M. - an hour after the legislative session had been adjourned. For hotel operators, a snowstorm on top of a railroad strike is a bonanza. Typical was the Warwick, at 54th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, with its 500 rooms full and a steady stream of departing travelers returning when they found their flights grounded. At midafternoon, the hotel's general manager, Robert Jaeger, said he had accommodated a half-dozen such guests and figured he would have room for about a dozen more. In the lobby, where the potted palms seemed positively tropical, Mr. Jaeger commiserated with guests who had packed a few short hours ago and now were faced with unpacking. ''Ah, well, that's weather,'' he said. ''We can't change it. The most we can do is talk about it.''

719-> FILM: EUSTACHE'S 'PETITES AMOUREUSES'
IN many ways ''Mes Petites Amoureuses,'' Jean Eustache's 1974 French film opening today at the Public, looks as if it had been meant to answer anyone who'd been less than enchanted by the director's ''Mother and the Whore,'' one of the more antagonizing films presented at the 1973 New York Film Festival. ''The Mother and the Whore'' is a long (3 hours and 35 minutes), humorless contemplation of the relations between men and women as primarily revealed in extended exchanges of pithy, aphoristic dialogue spoken by Jean-Pierre Leaud, Bernadette Lafont and Francoise Lebrun. ''Mes Petites Amoureuses'' is something else - a short (less than two hours), almost taciturn film that wears a smile (though a sad one) behind the impassive expression of Daniel, its adolescent hero. Daniel, played by Martin Loeb with stern diffidence, is a slightly younger first cousin to Francois Truffaut's Antoine Doinel. He's the way Antoine might have been when Antoine was somewhere between ''The 400 Blows'' and ''Love at 20.'' Daniel isn't exactly unwanted, but he's nobody's principal concern. He's also a vast reservoir of unexpressed feelings. He spends his time being shuttled between a Paris suburb, where he lives with his loving but preoccupied grandmother, and a small town in southwestern France, where he shares a tiny apartment with his mother and her Spanish lover. Traveling from one home to the other, Daniel carries a small suitcase that looks as if it were made out of cardboard and contained only a change of socks. ''Mes Petites Amoureuses'' would initially seem to owe an unconscionable amount of its inspiration to the Truffaut films. Daniel's mother (Ingrid Caven) behaves decently as long as Daniel doesn't make demands that come between her and her lover, who, in turn, isn't unkind to the boy, but neither is he especially interested in him. Though Daniel loves school and its camaraderie, his economically pressed mother doesn't hesitate to force him to get a job instead. Like Antoine Doinel, Daniel is obsessed by sex, and much of ''Mes Petites Amoureuses'' is devoted to his confused responses to girls, including one wordless (though quite successful) encounter in a movie theater. As were so many films of the 60's and early 70's, ''Mes Petites Amoureuses'' is studded with movie references. Like ''Stolen Kisses,'' it even opens with the voice of Charles Trenet singing a romantic ballad on the soundtrack. However, Mr. Eustache's narrative method is quite different from Truffaut's in the Doinel cycle. It more closely resembles the Truffaut of ''Small Change.'' ''Mes Petites Amoureuses'' alternates between being anecdotal and simply a record of the observations of a very special sensibility. It's less like a piece of finished fiction than a series of terse, precisely worded entries in a notebook. This is both the style of the film and its charm. Mr. Eustache, who was widely respected in France, made one more feature, ''Une Sale Histoire'' (1978), and four shorts before his death in 1981 at the age of 43. SAD SMILE - MES PETITES AMOUREUSES, written and directed by Jean Eustache; in French with English subtitles; director of photography, Nestor Almendros; edited by Francoise Belleville, Alberto Yaccelini and Vincent Cottrell; music by Theodore Botrel; produced by Pierre Cottrell. At the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street. Running time: 110 minutes. This film has no rating. Mother...Ingrid Caven; Daniel...Martin Loeb; Girl...Jacqueline Dufranne; Client...Maurice Pialat; Jose...Dionys Mascolo; Boss...Pierre Edelman.

721-> FOSS TO OFFER NIETZSCHE COMPOSITION
Lukas Foss, that indefatigable exhumer of symphonic rarities, has done it again. This weekend, he will offer what is billed as the first United States performances of Friedrich Nietzsche's choral cantata ''Hymn to Life.'' Yes, the Nietzsche, the late-19th-century German who is best (if inaccurately) known for his philosophy of the Superman. As Lincoln Kirstein argued eloquently in a recent New Yorker article, Nietzsche's brilliant insights were twisted by his sister after his death, creating a false image of bullying bravado that pointed toward Nazism. The real Nietzsche was a philosopher of morals and esthetics. But he also played the piano and composed in his youth, he inspired later composers (Mahler, Strauss, Delius), and his complex relationship with Richard Wagner - first adoration, then fierce polemical opposition - helped set the stage for the post-Romantic reaction and the advent of Modernism. ''Hymn to Life'' is a seven-minute setting for chorus and orchestra of a poem by Lou Salome, better known by her subsequent married name of Lou Andreas-Salome. This remarkable woman became the romantic ideal of Nietzsche, Rilke, Freud, Strindberg, Hauptmann and Wedekind, who made her the model for his Lulu character, subsequently translated into Louise Brooks's most famous film portrayal and Berg's opera. She was no mere temptress; Nietzsche called her ''by far the most intelligent person I have ever met.'' Romantic Ecstatic Rhetoric The bulk of Nietzsche's compositional efforts were songs and other miniatures in his youth, between 1854 and 1874. He met the young Lou Salome in 1882, and shortly thereafter set her poem ''Hymnus an das Leben'' for chorus and wind ensemble; it was published in 1887 in a symphonic expansion by his friend Peter Gast, which is the version to be heard in Brooklyn. The poem is pure late Romantic ecstatic rhetoric, in which the speaker's self-abnegating commitment to ''life'' is expressed in terms of overheated personal passion. When Gast read the poem, according to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in his book ''Wagner and Nietzsche,'' he assumed Nietzsche himself had written it. Under Wagner's spell, Nietzsche could think of no other music, and his post-Wagnerian revulsion took the form of a clinging to all things light, balanced and Mediterranean, Bizet and ''Carmen'' being his favorites. His early compositions, however, reveal more of Schumann's influence than any other, and Mr. Foss said he feels the ''Hymn to Life'' falls between Schumann and early Wagner in style. ''My father was a professor of philosophy,'' the conductor (himself a composer) recalled the other day. ''I heard about Nietzsche when I was a child over the breakfast table, and I remember how my father said that in his youth, Nietzsche couldn't decide between being a composer, a poet and a philosopher. ''Later I learned he had sent an early composition called 'Nirvana' to Wagner, who told him it looked 'delightfully familiar,' which I thought wasn't very kind of Wagner. Maybe that discouraged Nietzsche from composing further. The Nietzsche archives had no record of 'Nirvana,' so we decided on 'Hymn to Life' instead.'' Other Rarities The Nietzsche premiere, and the way it fits in with the rest of this weekend's program, is but another example of Mr. Foss's ingenuity as a program builder. ''I realize I can't explore a lot of unfamiliar names in a subscription series, or we lose subscribers,'' he said ruefully. ''Subscription audiences want to see the great names. So my problem becomes, how can I still be adventurous and not be repetitive? So I just use my mind to find less familiar things by familiar names.'' This weekend's concerts, devoted to the general theme of German Romanticism, contain two other rarities. There will be the first New York performances of Anton Webern's early, Romantic ''Three Orchestral Studies on a Ground,'' which uses material heard in different form in the composer's Passacaglia (Op. 1). There will also be the conductor Felix Mottl's orchestral arrangement of a Beethoven song, ''Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur.'' The more familiar items on the bill will be Schumann's Piano Concerto, with Bella Davidovich as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. The Grace Choral Society of Brooklyn will sing in the Nietzsche cantata. The three performances of this program are at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 P.M. Tickets cost $20, $16 and $10, and are available at the academy box office or through Teletron, 947-5850. Information: (718) 636-4120.

722-> CONNECTICUT OPINION; PURSUIT OF CULTURE AT A YOUNG AGE
MY mother was born in a tough section of Chicago, near the Loop. To her, this was a nonpareil social blight. It had to be erased at all costs. My mother's solution took the form of a frantic, lifetime pursuit of culture as she understood it. Very early I learned about Mother's love of New England, particularly of my Boston-born father's cultured accent. This she carefully grafted onto her Chicago enunciation, creating a novel speech pattern that completely mystified our relatives and friends. All they could conclude was that it sounded very refined and quite unlike the speech of the people in Grand Rapids, Mich., where Father took Mother to live after their marriage. To be sure of raising the taste and manners of my brother and me, Mother took us every summer on high-toned educational tours of the Eastern Seaboard and Canada. These also served to kill time during the hot weather when Father was on the road, selling furniture in the Far West and Mexico. First we went to Washington, D.C. to visit Mother's oldest and dearest friend, Mary Agnes Chase; my godmother, an early feminist, suffragist and an agrostologist in the United States Department of Agriculture. She had her own office in the Smithsonian Institution, where she worked on an index of grasses of the entire world. I was allowed to march in many suffrage parades with her, holding my ''Votes for Women'' banner, but Mother put her foot down when Aunt Mary shackled herself to the White House gates during President Wilson's inauguration in 1913. Draped in yards of heavy chain and carrying a banner larger than herself denouncing ''Kaiser Wilson'' for his indifference to women's suffrage, Aunt Mary got her message in most of the daily newspapers and liberal magazines. Mother's culture patterns for my younger brother and me were not as prominent as Aunt Mary's civic appearances, but they were far more strenuous. We spent days, weeks in Washington visiting every free government display, every museum, every art exhibit, every government building open to visitors. We had to examine every state motto in every floor of the Washington Monument. Happily, Mother let us ride the elevator going up to the top. We discovered how money was printed, how legislation was introduced into Congress, where to stand to hear the whispers under the dome of the Capitol. We went to see the Mall, Mount Vernon, famous hotels, Ford's Theater, the Supreme Court in session, Arlington Cemetery - we missed nothing. Our young minds reeling, eyes bloodshot from too much looking and legs suffering from shin splints from walking all day on polished marble floors, my brother and I were like two lame colts put to traces too early. Happily, Mother's eagerness to have us embrace enlightenment in our young lives sometimes gave us a respite. She had a passion for ships and never took a train when she could take a boat, so at the end of the Washington visit, we embarked on a Potomac River boat. At Newport News, Va., we changed to a small ocean liner and sailed into New York Harbor, greeting the Statue of Liberty as enthusiastically as if we had just arrived from Europe. New York was noisy and frightening for Mother. We took quiet boats as much as possible for sightseeing, to Bedloes Island where we climbed into the torch of the Statue of Liberty, to Coney Island with its wonderful, scary roller-coaster rides. At Ellis Island the arriving immigrants seemed to me a special exhibit for the many sightseers. We stood in a group on the sidelines and watched the day's quota of frightened, bewildered, often weeping newcomers to the country. One girl of about my age was crying and screaming, calling out to an older woman who was being taken out of her sight, perhaps to be returned to her native land. Our last boat trip in New York, planned for Staten Island, finished Mother with the city forever. A notorious New York police officer, Lieut. Charles Becker, was accused of protecting illegal gambling houses and implicated in the murder of a well-publicized gambler, Herman Rosenthal. It was rumored that Lieutenant Becker was attempting to flee Manhattan by boat, dressed as a woman. Hence, all women boarding all outgoing ferryboats were frisked, not subtly in private by females, but right there on the spot by policemen. My brother and I, worn out with sightseeing, felt a secret delight as we watched our straitlaced mother gone over quite roughly and thoroughly. How anyone could imagine she was a man disguised as a woman astonished us. She had an ample, tightly corsetted figure and an expression of self-respect and dignity that no man could imitate. She was the essence of feminity. Her horror and shock at being roughly handled brought equal horror and shock to us with that undertone of delight. We suppressed our feelings as the police patted Mother's ample bosom to be sure it was real, and frisked every inch of her body for hidden weapons. We left New York shortly after that incident, and dropped it from future culture tours. Mother said it was not only too noisy and filthy, but dangerous. Also, the Y.W.C.A.s were increasingly unpleasant about accepting my tall, 10-year-old brother for overnight lodging. Bill was delighted; he hated staying at the ladies' Y. I didn't mind losing New York. Mother made us wash off the New York filth after each sortie from the Y, and would nott let us handle germ-laden Manhattan money. The constant baths were the worst; first we were scrubbed by Mother, who did not think we were capable of removing all the vicious dirt and germs without her help. Then, after the hot bath or shower, she doused us with ice-cold water to close our pores. Dire things would happen if we ventured out, even in the heat of summer, before our pores were safely closed. The ride from New York to Boston on a good-sized ship was delightful and Boston was Mother's favorite stop. Everyone there spoke with her favorite accent. I don't recall the Bostonian reaction to her speech, or whether she toned it down in the face of so many originals. I do know we stayed with Father's oldest brother, Henry, who took a dim view of females. He had three ''old maid'' daughters and I soon learned that women far outnumbered men in Boston, and that the safe thing for a young woman to do was accept the first offer of marriage made to her. She might never have another opportunity. One of my female cousins suffered from crippling asthma, another had a disease called St. Vitus's dance, and the third committed suicide before she was 30. Uncle Henry's only son graduated from Dartmouth College, married, had three children and led a normal, happy life. Boston was 100 percent culture, and Mother took us endlessly through museums, ancient buildings, cemeteries until we could not take any more. It was the end, and from there we would board a train for home, since Mother could not figure out how to get from Boston to Grand Rapids by boat, although she often said it might have been maneuvered through the Great Lakes. To be fair to Mother, the trips were not too bad. We learned how to order restaurant meals, how much to tip, how to buy railroad and boat tickets, to receive the correct change in all transactions, to spot where our luggage was being checked so we could always find it if the lights went out. They did go out once in Quebec. I was sent for our suitcases in the dark, and we were the only family who caught the train that furious crowds at the checkroom had hoped to catch. My parents would be relieved to know that I am happily settled in the cultured town of Ridgefield, in a 1730 house, authentically restored by the famous architect, Cass Gilbert. Also, they would be happy to know I am still with the compatible husband I managed to snare, despite the ratio against me, 56 years ago. Mother might be disappointed to discover that no one ever mistakes me for a Bostonian or the daughter of one, and that it isn't difficult for anyone to realize I was born and grew up in the Middle West. Perhaps I should have studied her speech patterns more carefully.

724-> COMPETITION IS DEAD, LONG LIVE COMPETITION
THE BIGNESS COMPLEX Industry, Labor, and Government in the American Economy. By Walter Adams and James W. Brock. 426 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $22.95. AFTER six years of the most probusiness Administration since that of Calvin Coolidge, at the beginning of a fifth year of general growth, the American economy remains troubled. Many consumers prefer foreign to domestic products. We buy more food and food products from other countries than our farmers sell to them. In 1986, we even suffered an adverse trade balance in high technology. Gains in productivity have been disappointingly small. Large numbers of blue-collar workers and middle managers have lost jobs. Their colleagues have frequently been compelled to accept wage or salary cuts. Unemployment sticks at 7 percent, a figure that as recently as the 1960's spelled economic and political crisis. Walter Adams, a former president of Michigan State University and now a Distinguished University Professor of Economics there, is a veteran student of industrial organization and an unabashed advocate of vigorous antitrust enforcement, and James W. Brock is an associate professor of economics at Miami University in Ohio. In ''The Bigness Complex,'' they offer an entirely plausible explanation of poor American performance. The authors locate our troubles in the decline of competition. Theirs is an angry brief against the cult of size. They present evidence that obese conglomerates like International Telephone and Telegraph and Gulf and Western Industries are appallingly bureaucratic and incompetent, more apt to stifle competition than to fund research and development and improve efficiency. Gigantic organizations make gigantic mistakes. In 1952, United States Steel, now U.S.X., wasted $500 million on an open-hearth plant just as Japanese and European rivals were shifting to far more efficient oxygen furnaces. The Pentagon's addiction to negotiated contracts with General Dynamics, McDonnell-Douglas and a handful of other huge enterprises has generated routine cost overruns, defective weapons - and enormous profits for incompetent managers. General Motors, which acquired H. Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems and Mr. Perot with it, paid him $743 million to go away and stop criticizing G.M. management. The Reagan Administration receives its lumps here, in particular for its indulgent positions on antitrust. Taking its cue from William F. Baxter, President Reagan's first chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, the department has looked benignly on almost every merger and acquisition deal thriving souls like T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn could invent and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. could finance with junk bonds. Economic theory emanating from the University of Chicago, the fount from which Mr. Baxter drank, asserts that the omniscient market rearranges assets so as to generate greater value for stockholders and enhanced choice at lower prices for consumers. As the authors demonstrate, the empirical record devastatingly refutes these claims. In their entertainingly combative style, the authors assault cozy union-management arrangements designed to raise wages and prices, John Kenneth Galbraith's notion of countervailing power (unions checking management and buyers restraining sellers), neoliberal industrial policy intended in mistaken imitation of Japanese practice to guide investment into winning activities and ideologues of deregulation who aspire to eliminate consumer protection against dangerous drugs and environmental hazards. Social regulation is a good thing. Consumers lack knowledge of drugs, and they are helpless to shield themselves from contaminated water and toxic air. By sabotaging social regulation, the Reagan Administration has added to its list of dangerous achievements. Jammed as it is with information, this is a lively book, written in the plain, direct English commanded by few economists and social scientists. The cure for American economic ailments is more competition. Rarely have the merits of the therapy been more persuasively demonstrated. For me, a single caveat is in order. The authors prove time and again, as in the Lockheed, Chrysler and Continental Bank bailouts, how powerful anticompetitive coalitions are. Large size has become an almost perfect protection against the failures of management. I would add to the authors' recommendations the absolute necessity of full-employment policies. Only with high employment will it be possible to resist union, management, community and political pressures to protect uncompetitive industries and rescue mismanaged corporations.

725-> Market Place; Stock Analysts Raising Sights
SOME technical analysts - those professionals who study investor sentiment and the internal workings of the stock market - believe that equity prices, despite yesterday's explosive action, are headed still higher. ''The market at this juncture is topless,'' declared Robert J. Nurock of Paoli, Pa., author of The Astute Investor, an investment advisory publication. ''That's what my sentiment indicators are saying.'' Andrew L. Addison, who publishes The Addison Report in Quincy, Mass., commented: ''The market is telling me to expect more surprises on the upside. As recently as 10 days ago, my target was for the Dow industrials to hit 2,400 before year-end. I just raised my target to 2,500.'' ''Bottom line, we're going higher,'' said Edward P. Nicoski, chief technical analyst for Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ''There still exists a lot of nonbelief by investors in this market and, on a sentiment basis, that is a constructive sign. Short-term, the Dow ought to get to 2,200. Beyond that I don't have a forecast.'' Yesterday, in another giant leap forward, the blue-chip Dow advanced 51.60 points, finishing at a new high of 2,145.67. It has set record closings in 12 of the last 13 sessions and, so far this year, has amassed a gain of some 250 points. Ordinarily, such a strong advance compressed within a short span is a signal for at least a temporary setback, said Ralph J. Acampora, technical analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''It is possible you could get a crack in the market at these levels,'' he said. ''However, I lean toward an alternate scenario, whereby stock prices will waffle, or consolidate their gains, in coming weeks.'' For the short term, he envisages a ''trading range'' that fluctuates roughly between 2,050 and 2,150. The upper end of this range was almost reached yesterday. ''My ultimate target for this year,'' the analyst said, ''is between 2,300 and 2,400.'' In a study of stock charts, Mr. Acampora sees some issues ''poised for breakouts,'' or higher prices. In his view, these include Bausch & Lomb, the CSX Corporation and the seven regional Bell telephone operating companies. Technical analysts may scrutinize much of the same data, but just like fundamental market analysts who concentrate on business trends and prospects for individual companies, they often disagree in their findings. Just this week, one of Wall Street's best-known technical analysts sounded anew his warning that the market is vulnerable to a sharp decline. John A. Mendelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. first predicted in July that the Dow could drop by 15 percent or more from its high. He has been advising clients to stay in cash, rather than in stocks. In Paoli, Pa., Mr. Nurock depends upon a set of proprietary sentiment indicators to gauge market movements over the next two or three weeks. ''These short-term indicators are based on changes in trading patterns of stock-index options and, at this juncture, all of them are neutral,'' he said. ''I regard that as positive, because these indicators reflect investor caution and skepticism about the durability of this rally.'' Mr. Nurock maintains a model portfolio and he said that, at present levels, he regards as attractive such stocks as AMP Inc., Frequency Electronics, Giant Group, Polaroid and Russ Berrie. Despite the optimism of many technical analysts, one sentiment indicator that is geared to the market's longer-term action has just turned negative. Investors Intelligence, a stock market service based in New Rochelle, N.Y., tracks some 135 investment newsletters in order to gauge the sentiment of these advisers. ''Using these letters as a contrary indicator, we have just seen our first negative sentiment reading since last May,'' said Michael Burke, editor of Investors Intelligence. ''Bullish market letters have climbed to 62.9 percent of the total, while bearish letters dropped to 12.9 percent. The remaining 24.2 percent are looking for a correction in stock prices.'' A bullish reading above 53 percent, combined with a bearish reading below 20 percent, translates into a negative for stock prices, according to Mr. Burke. ''However, this indicator does not turn on a dime and a situation can persist for quite a while,'' he said. ''We got our extreme number of bears in April 1982 and the bull market did not begin until August of that year.'' In addition to various sentiment indicators, technical analysts also study momentum indicators, such as the ratio of new 52-week highs to new lows and the breadth of the market - or the number of advancing stocks to declining issues. ''On a weekly basis, this advance-decline line has been making new highs, and I regard that as bullish,'' said Mr. Addison in Quincy, Mass. ''Another favorable momentum indicator is that trading volume has expanded on days when the market rose and contracted during sessions when stock prices declined.''

726-> SPORTS PEOPLE; SENIOR BOWL CHANGES
In light of the dismissal Thursday of Coach John Mackovic by the Kansas City Chiefs, officials of the Senior Bowl football game at Mobile, Ala., announced yesterday a change of coaching assignments for the game among graduating seniors to be played next Saturday. Mackovic had been scheduled to coach the North all-star team against a South squad coached by John Robinson of the Los Angeles Rams. But Robinson has now agreed to coach the North so that Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins could be in the charge of the South team. That squad includes 10 players from the University of Alabama, one being Shula's son, Mike, a quarterback.

727-> BASEBALL NOTEBOOK; HAYES SAYS PHILS ARE SET TO CHALLENGE
IF the Philadelphia Phillies want a precedent, they need look back only three years. The Kansas City Royals finished the 1983 season in second place, 20 games behind the Chicago White Sox, then won the American League West championship the following season. The Phillies finished last season 21 1/2 games behind the Mets and know they need something more than a pogo stick to catapult them past the World Series champions. They need all the help they can get, especially in terms of productive players, present or still unaccounted for, but Von Hayes, one of the most productive players in the league last season, believes they helped themselves even before they reached the off-season. ''During the second half of last season, we built for this year,'' Hayes said. ''We felt we were one of the best teams in baseball in the second half. We'll have a positive attitude going into the year. It won't be as frightening as it would've been if we hadn't had the kind of second half we did.'' By the All-Star Game break, the Phillies already were 17 1/2 games behind the Mets. But more than five weeks later, they had lost only one more game in the standing while they had gained one place, from third to second. They completed the post-All-Star Game part of the schedule with a 44-32 record, second best in the division to the Mets' 49-29. Hayes rejected the idea that the Phillies played so well because they had no pressure on them. ''I think it's tougher to play when you're not in the pennant race,'' the 6-foot-5-inch first baseman said. ''It's even tougher when you're thinking about a contract for next year. It's harder to blank that out and keep playing. It's easier to blank out financial things when you're on a contending club. You're always thinking about the games and the race.'' Whatever thoughts Hayes might have had about his financial future, he kept them from interfering with his on-field duties and emerged from the season with a statistical record exceeded only by his teammate and noted slugger, Mike Schmidt. Hayes led the league in run production (runs plus runs batted in minus home runs), with 186, tied for first in runs scored (107), tied for fourth in total bases (293) and was fifth in runs batted in (98), sixth in batting average (.305), sixth in on-base average (.379) and seventh in slugging percentage (.480). His financial reward: a three-year contract for $1.3 million a year (he earned $650,000 last season). He hopes he will reap further reward this year in the form of a division championship, but there is that matter of a 21 1/2-game distance the Phillies have to travel. ''We're hoping the Mets might have a lot of mental problems, like a lot of teams have after they win,'' Hayes said. ''Last year everything fell into place for them. The chemistry was there. All we can hope for is the chemistry to change a little. We feel we have a good enough team to go up against them.'' The Phillies will get even better if they sign Lance Parrish, the good-hitting free-agent catcher in whom they have expressed interest. Coming Attractions By signing for three years, Hayes relinquished his right to be a free agent after next season, perhaps a wise decision considering the shaky state of the free-agent market. However, the roster of prospective free agents following the 1987 season still provides a veritable all-star team: 1b, Jack Clark, St. Louis; 2b, Lou Whitaker, Detroit; ss, Cal Ripken Jr., Baltimore; 3b, Mike Schmidt, Philadelphia; Wade Boggs, Boston; Gary Gaetti, Minnesota; of, Jesse Barfield, Toronto; Dale Murphy, Atlanta; Chili Davis, San Francisco; c, Tony Pena, Pittsburgh; starting pitchers, Jack Morris and Dan Petry, Detroit; John Candelaria and Mike Witt, California; Joaquin Andujar, Oakland; Mike Krukow, San Francisco; Bruce Hurst, Boston; relievers, Dave Righetti, Yankees; Dave Smith, Houston; Greg Minton, San Francisco. Any of those players could remove himself from the list by signing a new contract that would take him past this year. At least some of the players on the list will most likely do that. Morris can be a free agent for the second straight year because he accepted the Tigers' arbitration offer. Under the rules, that meant he had not been a free agent the first time. Some players could be free agents if their teams don't exercise options in their contracts for 1988. That group includes Bob Ojeda and Jesse Orosco of the Mets, Nolan Ryan of Houston, Hubie Brooks and Tim Wallach of Montreal, Ken Griffey of Atlanta, Bert Blyleven of Minnesota, Richard Dotson of the Chicago White Sox and Shane Rawley of Philadelphia. Ron Hassey is in that category, which means that if the White Sox don't exercise the option he could join the Yankees again - that is, if they haven't already traded for him. Taking Their Cuts Only once in the 11-year history of salary arbitration has a player emerged from a hearing with a cut in pay. That happened to Aurelio Lopez, then with Detroit, in 1983, when he was slashed from $285,000 to $250,000 after asking for $315,000. Lopez could gain company this year. Of the five players who, with their clubs, have submitted salary figures for their hearings (if the cases reach that point), two face lower salaries in 1987 if they lose. The Atlanta Braves have put in a $340,000 salary for Terry Harper, which represents the maximum 20 percent cut from his 1986 salary of $425,000, and the Oakland A's have gone in at $250,000 for Chris Codiroli, who earned $270,000 last season. Harper has asked for $475,000, Codiroli $325,000. Based on the clubs' pattern in salary offers, more cuts are expected when figures are submitted tomorrow for the other players in arbitration. Past the Deadline Apparently, not all players will have their salary figures submitted tomorrow. The clients of Richard Moss will wait until Tuesday, Moss said, even though the deadline is tomorrow. ''Monday is a national holiday, Martin Luther King Day,'' Moss said. ''Especially in this year that Commissioner Peter Ueberroth has asked to be dedicated to the memory of Jackie Robinson, I think it is unseemly that this holiday be ignored. If there are persons who want to penalize me or my clients because of that belief, just let them try.'' No Time for Hearings Steve Crawford will not have his salary slashed. The Boston relief pitcher is believed to be the only player ever to file for arbitration five times. He also has settled five times without waiting for a hearing, the most recent time last Friday, only 24 hours after he filed. His negotiated salary, in the years he has placed his name on the arbitration list, has gone from $35,000 (in the minors in 1983) to $50,000 to $125,000 to $330,000 to an amount just shy of $400,000 for next season. Most curious new salary: The Pittsburgh Pirates raised Bob Walk's salary from $175,000 to $285,000 after he compiled a 7-8 record and a 3.75 earned run average. His salary now is higher than that of Jim Morrison, who led the team with 23 home runs and 88 runs batted in and had the sixth-highest slugging percentage in the league. Morrison, under a contract he signed in 1982, will have a salary of $277,500. He also can earn $60,000 in bonuses based on weight and number of games played. Recount Needed Jim (Catfish) Hunter farms peanuts in Hertford, N.C. Dave McNally sells cars in Billings, Mont. Hunter is in the Hall of Fame. McNally no longer is on the ballot for the Hall. Hunter received 315 votes in this year's ballotting. McNally received a total of 29 votes in the four years he was on the ballot. The voters, 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, approach their task in a curious manner. There are those people who will argue that Hunter belongs in the Hall of Fame and those who will argue he does not. Whether he does or doesn't, though, he didn't warrant, based on their career records, such a wide margin over McNally, who was the victim of apparent ignorance among the electorate. Hunter pitched 15 full seasons, McNally 12. Hunter won 224 games, McNally 184. That is the only clear-cut advantage Hunter had over McNally. McNally, who pitched for mostly good Baltimore teams, had a .607 winning percentage and a 3.24 earned run average to .574 and 3.26 for Hunter. McNally permitted 10.92 baserunners and struck out 4.99 batters per nine innings; Hunter's ratios were 10.21 and 5.25. McNally completed 30 percent of his starts and pitched a shutout every 12 starts; Hunter completed 38 percent of his starts and pitched a shutout every 11.3 starts. In 8 of his 12 full seasons (67 percent), McNally had a better winning percentage than his team had in games he did not win or lose. Hunter had a better winning percentage than his team in 9 of 15 seasons (60 percent). Hunter gained the Hall on the strength of five successive 20-victory seasons, in which he had a 111-49 record, a .694 percentage. In his other seasons, he had a 113-117 record, a .491 (or losing) percentage. McNally had four consecutive 20-victory seasons for an 87-31 record (.737). In his other years, he had a 97-88 record (.524). One additional 20-victory season, in the minds of some voters, might be enough to vote in one pitcher over another, but considering all the records, it's not enough to vote one player in and the other off the ballot.

728-> AS DOZIER GOES, SO GO LIONS
They are mirror images of their respective teams, Mike Irvin, Miami's sophomore wide receiver, flashy on the field and off, his black warm-ups accented by two gold chains, dark sunglasses and a studded earring; D. J. Dozier, Penn State's senior tailback, a face in a crowd in a conservative sports jacket, more than willing, he said, to place the needs of his team ahead of personal gain. Before the game, Irvin and Dozier were seen as having something in common: both were barometers of the way their teams were playing. So if Irvin, a game breaker who already holds the Miami career record with 20 touchdown catches, could find openings in the Penn State secondary, then he and Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, could lead the Hurricanes to a one-sided victory in the Fiesta Bowl to determine the No. 1 team in the country. But if Dozier could keep the Miami defense on its heels with his ability to run inside and out, thus enabling Penn State to control the ball, the Nittany Lions' chances of winning would multiply. The strategy was to keep Testaverde on the sidelines as much as possible. As it turned out, Testaverde was on the field a lot - long enough to be intercepted five times in a 14-10 loss. 94 Yards, Winning Touchdown Dozier got his yardage - 94 on 18 carries, including the 6-yard run in the fourth quarter that put the Lions ahead to stay. For the fourth consecutive year, Dozier led Penn State in rushing, gaining 811 yards in the regular season, becoming the second leading runner in school history, behind Curt Warner. Still, Dozier could have been better had he not been slowed by injuries during his four years at Penn State, gaining 1,000 yards or more only as a freshman. He was healthy this season but Joe Paterno favored a balanced offense, passing more often and using five running backs to wear down opponents. ''The guy I felt bad for this year was D. J.,'' said John Shaffer, the Penn State quarterback. ''He could have been a Heisman Trophy candidate at another school, carrying 30 times a game. We felt, though, that we had a lot of people to run the ball.'' Dozier, who is from Virginia Beach, Va., said there are no regrets. ''I'm the type who does what he is asked and more,'' he said. ''You can't have a selfish attitude on this team, not with the other backs we have. My mother and father brought me up that way and that's the way Joe coaches. I love football, it's important to me, but it's not the only thing in my life.'' The 6-foot-1-inch, 204-pound Dozier came close to matching Warner's performance in the 1981 Fiesta Bowl, when Warner gained 145 yards to lead the Lions to a 26-10 victory over Southern Cal. Irvin Quick, Defense Quicker Irvin was one of the reasons the Hurricanes were clear-cut favorites. His speed and quickness typifies the Miami offense, but the Penn State defense was deceptively quick, largely shutting Irvin down. When he and Testaverde were redshirted in 1984, they spent a great deal of time practicing together, which carried over into the summer of '85. They have been a team ever since. ''I remember how jittery we both were before our first game last season,'' Irvin said. ''But Vinny showed confidence in me right from the start. He knows where I like to catch passes in certain situations, in my hands or my body. He'll give me hand signals at the line of scrimmage after reading a defense. In the huddle, when he tells me a play is going to be a touchdown, it usually is. We work well.'' Irvin was one of three talented Miami wide receivers, Brian Blades and Brett Perriman were the others, but Irvin was considered the best long threat. He figured Penn State would play a deep zone, giving him short gains over the middle. The Lions often used their all-America linebacker Shane Conlan, in man-to-man coverage in those situations. The thought of being covered by a linebacker made Irvin smile. He doesn't think there are any who can keep up with him. ''Penn State let's you nibble but not take the big bite,'' he said, more prophetic than he knew. Paterno compared Irvin to Lynn Swann, a compliment that briefly left Irvin speechless. ''My favorites have been Kellen Winslow and James Lofton,'' he said. He was miffed when he made only second team all-America, which he guessed can be attributed to the fact he is only a sophomore. Like his teammates, Irvin does not lack confidence. ''We want to put Penn State away early and celebrate the rest of the game,'' he said. ''We don't feel the pressure or get intimidated. You put the spotlight on us and we enjoy it.'' Tonight, Penn State enjoyed it even more.

729-> OFFICIAL CALLS IN PRESS AND KILLS HIMSELF
R. Budd Dwyer, the Pennsylvania State Treasurer, whose conviction for bribery last month jolted the state's Republican Party, shot and killed himself today at a news conference in his office in Harrisburg, the state capital. For half an hour he protested that he was innocent and criticized some people who had been connected with his conviction, and included news organizations that had reported it. Then, red-faced and sweating, Mr. Dwyer drew a .357 Magnum revolver from a manila envelope. He warned everyone to stay away to avoid being hurt. Several reporters ducked for cover. Others tried to dissuade him. Before anyone could reach Mr. Dwyer, he put the barrel of the pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He was pronounced dead half an hour later, at 11:31 A.M. Wife Suggested for His Post In a letter delivered later to Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat who was inaugurated Tuesday, Mr. Dwyer, who was 47 years old, said he regretted that ''the 'justice' system did not function properly in my case,'' and asked that Mr. Casey consider appointing his wife, Joanne Dwyer, as interim Treasurer. Mr. Dwyer and a former state Republican chairman, Robert B. Asher, were found guilty last month of 11 Federal charges stemming from the Pennsylvania Treasury Department's 1984 decision to award a $4.6 million contract to a California computer concern without taking bids. Two of the company's officials testified that they had won the contract by offering a $300,000 payoff to Mr. Dwyer. One testified that Mr. Asher found out about the offer and ordered the money diverted to the Republican State Committee. The convictions in Federal District Court in Williamsport, Pa., resulted from an investigation that might affect the Republican Party's state hierarchy and widen a shift of power to the Democrats. Republicans held the Governor's office for 16 of the last 24 years before Mr. Casey, a Democrat, was elected to succeed Dick Thornburgh, a Republican. Interim Appointment at Issue Mr. Dwyer, who faced up to 55 years in prison, was to have been sentenced in Williamsport Friday. After that, according to a ruling by State Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman, he would have been automatically removed from office. Consequently, maneuvering over whom Mr. Casey would appoint to fill out the unexpired second term of four years had begun. A regular election for the Treasurer's post is to be held in 1988, and Mr. Casey has been sparring with leaders of the Republican-controlled State Senate over interim appointment. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is necessary for confirmation. Mr. Casey is said to want to appoint a strong Democrat who could run for a full term as Treasurer next year, thus widening Democratic influence at the top of the state government. Republican Senate leaders say the voters elected a Republican and are entitled to a Republican serving out the term. Some compromise is expected since Mr. Casey is trying to win Senate cooperation for his programs, including an economic development plan. The Governor's office had no immediate comment on Mr. Dwyer's request that his wife be appointed. A Resignation Was Expected All political speculation faded, however, at least for the time being, after what happened at the news conference. Governor Casey said in a statement that he and his wife ''are profoundly shocked and saddened,'' and that ''Mrs. Dwyer and her children are in our prayers.'' Mr. Dwyer leaves two children, Rob and Deedee. Capitol reporters had thought Mr. Dwyer had called the news conference to announce his resignation. At the conference, according to some who attended it, Mr. Dwyer made a long, rambling statement. He criticized Acting United States Attorney James West, who prosecuted him; former Governor Thornburgh, with whom he had been at odds, and Federal District Judge Malcolm Muir, who presided at his trial. 'A Crime I Did Not Commit' Mr. Dywer said the judge had a history of imposing ''medieval sentences.'' He said he was ''being punished for a crime I did not commit.'' And he urged that the death penalty be repealed, saying that what had happened to him made him certain that innocent people had been convicted and executed. He apologized for voting several times as a state legislator for the death penalty. He called three aides to his side and handed each a sealed envelope. One contained instructions for funeral arrangements. One was Mr. Dwyer's organ-donor card. One was the letter to Governor Casey. ''By the time you receive this letter,'' it read, in part, ''the office of State Treasurer of Pennsylvania will be vacant. I stress to you that I did not resign but was State Treasurer of Pennsylvania to the end.'' 'Budd - Don't Do It!' The letter expressed confidence that Mr. Casey ''will be the great Governor that Pennsylvania needs at this time in our history.'' Saying there apparently was precedent for a spouse succeeding a spouse, Mr. Dwyer recommended his wife of 23 years as his successor. He termed her ''very talented, personable, organized and hard-working.'' As he drew the revolver, witnesses said, he warned people to stay away because ''this will hurt someone.'' ''Budd - don't do it!'' a reporter shouted. ''Budd! Budd! Budd!'' another shouted. ''I should have run and grabbed him when he pulled out the envelope,'' said Fred Cusick, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''I knew that was it.'' z

730-> F.B.I. Traces Sniper Bullets In New England to One Gun
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has determined that the same .22-caliber weapon was used in sniping attacks in rural Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Several people have been hit by fragments of bullets in 11 shootings since Dec. 8. The shootings, the latest Jan. 8 at a home for the retarded in North Smithfield, R.I., prompted Gov. Edward D. DiPrete last week to assign the National Guard to help the local police. Philip E. Langton, a Massachusetts state trooper, said Tuesday, ''The evidence we were able to identify was consistent as being fired from the same weapon.'' 'We're looking at one gun,'' Capt. Michael A. Urso of the Rhode Island state police said.

731-> Shuttle Accords Avert a Showdown
In reaching settlements with the families of four astronauts killed in the Challenger disaster, the Justice Department and Morton Thiokol Inc. appear to have avoided, at least for now, engaging in a court dispute between the Government and one of its chief contractors. Legal experts said that both sides desperately wanted to avoid such a clash in court. But a dispute may yet surface if the families of three other crew members press their cases. If so, it would probably center on one question: Who was more responsible for the Challenger disaster, the manufacturer of the space shuttle's solid booster rockets or the Federal agency that was supposed to be overseeing its work? That question would probably have come to the fore if Federal officials had simply settled the families' claims against the Government, and left Morton Thiokol, the manufacturer of the rockets, to deal separately with the families. All Claims Dropped Instead, the Justice Department included the rocket maker in the settlement, and the families agreed to drop all further claims against any of the space shuttle contractors. Neither Government officials nor Thiokol would discuss the reasons such an accord was reached. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who were not directly involved in the negotiations, say privately that Thiokol's inclusion probably saved the Chicago-based company millions of dollars in legal fees and potential jury judgments. ''Letting Morton Thiokol fight these cases alone wasn't a viable choice,'' said Mark A. Dombroff, formerly the director of the torts branch of the Justice Department's civil division, which handled air crash litigation for the Government. Noting that NASA officials would inevitably be drawn into suits between Thiokol and the families, he added: ''The Government wouldn't be buying any peace.'' Unsettled Claims Justice Department officials declined to discuss the settlements or their legal strategy, noting that the claims of three families - including one that has a suit pending against Thiokol - are unresolved. Nor would they provide details of the settlement. The amount to be paid to the families, a cost being shared by Thiokol and the government, has not been released. ''It's not something we are interested in talking about,'' said Philip Wyna, director of corporate development at Thiokol. ''The only thing we are saying is that we are making a substantial payment toward the settlements.'' At the Justice Department, Amy Brown, a spokesman, said that ''the settlement should not be construed as an admission of liability or negligence by Morton Thiokol.'' 4 Families Involved The settlements involved the families of Francis R. Scobee, the mission commander, and Air Force Lieut. Col. Ellison S. Onizuko. They also included two non-Government employees: Gregory B. Jarvis, who worked for the Hughes Aircraft Corporation, and Christa McAuliffe, the New Hampshire schoolteacher who was to have been the first ''teacher in space.'' No settlements have been reached with the families of Judith A. Resnick, Michael J. Smith or Ronald E. McNair. Mr. McNair's survivors have filed suit against Thiokol. In recent months, legal experts have said that should Thiokol go to court, it would probably assert two primary defenses. First, they speculated, the company would contend that it was immune from liability because it was acting in behalf of the Government. In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting in Richmond, overturned awards against three contractors made to the families of four men killed in military air crashes. It ruled that the Government's sovereign immunity extends to its contractors. Thiokol's second defense would probably be that officials at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which was overseeing the booster rocket project, were ultimately responsible for the accident. Such a contention could lead to presentations of the same witnesses and documents that dominated the hearings of the Presidential commission that investigated the accident. ''It would be a very ugly scene,'' one senior NASA official said recently. Noting that the commission, chaired by former Secretary of State William P. Rogers, had carefully avoided placing blame on individuals, the official added: ''All of a sudden, everyone would be pointing fingers.'' Insurance Coverage Under the terms of its contract, Thiokol carries insurance for the first $500 million in judgments against the company for the failure of its rockets. Beyond that figure, the company was indemnified by the Government, according to Susan Smith, the general counsel of the Marshall Space Flight Center. By contrast, Rockwell International, the maker of the shuttle orbiter, is now indemnified by the Government for all judgments resulting from a failure of its equipment. It was Rockwell, not the Government, that paid the survivors of the three astronauts killed in the Apollo 1 launch-pad fire in 1967. Meanwhile, Ms. Smith said she is negotiating with Thiokol over the company's penalty for the failure of its rocket, a penalty that could reach $10 million under terms of the contract.

732-> STAGE: THE ICE CAPADES WHIRLS INTO THE GARDEN
There was an air of deceptive thaw outside Madison Square Garden on Wednesday evening as temperatures -by January standards - soared. Inside, however, it was a season of the brave and the beautiful and the extraordinarily well balanced - in this year's incarnation of the Ice Capades. The company first took to the ice in 1940, and it has developed its own generations of fans. Perhaps there have been changes in the format over the years, but the show is still about good skating, dazzling precision, wondrous grace and a constant push to see how far skill can take one over the fastest surface known to man. What's more, it still succeeds. This year's show, subtitled ''The Best of Times,'' maintains the fast pace and splashy color for which it has gained renown. You want fast and beautiful? You will be thrilled with Kitty and Peter Carruthers, a brother-sister team who hold Olympic silver medals and several national titles and who whirl and whisk during maneuvers in which the slightest miscalculation might cause serious injury. Your taste runs to dance? Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert bring a ballroom grace to the Garden with entrancing, high-speed grace, while Terry Pagano and Tony Paul spin in rapid adagio routines. Robert Wagenhoffer is a single who seems to be soaring off the ice as much as he is on it. Bobby Beauchamp, a newcomer to the show from Los Angeles, brings an unusual vigor and intensity to his skating, particularly in the title role of the show's big production number, ''Firebird!'' Tricia Burton and Burt Lancon are iceborne satirists, deftly lampooning the type of skating others do to draw admiration. There is only one number specifically directed at the younger set, and that is ''The World of Teddy Ruxpin,'' which features overstuffed, amiable creatures who enact, with the vivacious contribution of Vicki Heasley, a pleasant adventure in some never-never lands. Steve Wheeler and Susan Jones are conjurers, and their act would be as acceptable off the ice as it is on. The management has even thrown in a dog act, apparently to appease those who have been forced to go to ice shows but don't really like them. If you don't care for dog acts, you've had it. Under the direction of Robert Turk, this year's Ice Capades is as attractive an episode as any. The handsome skaters even give us a taste of ''A Chorus Line'' and a touch of the Rockettes as they wheel about in a pinwheel of precision toward the finale. Ice Capades is still a fine collection of good skates. THE CAST ICE CAPADES, produced and directed by Robert Turk, with Shirley Costello, George Foster and Clifford MacGraham; original music, lyrics and orchestrations by Tom Worrall, Don James and Barry Fasman; musical supervision by Paul Suter; choreography by Mr. MacGraham; costumes designed by Pete Menefee; Beatles Remembered production choreography by Sarah Kawahara; sets and scenery by Robert W.

733-> Alex B. Novikoff Dies; Professor and Biologist
Prof. Alex B. Novikoff, a cellular biologist and a professor of pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine for the last 28 years, died Friday at the college's hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1953, after he refused a request by the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security to identify Communists among former colleagues at Brooklyn College, Professor Novikoff was dismissed by the University of Vermont's College of Medicine. Twenty years later, the university apologized by presenting him with an honorary degree while 8,000 people gave him a standing ovation. He was born in Russia, grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and received B.S., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University, which gave him its Distinguished Service Award in 1960. He has been honored annually by the National Cancer Institute with a career professorship award since 1962. Professor Novikoff wrote, with Eric Holtzman, ''Cells and Organelles,'' a widely-used textbook on the substructures of cells. He also wrote science books for children. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Phyllis Novikoff, an associate professor of pathology at Albert Einstein College; two sons, Kenneth, of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Lawrence, of South Euclid, Ohio; two sisters, Lillian and Sonia, and two grandchildren.

735-> FILM: WOODY ALLEN'S FOND REMEMBRANCES OF 'RADIO DAYS'
RADIOS once came in two basic models of wooden cabinets. The table-top, sheathed in oak or mahogany veneer, looked like a small, peak-roofed sentry box, with Romanesque or Gothic arches in front of the sometimes gold-flecked fabric masking the speaker. The table-top radio added a certain tone to any suite of living-room furniture, though certainly not as much as the majestic console, the big, heavy floor-model that was a prized piece of furniture in its own right. For most of us who were born before World War II - or even during the war's early days - it's sometimes difficult to realize that these extraordinary objects are now antiques, and that the material that poured from their speakers constituted a singular, if short-lived, popular art. We didn't have to look at the radio -though we always did - to be swept up by the voice of the unknown diva on ''The Major Bowes Amateur Hour,'' the awful dooms facing ''Little Orphan Annie,'' the arcane knowledge possessed by contestants on ''Name That Tune,'' the adventures of ''The Lone Ranger,'' or the gaiety of the annual New Year's Eve festivities at the Roosevelt Hotel, presided over by Guy Lombardo. We didn't see a wooden cabinet, often scratched and scuffed, its speaker-fabric punctured by children who'd wanted to discover what was going on inside. Instead we saw a limitless universe, created entirely out of voices, music and sound effects that liberated each mind in direct relation to the quality of its imagination. When Uncle Bob (or Ted or Ray) promised to send a shooting star over the house to mark a young listener's birthday, the young listener, who had hung out the window for an hour without seeing the star, questioned not Uncle Bob (or Ted or Ray), but his own eyesight. What's sometimes referred to as the golden age of radio - roughly from the mid-30's through the mid-40's - holds a privileged position in the memories of most of us who grew up with it. Radio wasn't outside our lives. It coincided with - and helped to shape - our childhood and adolescence. As we slogged toward maturity, it also grew up and turned into television, leaving behind, like dead skin, transistorized talk-radio and nonstop music shows. It's this brief and, in hindsight, enchanted period that Woody Allen remembers in his most buoyant, comic and poignantly expressed of memoirs, titled, with his unflagging, poetic exactitude, ''Radio Days.'' ''Radio Days,'' which opens today at the New York Twin and other theaters, is as free in form as it is generous of spirit. It's a chronicle of a family during the radio years, as well as a series of short-short stories. These follow, one after another, like the tales of Scheherazade, if Scheherazade had been a red-headed little Jewish boy in the Rockaways, born poor, star-struck, infinitely curious, and seriously incompetent as a juvenile criminal. The little boy, Joe (Seth Green), whose recollected thoughts are spoken on the soundtrack by Mr. Allen, is so happily lost in the world of radio that he scarcely notices the Depression around him. He has ''Breakfast With Irene and Roger,'' who hobnob with the rich and famous (and talk about it the next morning), and he knows the true, inside story of Sally White (Mia Farrow), of ''Sally White and Her Great White Way,'' who's radio's most glamorous Broadway gossip columnist. He enjoys the intense arguments about the stars: ''He's a ventriloquist on radio. How do you know he doesn't move his lips?'' The boy's first loyalty is to the Masked Avenger (Wallace Shawn), a Green Hornet-sort of radio vigilante who, at the moment of triumph, says heartily, ''It's off to jail for you! I hope you enjoy making license plates!'' To buy the Masked Avenger's ''secret-compartment ring,'' Joe helps himself to donations intended for the ''Jewish Homeland Fund.'' This leads to a good deal of physical stress in a confrontation with his parents and his rabbi, who compete with each other for the right of beating the boy senseless (in the middle of which Joe solemnly addresses the rabbi as ''My faithful Indian companion''). Joe is, indeed, surrounded by stress and aggravation, from morning to night. ''Turn off the radio,'' screams his mother (Julie Kavner). ''Why should I?'' says the boy. ''You listen to it.'' ''That's different,'' she says. ''Our lives are ruined anyway.'' Radio is Joe's Camelot. Never has Mr. Allen been so steadily in control, as ''Radio Days'' slides from low blackout sketch to high satire to family drama that's as funny as it is moving. One of the film's many performances-without-price is Dianne Wiest's as Joe's ever-hopeful, unmarried Aunt Bea, who's attracted to the wrong men mostly because they're the only ones available. On a foggy night, while parked at Breezy Point, a particularly promising suitor hysterically abandons Bea when he hears the news that the Martians have landed in New Jersey. ''Radio Days'' is so densely packed with vivid detail of place, time, music, event and character that it's virtually impossible to take them all in in one sitting. Carlo Di Palma is again responsible for the stunning photography, and Santo Loquasto for the production design. Among the memorable presences who fill the screen there are old Mrs. Silverman, who has a fatal heart attack - her teacup halfway to her lips - after watching a white woman kiss a black man, and gentle Mr. Zipsky who, without warning, has a breakdown and takes a meat cleaver to his neighbors. Also: genial Uncle Abe (Josh Mostel), who goes next door to complain to the radical neighbors, playing their radio on the high holy days, and returns several hours later as a confirmed Marxist. The members of the huge cast are uniformly splendid. Many, like Tony Roberts, Danny Aiello and Jeff Daniels, are familiar from earlier Allen films, while others, like David Warrilow and Tito Puente, are new. The film is nothing if not generous with - and to - its talent. Miss Farrow is hilariously common-sensical as the ambitious cigarette girl (''Who is Pearl Harbor?'' she asks in bewilderment on Dec. 7, 1941), and Diane Keaton, on the screen only a few minutes, helps to bring the film to its magical conclusion with a lovely, absolutely straight rendition of ''You'd Be So Nice to Come Home to.'' It's New Year's Eve, 1943, and Mr. Allen's radio days are as numbered as those of Proust's old Prince de Guermantes. ''Those voices,'' says the narrator by way of a benediction, ''grow dimmer and dimmer.'' At this point I can't think of any film maker of Mr. Allen's generation with whom he can be compared, certainly no one at work in American movies today. As the writer, director and star (even when he doesn't actually appear) of his films, Mr. Allen works more like a novelist who's able to pursue his own obsessions, fantasies and concerns without improvements imposed on him by committees. At this point, too, his films can be seen as part of a rare continuum. Each of us has his favorite Allen movie, but to cite one over another as ''more important,'' ''bigger,'' ''smaller'' or ''less significant'' is to miss the joys of the entire body of work that is now taking shape. ''Radio Days'' is a joyful addition. Mr. Allen, our most prodigal cinema resource, moves on. ''Radio Days,'' which has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), includes some mildly vulgar language and double-entendres.

736-> NEXT: A SHOP-AT-HOME LOAN
Picture this. Right after viewers of the Home Shopping Network television show have snatched up an allotment of zirconium rings, and before a shipment of ceramic figurines from Capodimonte, Italy, is put up for sale, the announcer offers, of all things, a cheap car loan. The scene might not be so far-fetched as it seems, especially if regulatory authorities approve a plan by Home Shopping, a pioneer in the growing shop-at-home industry, to acquire a Baltimore savings and loan. Yesterday Home Shopping, whose stock has been gyrating this week for other reasons, announced that it had agreed to acquire Baltimore Federal Financial for $40 million. On the latest news, Home Shopping advanced $4, to $34, after falling more than $5 on Wednesday. Role of Baltimore Federal ''We're hoping to be able to use Baltimore Federal to help in the development and sale of financial products to our customers,'' said Nando DiFilippo, executive vice president and general counsel of Home Shopping, which is based in Clearwater, Fla. ''We're not the first retailer that has looked at financial products and services. Sears has,'' Mr. DiFilippo added during a telephone interview yesterday from his home in Virginia. But Sears, Roebuck & Company, which owns the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage firm as well as real estate and insurance companies, sells its financial services in its stores. If Home Shopping gets its way, its customers would be just a phone call away from initiating a consumer loan or a credit card. Contrast With Sears ''The only difference is that we have a delivery system that is different from Sears's,'' Mr. DiFilippo said. The other difference, of course, is that Sears is an established marketing giant, and Home Shopping Network created the latest retailing fad. Indeed, Sears attracts millions of customers to its stores nationwide and sells many millions of dollars of products through its catalogue business. Home Shopping, on the other hand, can conceivably reach customers anywhere there is a telephone and a television set. Home Shopping may also sell financial services through direct mail contact with its buyers. But Mr. DiFilippo said his firm would first have to expand this aspect of its business. A Million Purchasers Cited The company, which went public last May amid much fanfare, says it already has one million club members, or people who have made purchases from its television show. Home Shopping also says that it reaches 31 million American homes and will be received by another 11 million if the acquisition of its competitor, the COMB Company, is completed. All this acquisition activity has played havoc with Home Shopping's stock, which rose sharply on Monday and Tuesday, fell abruptly on Wednesday and resumed its meteoric climb yesterday. Since last May, the company's stock has risen sharply and has split twice. The gain early in the week came as rumors spread around Wall Street that Home Shopping, which started in 1977 by selling goods over the radio, might make an acquisition. On Tuesday it disclosed those plans further, saying it was going to buy COMB. 'Short Squeeze' Experts reasoned that a ''short squeeze'' might be responsible for much of Home Shopping's unorthodox stock activity. A short squeeze occurs when investors who were betting that a company's stock would decline are forced to reverse their positions. When a stock is shorted, an investor sells stock that he has borrowed, hoping that sometime in the future he can replace those shares with stock bought at a lower price. But when the price of the stock goes up instead of down, that strategy backfires and the investors who shorted lose money. They may be forced to buy at higher prices because they must return borrowed shares to the original owners who want to sell or because they fear that the stock may go higher still. $40 Million Involved in Deal In the Baltimore Federal announcement, Home Shopping said that, in addition to investing $30 million cash, it would also purchase $10 million of Baltimore Federal's newly issued subordinated debentures. The company said the 103-year-old Baltimore Federal is the largest thrift institution in Baltimore, with approximately $1.7 billion in assets at the end of last year. Home Shopping said that Baltimore Federal's board of directors had accepted its offer. The transaction, however, still needs the approval of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as well as of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

738-> ECONOMIC SCENE; European Anger At 'Ramboism'
WILL the new year bring a trade war? That danger has come closer with the announcement by the Reagan Administration that it will impose, by the end of this month, 200 percent tariffs on a broad variety of European goods, including French wine, British gin and Danish cheese. The Europeans have reacted angrily; the French trade minister accused the United States of ''choosing the Rambo method.'' The European Community has vowed to retaliate by imposing counter-tariffs on American imports. But the United States seems ready to take that risk rather than let stalled negotiations over a tariff dispute resulting from Spain's entry into the Community drag on much longer. To join the Community, Spain was required to impose tariffs on imported grains, which, according to the United States, will cost American farmers at least $400 million in lost sales. The Europeans say the United States estimate is too high. Is the American move just a bargaining ploy? Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States Trade Representative, said he ''wouldn't give odds'' on whether the proposed American tariffs would actually come into effect. He expects a counteroffer from the Europeans before the tariffs are imposed Jan. 30. But he denies that the United States is bluffing. Obviously, no poker player but a lunatic ever announces that he is bluffing. Nevertheless, there is no reason to think the United States is merely bluffing - and many reasons to believe it has decided to adopt a tougher position toward the Europeans and also toward the Japanese, the Koreans, the Canadians, or any other country, to gain what it considers fairer treatment and greater market access for American exports. If this is Ramboism, so be it; but its objective is still to open markets, not to seal them off. Confidence that the trade deficit is improving may be running out. The Commerce Department announced this week that the United States deficit on merchandise trade climbed to a record $19.2 billion; imports were $37.8 billion, twice as much as United States exports of $18.6 billion. This report has shaken the Government and private economists who hoped the apparent improvement in the preceding three months marked a turn for the better in the trade deficit. Despite the fall in the dollar, the trade deficit in 1986 is estimated to have hit an all-time high of more than $170 billion, up from $148.5 billion in 1985. That translates into hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, lost income and threats to the survival of American farmers and industries. Just to achieve the modest growth forecast by the Administration for 1987 - 3.2 percent for real gross national product and 2 percent for the manufacturing sector - the Government is counting on a $30 billion to $40 billion improvement in the trade deficit. If that does not materialize, there would be a greater risk of recession, higher unemployment and a deeper budget deficit. The Administration's strategy of trying to reduce the trade deficit by depreciating the dollar and trying to preserve open trade would be blown out of the water. Politically, the Administration does not have much time to get out in front on the trade issue. The loss of control of the Senate to the Democrats will make it harder for President Reagan to block protectionist legislation in the coming year. That is one reason that the Administration, without waiting for Congress to act, has confronted the Europeans with what amounts to an ultimatum on imposing the 200 percent tariffs by the end of this month. Whether this ultimatum leads to a trade war will depend on how seriously the Europeans take the American threat, how they see their interests ultimately affected and how committed they really are to preserving the essentially, if imperfectly, open trading system that has contributed so much to world economic development in the postwar period. West Germany and the other European countries and Japan and the newly industrialized countries of East Asia, which have relied on an export-oriented strategy, have experienced the greatest growth in their history. But that export strategy for growth depended, more and more, on the willingness and capacity of importing countries to increase their debts. The threatened world debt debacle, the slowdown of economic growth and the emergence of gluts throughout the world in industry and agriculture are intensifying strains on the open trading system. Recognizing the dangers of another breakdown in that system, such as the one that shattered the world economy in the 1930's, the United States, the Europeans and the Japanese unquestionably do not want an all-out trade war. The present pulling and tugging between America and Europe could turn out to be a ''phony war,'' aimed at protecting particular economic interests and appeasing political pressures, but without inflicting too much damage on other countries. However, what may begin as a ''phony war,'' the term used to describe the seeming stalemate on the Western front in Europe during the early months of World War II, could erupt into an all-out trade war. Nations go all out when they feel their most important interests threatened.

739-> TEACHERS BRISTLE AT PLAN FOR COURSES ON RACISM
When one teacher suggested that ugly comments about recent racial incidents in Queens represented the feelings of a few ''punks,'' Surekha Rao, a teacher at the Charles E. Hughes High School for the Humanities in Chelsea, disagreed. ''They don't just reflect a few punks,'' Miss Rao said. ''Blacks are still second-class citizens, and a significant part of the black population feels it is left out.'' Later, the guidance supervisor for Manhattan schools, Jacqueline Hunt, suggested that teachers sometimes avoided conflict by ignoring racist statements. She said that ''taking a positive step is not ignoring'' such remarks. The exchanges occurred during one of the workshops for 500 teachers and administrators yesterday at Hunter College. The Board of Education was announcing a curriculum to try to foster ethnic and racial harmony. Study Guide and Lesson Book Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones called the courses an important step in confronting ''an area that, by and large, we have been reluctant to address in the past.'' A new 248-page study guide, ''Roots of Oppresson, Seeds of Change,'' includes lessons on human rights, slavery, the killing of Armenians, the Holocaust and apartheid. A 54-page lesson book for the upper elementary grades is called ''The Struggle for Human Rights.'' The books include scores of lessons intended to sensitize students to racism. A lesson for the elementary grades suggests that teachers introduce their classes to apartheid by simulating ''Country X,'' where some students can move freely and others are prohibited from doing so. Although the guides were developed last year, Mr. Quinones said the workshops yesterday had been precipitated by the incident in Howard Beach, Queens, in which three black men were assaulted by a group of white youths. One victim was killed by a car while fleeing the attack. Responsibility of the Clergy Mr. Quinones has been outspoken on the responsibility of the schools in preventing such incidents. However, in his opening address at the conference, Mayor Koch said the schools ''cannot do it on their own.'' The Mayor said he was unsure whether members of the clergy were ''involved as much as they could be, should be or will be.'' Asked to elaborate, Mr. Koch said he did not ''want to take on the clergy,'' with whom he is scheduled to meet next week. ''Since the clergy have been the dominant force in all our communities, you have to hold them a little bit responsible, as well,'' he said. The Mayor's remarks were well received by teachers. Some of them voiced frustration that the Howard Beach attack had been linked to classroom experiences. ''These kids happen to be students of the school,'' a teacher at Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn, Vincent Flanagan, said. ''It's not Howard Beach, or Atlantic Avenue or Jamaica. It's society.''

742-> KOSAR AND GASTINEAU POISED FOR CLASH IN BROWNS-JETS GAME; RUGGED TASK AFTER INJURIES
In his most disappointing season, Mark Gastineau suddenly looms again as the Jet who must make the big play on defense. Bud Carson, the defensive coordinator, explained today that he is relying on his line -not blitzing tactics - to pressure Bernie Kosar when the Jets face the Browns in Cleveland Saturday in a divisional playoff game. Because Kosar is so good at finding the uncovered receiver quickly, the Jets probably cannot afford to send linebackers or defensive backs charging after him. The last time the teams met in Cleveland, two years ago, Gastineau helped preserve a 24-20 victory with two sacks of Paul McDonald on the final Cleveland drive. Last year, facing Kosar for the first time, Gastineau was the American Football Conference player of the week in a playoff-clinching victory with a sack, six pressures, seven tackles and a forced fumble. Hobbled by Injuries It has been some time since Gastineau was a force in a game. In an injury-plagued 1986 season, he produced only two sacks in 10 games. He was first troubled with a strained abdominal muscle, and then he missed the five final regular-season games because of arthroscopic knee surgery. In Kosar, the Jets are facing a quarterback who has been dumped only seven times in his last five games, who has the best record in the league for avoiding interceptions, and who, simply, can get rid of the ball so quickly that defenders can't afford to blitz him. That leaves the potential pressure up to the Jets' defensive line - especially Gastineau. No one else on the team is consistently dangerous in providing quarterback sacks or pressure. In fact, Gastineau takes a ribbing from teammates over the fact that the leading sacker on the Jets right now happens to be Bobby Humphery, a defensive back converted from wide receiver. He had four during the season - 18 fewer than the record Gastineau established in 1984. ''It's only my second game back, it's going to take me one more game,'' Gastineau said today, obviously expecting to get past the Browns and into the American Conference championship game. Gastineau says he is over the abdominal-muscle strain that hindered his pass rush this year, and he said that the fact he is 20 pounds lighter has brought back his old quickness. Achieved Sack Against Chiefs He returned from the surgery for last Sunday's wild-card game against the Chiefs and quickly produced a sack after Tom Baldwin helped collapse the protective quarterback pocket. Does that one sack indicate that Gastineau can again pressure the quarterback? ''The best thing for me is to keep my mouth shut, and after the Cleveland game we'll see,'' said Gastineau. ''I'm a firm believer in this team, and this could be the biggest letdown of my life if we don't win right now.'' Gastineau said he might change his rushing technique to overcome problems he had against the Chiefs. Kansas City's left tackle, Irv Eatman, several times leveled the rushing Gastineau with blocks at knee level. ''It's something he wouldn't have done unless he knew I was hurt,'' said Gastineau. ''They're going to go for my legs.'' To counter that, Gastineau said, ''you jump over him. I was a little bit hesitant because it was my first week back. Maybe this week I'll do it. It's normal to be hesitant after you've been in the hospital.''

743-> ARCHIVES OF BUSINESS: THE DOW IN PERSPECTIVE
It may be fun to look back at the Dow's history, but that's no way to make money. Looking ahead, most professional investors think that even after four years of strength, the Dow looks vigorous - more vigorous than other major indexes. ''I think the Dow could be the best performer over the longer term,'' said Jonathan A. Berg, founder of New York's Berg Capital Corporation, which manages $100 million in client accounts. The power, breadth and depth of this January's rally has shocked many investors. After selling related to the year-end tax changes dropped off in December, the tone in the market suddenly shifted and buyers began to jump aboard. The mood swing has touched almost every corner of the market. In fact, by some measures, the number of advancing and declining issues, for instance, analysts find this rally more powerful than the surge in August 1982. This strength has convinced many institutional investors that the Dow and the broader stock market will climb for the next three to six months. This year will be a ''superyear, better than 1986 and 1985,'' predicted Robert R. Prechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist Newsletter in Gainsville, Ga. Among the optimists are some who think a modest dip in the Dow may occur soon, en route to a continued rise to 3,000 or higher. For example, New York's Forstmann-Leff Associates, which manages more than $4 billion for clients, has been selling stocks during this rally. ''We think you're getting close to some sort of correction,'' said William F. Harnisch, the firm's president. ''It may not be a meaningful one but we'd like to play it.'' Even this kind of caution cheers investors. ''The market does climb a wall of worry,'' said Mr. Berg. Since the Dow hit 1,200 a year and a half ago, so-called value managers, who look for company stocks that are priced low in comparison with the value of company assets, have said that the market is overpriced. For instance, Leonard M. Heine, president of the Management Asset Corporation in Westport, Conn., has almost half of his clients' $1 billion in cash. Much to the dismay of Mr. Heine and other investors, buyers continue to swarm into the market, driving prices ever higher. How far will this go? Some professionals are looking for a 200-point increase in the Dow, others predict 500 points. Assuming that the yields on long-term bonds fall to 6.5 percent from their current 7.3 percent, Edward S. Hyman, economist at New York's C. J. Lawrence Inc., figures that the Dow will advance to 2,400 by June. The basic reasons for bullishness among investors are the same as they have been for the past few years. The economy is growing at a slow but steady rate and investors foresee low inflation and stable or even marginally lower interest rates. On top of these positive fundamentals is an attractive liquidity situation. During the merger mania of the past few years the supply of stocks has been shrinking at the same time investors' demand for stocks has increased, thus providing fuel for a powerful rally. And many expect this liquidity picture to continue. Institutional cash levels are estimated to be at record highs. And, said Mr. Berg, ''People who have stocks are saying I have something other people want and I'm going to hold out for a higher price.'' One of the most vocal bulls is Mr. Prechter. ''The beginning of a major move has started that will last many months,'' he said last week. He expects the Dow to reach 2,600 by the end of this year and 3,600 by the end of 1988. Forstmann-Leff's long-term outlook for the Dow is 3,000 to 3,200, said Mr. Harnisch. ''We believe that we still have one big leg in this market,'' he said. Because corporations have slashed costs so much, he added, ''You don't need a lot of growth to get an improvement in profits.''

To the Editor: While it has become fashionable to look to the Japanese as today's standard setters in many areas, education is not one of them, the Department of Education's study ''Japanese Education Today'' notwithstanding (front page, Jan. 4). Japanese education is social Darwinism developed to its fullest. Eighth graders who fail to keep up with the curriculum are often relegated to second-class citizenship for life. They are often forced out of college-preparatory programs, and makeup opportunities are virtually nonexistent. At 13 years of age, they have sealed their future in a menial job. For those who go on, there are only four universities (Tokyo Daigaku, Meiji, Waseda and Keio) that can provide entry into the management of Japan's large corporations. Graduates from other universities are never considered executive material and will spend their working lives as low-paid ''salarymen.'' Competition to get into those four universities is extremely intense. Teen-agers must study until 11 every night; forgo social development or any other enjoyable part of adolescence. Suicides and attempts at it are all too common among those not selected. Even those who make it are usually so burned out on education, they have little desire to learn anymore. That is one reason why university programs, even those in the top four, are little more than rites of passage before employment. That is why most of the major advances in technology and science occur in this country and not in Japan. RUSSELL SHOR Philadelphia, Jan. 5, 1987 The writer was for three years a journalist in Japan, where his wife was an instructor in history at Keio.

748-> GRUMMAN TO END 1,500 JOBS ON L.I.
Long Island's largest employer, the Grumman Corporation, said today that it planned to eliminate about 1,500 jobs in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. It is the first time in more than decade that Grumman has cut its Long Island work force. The reduction is part of a company-wide move to trim costs. The cuts will involve about 1,200 layoffs, the company said, with the remainder coming through attrition. The dismissed employees were not likely to be rehired later, officials added. ''We are on a weight-reduction and muscle-building program,'' said John O'Brien, Grumman's president and chief operating officer. ''The moves are necessary,'' he said, ''because of increasing pressure on defense budgets and increasing pressures on defense companies to be more competitive.'' The military contractor said the cutback would save it $50 million this year. Grumman, with a worldwide work force of 33,000, employs about 25,000 people on Long Island. Company officials said that although they were cutting the Long Island rolls by 6 percent, they expected to increase their work force in other parts of the country, including Melbourne, Fla., and Montgomery, Pa. Over all, they said, corporate employment should increase slightly or remain stable this year. In an interview at the company's headquarters here, Mr. O'Brien said that most of the job cuts would come in the corporation's Aircraft Systems division, which is building five types of planes, including the F-14, the Navy's principal fighter plane. The cuts are largely the result of a decrease in production of the F-14, to 8 planes this year from 24 in 1986. Mr. O'Brien said the sharp reduction was expected and resulted from an upgrading of the F-14, with electronic technology and a more powerful engine. Most of the job losses, the company said, would occur on the production lines at the company's Calverton, L.I., plant. But Mr. O'Brien added that cuts would also be made in the aircraft support services. He said he could not provide a breakdown. More broadly, Mr. O'Brien described today's actions ''as part of the transition of the Grumman Corporation from an airframe manufacturer to a company that focuses on outgrowths from that business,'' such as electronics and data services. 'A Tremendous Shift' ''We are going through a tremendous shift in the skills mix that we need,'' Mr. O'Brien said. Grumman, which gives its employees free turkeys at Christmas, has a nonunion work force that is said to own more than a quarter of the company's stock. The company said it would begin notifying affected employees in the next few weeks. Those dismissed will receive severance pay based on their length of service. They also will get ''preferential consideration'' for openings elsewhere, the company said. But given the company's reputation for paternalism, Mr. O'Brien said the layoffs - the first since 1975-76, when the company cut nearly 2,000 workers - were ''particularly painful.'' Wall Street seemed noncommittal about the cutback. Grumman's stock fell 12.5 cents, to $25.625, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

750-> VIETNAM PARLEY ENDS; LEADERS AREN'T NAMED
A six-day session of Vietnam's National Assembly ended in Hanoi on Monday without the naming of new Government leaders. No explanation was given by the official Vietnamese news organizations for the absence of expected Cabinet changes. A Vietnamese News Agency account of the session said only that the assembly had approved a draft law on marriage and the family, adopted development and budget plans for 1987 - including a call for a 7 percent economic growth rate - and welcomed a Soviet call for a nuclear-free world. On Dec. 17, in the largest shake-up in party history, four prominent Communist leaders resigned or were dropped from the party Politburo during the sixth national Vietnamese Communist Party Congress. It was assumed by scholars and diplomats, as well as by some Vietnamese officials interviewed by journalists, that the former Politburo members would also lose their Government positions when the National Assembly met. Most Western journalists have been barred from reporting in Vietnam during the last few months. Resigned at Congress The leaders holding concurrent high party and governmental positions who resigned during the party congress were Pham Van Dong, the country's Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Prime Minister, and Truong Chinh, the party's General Secretary and Chairman of the State Council, or President of Vietnam. Mr. Chinh was replaced as party General Secretary by Nguyen Van Linh. Le Duc Tho, a veteran party leader, also retired Dec. 17, and To Huu, a former deputy Prime Minister, was quietly dropped from the Politburo. Mr. Huu had already lost his Government job in a shake-up last June. In addition, Gen. Van Tien Dong, the country's Defense Minister, lost his Politburo seat during the party congress. Vietnamese exiles say he or members of his family may have been involved in corruption scnadals. He was also associated with the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Vietnamese officials say new Government appointments can be made at any time. Some scholars believe they may come when there is less public attention focused on national meetings, or they could be postponed until June 1987, when a new assembly is due to be convened. Speculation Over Divisions There is considerable speculation that continuing divisions in the party are holding up the formation of a new government. According to the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, the new Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party, from whom the Government officials are likely to be named, is as follows: Full members in order of rank are Nguyen Van Linh, Pham Hung, Vo Chi Cong, Do Muoi, Vo Van Kiet, Le Duc Anh, Nguyen Duc Tam, Nguyen Co Thach, Dong Si Nguyen, Tran Xuan Bach, Nguyen Thanh Binh, Doan Khue and Mai Chi Tho. There is one alternate member, Dao Duy Tung.

752-> U.A.W. REACHES A TENTATIVE PACT WITH DEERE
A tentative agreement between Deere & Company and members of the United Automobile Workers was reached late Tuesday, ending a 168-day work stoppage at 14 plants in Iowa and Illinois, the longest in the company's history. Full details of the settlement were not disclosed, pending ratification meetings with rank-and-file members later this week, union officials said. Company officials also refused to disclose the terms of the agreement. More than 13,000 union members were idled when Deere, the world's leading producer of farm equpment, halted production at 10 plants Aug. 22, the day after union workers walked out of three plants in a wage dispute. Salaried employees and workers at the company's non-U.A.W. plant in Horicon, Wis., which makes consumer and lawn care products, kept working. The pact affects production and maintenance workers in Iowa and Illinois as well as warehouse and parts depot workers at facilities in East Moline, Ill., Denver, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Memphis. Workers at the five warehouse and parts depots were allowed to work during the strike. Robert Shoup, a company spokesman, said Deere was ''very pleased'' with the tentative settlement. He said the major issues separating the two sides involved job security and pensions, but he would not elaborate. Deere has said that the depressed market for agricultural implements and the company's large losses made it impossible to meet union demands. Earlier, Bill Casstevens, a union spokesman, said the major issues were job security and the company's efforts to ''emasculate our cost-of-living benefits.'' Under the old contract, the average Deere worker received wages and benefits of $24.64 an hour, with the average base pay $14.85 an hour. Mr. Shoup acknowledged that the work stoppage appeared to have damaged the historically good relations between the company and its workers. ''These things take a little time to heal, and they will,'' Mr. Shoup said. The last time the union struck the company was in 1979, and that stoppage lasted 20 days. Talks broke off Dec. 3 after a session that lasted two hours, with each side saying the other was bitterly entrenched. Negotiators said after the meeting that they were more than $17 million apart in their proposals for a three-year contract. Since then, the two sides had met sporadically until Tuesday's seven-hour negotiating session. A state judge had ordered the two sides to resume bargaining Monday.

753-> WILLIAM G. RABE
William G. Rabe, a former director of the Manufacturers Trust Company, died Jan. 17 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., after a long illness. He was 90 years old. Mr. Rabe, who was born in Brooklyn, entered the banking business in 1921 as an employee of the New York Trust Company. In 1931, he joined Manufacturers Trust and was elected a director and chairman of its trust committee. He was chairman of the advisory board and became an honorary director of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company when Manufacturers Trust and the Hanover Bank merged in 1961. He retired in 1963. Mr. Rabe is survived by his wife, the former Alyce Monohan; a daughter, Marilyn Huber of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; two grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

754-> A LEAFY LOS ANGELES HIDEAWAY
Winding along Stone Canyon Road, pausing for a better look at baronial estates tucked behind overhanging sycamores and high iron gates, first-time guests at the Hotel Bel-Air might wonder if they have taken a wrong turn. What would a hotel be doing amid all the wealth and splendor of Bel-Air, the fabled wooded retreat for dozens of Hollywood stars? But the residents of Stone Canyon Road, where the Mercedes cars outnumber all other makes combined, do not seem to mind having the hotel's charming, pink, California-adobe-style buildings in their neighborhood. After all, sections of the Hotel Bel-Air were there long before many of the homes, first as the stables and then as the guesthouses on the original estate of Alfonso Bell. In the 1920's Mr. Bell, the oil and real estate magnate, developed the area into the most exclusive neighborhood in Los Angeles. The Bel-Air was opened in 1946 and over the years the neighbors became so accustomed to its unobtrusive style that when the new owners began to renovate it in 1983 they petitioned them to make everything just the way it was when the place was in its heyday in the 40's and 50's. Today the residents appear to be pleased with renovations that modernized the hotel but left its character and charm intact. Unlike the Beverly Hills Hotel where there is constant bustle around the pool, in the Polo Lounge and the lobby, whatever dealing goes on at the Bel-Air is more like that at a private club in Manhattan. Breakfast finds the power brokers table hopping and talking on the mobile phones, but even then the hotel manages to remain relatively serene. The staff makes something of a fetish of anonymity. It likes to think that the hotel's 11-plus acres are still a secret. It is hard to believe that these semitropical gardens are just a mile from the heavily trafficked Sunset Boulevard. Tyrone Power honeymooned here and Princess Grace was a frequent guest, but during the 70's the Bel-Air fell into that state of shabbiness known as genteel. In 1983 Caroline Hunt Schoellkopf, best known for her renovation of the hotel called the Mansion on Turtle Creek, in Dallas, bought the property, as the staff refers to it, for almost $23 million. She has spent another $6 million fixing it up and adding 26 rooms and garden suites for a total of 92. The interior design is the same throughout the hotel, yet no two rooms are alike. Each, however, conveys the feeling of a sumptuous private residence. The least expensive room has its own private terrace, shaded by trees, shrubs and cascades of flowers. The one in which I stayed had Bel-Air's forested hills for a backdrop. The room, with its pale pink walls, a dhurrie rug on a pink sand-colored tile floor and bed covered with a luxurious throw of pink, sand and brown, was appointed with every amenity. The bath was bright with glossy white Mexican tiles and brass fixtures. There were three phones, one at the bed, one at the desk and one in the bathroom. The walk-in closet held a small, stocked refrigerator. Elegant French soaps, thick, large absorbent towels and robe, shampoo, body lotion and conditioner - there was little the management had overlooked. The TV, with remote control, was hidden in the armoire that doubled as a desk. If I had one complaint it was the lack of sufficient light at the desk. Service matches the setting: unobtrusive, cordial and timely. There is 24-hour room service and if you want Kentucky Fried Chicken, as one British couple did, they will send a limousine to get it. No one, says the hotel, has ever stumped them. Room-service meals are delivered on time and warm. At breakfast the orange juice is fresh, the English muffin crisp, the butter sweet. The omelet could have been a little softer but it tasted as if it had just come off the stove. Like the hotel itself, the food has undergone considerable renovation. California modern, fresh, well-cooked and handsomely presented, it is some of the better hotel food available in this country. A roasted corn and tomato soup with tracings of red, green and tan; grilled tuna, cooked as requested, to medium rare with orange and red onion; an assortment of grilled vegetables and a rather homey chocolate peanut butter cake is typical of what the hotel has to offer. Dinner is about $50 a person without wine, taxes or tip. The sumptuous dining room is done in taupe, peaches and soft greens, the walls covered with oils. The lush flower arrangements and trees bring the outdoors inside. Meals are also served out on the bougainvillea-shaded terrace or in the privacy of your own walled patio. The bar is very un-California: The walls are paneled in dark wood; the chairs are leather; there is a fireplace, a piano and a TV. Aside from the heated pool there are no sports facilities on the grounds. But arrangements can be made for the use of golf, tennis and fitness facilities at private clubs nearby. Jogging along the winding roads of Bel-Air offers an opportunity for uninterrupted peeping at the palatial homes - through the iron gates and fences designed to thwart the curious. During my visit a wedding was under way at the hotel, and if I were looking for a romantic place to hold one, I wouldn't look any farther. Just across the bridge that leads from the entrance to the hotel itself, down a gentle hillside, there is a small gazebo by a pond inhabited by swans. It is a magical setting, especially when the last rays of light filter through the leaves at sunset. There is something magical about the hotel, too. After a while you come to believe that you have stepped back in time, to the Hollywood of the 20's, where a delicious indulgence was everyone's birthright. Hotel Bel-Air, 701 Stone Canyon Road, Los Angeles, Calif. 90077; 213-472-1211. The daily rates for rooms range from $190 to $290, single, to $215 to $315, double, and, for suites, some with kitchens, from $400 to $1,300.

755-> ART: DUTCH SHOWS AT MORGAN AND MET
THE Netherlands is now getting special attention by way of two related museum exhibitions. The one at the Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, is a selection of 16th-century drawings, most of which are making their first appearance in the United States, and it comes with a plump catalogue. A joint effort by the library and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, where it first materialized, the show musters about 120 works, including eight by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (about 1525 to 1569). As it happens, two of the Bruegel works are present in the second display, albeit reversed as engravings. That second exhibition is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it consists exclusively of the prints that Bruegel habitually made his drawings for. All 65 of them come from the museum's collection, which is billed as the largest in the country. Sail before steam, drawings before prints: the Morgan production should be seen first. This is not just because drawing is the older of the two media but rather because the qualities that make it attractive - spontaneity, subtlety, a sense of the artist's nearness and so on - seem anticlimactic when viewed after images that have been neatened, dramatized or both by reproduction. More important, however, is that the 50 or so artists surveyed provide a foil for Bruegel's accomplishment and at the same time communicate a strong sense of northern Europe in transition. Though too late for the Hundred Years' War and too soon for the even more destructive conflict that lasted 30 years, the 16th century was not itself short on turmoil. It was the period during which Protestantism went from the bottom of the chart to the top and nationalism and imperialism began to gain ground. Entering the era as one more-or-less Roman Catholic territory, the Netherlands, thanks to the savagery of the Spanish occupation, departed it bisected into a Protestant North and a Catholic South - the forerunners of today's Netherlands and Belgium. Still, there's no sign of these political upheavals in the art, certainly not in the drowsy little study of trees with houses behind and grazing cattle in front that was delicately penned in 1569 by the Master of Small Landscapes. Nor can they be divined in fantasies about mountains and queer rock formations that seem to have beset so many inhabitants of this land devoid of both. As for Bruegel's subtly toned masses of squiggles, stitches and stipple depicting the Alps, they convey only the pleasure that the artist took in landscape. The catalogue says that he was the first to travel south for the scenery rather than for art and culture - shades of the Romantic era to come. The convulsion that the show does express is the belated arrival of the Renaissance in northern Europe. Represented by Mannerist figures, Baroque compositions (note Dirk Barendsz's revelers in modern dress awaiting the end of the world) and Classical ornament, civilization again infiltrates the barbarian North and again doesn't entirely overcome it, for which posterity should be grateful. Hieronymous Bosch (1450-1516) evidently died before his Gothic ways could be eradicated. But if political messages there are in this show, they may lurk in his pen-and-ink of an owl perched in a hollow tree, where the grass in the foreground pullulates with human eyes, and a pair of giant ears, also human, is propped against trees behind. On the other hand, this and the more straightforward study of the birds nesting may simply allude to the medieval distaste for the owl, which, by the way, still lingers in Europe. Even more obscure is Bruegel's pen-and-ink of beekeepers who, clad in headgear like fencing masks and garments akin to surgical gowns, bustle with basket-hives while a young man in a tree reaches for a bird's nest and the mandrake growing in the foreground promises retribution for someone. If it was heretical tricks these artists were up to, they were lost on their patrons in the Catholic establishment. In any case, the present scholarly consensus seems to be that since the bizarre symbolism pioneered by Bosch and continued by Bruegel made sense in its time, it should not be regarded as proto-Surrealism simply because it is incomprehensible today. Well, easier said than done, especially in the Metropolitan's print show, where there are juxtapositions weirder and funnier than any dreamed up by Max Ernst. There is also the inevitable Germanic scatology - monkeys with beautifully drawn eyes doing unspeakable things with the belongings of a peddler who sleeps by the wayside - not to mention eroticism. Serious landscapes incorporating Classical and biblical allusions abound; morals are pointed in scenes such as ''The Fat Kitchen,'' where the pets are as portly as their owners, and its counterpart, ''The Lean Kitchen.'' Philip Galle and Pieter van der Heyden are among the notable engravers; so is Frans Huys, for presumably it was he who made the artist's men o' war look like bosomy matrons sailing seas of whipped cream. Plainly a good businessman with something for everyone in his repertory, Bruegel packs his scenes with so much incident that the Met show, though half the size of the Morgan's, takes about the same length of time to study. Both spectacles are highly recommended. The Met exhibition remains through March 15 and the Morgan show through April 5. Also of interest this week: Robert Beauchamp (M-13 Gallery, 413 East Ninth Street): Robert Beauchamp is one of many painters who studied with Hans Hofmann and one of the few to show it, unless it is a coincidence that he, also, wades into the canvas as if to war and likes to juxtapose red and green. Only one small 1960's image in this show intimates he was once an introvert preoccupied with an archetype - a lithe, 20th-century Lilith with a beaky nose and a helmet of hair who, set in vague landscapes of somber hue, consorted only with her look-alikes and animals. She is still around and so are some of her animal companions -camels, birds and horses with the muzzles of moose. But the catalogue for the artist's recent traveling retrospective indicates that since the early 70's they have been nearly crowded out by other symbols, notably lighted matches, flowers, large apples with haloes and, in one case, a slab of melting butter. Beauchamp belongs to the generation that produced the second wave of Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Minimalism and Conceptualism, but by training and temperament he has been closest to the first of these movements. So it is not illogical that, well before the end of the 1970's, his symbolism should have metamorphosed into an Expressionism salted with automatist spatter or that his figures should have become grotesques inflected by Ensor, Bacon and Dubuffet. Despite this and the genuine anguish permeating his work, Beauchamp is now liable to be taken for a Neo-Expressionist. (Through Sunday.)

756-> WASHINGTON TALK: WORKING PROFILE; The White House Link To Iran Investigations: David M. Abshire
David M. Abshire knows something about dealing with Capitol Hill. He was an Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations in the early 1970's, when the Nixon Administration was trying to suppress information about military incursions into Laos and Cambodia. ''That was an example,'' Mr. Abshire noted dryly, ''of how not to do it.'' Mr. Abshire recalled that incident the other day as he described the responsibilities of his new job, coordinating the White House response to the Iran arms scandal. Although the Nixon Administration tried to hide information, he said the Reagan Administration would try to provide as much as possible to official investigating bodies, such as the special prosecutor and the select committees recently established on Capitol Hill. ''Our role,'' he said, ''is to be facilitator, coordinator and link to these independent institutions.'' That role is easy to describe but not so easy to play out. Like any official in any Administration who is directed to clean house, Mr. Abshire has been placed in a potentially tricky position. While his mandate is to ''get all the facts out,'' he is working for an Administration that has a deep interest in its own survival. 'I've Got My Integrity' What if his investigation turns up a ''smoking gun,'' a document that could severely damage the Administration he is serving? The 60-year-old diplomat and academician said he had learned the lesson of the Nixon years and would not hesitate to turn over the evidence. ''I've got my integrity, and so does everyone in this room,'' he said. ''We were not involved in the past situation. We were brought in from the outside with that in mind. We've got no vested interest in the past.'' ''The Administration is going to be criticized by these committees for the way the policy implementation went wrong,'' Mr. Abshire continued. ''And our purpose is not to prevent that. Our purpose is to carry out the function of getting out the information and the documents, and let the chips fall where they may.'' But what Mr. Abshire and his aides will not do is provide information and documents to the press or the public, and there has been considerable grumbling in the capital that while the White House is conveying the appearance of openness on the Iran affair, it is not, in fact, always forthcoming. Charles Brower, Mr. Abshire's chief aide, acknowledges that there has been ''quite considerable impatience'' about the general lack of information available. But he argues that getting to the bottom of the affair is ''necessarily a cumbersome and sometimes tedious process.'' Mr. Abshire was happily rounding out a tour as ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when President Reagan called him in Brussels and asked him to take on what is likely to be a highly sensitive and largely thankless task. ''I did not request the job,'' said Mr. Abshire, who spent much of his long career in Washington running the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University. Indeed, he added, it took ''extra persuasion'' by the President to bring him home. Mr. Abshire, as special assistant to the President, has set up shop on the fourth floor of the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House, with a staff of a half-dozen assistants hastily recruited from other agencies. The remote location of the office -one former Administration official called it ''Siberia'' - has spawned speculation that the White House is not really serious about reaching the bottom of the Iran affair. But no matter where the offices are, the pressure inside them is intense. ''We all wish we were doing something else,'' said one of Mr. Abshire's aides. So far, the special assistant has talked with the independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh, and just about every lawmaker assigned to the two Congressional investigating committees. The initial reviews of his performance have been good, with Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Senate panel, saying, ''Ambassador Abshire is truly going to respond to the requests of the committee with alacrity.'' The basic concept behind his appointment was to have Mr. Abshire handle all requests and obligations stemming from the Iran affair, thus freeing the rest of the Administration to concentrate on other matters. One major task is simply finding and transmitting documents that relate to the scandal. Last week, the first batch requested by the House committee was trucked up to Capitol Hill, about 3,000 items in all. Mr. Abshire says that these materials should go to Congress unedited and unevaluated by the White House and that any effort by the Administration to conduct a ''parallel investigation'' or engage in ''second guessing'' would lack credibility. ''The worst thing that the White House can do,'' Mr. Brower said, ''is for anyone here to purport to act as judge and jury in this matter and declare in definitive form what the truth is.'' Listening to Complaints Mr. Abshire's second major job is to listen to complaints from Congress and transmit them to the President at what will probably be regular weekly meetings. Already, Mr. Reagan's special assistant has heard several earfuls. Lawmakers from both parties say the President simply does not consult them enough. James A. McClure of Idaho, a Republican member of the select Senate committee, said, ''I saw Lyndon Johnson more than I see Ronald Reagan.'' In addition, there is a strong feeling on Capitol Hill that until the President takes more responsibility for the Iran affair, and apologizes fully for his Administration's blunders, the matter will continue to blight his Presidency. ''If a ship's commander is asleep in his bunk,'' Mr. McClure said, ''and the ship runs aground, the captain is ultimately responsible.'' Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican, said he had told Mr. Abshire that many of the President's chief advisers have ''no antennae for Capitol Hill'' and do not understand how Congress works. ''I wish,'' Mr. Hyde said of the President, ''that he had people around him who were strong, and not yes men.'' Mr. Abshire's value to the Administration might well rest on how willing he is to say no to the President.

757-> ARE VOTERS ENTITLED TO REAGAN'S DIAGNOSIS?
PRESIDENT REAGAN is back at the White House, recuperating from his third major operation since his inauguration, his second in 18 months. A trans-urethral resection of Mr. Reagan's prostate went smoothly last week, and a checkup found no evidence of a recurrence of the colon cancer removed in July 1985. In 1981, he had chest surgery to remove a bullet from his lung. The world knows these and other medical facts about Ronald Reagan because in running for high office politicians also waive certain rights to privacy. But last week's surgery raises a longstanding question particularly relevant to the 75-year-old Mr. Reagan, the oldest man to serve in the Oval Office: What is the proper balance between a President's right to privacy and the right of the people, who are his employer, to know about his health? There is a long history of secrecy surrounding Presidential ailments, serious as well as minor, often near election time. In 1893, surgeons operated on Grover Cleveland's jaw, working aboard a ship off New York City to keep the procedure secret. In 1944, the public was told that Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from severe hypertension and heart problems, was in excellent condition. President Reagan's resiliency has been well demonstrated. The wounds and blood loss he suffered after being shot in 1981, for instance, were perhaps a more strenuous test of his cardiovascular system than the treadmill stress test he passed last week. And last week, as before, his doctors said his bones and organs resembled those of a much younger man. But partly because of reports about Mr. Reagan's napping at Cabinet meetings, and partly because of his performance at news conferences, where his answers on occasion lack precision, perhaps as a result of his partial loss of hearing in one ear, an uneasiness remains, if not about Mr. Reagan's medical condition then about his age. White House aides, always careful to emphasize his vigor, feared that prostate surgery would cause Mr. Reagan to be seen as vulnerable because he had one of the most common geriatric problems. How the procedure will affect the President's image is not known. But whatever the perception, it is affected by the way the White House presents medical news. And while Mr. Reagan has been more forthcoming than many public figures, issuing reports on his general health ever since he entered politics, the White House has been grudging in its handling of some of his medical problems. Not long after his colon cancer surgery, for example, Mr. Reagan was seen with a small bandage on his face. It took several days before he acknowledged that a basal cell carcinoma had been removed. Last week, none of the President's doctors appeared at a news conference or were allowed to talk to reporters. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said he was withholding minor medical details. Joking about his reliance on a medical dictionary, he said all details about the procedure would come from ''Dr. Speakes.'' That low-key approach is believed to reflect Nancy Reagan's wishes. She is known to have been distressed by the extensive coverage of her husband's colon cancer operation and by outside doctors' public criticism of the quality of his care. There was no such criticism this time, but questions remain. Why, for example, did Dr. T. Burton Smith, the urologist who performed Mr. Reagan's first prostate operation in 1967 and who said five months ago that no further urological procedures were needed, resign as White House physician in early December? The only answer has come from the White House: to pursue ''personal interests elsewhere.'' And might the public have been more reassured about the President's health last week if they had heard directly from a doctor? It may be up to historians to discover what is not known about any President's health. And it may not matter. That is a point made by those who argue for high officials' privacy. A requirement to disclose all medical details, including those irrelevant to performance in office, they say, could bring pressure on officials to withhold information from their doctors. The argument for more disclosure is often made through a case history, that of the stroke of Woodrow Wilson, which left him incapacitated and the unknowing country in the hands of his wife, who virtually ran the White House.

758-> IRANIAN SETBACK STIRS FEARS THAT WAR MAY SPREAD
The deadlock in the war between Iran and Iraq has raised fears that the conflict may spread to other Persian Gulf nations, according to reports by Western military officials stationed in the region. Some predict that another Iranian reverse comparable in severity to the one suffered last week will force a frustrated Teheran to act against Iraq's paymasters, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Such a reverse and even the defeat of the Iranian armies in the long-predicted ''final offensive'' is quite possible, according to one European intelligence organization, unless the Iranians alter their tactics and learn the lessons of their recent offensive operations. According to this source, the Iranians suffered very heavy losses, including a high percentage of killed to wounded, because they insisted on exposing infantry to superior artillery and mortar fire and intermittent bombing by Iraqi aircraft. Iraq Retook Four Islands After 36 hours of virtually incessant bombardment of the Iranians, the Iraqis were able to retake, with relatively light losses, four small islands in the Shatt al Arab waterway that had been briefly occupied by Iran. Although each side made wildly exaggerated claims about the casualties suffered by the enemy, the consensus among NATO experts is that the total casualties were between 8,000 and 10,000 killed, wounded or missing. More than 65 percent were Iranian, according to one European military official who has monitored the war since it began in 1980. It is estimated that Iran lost 3,000 dead. ''The political and military leadership in Teheran seems unable to grasp the brutal fact that in war fanaticism and courage are not enough,'' this source said. ''They are attacking today exactly as they did in 1982, throwing thousands of half-trained boys against artillery, mortars and machine guns manned by steady troops. Until they begin to employ more subtle tactics, they will meet with little success.'' Iran's final major offensive, if it comes at all, is now expected in March. Western military analysts favor March, they say, because the ground will be too soft after seasonal rains during February for the rapid movement of Iraqi tanks and artillery. Iraq has numerical superiority in these weapons, the sources said. Iraqi Planes Had Minor Role The Iraqi Air Force, which has established superiority over Persian Gulf and Iranian targets, played only a minor role in repulsing last week's offensive. Many air officers, while acknowledging the damage the air force has done to Iranian refineries and tankers, believe that from the strategic point of view it should shift to new targets. They point out that the Iranians are still able to use the bridges across the Shatt al Arab, which runs from the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to the Gulf. They say these bridges should be bombed because they could be used in a major ground offensive against Basra, which is Iraq's second largest city and the southern terminus of the main highway from Baghdad, the capital. The same is true, air officers said, of the causeways built by the Iranians across the marshes northeast and east of Basra. These could be used by ground troops in any major attack on Basra. If, as maintained, Iran has received a substantial amount of defensive weapons from the United States and Israel, Western experts on the Middle East point out that thus far the weapons have not been used extensively. Iraq's French-built Super-Etendard bombers ranged the Gulf and flew over Iran in December but encountered only two interceptors, American-made F-14's, which were shot down. Nor did they meet surface-to-air missile fire. Electronic Jammers Cited One British official believes that the absence of missile fire is a result of Iraq's deployment of advanced electronic jammers obtained from France. These allow the bombers to penetrate the elaborate Hawk missile defenses that surround Teheran and most of the ports on the Gulf.

759-> DANGERS CITED 18 MONTHS EARLIER
In an inspection 18 months ago, the Puerto Rico Fire Department found that the Dupont Plaza Hotel's fire alarm system was not working properly. The department also said the hotel's fire evacuation plan was inadequate and that its employees did not know what to do in case of a fire. Jose Carrasquillo, deputy chief of the department, said this week that the hotel had been notified of the results of the inspection but said there had been no follow-up. ''We don't know if they fixed everything,'' he added. Bruce Shulman, vice president for sales and marketing at the Dupont Plaza, who joined the hotel eight months ago, says all the deficiencies cited were corrected immediately. Many survivors have said that no fire alarms sounded on New Year's Eve. One guest, Robert Howard, an accountant from Livingston, N.J., said after the disaster that at the time of a small, smokey fire on the ninth floor early on Dec. 27 another guest had ripped the handle off an alarm box and that the alarm did not go off. There also were small fires at the hotel on Dec. 19 and 28. According to Mr. Carrasquillo, ignoring a fire inspector's recommendations would not normally result in criminal prosecution of a hotel owner in Puerto Rico. He said he did not believe that the kind of safety lapses found in the 1985 inspection would have had a significant bearing on the damage or casualties in the New Year's Eve fire. He noted that the hotel did not have smoke detectors and had a sprinkler system only in its laundry and kitchen areas. This is in accordance with Puerto Rican fire ordinances, he said. But he added that smoke detectors probably would have drawn attention to the New Year's Eve fire in seconds and that such an early warning might have affected the outcome of the fire.

760-> LENGTHY HELMSLEY INQUIRY IS SEEN
Federal and state grand juries are expected to take weeks, or even months, to complete a tax investigation of Harry and Leona Helmsley, who head major hotel and real estate operations in New York City. Authorities familiar with the case said yesterday that it was necessary to question many witnesses and scrutinize numerous documents before determining whether any charges would be filed against the couple. The investigation focuses on whether Mr. and Mrs. Helmsley had improperly charged the costs of extensive renovation work on their private estate in Greenwich, Conn., to their business operations, law-enforcement officials said. The officials said two rooms of business and financial records in the Helmsley organization's offices in Manhattan had been sealed to permit investigators to examine them. Subpoenas were issued for about 30 employees of the Helmsley organization to testify before a grand jury, according to people familiar with the tax investigation. The Helmsleys said in a statement issued by a spokesman that they ''adamantly deny any wrongdoing.'' The office of the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, is participating in a coordinated investigation of the Helmsley case, according to Timothy Gilles, the press secretary for Mr. Abrams. The investigation was said to involve inquiries about both Federal and state taxes and the filing of financial records. One issue was whether false invoices were used to make personal expenditures appear to be business expenses.

761-> STOCK STRENGTH PREDICTED...WITH HEAVY BOND DEMAND
With bond yields falling to their lowest level in about nine years, corporate treasurers displayed an awesome appetite for borrowing in 1986. More than $200 billion of new bonds were issued, twice the record set in 1985. And with bond rates expected to remain at those low levels, investment bankers predict that corporations will continue to flock - although in smaller numbers - to the market. Although many analysts forecast lower rates for early 1987, they acknowledge that the drop should not be as precipitous as the 2-percentage-point decline early last year, and some warn that rates might rise modestly late in 1987. Even so, securities dealers say that the catalysts for new corporate bond sales will be the same as last year: Corporate treasurers and local government officials remain eager to refinance bonds that were sold when interest rates were higher, and Wall Street financiers are still looking to the bond market as a key source of financing for mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructurings. Analysts at Salomon Brothers estimate that new corporate bond issues, after subtracting bonds that are refinanced, might total about $84 billion in 1987, down slightly from the record $90.9 billion in 1986. A Record in 'Junk Bonds' Apart from the activity stimulated by lower interest rates, a record $32.5 billion of high-yield ''junk bond'' financing was arranged last year. Although other Wall Street firms are devoting more resources to arranging sales of these speculative bond issues, Drexel Burnham Lambert continues to dominate the market. But even though Drexel's dominance of the junk bond market has elevated the firm into the ranks of the top 10 underwriters, its other underwriting activities fall short of the industry leaders. The First Boston Corporation, combined with Credit Suisse First Boston, its international affiliate, continues as the leading underwriter of debt securities, followed by Salomon Brothers, which is the largest firm in the American debt market. The growth of the market for high-yield, low-quality bonds has gone hand in hand with investors' growing appetite for such issues. Although some analysts, such as Edward Altman, a New York University professor, warn that a recession could ''cause higher rates of default than anything we have seen in the past,'' such warnings have not discouraged purchases of junk bonds by large investors. Those mutual funds and insurance companies are eager to continue earning the double-digit rates of the early 1980's, and for now, they seem satisfied that interest rates of 13 percent and more on junk bonds are high enough to compensate for the risk of default and the fact that junk bond prices do not rise as much as Treasury bonds when interest rates are falling. Of course, with yields of high- and medium-quality bonds at about their lowest levels in nine years, traditional bond financings to repay short-term debt or raise funds for expansion will continue. A few hundred of the nation's largest corporations have already filed shelf registration statements for more than $150 billion of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby clearing the way for a quick sale whenever market conditions are auspicious. ''The absolute level of rates was attractive last year,'' said Donald S. Howard, chief financial officer at Citicorp. That institution borrowed in the domestic long-term debt market last year - with two issues totaling $400 million - for the first time since 1980. Although acknowledging that the low interest rates will continue to tempt corporate treasurers, Mr. Howard noted: ''For the time being, we are like someone who just ate a large meal. Our appetite is reduced.'' Index Watching Will Continue Among investors, one 1986 trend that is sure to continue is the tendency to manage portfolios with the aim of equaling the performance of one of the indexes now compiled by securities dealers. Since only about a fourth of portfolio managers outperform the market, more pension funds and other institutions are directing their fund managers to match an index, rather than trying to outperform the market by guessing which way interest rates will move. ''The search now is for securities that will outperform the various bond market indexes, whether rates rise or fall,'' said H. Dean Benner, a managing director at Chase Investors Management Corporation. The mortgage securities market is one of the most fertile areas for custom-designed securities that meet the needs of investors such as Mr. Benner. After the introduction last year of stripped mortgage-backed securities - where principal and interest payments of outstanding mortgage securities were reallocated among two new securities - and floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations, investors can expect even more diversity in 1987. New Generation of Securities New Federal legislation allowing real estate mortgage investment conduits has cleared the way for a new generation of mortgage-backed securities that were not possible under previous tax laws. Analysts at Salomon Brothers, the leading firm in mortgage-backed securities financing, noted that these real estate conduits will lead to a proliferation of mortgage securities, including some whose credit quality will be far lower than the triple-A level that is now standard in the mortgage market. Elsewhere in the mortgage market, officials at Salomon Brothers said in its ''Prospects for Financial Markets in 1987'' that yields on mortgage pass-through securities - which rose sharply compared with Treasury bonds in 1986 - may decline relative to Treasury issues this year. Prepayments of mortgages should not continue at the same rapid rate as last year, and the supply of new mortgage securities should be reduced as homeowners finish refinancing old, high-interest mortgages. In the municipal bond market, the new Federal tax law was the most prominent development of the year, helping to shrink the supply of new tax-exempt bonds to about $143.5 billion in 1986 from $200 billion in 1985, according to IDD Information Services. In the coming year, investment bankers expect the amount of new financing to contract slightly. The new tax law limits the amount of financing for housing and other projects undertaken in cooperation with, or on behalf of, private businesses. To cope with the new limits on tax-exempt financings, securities dealers are preparing for an increase in taxable bond sales by local governments from the $4.4 billion of such issues that was sold last year. For investors, the most confusing aspect of the new tax law is the possibility that interest on some kinds of bonds, such as those for housing and student loans, may be subject to the personal alternative minimum income tax. Because that tax will generally apply only to individuals with large amounts of tax shelters or other preference items, interest on those bonds subject to the tax will still be tax-exempt for many investors. ''I'm telling people to take advantage of the other guy's minimum tax problem, and buy these new bonds with the higher yields,'' said James Lebenthal, president of a New York municipal bond firm bearing his name. Recent issues of bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax have been yielding about half a percentage point more than bonds of similar quality and maturity that are not subject to the tax.

763-> DRUG TESTING FOR CUSTOMS AGENTS IS ABANDONED BY THE WHITE HOUSE
In a major retreat, the Reagan Administration announced today that it would not require drug testing for agents and investigators hired by the United States Customs Service. The announcement came after a Federal district judge in Louisiana struck down the agency's drug-testing program last November, calling the program a ''gross invasion of privacy'' that was ''utterly repugnant to the United States Constitution.'' The Customs Service, which had stopped hiring without drug testing late last year, was under pressure to resume hiring because Congress, pressing the war on drugs, had provided money for 3,000 new Customs employees in addition to nearly 14,000 already in the agency. The dispute and the decision have implications for the entire Government. President Reagan has ordered all agencies to establish drug-testing programs for employees in ''sensitive positions.'' Screening Termed Necessary William von Raab, the Commissioner of Customs, halted hiring two months ago because the court barred drug testing but he insisted that agents be tested for the use of drugs. ''Drug screening is necessary to insure that the persons hired and entrusted with the enforcement of our nation's drug laws are not drug users themselves,'' Mr. von Raab said in an affidavit on Nov. 19. Mr. von Raab said in his affidavit that he was ''unaware of any specific drug problem'' among applicants for jobs at the Customs Service. But he added that the applicants were ''drawn from a society where drug abuse is widespread,'' and there was no reason to believe they were ''immune to a problem that has pervaded all socioeconomic classes.'' The Customs Service, which is responsible for stopping drugs at the nation's borders, resumed hiring today without drug testing but said it would persist in its appeal of the ruling in Louisiana. The delay in filling vacancies ''cannot continue,'' the Customs Service said. Violation of Fourth Amendment Mr. Reagan's effort to require drug testing of Federal employees has had several legal setbacks. Judges have generally said that such testing, in the absence of any reason to suspect drug use, violates the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which bars unreasonable searches and seizures. Despite the setbacks, Administration officials said they were not ready to abandon mandatory drug testing. The armed forces have had drug testing programs for several years, and the United States Court of Military Appeals has generally upheld them. The constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to the military, but the military authorities sometimes use different standards for determining what is reasonable. Thus, courts have held that military personnel, selected at random, may be compelled to give urine samples without probable cause. Six months ago the President called for ''a national crusade against drugs.'' But last week, in his budget for the fiscal year 1988, he proposed to cut funds for drug enforcement and education below the levels set by Congress. Lawmakers from both parties denounced the proposals, asserting that Mr. Reagan was cutting back his own campaign against narcotics. Defending its budget proposals, the Administration said the $3 billion requested for drug enforcement, prevention and treatment in 1988 was nearly three times the amount spent in 1981. Program Adopted Last July The Customs Service adopted its drug-testing program last July, two months before Mr. Reagan ordered testing at all agencies as part of a comprehensive effort to achieve a ''drug-free Federal workplace.'' The Louisiana case was filed by the National Treasury Employees Union on behalf of Customs Service employees. Under Mr. von Raab's plan, the Government tested people who were either hired for or promoted to positions as customs agents, inspectors and investigators. In his ruling last Nov. 14, Federal District Judge Robert F. Collins of New Orleans said the Customs Service was using a ''dragnet approach, a large-scale program of searches and seizures made without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion.''

764-> SPORTS PEOPLE; DUKE NAMES COACH
Steve Spurrier, a Heisman Trophy winner while playing quarterback for the University of Florida in 1966, was named the head football coach at Duke University yesterday. He replaces another former quarterback, Steve Sloan, who resigned earlier this week to become athletic director at his alma mater, the University of Alabama. Spurrier, 41 years old, who played with the San Francisco 49ers from 1967 to 1975, was offensive coordinator for Duke under Coach Red Wilson from 1980 to 1982. ''It's a good feeling to be able to come back somewhere where you've worked before, you know the people here, where you have a lot of friends,'' Spurrier said. He was head coach of the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League, but since the league suspended operations he had been working with the Hall of Fame Bowl committee in Tampa. . . . The University of Wyoming athletic director, Paul Roach, a former assistant football coach for the Cowboys, was named the university's new football coach.

765-> SEAT BELTS ON TRAINS WEIGHED AFTER DEADLY CRASH
The Federal Government's chief railroad safety officer said today that he would seek comments on whether seat belts should be installed on the passenger coaches of Amtrak and the five commuter rail systems that use the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. The official, John Riley, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, said he was not making a formal proposal for seat belts on passenger trains at this time but wanted to hear what railroad officials had to say in light of the collision of an Amtrak passenger train and three Conrail diesel engines last Sunday. Fifteen people were killed and 178 others were injured in the accident near Baltimore. ''It's an obvious issue,'' Mr. Riley said of the idea of installing seat belts. ''When you see an accident like this, there are all kinds of ideas that come up.'' The Government requires that seat belts be installed on all passenger cars sold in this country and on airplanes. Possible Tampering Is Found The Federal railroad agency also reported that its safety inspectors had found two more freight train engines with signal alarm whistles that appeared to have been deliberately disabled. Federal investigators found earlier that the signal alarm whistle in a cab of one of the Conrail engines involved in the fatal collision had been disabled through apparent tampering. That finding prompted the agency to order a special inspection of all train engines used in the Northeast Corridor. Meanwhile, a source familiar with the inquiry said evidence gathered by Federal investigators indicated that the Conrail engineer was going faster than he should have been going. Investigators say there is evidence indicating that the engineer, identified as Ricky Gates, was exceeding his allowed speed limit, traveling at 60 to 62 miles an hour up until the time he threw the train into emergency braking at or just before reaching the track signal closest to the point where the trains collided. The engineer has said that an earlier signal, about two miles from the point where the trains converged on a single set of tracks that goes over a bridge, displayed a signal indicating he should have slowed his engine to 45 miles an hour and prepared to go through the section where the tracks merged at 40 miles an hour. Signal to Slow Train Monitoring devices indicate that the initial signal required the engineer to slow his train to 30 miles an hour and to be prepared to stop at the signal closest to the junction. The signal had been set on this ''approach'' mode for about three hours, according to Federal investigators. An investigator said a bulb had been removed from the ''approach'' signal display on the Conrail engine, apparently after the accident. Investigators said they did not believe that the engineer removed the bulb, mainly because he told investigators that when he checked the engine out earlier in the day, all engine cab signal lights were functioning.

766-> BEAUTY; The Trend That Didn't Take
At the couture shows in Paris last fall and earlier this winter, a few designers unleashed a parade of flamboyant coiffed hairdos to go with their elaborately poufed evening dresses. The fashion pundits instantly predicted that women would be racing to salons for false hairpieces and layers of teasing - a fad that had faded with the 1960's. While the bustled and bouffant dresses of Paris were great successes there and in the United States - setting off a flurry of adaptations at every price range - the elaborate coifs many French women acquired have not been as triumphant here, at least judging from the hairstyles worn by women at various New York galas. Why the Parisian hairstyle didn't win a following the way the clothes did says something about American women and their tolerance for changing styles. While many women are willing to experiment with clothes, hair and makeup are part of a woman's identity; change them too radically and a woman's individuality is obscured. With the Parisian hairstyles, not only is the wearer thoroughly transformed but, in many cases, her hair no longer looks like human hair. Instead, it is sprayed and molded to resemble a heavy wig, a horse's tail, a hat - all of which are unacceptable to both American women and their hairstylists. Louis Javier, a leading hairdresser in Manhattan who works at the Thomas Morrissey Salon, says that some of his socialite clients - Pat Buckley, Nancy Kissinger, Pamela Harriman, for instance - ''already have a stamp. A more elaborate hairstyle wouldn't make them feel comfortable.'' And, he adds, ''I'm not a dictator. I don't say, 'You must do this.' Women today are secure.'' Perhaps the look also failed because it was too complicated and too time-consuming for American tastes. ''That kind of style takes hours of coiffing,'' says Mary Farr of the Kenneth Salon. Still, some hairstylists believe the complicated hairdos of Paris have turned American heads to a degree. ''Paris gives you the mood and then it filters down into everyday life,'' says Joseph Spadaro, another hairstylist at Thomas Morrissey, whose clients include Jacqueline Onassis. That trickle-down theory has resulted in less elaborate looks that are nevertheless carefully styled. For example, American women have translated the exaggerated bouffant ponytail shown at couture collections into subdued tied-back styles. Large black bows adorn those ponytails, and have become a best-selling hair accessory on both sides of the Atlantic. The ponytail idea is pervasive. Miss Farr says that even when she is not gathering the hair in a clip, ''90 percent of the time'' she pulls it away from the face and behind the ears in a shape that mimics the ponytail. For some women, the bouffant styles in Paris inspired fuller, softer shapes for hair. Ivana Trump, the wife of the real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump, prefers voluminous, wavy hair and often creates that style with her own hands and heated rollers. Among young American women, hair is done to look undone. Sometimes it takes a curling iron, blow-dryer, setting lotion and a professional hairdresser to simulate this intentionally tousled effect. ''Windblown, but in the right places'' is how Javier describes these creations. That could also describe John Sahag's design for Diandra Douglas, the wife of the actor Michael Douglas. Mr. Sahag, who owns the John Sahag Salon in Manhattan, curls sections of Mrs. Douglas's hair and leaves other sections untouched. ''I didn't want her to look as if she just had her hair done,'' he says. ''It looks very real.'' In fact, that hair - even carefully coiffed hair - looks real could sum up what American women want.

767-> COMPANY NEWS; TURNER DISCUSSING SALE OF POSSIBLY LARGE STAKE
Ted Turner, head of the financially troubled Turner Broadcasting System, may be negotiating to sell a significant piece of his 80 percent stake in the television and cable company, Wall Street analysts and sources close to Turner Broadcasting said yesterday. The company refused to say how much stock might be sold. Some analysts thought that it was too early in the negotiations to assess the situation but felt that Mr. Turner would fight vigorously to maintain control - even if he sold a substantial stake. Speculation over the possible sale by the broadcaster developed after Turner Broadcasting released a 49-word statement saying only that it was discussing a possible ''infusion of equity capital into the company'' by what it called ''a group of cable operators.'' The company said that discussions were continuing on the possible infusion of capital but stressed that there was ''no assurance'' the talks would lead to any firm agreement. It described the capital infusion under discussion as ''material'' but would not elaborate. Storer Communications said that it was a member of the group. Reuters news service quoted Andy Holgate, a spokesman, as saying, ''We have been approached by Turner Broadcasting and expect to talk with them in the relatively near future concerning an opportunity for investment in their company.'' Cox Communications said it had also been approached and was examining the proposal, Reuters added. Drexel Burnham Lambert, which has advised Turner in the past, is thought to be helping the company round up possible investors. It did not return phone calls for comment. Mr. Turner's office in Atlanta said the executive was not available for comment, and other officers declined to elaborate except to say that the group it mentioned referred to ''a number of different operators'' that would be independent of one another. A company spokesman, Arthur Sando, said the statement was made after the stock began trading heavily on the American Stock Exchange in the last few days. It said the Amex had not asked for the statement. Turner common stock jumped $2.875, to $18, in heavy trading yesterday. Its preferred stock rose 50 cents, to $9.50, also in heavy trading. Last Wednesday, almost 3 million preferred shares changed hands as word spread that new money might be coming into the company. Turner lost nearly $120 million in the first nine months of 1986 on revenues of $401 million. It earned $15.6 million in the period a year earlier on revenues of $259.4 million. Analysts who follow Turner and other cable television executives felt strongly that the discussions under way might involve Telecommunications Inc. of Denver, the nation's biggest cable television operator, and its president, John C. Malone. Telecommunications owns about 3 percent of Turner Broadcasting. Mr. Malone did not return calls made to his Denver office. Kenneth T. Berents, who follows Turner for the Baltimore investment house of Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., said he had heard from his sources that several of the big cable operators might be talking to Turner Broadcasting, including Telecommunications and the American Television and Communications Corporation, an 80 percent owned Time Inc. subsidiary. In Denver, James C. Duffy, a spokesman for A.T.C., said none of the executives were availbale for comment. Some analysts declined to speculate on how much money might be attracted. One analyst, asking not to be identified, said he thought $100 million to $150 million, ''or even less,'' might be the target figure for the present. The Turner spokesman, Mr. Sando, said the company owed $150 million in short-term debt and $1.2 billion in long-term debt stemming from its $1.6 billion purchase of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company with high-yield securities, or ''junk bonds.'' He said that no payments were overdue but that the interest rate climbed a half-point every quarter the debt remained unpaid. The next deadline is March 15, he said.

768-> PANEL BACKS LICENSING OF AIDS DRUG
In a highly unusual step, a panel of expert medical advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended today that a promising drug against AIDS be licensed for sale despite what the scientists described as major gaps in knowledge about its effectiveness and safety. ''An extraordinary situation requires extraordinary measures,'' said one of the panelist, Dr. Stanley M. Lemon of the University of North Carolina. The drug, azidothymidine, or AZT, is the first shown to prolong the lives of AIDS patients. The recommendation to license the antiviral drug is not binding on the Federal agency, which is not expected to decide the issue for weeks at least. But it sharply improved the prospects for approval of the drug, which is manufactured by the Burroughs Wellcome Company of Research Triangle Park, N.C. Through the day of discussions the committee was torn by what several of its members termed an excruciating ''dilemma.'' Members noted that knowledge about the drug, known to have serious toxic side effects, was far more limited than what is normally required to approve a drug for marketing. But the panel concluded that an exception should be made for the only drug yet found effective against a spreading killer for which no other treatment exists. Once a drug is licensed, doctors may prescribe it to any patient they feel it will help. But the panel supported approval of AZT only after hearing assurances from Burroughs Wellcome that the company, in close consultation with outside experts, would restrict availability of AZT to patients who, studies indicate, would be helped more than harmed. A Call for Major Research The panel said use of the drug should be restricted to selected categories of AIDS patients for whom it was known to be beneficial. It called for major additional research on its effectiveness and safety. The panel concluded that existing research proved only that the benefits outweighed the risks for 24 weeks in AIDS patients who had recovered from a form of pneumonia and certain patients with AIDS Related Complex who showed signs of serious damage to their immune systems. In the single controlled clinical study that has been completed, AZT prolonged the lives of these patients but it also caused severe anemia and other blood problems in many. The scientists stressed how much was not known about AZT, including its long-term effectiveness and toxicity and its interactions with other drugs. The vote to recommend licensing of AZT, with the noted reservations, was 10 to 1. The lone dissenter was the panel's chairman, Dr. Itzhak Brook, who said he feared health officials might regret ''releasing the genie out of the bottle.'' Dr. Brook and some other experts who attended the meeting today said they feared the drug would be misused by many people who were infected by the AIDS virus but who had mild symptoms or none at all. These scientists would prefer to continue the current distribution system until more research data are available. Under the current system, more than 3,000 carefully selected patients have received the drug at no cost as researchers have gathered data. Complicating the drug's future is a supply shortage, which company officials said would be alleviated only gradually this year. Dr. David Barry, vice president for research at Burroughs Wellcome, outlined the company's unusual proposal to control distribution of AZT. He said the plan, which is still being designed, would curb dangerous misuse and insure that a limited supply went to the patients who needed it most. The company will require doctors to provide medical profiles of patients, and a committee of scientists will decide which patients qualify to receive AZT. The panel did not try to resolve the difficult question of exactly which types of AIDS patients, if any, beyond the narrow range studied so far should have access to the drug. Dr. Barry and several scientists at the meeting today argued that, in addition to the patients who have had the pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii, or have certain severe AIDS-related conditions, many AIDS patients with other infections brought on by immune deficiency would probably also benefit. Many experts at the meeting appeared to agree that dispensing AZT to AIDS patients who had suffered only Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, should be deferred until the completion of a study that is under way. Who should qualify for the drug will be the subject of intensive discussions between the company, officials of the Food and Drug Administration and other scientists in the weeks ahead. In contrast with the existing program for distributing AZT, Dr. Barry said, the proposed controls would involve far less paper work for physicians. Several members of the advisory panel stressed the need for studies of AZT's effectiveness in healthy carriers of the AIDS virus, to see if it can prevent them from developing AIDS. Dr. Barry said such studies were planned but that enough AZT would not be available until the spring. This week the manufacturer of another potential anti-AIDS drug, ribavarin, said it planned ask the F.D.A. to permit a special distribution program of the drug before it is licensed. The company, ICN Pharmaceuticals, did not say how the program would be organized or who would receive the drug.

769-> Chile Lifts Nighttime Curfew In Effect in Capital Since '84
Chile's military Government announced today that it was lifting a two-year-old nighttime curfew in Santiago, the latest in a series of steps designed to improve the country's image abroad. Two days ago President Augusto Pinochet announced that a state of siege in effect since September would expire next week. He also announced that the Government would permit most of Chile's several thousand political exiles to return home over the next 90 days. In a brief announcement today, the security authorities said the curfew was being suspended with immediate effect in Santiago and the coastal province of San Antonio, the only regions in which it was still being applied. The curfew, between 2 A.M. and 5 A.M., had been in force since November 1984.

772-> NEW ORLEANS FACES HARD TAX CHOICE
Among many debates in New Orleans stirred up by depressed oil prices, two have meshed in a hot political battle to be decided this week. The issues are crime and taxes. On Saturday New Orleans Voters will have the chance to do what has historically been anathema to residents of the state: increase property taxes. If approved, the tax increase would raise about $16 million a year for the Police and Fire Departments and emergency medical services, compensating for drastic budget cuts that were forced by declining revenue. The proposal would increase property taxes $1.20 for each $1,000 of assessment. There is no debate over whether the money is needed. The city budget has been so strained that the city government was forced to operate for much of the fall on a four-day week. In addition, a recent rash of armed robberies has dramatically highlighted the budget cuts in the Police Department. The city's uniformed police force has been reduced to 1,300 from 1,510 in 1978, and there have been reducations in the department's civilian employees as well. The city now has 800 firefighters, as against 1,026 in 1977. Chamber Opposes the Tax But the proposed tax increase is vehemently opposed by the Chamber of Commerce, two influential Councilmen and four of the city's seven tax assessors, among others. Most of the opponents say a service charge on residents would would be preferable. Details of such a charge have not been specified. The underlying cause of the budget shortage, say those for and against the tax increase, is Louisiana's unusually low property tax and the way it is applied in New Orleans, falling primarily on business and rental property. Most New Orleans homeowners pay no property tax because of a state law that gives a tax exemption to homes assessed at less than $75,000. Opponents of the tax increase say that while the new tax would give the Police and Fire Departments much-needed money, it would also drive businesses and renters to the suburbs, where taxes are lower. Those favoring the tax increase include Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who inherited a $30 million budget deficit from his predecessor, Ernest N. Dutch Morial. Others favoring the tax are five of the city's seven Councilmen, the Police and Fire Departments and tourism officials. The tax proposal is the most recent attempt by politicians to keep the city's public safety measures intact amid the storm of concern about crime. In late September, voters turned down a proposed $195 property service charge. In early October, Council members voted for a 1.5 percent city tax on wages, and the tax is now the subject of a lawsuit challenging its validity. The city already has a 9 percent sales tax. ''There is no other window open,'' says Lambert C. Boissiere Jr., the Councilman who is leading the fight for the property tax, which is the only issue on the ballot. ''The main message is, do you want to make New Orleans a safer city?'' 'Taxes Running People Out' Tom Arnold, one of the tax assessors who is fighting the proposal, said: ''What we need in this city is more taxpayers, not more taxes. Taxes are running people out.'' Louis E. Madere, former chief city economist, who is now executive director of the private nonpartisan Bureau of Governmental Research in New Orleans, said the proposed tax was ''just bad government.'' Mr. Madere said a 1983 city survey found that 60 percent of the property taxes collected here came from businesses, 38 percent from renters and 2 percent from homeowners. Fuel was added to the debate last week when Patricia Lobaugh, a visitor from Ohio, was shot to death in an apparent robbery at 9:30 A.M. on a sightseeing expedition. She had been taking photographs in Louis Armstrong Park, a tourist attraction on the edge of the French Quarter. While there is wide agreement that crime is soaring here, encouraged by high unemployment and the police cutbacks, there has been a delay in measuring the increase because of the police shortage. Budget cuts last August wiped out the entire crime analysis division. The most recent crime statistics, announced last month but tallied only through September, show a 33 percent increase in armed robberies over the same period in 1985. But Sgt. Juan Quinton said that armed robberies were lower than usual in 1985. In any case, fear of crime is widespread here. New Orleans boosters say talk of a crime wave has come at a particularly awkward time, when the city is working hard to convince both the Democratic and Republican Parties to hold their 1988 conventions in the Louisiana Superdome. A recent cartoon in The Times-Picayune shows a woman brandishing a large gun while her husband prepares to take out the garbage. ''Honey,'' he says, ''I'm gonna take out the trash. Cover me!'' The cartoon appears at the top of a full-page advertisment, run periodically by the newspaper as a community service, giving tips on how to avoid crime. ''Terrifying because it's virtually true,'' says the cartoon's caption. The Times-Picayune opposes the tax and has recommended a service charge to bolster protection.

774-> AMARILLO'S ANSWER TO STONEHENGE
Don't Mess With Texas'' read the signs at the state line. It was the nonwimpy approach to highway beautification, an antilittering campaign that didn't say please. The man on the radio was hawking a Bible Challenge Contest (''the answers are in the Book'') and an 800-number hot line for Satanists, drug addicts and prostitutes who needed help. Outside was wide-horizon ranch country, a land so flat and treeless you could watch a grain elevator appear as a distant point on the horizon, loom larger and larger as the miles rolled by and finally glide past your window and be gone. We were well shy of the halfway mark on a 10-day journey from Los Angeles to New York, but after two nights in the small-town artiness of Santa Fe it felt good to be whizzing across the high plains of Texas toward Amarillo. Amarillo is a town with more millionaires than Santa Fe and maybe even more art, but it's not the sort of place that has quaint adobe shopping centers or a lot of galleries featuring native handicrafts. Amarillo's major native handicraft is the atomic bomb, which is assembled in the local Pantex plant, a place that does not offer tours. Georgia O'Keeffe once taught there, but the art Amarillo's known for now is on a whole different scale. Out on Boys Ranch Road is the ''Floating Mesa,'' a flat-topped escarpment with its middle third wrapped in blue plastic so the top seems to float on air. Jutting out into a lake is Robert Smithson's ''Amarillo Ramp,'' which looks like it belongs in a parking garage except that it's made out of earth and it doesn't lead to anything. And on the western outskirts, in an alfalfa field beside Interstate 40, is the Ant Farm's ''Cadillac Ranch'': 10 battered Cadillacs, huge finned relics from the late 40's to the early 60's, buried nose-down in the ground at the precise angle of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The ''Cadillac Ranch'' combines the monumentality of Stonehenge with the mystery of an auto graveyard. It marks the apogee of the American century. Both the ''Ranch'' and the ''Ramp'' owe their existence to Stanley Marsh 3d, a man who has been messing with Texas for some time now. Marsh inherited a fortune in oil and has parlayed that into a small media empire, but his taste in civic monuments has earned him a certain notoriety. Amarillo is not the sort of place where you can take a sledgehammer to 10 perfectly good Cadillacs and leave them half-buried in the ground with impunity, no matter what kind of money you have. For years the ''Cadillac Ranch'' was ignored in Amarillo's official tourist literature in favor of more conventional attractions like the Amarillo Livestock Auction and the International Helium Monument. (Amarillo, one learns at a display in the rest area outside of town, sits atop the largest helium field in the free world.) None of these are major draws, however, and even Amarillo's most fervent boosters are likely to admit that it's the sort of place most folks just drive through on their way to some place else. The ''Cadillac Ranch'' exists for them, a drive-by attraction in a drive-through town. Which was exactly what I had in mind. I quickly discovered that it's not all that easy to find any more. In 1974, when the members of the Ant Farm collective flew in to set the cars in concrete and bury them in the ground, the site was well out in the country. Now it's on the edge of town, half-lost in a clutter of motels and RV parks, with a shopping center just down the road. Out on the plains, 10 Cadillacs sticking out of the ground might be visible for a couple of miles. Here you could miss them altogether, which is what we did. On our second pass we caught sight of them on the right, rowed up together in the middle of a large, square field several hundred yards from the highway. They looked surprisingly small. They also looked surreal, like the product of some extraterrestial event. In Arizona we'd been lured off the Interstate by an official-looking sign promising a meteor crater of some significance. Six miles across the desert later we'd discovered that the meteor had apparently landed next to a parking lot and an ugly brick building that was now being used as a gift shop and ticket booth for the crater. If the crater had been left by a giant Cadillac we might have stayed. Certainly these cars, with their flaring tail fins and their rakish tilt, looked like they might have cruised in through the stratosphere and embedded themselves in the earth, zap! zap! zap! - an intergalactic precision flying team sending who knows what message. Maybe they were the chariots of the gods. We decided to stop for a visit. This was in itself a perverse act. The whole point of the ''Cadillac Ranch'' is that you don't stop for it; it's like a billboard, and nobody stops at billboards. Nonetheless we pulled off the Interstate at the next exit, turned left across the railroad tracks to Amarillo Boulevard - the old Route 66 -and worked our way back to the service road on the right side of the highway. There was no parking lot, no gift shop, no ticket booth; the ''Ranch'' in its neglect existed in a pristine state, out of sight even of the shopping center. It was fenced in with barbed wire, but halfway down the road was a small farm gate, closed but with a well-worn path leading directly across the field to the cars. We parked next to a huge puddle from the previous day's rain and climbed the gate. The Cadillacs had long since been discovered by teen-agers armed with spray paint. What had been multicolored was now a dull red and scrawled with messages: ''Joe + Diane,'' ''Wild and Innocent,'' ''Brett L. -n- Laura S. 4ever.'' There was an air of ruination about, a post-apocalyptic suggestion of a once-great civilization that had enjoyed a brief rococo phase before going over the edge. The earth around the cars was slightly sunken, as at a grave. Black and loamy, it covered the front seats and dashboards. Jagged hunks of glass stuck out of the window frames. Tires were slashed, rear seats unsprung. Birds were singing all around, and from the Interstate you could hear the lonely whine of traffic. We walked back to the service road, our shoes caked with mud, and headed east into a wraparound sunset. The next morning, over breakfast at the Country Kitchen, we discussed the day's itinerary. The place was like something out of a Sam Shepard play, a white metal shack beside a dusty country road where motherly women dished out scrambled eggs and sausage biscuits while a statuesque blonde lingered idly in the kitchen as if dreaming of escape. The only place to go seemed to be the Last Chance Liquor Store next door. We sat at the counter and spread out a map and decided to take Route 66 out of town. Half an hour later we were driving through a neon strip that looked like a set from the ''Twilight Zone.'' Amarillo Boulevard dated from the same era as the cars in the ''Cadillac Ranch'' and seemed to be in roughly the same condition. We passed through a desultory gantlet of lonely cocktail lounges, deserted hamburger joints and neon motels: the Crystal Pistol Burlesque, the Zest-E Burger, the Silver Spurs Motel, the Wagon Wheel Motel, the Sneak Joint, the Alibi Lounge. Jet fighters streaked overhead, dust blew across the road. At the edge of town, next to a white cinderblock lounge (''Texas Giggilos,'' read the sign, ''Ladies Night Every Saterday''), we found an icon as full of pathos as the ''Ranch'': the Trail Drive-In. It had a large ''For Sale'' sign and several ''No Trespassing'' signs plastered across the front, but that didn't hide the faded grandeur of its cinderblock screen. We turned into a rutted entryway and parked. The Trail was a drive-in that was built to last. Other drive-ins may have put their screens on stilts; the Trail's was more solid than the Alamo. High walls flanked it on both sides, but we found a doorway that led to the playground, where kids had doubtless frolicked beneath the flickering light of ''High Noon'' and ''Shane.'' It was choked with weeds now, the broken-down swings all covered in rust. A boarded-up refreshment stand stood out in the parking area like a pink bunker, surrounded by speaker poles that stuck out of the ground at crazy angles. In the distance a single grain elevator rose out of the plains. It suddenly struck me how prophetic Stanley Marsh's vision had been: the Texas plains of the 50's, full of bluster and bravado, half-buried now in anticipation of archeology majors from the next millennium. We got in the car and drove on.

775-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Bearish Sentiment Seen Weighing on the Dollar
The wave of speculative trading that roiled the world's currency markets again yesterday capped a week that will be long remembered among market participants. Although the dollar experienced wide intraday moves against such key currencies as the mark and the yen in the five sessions, by the close yesterday it was only slightly below where it began on Monday. The dollar closed at 1.9175 marks yesterday, down three-tenths of 1 percent for the week, and it finished at 158.25 yen, down slightly from an opening bid of 158.80 on Monday. But the modest decline masked a conviction among market participants that the dollar must go lower. ''The basic sentiment, both technically and fundamentally, is bearish for the dollar,'' said Michael Snow, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland. ''It is as bearish as I have ever seen it.'' Day after day, the pressure of aligning currencies pushed the European Monetary System almost to the breaking point as traders became increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for the dollar. This prompted increased buying of marks, the preferred European currency, which in turn exacerbated the strain within the E.M.S. and generated billions of dollars worth of trades. ''It's only been a week,'' said Richard E. Witten, a vice president in the foreign exchange department at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''It feels like a month.'' The Bank of Japan's intervention did cause a brief rally in the dollar yesterday during trading in Asia, but it weakened against the yen later in trading in Europe and New York. To prevent their own currencies from moving too much against the mark, at least four other European central banks, including those of France and Italy, entered the market this week to support their currencies. The Banque de France, which reportedly had reserve losses of about $8 billion during December as it tried to protect the franc's value against the mark, was in the market at least five times this week, traders said. Tensions within the E.M.S. have created opportunities for traders to profit through ''cross rate'' trades, which are trades involving currencies other than the dollar. ''The cross rates has been where the action is, particularly the 'Iron Cross,' the franc-mark exchange rate,'' said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief foreign exchange trader at Credit Lyonnais in New York. GOLD PRICES RISE By The Associated Press - Gold rose yesterday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $405.50, up $3.75 an ounce from Thursday. Earlier, in London and Zurich, gold rose to $404. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at $406, up $3.70.

776-> PIERRE M. GEORGE
Pierre M. George, senior officer of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, died Thursday at Roosevelt Hospital after a long illness. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. George, who was an accountant, was born and educated in Greece. He was financial adviser to the Archdiocese, which is based in Manhattan. He served over a 50-year period under three archbishops and was awarded the St. Paul Medal, the highest award of the Archdiocese for lay people. He is survived by his wife, Calomoira; a daughter, Bessie Nicholas of Manhattan, and a grandchild.

777-> TECHNICALITY VOIDS CHARGES OF BIGAMY AGAINST A PHYSICIAN
A Manhattan doctor arrested on bigamy charges will probably not be prosecuted because of a legal technicality here and the unwillingness of prosecutors to pursue the case in Iowa, where he is said to have married his second wife in December. On Thursday, the doctor, Henry Edelson, 29 years old, was arrested at the 17th Precinct stationhouse on the East Side, where he had come voluntarily after his first wife, Penny Gaston Edelson, 46, complained that he was a bigamist. But the arrest was voided hours later after the police and officials from the Manhattan District Attorney's office discovered a 1955 court decision that appeared to rule out prosecution here. In that case, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled that when a second marriage occurs in another state, it is not an offense against the people of New York. Mrs. Edelson has not decided if she intends to complain in Iowa, and officials there appear less than eager to take on the case. Jim Ramey, chief assistant attorney for Polk County, Iowa, said he would prefer to devote his time and resources to murders and robberies. A Hope for Reconciliation ''I'm worried about people who walk down the street, not people who walk down the aisle,'' he said. The first Mrs. Edelson said she and Dr. Edelson had not been divorced, and she hoped for the reconciliation she says her husband mentioned on visits after their September 1985 separation. But on Dec. 13, Dr. Edelson, a resident in internal medicine at the New York University Medical Center, married Katherine Salisbury, reported to be 24, in West Des Moines. Neither Dr. Edelson nor his second wife could be reached for comment. The first Mrs. Edelson, who said she worked to put her husband through medical school, added that she feels ''very devastated.'' Her lawyer, Lloyd Merrill, said he might pursue the matter in Iowa. ''This whole thing has been something of a firestorm,'' Mr. Merrill said. ''We're all trying to catch our breath.'' Officials in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said they could not remember another arrest for bigamy in the last decade.

778-> AIRLINER SAFETY PRACTICE DEBATED
The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration today rejected a proposal that widespread resumption of in-flight holding patterns be resumed to ease airline departure delays. ''It's much better to take your delays on the ground,'' the Administrator, Donald D. Engen, said in an interview after testifying before a Senate panel holding hearings on aviation safety. ''If you put them in the air it's just more mischance,'' Mr. Engen said, referring to the once-routine practice of allowing airliners to take off on schedule and then circle their destination if they could not land on schedule. The agency has allowed in-flight holding in recent months, Mr. Engen told members of the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. But he said this was done only on a limited basis and at selected airports. Still, the Air Transport Association, which represents major scheduled airlines and proposed last year that the practice of in-flight holding be resumed, took issue with the Administrator's position and rationale. ''F.A.A. data show that considerable holding is being used in day-to-day operations at a number of major airports, always consistent with safety,'' said Daniel Z. Henkin, the association's senior vice president for public information. ''Air traffic controllers are handling airborne holdings in a routine, professional manner.'' Mr. Engen's testimony came a day after Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the Secretary of Transportation, proposed that a limited antitrust law exemption be granted to commercial airlines to discuss reducing flight congestion and delays. Mr. Engen did not discuss the proposal today.

779-> ART: 17 EARLY PAINTINGS BY GERHARD RICHTER
THE exhibition of Gerhard Richter's early work at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery (99 Greene Street) reveals only the tip of the iceberg of this West German artist's polymorphous production. Nonetheless, the 17 paintings on view (through Jan. 17), made between 1964 and 1974, constitute the largest group of Richter's work from this period ever exhibited in New York. They provide important background material on an artist who, despite his considerable reputation, is something of an enigma here. During the period covered by this show, European painting was not getting a lot of play in New York; Conceptual Art and Process Art were the imports of choice. Richter, who was born in Dresden in 1932 and emigrated from East to West Germany in 1961, had his first one-person show in Dusseldorf in 1963; but he did not have a solo exhibition in New York until 1978. At that point he proceeded to become quite well known for big, hotly colored gestural abstractions (which always managed to be oddly photographic in their spatial effects) and for photo-based landscapes and paintings of lighted candles. This exhibition establishes that the polarities of Richter's art have long been the photographic image at one extreme and pure painting, as material and process, at the other. And it shows several of the ways Richter has worked back and forth between the two, in the process irrevocably blurring the distinction between abstraction and representation, as have many other artists his age and younger. Richter emerges here as an artist who fits in at several points in the terrain of American art; his work relates to Photo-Realism, Pop Art and Minimalism. He is also an early appropriator, for the most part using only existing images and configurations in his work. When he wants to paint a landscape, Richter copies a page from a guidebook onto a canvas, captions and all. ''Egyptian Landscape'' of 1964 gives us four views of ancient sites isolated on a ground of creamy white paint as if on a big page. This painting brings to mind the 1960's transcriptions of shipboard postcards by Malcolm Morley, who also brought a distinctly cerebral edge to Photo Realism. When Richter makes an abstract painting, it, too, often has a real-life source: two of the abstract paintings here are based on enlarged copies of a paint company's color charts, reproducing exactly the hard shiny look of paint chips. Left to his own devices, without an image to work from, Richter can emphasize process to the exclusion of all else. ''Gray,'' a painting that is not as interesting to look at as most others here, but that provides important clues to Richter's sensibility, is simply a large canvas covered with thick brushstrokes of gray paint. Richter balances most precisely the two extremes of his art in ''Townscape PL'' of 1970. Here, working from an aerial view of a city, he creates a sloshy network of grisaille brushstrokes that, without yielding precise information, leave no question about the image's source. Everywhere precise depiction is alluded to and then thwarted. A favorite device is to pull what artists call a blending brush across a realistic image so that it acquires a horizontal blur, reminding us that the image is paint, nothing but paint. This occurs in the aforementioned ''Egyptian Landscape,'' in the 1971 portrait of Brigid Polk (done from a Polaroid photo) and in the particularly wonderful ''Alfa Romeo (With Text)'' of 1965. Here the blurring of the car's image makes the vehicle seem to be moving, a suggestion of speed that contrasts absolutely with the slow methodical painting of the text that fills the left side of the canvas. In other paintings, especially the 1967 ''Lamp'' and the 1969 ''Sea Piece (Gray-Green, Cloudy),'' it is the depiction of light that blurs and distorts the image, reminding us once more of its painted state. This is a show that starts out cold but ends up rather hot, and it is Richter's attention to the various painted states of his images that raises the temperature. His impersonal coolness is so consistent that it has become the unifying characteristic of his highly diverse art, and this is understandable. But spend some time with these paintings, and their coolness gives way to a workmanlike but subtly impassioned rendering in which research and improvisation meet and the hand has its say. Also of interest this week: Richard Tuttle (Blum Helman, 20 West 57th Street): Richard Tuttle's scrappy little wall sculptures, fashioned out of cardboard, Styrofoam and bits of wire and wood and then brightly painted, continue to be an affront to well-made, heavy, expensive-looking art, of which there is much these days. On first encounter, Tuttle's delicate constructions could be the work of an exceptionally talented child or naive artist; they seem to be the kind of work that even a mother might inadvertently toss out. But second or third encounters overturn these impressions and suggest that Tuttle is pursuing his own eccentric brand of Minimalism, a highly individualized argument concerning how less can be more both esthetically and ecologically. His ''less'' lies in his use of materials that are modest, inartistic and virtually biodegradable, in his avoidance of overt craftsmanship and in his reliance on an intimate scale that brings the viewer up close to his works. His ''more'' emanates from his vibrant color, the energetic quirkiness of his forms, and the unexpected way these structures, so seemingly abstract, coalesce into semi-legible images: his ship at sea, a red-roofed house beside a row of trees, a possible parrot. Underlying all this seems to be the insistence that valuable visual perceptions should have as little as possible to do with obvious measures of value. Thus an art that seems to be purely formal and exceedingly poetic comes around to the political by the back door. (Through tomorrow.) ''Text and Image: The Wording of American Art'' (Holly Solomon Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street): This is an exhibition of some 40 artists who, one way or another, have incorporated language into their art. It spans the generations from Stuart Davis and Robert Motherwell through Jasper Johns and Nancy Graves to such recently emerged East Village talents as Peter Nagy and Tim Rollins and K.O.S. Along the way, styles as diverse as Pop, Conceptual and graffiti art are represented. Although it comes on like a year's-end hodgepodge, it adds up to a rather carefully selected survey. Words, it turns out, have served American artists well, and vice-versa. Some of them, such as Jenny Holzer, Jonathan Borofsky and William Wegman, use words to tell a story or deliver a message. Others, such as Davis and Judy Pfaff, use single words for their decorative, streetwise punch. Still others do a little of both -Barbara Kruger, Ed Ruscha, Robert Indiana and Neil Jenney, in particular. In certain extreme instances, such as the work of Lawrence Weiner and Joseph Kosuth, what you read is what you get (to paraphrase Frank Stella). In their pieces, language is used almost as abstractly as the black square in a painting by Malevich. The exhibition's highlights are many, and include the Davis painting ''Untitled (Variation on Pochade),'' a late work in which his usual jostling forms are outlined in black on bare white canvas; Larry Rivers's endearing ''Brushed Camel'' (after the cigarette), and, of particular interest, a little-known painting from 1968 by John Baldessari. Titled ''A 1968 Painting,'' it combines its name with a grisaille rendition of a Stella protractor painting; from certain angles, especially a post-Modernist one, this work looks extremely up to date. (Through tomorrow.)

781-> GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO PLEDGES QUICK ACTION TO REQUIRE SPRINKLERS
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon acknowledged today that the Dupont Plaza Hotel, scene of the fatal New Year's Eve fire, did not have a sprinkler system because one is not required by Puerto Rican law. The Governor said the law would be amended as soon as possible to force all hotels to install them. In a news conference on the grounds of the hotel, the Governor said a sprinkler system would not have been effective in this fire, where many guests and hotel workers were caught by surprise. Rule on Hotel Inspections Assistant Fire Chief Jose Carrasquillo said in an interview that the department was supposed to inspect all the hotels at least once a year, but that it was not always done because of shortages in personnel. He said he did not know the last time the Dupont Plaza had been inspected. He said the inspections were held to make certain that fire exits were adequately marked, that hallways were kept clear, that hoses attached to standpipes were in working order and that there were fire extinguishers in the kitchens and other areas in which fire hazards might exist. Mr. Carrasquillo said the regulations were based on Federal norms, but he could not say what Federal agency had drawn up the norms. He said the regulations were adequate. ''We have had fires in many of the major hotels in the past and put them out uneventfully before any major damage was done,'' he said. ''This time there were circumstances that did not appear normal.'' The 420-room Dupont Plaza was built as the Sheraton Hotel in 1963, at the height of an island tourist boom. It opened the day before another major hotel, the Ponce de Leon, opened 10 blocks away in the Condado Beach area. Hilton a Pioneer in Industry In between were the Condado Beach hotel and La Concha and such smaller hotels as Hotel LaRada. The tourist industry in Puerto Rico began in 1949 with the opening of the Caribe Hilton on a rocky peninsula west of the Condado area. The 400-room Hilton was built by the commonwealth government in the hope it would start things in the tourist industry on the island. As a safeguard, the hotel was designed so it could easily be converted into a hospital. The government invited several large hotel chains to operate its new hotel, but the only one that expessed interest was Conrad Hilton, who then owned a large number of hotels on the mainland. The hotel was an instant success, giving birth to the island's hotel industry and to Hilton Hotels International. Another hotel was opened by the InterContinental Hotel chain several miles to the east in Isla Verde, near the airport. Government Then Built Another The government followed by building La Concha in the heart of the Condado area, then the site of stately homes and mansions by the sea, and invited another hotel chain to manage it. The Condado Beach Hotel, which was built in 1919, was refurbished and expanded by its owners, contributing to establishing the area as the primary hotel district. With so many hotel rooms on the market and so many islands building up their own tourism, Puerto Rican tourism developed into a spotty picture, particularly since the middle 70's. The season now under way was considered the best in 10 years.

Whitney Houston's two-year-old album has brought her five American Music Awards, while Lionel Richie, whose album was not even nominated, won four awards for songs and videos from his ''Dancing on the Ceiling'' album. Miss Houston won favorite female vocalist and album in the pop-rock category and claimed the female vocalist, album and video-single honors in the soul-rhythm-and-blues category when the awards were made Monday night. A song and a video from the same ''Whitney Houston'' album brought her two American Music Awards in 1986. The awards, based on a popularity poll, have no deadline for consideration. Mr. Richie was chosen favorite male pop vocalist, male vocalist and male video artist in the soul-rhythm-and-blues category and won the video-single award for ''Dancing on the Ceiling'' in the pop-rock category. Alabama won three awards: favorite country album for ''Greatest Hits,'' favorite country group and favorite country video group. Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Ocean and the mother-daughter country duo The Judds won two awards each.

785-> GRAND MET TO BUY NABISCO'S HEUBLEIN
RJR Nabisco Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Heublein Inc. wine and spirits subsidiary to Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the British brewing, hotel and leisure concern, for $1.2 billion. The acquisition, which will make Grand Metropolitan one of the world's biggest producers of wine and spirits, reflects the continuing restructuring in that industry. The announcement comes less than two weeks after Heublein said it was expanding its product line by buying Almaden Vineyards Inc., one of California's largest wine makers, from the National Distillers and Chemical Corporation for an undisclosed amount. That acquisition made Heublein, which already owned Inglenook and Beaulieu Vineyard, the second-largest wine producer in California behind the E. & J. Gallo Winery. Almaden will be included in the Heublein acquisition. 11 Percent of the Market Heublein, based in Hartford, markets nearly 100 brands of spirits, wines and imported beers, including Smirnoff vodka and Jose Cuervo tequila. It has a major presence in the domestic wine and liquor business, with about 11 percent of the market. Heublein had an operating profit of about $145 million in 1985, and 1986 results show profit growth, the British conglomerate said. It had revenues of about $1.3 billion last year. Grand Metropolitan's major products include J & B Scotch whisky, Bailey's Irish Cream and Gilbey's gin. The company has had a marketing relationship with Heublein since 1953. It has marketed Smirnoff in the Commonwealth nations and in parts of Europe, while Heublein has handled the British company's Black Velvet Canadian whisky in the United States. Analysts said that RJR Nabisco got an impressive price for Heublein, receiving a premium of about $500 million on the unit's book value. Reynolds Paid $1.3 Billion Five years ago, Heublein was bought for $1.3 billion by R. J. Reynolds Industries, as the company was known before its $4 billion merger with Nabisco Brands in 1985. At the time, Heublein's owned the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and an assortment of food products, among them A-1 steak sauce and Grey Poupon mustard. Last October, RJR Nabisco sold Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico for $840 million. ''This a great deal for RJR Nabisco,'' said Clinton O. Mayer 3d, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. ''They got $2 billion for the wine and spirits part of Heublein and the Kentucky Fried Chicken, and they still have the food part of the company.'' RJR Nabisco's stock reflected Wall Street's positive reaction to the deal, rising $1.25, to $56.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. W. Timothy Halford, a spokesman for Grand Metropolitan in London, said completion of the deal was expected after a vote of Grand Metropolitan shareholders scheduled for March 5. Reflection of Strategy F. Ross Johnson, president and chief executive of RJR Nabisco, said the deal reflected the company's strategy of focusing on its core tobacco and food business. ''With the sale of Heublein, we have accomplished the final step in this restructuring,'' he added. Last year, the company sold its Sunkist and Canada Dry soft-drink businesses to another British company, Cadbury Schweppes, for $230 million. The acquisition of Heublein continues the vast restructuring in the worldwide wine and spirits industry in the last few years. Last April, for example, Guinness P.L.C., the brewing company, won a nearly five-month takeover battle for Britain's largest Scotch whisky and gin concern, the Distillers Company, for about $4.1 billion. In September, the liquor business of Hiram Walker Resources was divided between the Reichmann family of Canada and Allied-Lyons, the British food conglomerate. And the Seagram Company, the world's largest producer of wine and spirits, is reportedly close to selling its huge wine business, including the Paul Masson and Taylor labels. RJR Nabisco is the parent of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which markets Winston, Salem and Camel cigarettes. Tobacco products accounted for about 49 percent of the parent company's revenues in 1985.

786-> IOWA TOPS INDIANA FOR 18TH IN A ROW
Top-ranked Iowa, facing third-ranked Indiana for the first time this year, put on an awesome display of rebounding and pressure defense this evening and routed the Hoosiers, 101-88, before 15,570 near delirious fans at Carver Hawkeye Arena. The victory extended the Hawkeye's unbeaten streak to 18, the longest in Iowa basketball history and the longest current major-college streak in the nation. The Hawkeyes lead the Big Ten with a 6-0 record. Indiana is 14-2 over all and 5-1 in the league. ''We gave up too many points,'' said Bobby Knight, the Indiana coach. ''It's really hard to duplicate Iowa in practice. They're too quick, and not only are they quick, but they are aggressive.'' Iowa, which led by 2 at the half, unleashed an awesome full-court press against the Hoosiers and stepped up a brutal rebounding assault it had begun in the first half. Trailing, 55-54, with 16 minutes 47 seconds left, Iowa went on an 18-6 tear and led by 72-61 with 12:20 left in the game. Indiana pulled to 91-86 on a 3-point play by Daryl Thomas, Indiana's senior forward. After Brad Lohaus, the Hawkeyes' 7-0 forward, picked up his fifth foul, his replacement, Al Lorenzen, tipped in his own miss to make it 93-86. Then Steve Alford, the Hoosiers' all-America guard, who had already hit three 3-point shots, hit a fourth but the official ruled that his foot was on the out-of-bounds line. B. J. Armstrong, Iowa's mercurial sophomore guard, made a drive at the other end to make 95-88 to put the game out of reach. The main concern tonight was the long awaited matchup between the country's No. 1 and No. 3 teams (in The Associated Press poll). In the first half, the Hawkeyes jumped out to an 11-3 lead. Iowa, the Big Ten's leading rebounding team, established an early inside presence, shooting, missing, rebounding, shooting again, rebounding again. The Hawkeyes outrebounded Indiana, 25-9, in the half. After three misses in a row by Iowa, Lohaus drew a foul on a rebound. He made the first and missed the second, but Ed Horton, who had nine rebounds in the half, tipped in the miss to make it 9-1. Dean Garrett, a 6-10 center for Indiana, hit a jumper, but tough rebounding by Jeff Moe, a 6-4 guard, drew another foul. Moe hit both shots to make it 11-3 at 15:54. After a timeout, Keith Smart, Indiana's junior guard, hit a short jumper. Moe missed a 3-point attempt but rebounded his own shot and Armstrong hit a jumper after his steal to make it 15-5. Indiana scored the next 7 points, including a 3-pointer by Alford, but Iowa marched off to a 33-20 lead from there. At that point, Indiana's Rick Calloway had picked up his third foul with 6:52 left in the half. This is when Indiana made a major push. Staying in is 2-3 zone but capitalizing on Iowa turnovers, Indiana outscored the Hawkeyes, 18-7, and trailed, 40-38, with 2:01 left in the half. But at the half, Iowa was still in command, 46-44. Iowa has good scoring balance as Kevin Gamble and Moe each had 17 points, Roy Marble and Armstrong 16, Horton 14 and Lohaus 13. Indiana's Thomas was the overall leader for the night with 22 points. Alford had 21. ''It still hasn't dawned on me yet that we're No. 1,'' said Marble, who played his full shift tonight after setting out three-fourths of Iowa's victory over Purdue Tuesday with an eye injury.

787-> FOWLER, CHAIRMAN OF F.C.C. FOR FIVE YEARS, IS RESIGNING
Mark S. Fowler, who has championed deregulation of the nation's telecommunications industries for the Reagan Administration, today announced his resignation as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. ''It seems like a natural break point,'' said Mr. Fowler, 45 years old, who has headed the commission since May 1981, longer than any predecessor. The average term for past chairmen was about three years. Mr. Fowler, whose first term as chairman expired last June, submitted his letter of resignation to President Reagan today. He had been expected to be renominated by Mr. Reagan this month, but he faced an uphill battle in the Senate Commerce Committee. In his tenure, Mr. Fowler pushed through commission policies that made it easier for broadcast properties to change hands, and he aggressively promoted competition in the telephone industry by dropping numerous competitive restrictions. More recently he fought to promote private competition in the international communication satellite field against Intelsat, the nonprofit consortium of governments that operates the world communication satellite network. Clashes Over Deregulation His leadership of the commission has been marked by frequent conflict with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate over deregulation policies. Lawmakers have criticized Mr. Fowler over his program to restructure telephone rates, which introduced monthly access charges for residential and small business customers. His handling of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast industry drew sharp criticism as being too lenient. And his attacks on the commission's special policies aimed at promoting ownership of broadcast properties by women and members of minority groups drew strong opposition from some lawmakers. Despite the conflicts with lawmakers, Mr. Fowler said in a brief interview tonight that he felt he could have won reconfirmation in the Senate, where control has shifted from Republicans to Democrats. There was speculation last spring that Mr. Fowler would leave when his term expired last June. But he surprised agency colleagues and lawmakers when he said he would stay on for a while so he could promote several of the remaining major items on his deregulation agenda. However, the recent departure of several key staff members, including the agency's general counsel and his senior staff counsel, suggested Mr. Fowler had decided not to face another battle on Capitol Hill. Mr. Fowler, a former Florida broadcaster who was practicing communications law here before his appointment to the commission, said his most significant achievement had been ''to rely on competition rather than the Government to regulate the telecommunications industry.'' He also said he felt he had achieved much of his agenda for ''freeing the electronic press so that it becomes as free as the print press,'' an apparent reference to his policy that made acquisitions easier and which called into question longstanding F.C.C. policies governing broacasters, such as the Fairness Doctrine, which requires broadcasters to air differing views on controversial issues. ''I feel we've accomplished basically what we set out to do and now it is time for me to move along,'' he said. Mr. Fowler said he did not think it was appropriate to discuss his future plans, since it would be several months before he left the agency. In his letter to Mr. Reagan, he said that his resignation would be effective this spring ''on an acceptable date.'' The White House had no immediate comment on Mr. Fowler's resignation. Mr. Fowler said he would not get involved in recommending a successor. However, it is widely known that Dennis Patrick, a commissioner who came to the agency from the White House staff, is a leading contender. Possible Successor Mr. Patrick, 35 years old, has been involved in key staff meetings with the chairman for more than a year, and last month his senior adviser, Diane Killory, was appointed general counsel of the agency, succeeeding Jack Smith, who resigned. At one point last year, Commissioner Mimi Dawson, a Republican who came to the commission from the staff of Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, was also said to be interested in the chairmanship. The commission is an independent agency that oversees interstate and international communications by means of radio, television, wire, cable and satellite. It is led by five commissioners. Among other things, the board allocates broadcasting frequencies and operators' licenses. The commission exercises limited control over the content of broadcasts through its rules on obscenity, slander and political announcements. In advancing the Reagan Administration's agenda of deregulating the telecommuncations industry, Mr. Fowler pursued numerous efforts that have dramatically reduced the agency's involvement in the industry it regulates. Those actions have prompted criticism from members of Congress and consumer action groups who asserted that he Fowler was overzealous and forced compromises in his proposed policies. For example, Mr. Fowler initially proposed that residential customers be charged a monthly fee, called an access charge, for use of the local telephone network. He first proposed a fee of $4, but retreated in the face of a criticism from members of Congress sympathetic to consumer groups. The access charge was eventually set at $2 to be put into effect in two steps of $1 a year. In another arena, that of broadcast mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Fowler drew widespread criticism for his advocacy of a ''level playing field'' for the buying and selling of broadcast properties. He contended that broadcast properties should be treated like nonregulated businesses in such transactions and he gave broad application to previously narrowly interpreted rules for the use of trustees to hold stock in hostile bids. In a statement issued tonight, Bell South, a company formed in the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, praised Mr. Fowler's leadership at the F.C.C. ''He had the vision to see that the American public would continue to get the best phone service in the world if the industry operated free of regulation,'' the company said. #2 Views of Fowler Two former television news executives differed sharply tonight over the results of Mr. Fowler's tenure. Julian Goodman, a former president of NBC News and chairman of NBC, said, ''I think Mark Fowler has been an outstanding chairman of the F.C.C.,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''He has brought a number of changes that have greatly improved the ability of broadcasting to expand its service to the public. I hope his successor does as well.'' Fred W. Friendly, a former president of CBS News, took the opposite view. ''Every past F.C.C. chairman has believed in some regulation,'' Mr. Friendly said. ''But not Mr. Fowler. I shed no tears at the resignation of Mr. Fowler. It was a tragedy that he was at the head of the F.C.C.''

789-> WRITERS READ UP ON BEING PUBLISHED
Not long after a South Carolina schoolteacher sent his manuscript to a New York literary agent, the agent, Julian Bach, telephoned him to report that Houghton Mifflin had accepted the novel for $7,500. After an embarrassed silence the teacher thanked Mr. Bach, then added, ''But I can't afford to pay that much.'' That was almost 17 years ago, and the teacher who was so unsophisticated in the ways of book publishing was Pat Conroy. But Mr. Conroy learned quickly, and today he is the author of the current best seller ''Prince of Tides,'' as well as ''The Great Santini'' and other well-known novels. While some aspiring writers even today are hopelessly naive about the process of getting a book published, according to editors, a growing number of them are wise in the ways of the book world. One reason is that such organizations as the Authors Guild, the American Society of Journalists and Authors and the National Writers Union make professional advice and sample contracts available to members. Moreover, many of the writers' conferences that have sprung up across the United States cover not only writing but also everything from thinking of ideas to negotiating the sale of foreign rights. Another reason for the enhanced awareness, editors say, is that a growing number of books offer tips on how to be published, what to look for in an agent or editor and how to turn rejection into acceptance. 'Determination and Endurance' Not every editor is convinced that such information is necessary. ''It's been my experience that writers who are really determined to get published don't need that kind of help,'' said Edward T. Chase, editor at large at Macmillan. ''If they really stick at it, eventually - like salmon swimming upstream - they're going to make it. But it takes determination and endurance.'' And even editors who approve of such books point to their limitations: They offer few if any suggestions for improving the intrinsic quality of the manuscript, as opposed to its physical appearance; some of the books gloss over writing ability as if it were incidental or an impediment to publishing, and others paint an unrealistically optimistic picture about the chances of being published. Yet most of the books are helpful about the mechanics of publishing, and the best of them are written by reliable battle-scarred veterans of the publishing wars. Perhaps the biggest hurdle in publishing, according to editors and agents, is selling the first novel - although these days it is almost as difficult to sell second, third or fourth novels if the author has not had a commercial success. Reading ''How to Write & Sell Your First Novel'' won't make it any easier for a writer without talent, but the book's tips and suggestions come from authors who know their subject: Oscar Collier, a literary agent who had been senior editor of the Prentice-Hall trade-book division, and Frances Spatz Leighton, the co-author of more than 30 books. The Collier-Leighton book is from Writer's Digest Books, which publishes many books on related themes. Another of its recent publications is ''How to Get Your Book Published: An Insider's Guide.'' The author, Herbert W. Bell, spent 33 years in publishing, mostly with McGraw-Hill. But many recent books on publishing are from the major commercial houses. Harper & Row, for example, will soon publish the third revised edition of ''Writing to Sell'' by Scott Meredith, a literary agent, a book that focuses primarily on fiction. Coping With Rejection Since rejection is an integral part of publishing, John Boswell - the book packager and agent who wrote Mark McCormack's best-selling ''What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School'' - has titled his book ''The Awful Truth About Publishing: Why They Always Reject Your Manuscript . . . And What You Can Do About It'' (Warner Books). Among the things you can do, he advises, are find the right working title and write effective proposals. Leonard S. Bernstein, author of ''Getting Published: The Writer in the Combat Zone'' (William Morrow), contends that there is no such thing as submitting a manuscript too many times, there is only submitting to the wrong markets. His book also promises to reveal ''what writing courses don't tell you about being a writer.'' ''The Writer's Home Companion'' by James Charlton and Lisbeth Mark, soon to be published by Franklin Watts, also discusses rejection, citing a manuscript that was turned down 47 times before being successfully published and made into a movie. By Raymond Abbott's own accounting, his novel, ''That Day in Gordon,'' set on the Rosebud Indian reservation in South Dakota, was rejected about 60 times before it was published to critical acclaim. ''It went to every publisher from Atheneum to Viking, as well as to small presses and university presses,'' said Mr. Abbott, a resident of Louisville, Ky. After Vanguard Press published the novel in September, Douglas Unger, reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, praised Mr. Abbott's ''spare and piercing prose style,'' pronouncing the book ''a moving, well-crafted work of fiction.'' While knocking on publishers' doors, Mr. Abbott read ''How to Be Your Own Literary Agent'' (Houghton Mifflin) by Richard Curtis, a New York agent. ''It told me what I should be looking for in a contract,'' he said, ''what rights to keep, what to think about in terms of an advance.'' How-to-Write Books For today's writer in search of advice, there are books for every taste - books, for example, telling how to write mysteries, how to write romances and how to write for children. Harmony Books just published ''How to Write Erotica'' by Valerie Kelly, 36 of whose screenplays (according to the book flap) have been made into X-rated videos. ''How to Prevent Libel and Privacy Suits'' (Free Press) by Barbara Dill, although intended primarily to provide guidelines for journalists, describes the potential pitfalls that face every writer and editor, including novelists and authors of nonfiction. And ''How to Publish, Promote, and Sell Your Own Book'' (St. Martin's Press) by Robert Lawrence Holt is a book to consider if all else fails - or, in the author's view, before anything has a chance to fail. There are even books about editing: ''Getting Into Print'' (University of Chicago Press) by Walter W. Powell, a professor at Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, describes how acquisitions editors for two scholarly imprints decide what should be published. And ''Editors on Editing'' (Harper & Row), edited by Gerald Gross, is an undated edition of a book published in 1962 in which several book editors explain their profession. Finally, anyone considering a writing career would do well to read ''The Wages of Writing'' (Columbia University Press) by Paul William Kingston and Jonathan R. Cole. This book, based on a survey of authors by the Columbia University Center for the Social Sciences and the Authors Guild Foundation, reveals that while authors rank among the top 10 percent of all occupations in prestige, most can not make ends meet from their writing alone. In fact, among the 2,200 published authors surveyed, the median income from writing amounted to $4,775 in 1979.

790-> PLANT USE SHOWS GAIN
The operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and utilities in December climbed to the highest level since last February, the Federal Reserve Board said today. The report is another sign of a recovery in the nation's manufacturing sector. The Fed said the nation's industry operated at 79.6 percent of capacity in December, up from 79.4 percent in November and an improvement of six-tenths of a percentage point since September. It was the highest operating rate since last February, when the nation's factories, mines and utilities were operating at 80.2 percent of capacity. Last month's rate still left production a percentage point below the operating rate of a year ago. Manufacturing industries operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in December, up from 79.9 percent in November and about the same level as a year ago. Within manufacturing, producers of durable goods operated at 76.9 percent of capacity, compared with a much higher 85.2 percent rate for factories making nondurable products. The operating rate in the mining industry rose three-tenths of a percentage point, to 73.7 percent, in December, only the second increase since last January. Oil and gas well drilling stabilized after a steep decline, while coal production surged last momth, the report said. Electric and gas utilities operated at 80.0 percent of capacity in December, down from 80.3 percent in November.

791-> Memorial Will Be Held For Rev. Mother Ruth
A memorial service will be held at 10 A.M. Monday in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan for the Rev. Mother Ruth, founder and headmistress of St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's Episcopal day school. The Reverend Mother, who died Dec. 22 after a brief illness, was 89 years old. The Reverend Mother, a native New Yorker, was born Ruth Elaine Younger. She entered the Canadian Sisterhood of St. John the Divine in Toronto and took her final vows in 1922. She was a graduate of St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Columbia University. She and a colleague, Sister Edith Margaret, founded St. Hilda's School in Morningside Heights in 1950. It later became St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, which offered coeducational academic training from nursery through the 12th grade. She was its headmistress until her retirement in 1985. In 1952, she was elected the Reverend Mother of the Community of the Holy Spirit, an Episcopal religious order for women that she founded that year. Under her direction, the group also founded the Melrose School in Brewster, N.Y., and St. Cuthbert's Retreat House.

793-> Cooke Gets 42 Cable Systems
Jack Kent Cooke, the cable television pioneer and owner of the Washington Redskins football team, extended his holdings yesterday with the purchase of McCaw Communications Companies, a cable television operator. The size of the all-cash deal was not disclosed. McCaw, which describes itself as the nation's 20th-largest cable company, serves 433,000 subscribers through 42 systems. The company's largest franchises are in Tucson, Ariz., Syracuse and areas of Oregon and Washington state. Mr. Cooke called it ''the cornerstone of an ever-expanding media empire.'' Reassembling Media Empire Mr. Cooke, 73 years old, began two years ago to acquire cable television and publishing holdings after retiring as chairman of Group W Cable. He lost a hostile takeover bid for Multimedia Inc., the Greenville, S.C., publisher and cablecaster, but made $24.5 million on the deal. He bought the Los Angeles Daily News in 1985 and has made unsuccessful bids since then for The Evening News Association in Detroit and The Louisville Times and The Courier-Journal, Kentucky's largest newspapers. Mr. Cooke, born in Canada, began his career in broadcast and publishing running a radio station in Stratford, Ontario, for the late Lord Thomson. He helped Lord Thomson assemble his broadcasting and publishing empire in Canada and the United States. Stint at Retirement By 1960 Mr. Cooke had accumulated publishing and radio properties of his own, along with a minor league baseball team and Canada's largest plastics company. He sold his holdings and moved to the United States during a stint at retirement, but quickly returned to business with the founding of the American Cablevision Company in 1964. He acquired a 12 percent stake in Teleprompter, then sold the company in 1981 to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for more than $1 billion. Among his other interests are the Elmendorf Farm thoroughbred breeding stables and the Chrysler and Kent buildings in New York City.

794-> THEATER: 'SELF-DEFENSE,' A COURTHOUSE DRAMA
As it took a New Haven jury to deliver verdicts in the New York municipal scandals, so it apparently falls to a New Haven theater to examine the New York system of ''negotiated'' criminal justice. ''Self Defense,'' the new play at the Long Wharf, is a plunge into the bleak morass of due process as practiced by public defenders and district attorneys in the Bronx of 1986. It's not a spectacle to inspire a nation's civics classes. In the view of the author, a first-time playwright named Joe Cacaci, such concepts as guilt and innocence, let alone such niceties as civil rights, are rendered irrelevant on an urban legal battlefield buffeted by plea bargaining, City Hall politics and pretrial publicity in The New York Post. The setting, a municipal courthouse, resembles a boxing ring, or perhaps a bullfight arena. At its center is Mr. Cacaci's well-meaning but exasperated hero - Mickey Reisman (Michael Wikes), a 35-year-old product of Columbia University's law school, now seven years into his career of defending the indigent from unsavory charges. ''Self Defense'' dramatizes Mickey's crisis of confidence as he reels under the strain of both docket and conscience overload. One client wrongly accused of child molesting, Julio (Jose Santana), would rather plead guilty to a lesser charge than risk conviction by a jury possibly prejudiced against Hispanic people. Does Mickey endorse this deal, in which case his innocent client will go to jail? Or does he veto it, in which case the client might still go to jail, but for an even longer sentence? Out of such grotesque conundrums are modern tragedies made and writers like Kafka or Joseph Heller born. ''Self Defense'' doesn't aspire either to tragedy or black paranoid farce, however. At its liveliest, Mr. Cacaci's play recalls the honorable down-to-earth television series about contemporary legal gridlock, from ''The Defenders'' to ''Hill Street Blues.'' The author conveys his fascination with the shrewd tricks of the trial lawyer's trade, and he has a keen, if not yet Mamet-esque, ear for the vernacular of hard-boiled urban invective. The funniest lines belong to a dyspeptic district attorney who both goads and amuses Mickey with his nonstop barrage of Yiddishisms, obscenities and cynical maxims (''There's no reason for an educated Jew not to be rich''). Is it a tongue-in-cheek gesture on the part of the director, Arvin Brown, to have cast Lee Wallace, an actor uncannily reminiscent of Mayor Koch, in this irascible role? When Mr. Wallace kvetches about ''the Mayor'' and other irritants at Gracie Mansion, it's almost as if Mr. Koch were standing on stage reading himself the riot act. While the gritty documentary details are on target in ''Self Defense,'' the dramatic execution can be clumsy. Pressing cases are established with much fanfare in Act I, only to vanish into the wings after intermission. (The play implicitly promises but never delivers a climactic courtroom scene.) Now and then Mickey must converse with perfunctory representatives of his private life - a best friend brought on for health-food jokes and a former lover (and assistant district attorney) whose sudden, Act II implication in a drug bust is as unconvincing as it is polemically convenient. By then, Mr. Cacaci has also taken to moralistic preaching. Laborious analogies equating the plights of lawyers and lawbreakers sound contrived, regardless of whether Mickey or one of his less erudite clients is delivering the message. Yet the real disappointment of ''Self Defense'' is its inability to dip beneath the surface of the people who are trapped by the daily machinations it depicts. Neither in the writing nor in Mr. Wikes's performance does Mickey ever amount to more than a generic bleeding-heart liberal; his defendants, whether innocent or guilty, are also stock figures (the sexual misfit with a heart of gold, the strung-out jailhouse lawyer). Although Mr. Cacaci intends otherwise, his journalistic presentation of his real-life subject may reinforce the status quo rather than challenge it. To liberate people from what he regards as a ''filthy'' system, a writer must start by freeing his own characters from the cliched, dehumanizing roles that such systems force them to play. With the exceptions of Mr. Wallace, Mr. Santana and Brian Smiar as a jaded defender, the cast does little to fight the stereotypes. In his staging, Mr. Brown has tried to make Mr. Cacaci's script seem more flamboyantly theatrical than its reportorial style actually permits by bringing Brechtian relish to the scene transitions and, eventually, by raising the volume of the more declamatory speeches. But the injustices in view are so daunting - and so surreal -that they inevitably exhaust the limits of the realistic theatrical means with which this production diligently investigates them. It seems symbolic in more ways than intended that Act I of ''Self Defense'' ends with the bang of the public defender angrily slamming a door, while the final curtain leaves both character and play trailing off into a defeated, halfhearted sigh.

795-> THE DANCE: 'PHOENIX,' ELEO PMARE PREMIERE
Things got off to a celebratory start when the Eleo Pomare Dance Company performed on Wednesday at the Joyce Theater as part of the Joyce Sampler festival. A proclamation from the office of David Dinkins, Borough President of Manhattan, declared it ''Eleo Pomare Day.'' As if to offer a primer on the art of Mr. Pomare, the proclamation spoke of the company's ''dynamic, vibrant performances,'' the work's ''raw energy and emotion'' and the choreographer's involvement with the use of dance to ''express the experiences of the oppressed.'' And the dance that followed, opening the program itself, bore all that out. ''Phoenix,'' which received its world premiere here, is both lyrical and plain-spoken, shimmering with reverberating emotion that is physicalized in the movement, and in the pulsating music by Steve Reich to which the dance is set. Program notes suggest that the solo, danced by Leni Wylliams, is allegorical. Mr. Pomare's metaphor is ''the Egyptian sun god, a fabulous and very beautiful bird, always male'' that ''burns itself alive and then rises from its own ashes.'' What we see is a man, dressed in a fire-colored ritual skirt and loincloth, who gradually rises to wheel through space, then sink with the dark glow of an unquenchable ember. ''Phoenix'' is Mr. Pomare at his strongest and most poetic. And it is hard to imagine anyone but Mr. Wylliams as the instrument of that vision, with his long and eloquently lyrical line and his air of grave triumph. But the evening was otherwise a disappointing one. Mr. Pomare is on to something in ''Conagua,'' the program's other premiere. He seems to be aiming, ambitiously, at a complete blend of smooth-flowing stylized modern dance and folk ritual crammed with incident. A celebration of the cleansing power of water, ''Conagua'' is dedicated to Yemenja, the water goddess of traditional African religion, according to program notes. And in its most persuasive moments ''Conagua'' is a coursing stream of pageantry. But the music - sleek elevator music composed by Jean-Michel Jarre - works against the antic qualities of the dance. The cast was led by Mr. Wylliams as Aye, Frank A. Raziano as the angelic Shell, Kathy M. Thomas as Of the Oceans, Michelle M. Robinson as Ochun, and Delores De Azcarraga, Maxine Steinman and Beverly Simpson as the Asistiras. It must be said that the dancing was uneven here, and especially in ''Back to Bach.'' ''Morning Without Sunrise,'' which completed the program, seems to have lost some of the dramatic power it had last year in its premiere at the Triplex. That theater's plunging sightlines enhanced the piece, a large-spirited homage to the courage of the people fighting apartheid in South Africa. The costumes for ''Phoenix'' and ''Conagua'' were designed by Mr. Pomare and Kenol Lamour, respectively. The program will be repeated on Saturday afternoon at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street.

798-> HADASSAH CELEBRATES 75 YEARS OF HELPING
Seventy-five years ago, Henrietta Szold, the first woman to enroll in the Jewish Theological Seminary, decided to transform her small New York study circle into a national organization dedicated to promoting Zionist ideals among American Jewish women and providing basic health care in Palestine. She called her association Hadassah, the Hebrew for Esther, a queen in Persia who saved the Jews from a massacre. Since 1912 Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, has expanded dramatically, growing into a $60 million-a-year philanthropic empire. The organization, which is celebrating its diamond jubilee this year, now supports two large hospitals, centers for refugee children, schools and a host of other projects in Israel, as well as increasing numbers of American programs. Leaders of Hadassah, however, say that it is more than just a fund-raising instrument. ''Anything you want to do, you can do under the umbrella of Hadassah,'' declared Ruth W. Popkin, the 18th president of the association, which has headquarters in New York. This giant sorority, which says it is America's largest women's volunteer group, is also devoted to educating its 385,000 members about Jewish culture and contemporary affairs. Hadassah will celebrate its 75th anniversary with a Feb. 24 fete in New York and an 1,800-member ''mission'' to Jerusalem in March. Mrs. Popkin, noting that the organization is branching out, said it remains committed to its original goals of providing ''the best health care and education for the people of Israel.'' Medical Centers in Jerusalem Hadassah is best known for its huge medical centers in Jerusalem. Ever since its nursing school was established in 1918, ''Hadassah has been one of the most important volunteer organizations to contribute meaningfully to the establishment of medicine and education in Israel,'' said Moshe Yegar, the Israeli Consul General in New York. Its first teaching hospital, at Mount Scopus, opened in 1939, but was destroyed after Jordan occupied East Jerusalem in 1948. After the hospital led a gypsy existence at clinics throughout the city, Hadassah dedicated a mammoth medical complex in Jerusalem's Ein Karem district in 1960. The 4,000 doctors, nurses and other staff members at the Ein Karem center now serve a half-million patients a year, and 2,000 students attend its medical, dental and public-health schools. Important research has been done in such areas as postoperative coronary care, bone-marrow transplants, cancer and neurological diseases. A second hospital - affiliated, like the Ein Karem center, with Hebrew University - opened at Hadassah's original Mount Scopus location in 1978, 11 years after Israel reclaimed the area during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Help for Children Children have been another major item on Hadassah's agenda since 1934, when the Youth Aliyah movement was born. This program, operated by the Jewish Agency, has helped a quarter-million refugee children settle and survive in Israel. They have included Holocaust orphans, poor Sephardic Jews and a recent wave of 2,000 refugees from the Ethiopian famine. Today some 18,500 children learn the ways of life in their new homeland and receive academic and vocational training in 315 youth villages, day centers and other programs. Hadassah's leaders say its concern for the disadvantaged people of Israel has carried it deep into education. Career-oriented training is the thread linking the 17-year-old Hadassah Community College, the Seligsberg-Brandeis Comprehensive High School and Hadassah's vocational-guidance institute, all in Jerusalem. The Jewish National Fund, which has helped turn desert into farmland, has been another beneficiary of Hadassah. The most recent project, created with the assistance of Hadassah volunteers, has been a recreational forest near the Negev desert settlement of Ofakim. Despite the organization's often-proclaimed political neutrality, Hadassah has frequently criticized American arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Jordan and has long been active on behalf of Soviet Jews. A Trip to Reykjavik Mrs. Popkin journeyed to Reykjavik last fall to deliver the names of 11,500 refuseniks - Jews forbidden to emigrate from the Soviet Union - to the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. The very fact that Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged the existence of the refuseniks, she said, was ''a big breakthrough.'' Hadassah has also turned its attention to cultural, educational and consciousness-raising activities for its 1,700 American chapters. To recruit younger women, local groups have begun seminars on career and family issues, public-affairs discussions and classes to strengthen understanding of Judaism and Jewish life. Hadassah's reputation as one of America's more culturally conscious Jewish organizations has made it attractive to many young women interested in discovering their Jewish roots. Deborah Auerbach-Reisner, a 26-year-old public-relations consultant in New York, says that - like other young members of her group -she feels that Hadassah has put her ''in touch with Jewish culture and what's going on in the Jewish community.'' Her group's monthly meetings include outside speakers and soft-pedaled pedagogy in the guise of learning Israeli songs and dances, staging Purim plays and eating latkes. Although Mrs. Popkin says that Hadassah will remain ''a women's Zionist organization,'' it has supplemented its traditional constituency in recent years. Its youth movement, Hashachar (''the dawn''), runs seven American summer camps and a work-study program in Israel. An arm for men was established in 1966 and now has grown to a membership of 20,000. A new association of ''friends of Hadassah hospital'' has members in 18 countries, Mrs. Popkin said, and an Israeli branch was established three years ago.

801-> STOCK STRENGTH PREDICTED...
On Aug. 13, 1982, with the nation stumbling out of a recession, the Federal Reserve Board used its vast powers over interest rates to try to bring the economy out of its slump, and in doing so touched off the Great Bull Market of the 1980's. Four and a half years later, Wall Street is wondering whether the most successful millionaire maker of all time can continue to romp for at least one more year. And while there is seldom anything resembling a consensus in the investment community, many market experts are convinced that stock prices can continue to rise as long as interest rates go no higher than current levels. ''I'm reminded of that quote by Mae West, who said, 'Too much of a good thing is wonderful,' '' said John Hotchkis, whose firm, Hotchkis & Wiley in Los Angeles, is keeping the $2.5 billion it manages for 25 institutional investors almost entirely in the stock market. Dow Up 22.6% for Year Even though corporate earnings did not live up to expectations this past year, Wall Street triumphed, thanks in large part to some heady first-half gains, spurred by lower interest rates on competing bond investments. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks the action of 30 of the nation's biggest stocks, rose 22.6 percent in 1986, far outpacing the broader indexes of the New York, American and over-the-counter stock markets. The blue-chip Dow index even threatened to catapult through the vaunted 2,000 level during December, before pulling back. On Wednesday it closed at 1,895.95, not far off its record of 1,955.57 set Dec. 2. To put those numbers in perspective, the Dow closed at just 788.05 on that Friday in August 1982 when the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate, which is the all-important rate it charges its member banks for loans. In the 52 months since then, in what has become by some measures the second-best bull market in history both in terms of percentage gains and duration, investors have made an estimated $500 billion in paper profits from equities. That vast sum far surpasses any gains scored in such a span. A. C. Moore, head of research at Argus Research, for instance, is predicting that the stock market will climb 15 percent in 1987, which will correspond closely to the amount he thinks corporate earnings will rise. But Mr. Moore believes most of the gain will come in the latter part of the year. In early 1987, he fears, stock prices will come under pressure because of poor economic conditions. 'It Won't Last Forever' Yet even the most ardent supporters of the market realize stock prices go in both directions. As Mr. Hotchkis put it: ''It won't last forever. We still live in a cyclical world, and no one has yet found the whereabouts of the tooth fairy.'' The cycle that people are most worried about these days is an economic one. Even with the Federal Reserve combating softness in the nation's economy through a friendly monetary policy, corporations for the most part are still reporting mediocre profits. The Standard & Poor's Corporation predicts that moderate to good earnings growth will be experienced by the retailing industry, banking, drugs, insurance and microcomputer software companies. A turnaround will take place, it predicts, for computer makers and the closely related semiconductor industry. Staying in the dumps, it believes, will be the auto and oil industries, while profits for the military industry will remain at about this year's levels. Brokerage Recommendations Brokerage firms, as always, differ on where to invest in 1987. Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., for instance, is recommending the home-building industry, as well as paper and forest products stocks. In those groups, it likes Georgia-Pacific, Great Northern Nekoosa, Hovnanian Enterprises, Kaufman & Broad, Lennar Corporation and Ryland Group. Among other stocks it finds attractive are Anheuser-Busch, the beer maker; Arkansas Best, a trucking company, and Gannett, a newspaper publisher. But Wall Street is also keeping a wary eye on other things. Insider trading scandals and tax reform, although monumental news events in 1986, may not yet have had a full-blown impact on the stock market. And new trading techniques - notably the split-second programs used by professionals to participate simultaneously in futures, options and stocks - could have an even more profound effect on who is willing to play the market in the years to come. ''We are in a bull market, but we have not had the traditional third leg of the bull market,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist with Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, who predicts the next upturn will still occur. ''The reason has been disappointing economic growth and disappointing profits.'' Growth Estimates Lower More than 50 economists recently surveyed by Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., estimate, furthermore, that the nation's real gross national product will rise a modest 2.5 percent in 1987. In the middle of 1986, those same economists were predicting more energetic G.N.P. growth of 3.5 percent. Standard & Poor's, whose stock indexes are some of the most carefully watched on Wall Street, said corporate profits improved just 11.2 percent during 1986. That was far below the 20-percent-or-so rise the 500 companies that make up S.&P.'s biggest index had been expected to enjoy. The early prediction for 1987: a 20 percent profit jump. Profits in the stock market, meanwhile, have been so enormous that some experts fear they cannot continue to grow - especially without getting a forceful assist from a better economy. 'More Than People Expected' Said Leonard Heine Jr., who manages $1 billion worth of other people's money through the Management Asset Corporation, based in Westport, Conn.: ''1986 was so much more than people expected, and it was due primarily to the destruction of interest rates. People were looking for places to put money. And I don't think any of us, in our wildest dreams, anticipated a market reaching 2,000 by the end of 1986.'' Lower interest rates help the stock market to divert money from competing investments. Indeed, money has come out of low-paying certificates of deposit and money market funds, for instance, and gone into stocks. But there is little evidence that corporate profits are picking up a windfall from lower credit costs. 'A Very Sluggish Economy' ''Nowhere do we see any fundamentals that support a market staying at this level,'' said Mr. Heine. ''You have, to say the least, a very sluggish economy.'' Taking a slightly broader historical view, however, might justify the gains. ''If you look at it in the longer-term context, by taking into account the fact that the market was so weak during the late 1960's and all during the 70's, I think you would draw a slightly different conclusion,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist of Chase Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ''To some extent, I think we are just catching up to a weak and undervalued stock market in those prior years.'' The biggest mystery of 1987, market experts agree, will be the insider-trading scandals that have rocked Wall Street. Nearly everyone expects the Securities and Exchange Commission's lasso to catch others who might have helped Ivan F. Boesky, the now deposed king of Wall Street arbitragers, illegally reap enormous profits on corporate takeovers. Effect on Corporate Takeovers But the Boesky situation could end up having its biggest effect on corporate takeovers, which have proved very profitable these last few years not only for Wall Street professionals but also for the average investor who happens to find himself holding stock in a company that gets bought out. The takeover binge - which caused such well-known concerns as RCA, Celanese, Chesebrough-Ponds and Richardson-Vicks to be betrothed to other companies - has been propelled, in large part, by the easy availability of takeover financing. And one reason money has been so available is the growth of the high-yield junk bond market, which has been pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Now Drexel and some of its executives find themselves under investigation in the Boesky case. If anything comes of that investigation, despite Drexel's insistence that it knows of no wrongdoing, the firm's ability to sell junk bonds could be impaired, and the takeover explosion could be muffled in the years ahead. A Slower Pace Expected But even without such an impact, the trend of corporate takeovers will probably continue at a somewhat slower pace. ''I think you are going to see them,'' said Robert Pirie, head of Rothschild Inc., an investment firm that has been an adviser on corporate takeovers. ''You are going to see big ones, but nothing like the volume you've seen in the last three or four months.'' Takeovers were particularly heavy late in 1986 as companies raced to expand, contract or restructure before the new tax laws took effect on Jan. 1. But the tax laws may also have an impact on the kinds of stocks that investors are willing to buy. Market experts say the new laws, which eventually will treat the gains won when a stock goes up in price the same way as a paycheck, will probably cause investors to take fewer risks. That might mean a rebirth for good, safe stocks that pay predictable dividends. ''I think that in general, with the change in the tax structure, many people will change their philosophy in investing,'' said Barry Salzberg, a partner in charge of executive financial counseling at the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells. Investors will have to be pretty certain, he said, that the gains that will be achieved on a particular stock will offset the extra tax.

805-> U.S. Woman Arrested On Thai-Burmese Line
A New Jersey woman who has been campaigning on behalf of the rebellious Shan people in Burma was arrested today as she crossed the Thai border. She was later reported to have been released, fined about $40 and ordered deported. The woman, Edith Mirante of Cranford, N.J., was charged at the border town of Maehongson with crossing illegally. She was returning from a news conference held Jan. 20 by Khun Sa, who heads the Shan rebels. Ms. Mirante has been trying to draw attention to the cause of the Shan people, one of several ethnic minorities that have long been in rebellion against the Burmese Government. Khun Sa, the Shan leader, said he had invited reporters to his headquarters to argue the Shan case, meet his troops and prove to the world that he was still alive. Two years ago, Thai officials said he had died. Foreign journalists here had been warned by the Thais that it would be considered illegal for anyone to cross the border for the news conference, held in an opium production area. Thailand is trying to curtail drug trafficking and to improve relations with Burma. The Burmese have expressed concern that several ethnic groups, especially the Karens, Mons and Shans, have sought refuge in Thai territory during military campaigns against them. Thai guards today also arrested Terence John White, a freelance photojournalist from New Zealand. Several other Thai and foreign reporters made the trip to the Khun Sa event and returned last week without problems.

Washington-area basketball fans are in imminent danger of a television overdose, and the blame can't be laid to CBS, NBC or even ESPN. The culprit is WNVC, Channel 56, in Falls Church, Va., a commercial-free outlet that covers Capitol Hill and affairs of state by day, then bombards its viewers with college play once the sun goes down. ''We're sort of a cross between C-SPAN and ESPN,'' says Matt Miller, production manager for WNVC and its sister station, WNVT (Channel 53), which, between them, will carry more than 200 games this season. Viewer demand for the games springs partly from the fact that most of the capital still hasn't been wired for cable, leaving a nighttime sports vacuum that the two stations are happy to exploit. Though both are publicly owned, neither is a member of the Public Broadcasting Service, and their lack of such PBS mainstays as ''Masterpiece Theater'' is fine with hoop fanatics, who could barely be better served by satellite dishes in their own backyard. The twin stations have six dishes - three with ''splitter'' capabilities to take in more than one game simultaneously - and can thus blanket the Washington area with live and taped coverage of all the major conferences and such popular independents as Louisville, Marquette and Notre Dame. The stations spend between $2,000 and $3,000 a game on rights fees, which are paid for by the viewers. Since there are no commercials, a timeout on the court allows a return to the studios for that sine qua non of public TV, the pledge break. Surplus from the pledges winds up in general operating funds, in effect subsidizing such non-sport activity as the telecast of the State Department's daily press briefing. The system has proved so successful that in the year just ended, WNVC added some 70 college football games to its schedule, as well as college hockey and a weekly two-hour sports call-in show. Though Channels 53 and 56 are now well into the season's coverage, the best - or at least the most - is yet to come. Commercial-free basketball ends this year just before the start of the national tournament with the second annual WNVC college basketball marathon - 35 consecutive hours of play from Friday afternoon to Saturday midnight. Tipoff is at 1 P.M., March 6.

810-> AFTER INFERNO, CONFUSION AND ANGER
For Lorraine Sherman of Brooklyn, the disaster was far from over today. She was in her room on the ninth floor of the Dupont Plaza Hotel when a fire broke out Wednesday afternoon on the hotel's lower floors. She recalled spending ''a couple of hours, an eternity,'' on the terrace until firefighters using ropes were able to lower her to safety. Today, Mrs. Sherman spent another eternity waiting in the tropical sun across the street from the charred 22-story hotel. ''My husband was in the casino,'' she said in a trembling voice, her cheeks wet with tears. ''And as of now, he's still missing.'' Difficulty Identifying Bodies Police and government officials said it could be days or even weeks before those who perished in the fire were definitively identified. ''Most of the bodies are totally burned,'' said Danny Velez, press secretary to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon. For those who survived, New Year's Day was filled with confusion, anger and questions. Many survivors lingered near the 420-room hotel. Most were barefoot or wearing only bathing suits, bathrobes, T-shirts or whatever clothes they had on when the fire broke out. A number of survivors complained that no alarms or sprinkler systems went off after the fire broke out and there was no organized attempt to evacuate hotel guests. Others complained about conditions after the fire. ''It's outrageous,'' said Barbara Zellman, a teacher from Manhattan. ''I have no money. My passport, my tickets, all my things are in my room. They haven't even given us any information.'' Late this afternoon Dupont Plaza's director, Bruce Shulman, said that all guests would be reimbursed for lodging and meals through Saturday and provided travel expenses. Personal possessions still in the hotel, he said, would be bagged and shipped later. For many survivors, however, lost property seemed the least important concern. Thomas Cadden, a 35-year-old lawyer from Meriden, Conn., said he was glad just to be alive. When the blaze erupted he was in the casino, the area where the largest number of deaths appear to have occurred. ''I was sitting at the blackjack table,'' he said, speaking from his bed at the Pavia hospital where he underwent four hours of surgery Wednesday night. ''I was looking at the ocean through the window and I saw smoke. I said to the dealer, 'Where is that coming from?' '' 'There Was Total Chaos' To Mr. Cadden's surprise, the dealer did not look up from the table. Instead, he continued to deal the cards. ''Then I heard this explosion and thick black smoke started pouring in,'' he said. In the rapidly darkening room, ''there was total chaos, panic, people screaming and running,'' he said. Somehow, he made his way to the window. ''I thought either I go through this window or I die here,'' he said. He grabbed a chair and smashed the glass, crawled out onto the ledge, cutting his hands on sharp glass, then lowered himself to a second ledge, which collapsed beneath him. ''I fell roughly 25 feet, a long way, and I fractured my ankle,'' he said. ''A friend of mine and two college kids saw me and they came over and helped.'' Charles J. Collins of Paxton, Mass., who was in a restaurant by the pool, told how he, his wife and daughter scaled a three-foot wall topped by barbed wire and dropped 12 feet to the beach. ''We could look up and see people banging on the glass trying to get out of the casino,'' he said. ''Everybody was screaming. People were hung up in barbed wire. People were hanging off the balconies. The smoke was so bad you couldn't see the people on the upper floors.'' Nancy Brensson, a 12-year-old from Cresskill, N.J., said she was with her parents in their 12th-floor room when she noticed white smoke outside. ''My dad opened the terrace door and the smoke came rushing in and it started to get dark,'' she said. They left the room and tried going down the staircase but ''it was filled with black smoke and we could see flames below,'' she said. They headed for the roof, where they waited for about an hour, as more and more people joined them. ''I was prepared to die,'' said Nancy's mother, Baiba, 39. ''I just didn't know whether it would be from fire or from smoke.'' Eventually, ''a helicopter came,'' Nancy said. ''We had to jump to get into it. My father almost missed: He was hanging out of it for a while.'' Like many survivors, the Brenssons had strong words of praise for ordinary citizens of San Juan and for other tourists who came to their aid. ''There was this one guy named Nick and his wife and they were on the roof calming everyone and kind of taking charge,'' Nancy said. Mr. Cadden, as well as others at the hospital, emphasized that they had been well cared for by medical personnel. But there was also sharp criticism of some aspects of the rescue effort and outright anger toward the hotel staff and management. Concern Over Earlier Fires ''There have been at least two other fires here recently,'' said Murray Fink, an engineering designer from Brooklyn. ''I had asked security about it and they said, 'Don't worry.' I asked about smoke alarms and the concierge told me, 'Oh, we don't need those, the building is concrete.' '' Robert Howard, an accountant from Livingston, N.J., said one fire broke out about 12:30 A.M. Sunday in a storage room on the ninth floor. He said that he had heard no fire alarms but that the teen-age children of another guest had alerted everyone by pounding on doors. One man pulled a fire alarm, Mr. Howard said, ''but it didn't work.'' The Howard family moved to another hotel the next day. ''I said to my wife,'' he said, ''either we find a room elsewhere or we're off this island.'' Although government officials today would say only that arson could not be ruled out, many guests felt certain that was the cause, adding that they thought it was related to a union's dispute with the hotel. The union denies any role in the fire. ''It was going on all week, they were burning mattresses and there were rumors that it had to do with the union,'' said Michael McGahan, a stockbroker from Mineola, L.I. ''But it was being treated more or less like a joke, not like it was something serious.'' Mr. Shulman, the hotel director, said this afternoon that there had been three small fires at the hotel within the past 10 days and that 30 extra security guards had been put on duty. He said the hotel conformed with all safety regulations. Some guests discussed what they thought could have been indications that day of troubles to come. ''We noticed that the maids made the rooms up earlier and then were gone and that the kitchen staff left early,'' said Linda Wolf of Bloomfield, Conn. ''There were arguments, verbal fights among the staff in the dining room. We had lunch at one o'clock and the waiters left before my husband could pay the check.'' While some employees may have just wanted to be home early New Year's Eve, ''I was here at Christmas and they didn't behave that way,'' she said. Witnesses and survivors put the start of the fire at no later than 3:30, and some expressed dismay that fire engines did not arrive until nearly 4 o'clock. Alexander Leighton, who owns a guest house, Casa Blanca, half a block from from the smelled smoke as he was walking his dog on the beach. ''I checked my watch - I'm a real nut for time,'' he said. It was 3:26, he noted. A View From the Beach Then a curl of black smoke caught his eye. It was coming from the lip of the roof over a hotel restaurant adjacent to the casino on the lobby level. From the beach Mr. Leighton looked into the casino through its large tinted windows. He could make out figures inside. Slot machines glowed in chrome-lined rows. Shadows moved near the craps tables. Silhouettes were hunched over the blackjack tables. Then, he said, an explosion sent a fireball flaring inside the tinted windows and the composition he had observed moments before broke apart. Toni Goldberg flew from Philadelphia late Wednesday night in hope of finding her 70-year-old mother but had had no success. ''I've checked all the hospitals, and she's not there,'' she said this afternoon. A lucky few did find their loved ones. ''Until 10:30 at night I thought for sure my daughter was dead,'' said Cecile Leprohon of Montreal, who escaped from her 16th-floor room into the basket of a hovering helicopter. ''I prayed and I promised a thousand dollars to the Church if she was alive. Now,'' she said, touching the sleeve of the bathrobe worn by her daughter, Judith, ''I'll be happy to pay.''

811-> WASHINGTON TALK; Contra Connection: Stalking Film Rights
Given the mystery surrounding the Reagan Administration's secret effort to keep the Nicaraguan rebels supplied with arms, perhaps it was inevitable there would be talk about a movie. Two groups are said to be vying to buy the film rights to the story from people involved in the operation, among them Eugene Hasenfus, the cargo handler who was detained for weeks by the Sandinistas after the supply plane he was on was shot down while on a mission over Nicaragua. But whether the movie will ever be made is something of a mystery itself. Either group could run into censorship problems if it turns out that participants in the covert operation were tied to the Central Intelligence Agency. Further compounding matters, one group says the other group appears to be going after the story rights so as to tie up the secret details of the operation and perhaps preclude any film ever being made. Money and Phone Calls Both groups reportedly have been touring the country this month, courting Mr. Hasenfus and others involved in the supply operation. Large offers of money are said to have been tendered, and phone calls are said to have been made by celebrities including the actor Marlon Brando. A key figure in one of the film groups is Larry Spivey, a former Navy counterinsurgency specialist. Mr. Spivey says he is now a freelance movie producer. But his company is not listed with any of the standard Hollywood unions or film production organizations, and the phone number he gives out elicits only a loud electronic buzz. The other film group is headed by Frank W. Snepp, a former Central Intelligence Agency official in Vietnam who now writes books and works on films. Mr. Snepp gained public prominence when he wrote a book about the fall of Saigon in 1975, ''Decent Interval,'' and was sued by the Federal Government for violating the agreement that agency employees make never to disclose information about the agency or its activities without prior agency approval. After the Supreme Court upheld his conviction, Mr. Snepp was forced to return about $200,000 in profits from the book. Since then several other book and film projects he has worked on have been screened by the C.I.A. for clearance, Mr. Snepp said. Mr. Snepp says Mr. Spivey seems in his movie offers to be trying to buy the silence of Mr. Hasenfus and his colleagues. Mr. Snepp says provisions in the contract Mr. Spivey offered to Mr. Hasenfus would give Mr. Spivey virtual veto power over what Mr. Hasenfus says about his experiences and might actually preclude any film being made. Mr. Spivey strongly denies the charge. ''My god, no,'' he said.The Subject of a Book Mr. Spivey has himself been the subject of a book, ''The Spivey Assignment'' by Philip Rosenberg, based on his experiences as a Georgia Bureau of Investigation informant in a case involving drug smuggling from Central America. In addition, Mr. Spivey numbers among his acquaintances Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the National Security Council aide who was dismissed over the key role he had in the secretive Iran-contra arms scandal. But Mr. Spivey says his relationship with Colonel North, who he says he met at a briefing on Nicaragua in the Old Executive Office Building, has no bearing on the film project. A Congressional investigator who is familiar with the contra operation says that Mr. Spivey was never actually involved in the contra supply effort but that he knew much about it almost from the start. ''He was not part of it,'' the investigator said, ''but he met all the players and was in all the right places at all the right times.'' Whatever the case, any movie about the supply operation that is based on interviews with people who participated in that effort could run into censorship problems because of the C.I.A.'s provision for secrecy pledges. Links to C.I.A. Mr. Hasenfus has said he thought he was working for the C.I.A. The Reagan Administration has denied that Mr. Hasenfus and his associates in the contra supply effort were working for the agency when his C-123 aircraft was shot down last October and he was taken prisoner. But Congressional investigators say they believe Mr. Hasenfus may have signed a secrecy pledge last spring when he joined the supply program through Southern Air Transport, a concern formerly owned by the C.I.A. According to people familiar with the film negotiations, Mr. Spivey has offered Mr. Hasenfus and others involved in contra aid more money, in some cases double Mr. Snepp's offer. For example, when Mr. Snepp reportedly offered one cargo handler $25,000 to act as a film consultant, Mr. Spivey is said to have jumped his offer to $50,000. Still, sources say, in Mr. Hasenfus's case he was most impressed not by money but by a phone call from Mr. Brando, who has become a friend of Mr. Snepp. Mr. Snepp says Mr. Brando, who has not made a movie in more than five years and shuns all public appearances, was simply interested in the politics of the story but might decide later to play a more active role in the film. Mr. Hasenfus said in a telephone interview from his home in Marinette, Wis., that he was not ready to decide which offer, if any, to accept. ''I'm just trying to keep a low profile,'' he added. But the people familiar with the talks say Mr. Hasenfus and his wife, Sally, planned to fly to California this week to meet with Mr. Brando and Mr. Snepp and possibly sign a deal with them. 'The Human Side' Mr. Snepp says his film would not be ''an expose, an anti-C.I.A. movie.'' Instead, he says, it would focus on ''the human side.'' That side appeals to him, Mr. Snepp adds, because ''I was a C.I.A official, but there was a lot more to me than that.'' To impress the Hasenfuses and others in the contra operation, Mr. Spivey reportedly showed them a letter from former President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, proposing a film about his life. He is also said to have related that he had worked for Orion Pictures in Hollywood. A spokesman for Orion said Mr. Spivey had brought the company one film property, about a rape victim, but that Orion later severed relations with him. Mr. Spivey said he did not have ''any idea'' whether his group would ever proceed to the point of beginning to film the arms supply story. ''We still don't know the truth,'' he said. ''We only do true stories.''

812-> 6 Die in Florida Plane Crash
Searchers today found the wreckage of a single-engine plane that crashed in a heavy rainstorm, killing all six people aboard, the authorities said. The pilot of the plane, a Cessna 210 Centurion, lost contact with air traffic controllers in the storm late Wednesday, the authorities said, and searchers found the wreck near the Panhandle community of Jasper this morning. The pilot had filed a flight plan in Huntsville, Ala., saying the craft was flying to Orlando, said Roger Myers, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, adding that the pilot lost contact with controllers at 11:41 P.M. About 100 people helped search for the plane, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department. The bodies were sent to Jacksonville, where autopsies were to be conducted Friday and the identities of the victims verified, the sheriff's department said.

813-> SUFFOLK POLICE ARE DESCRIBED AS DEFICIENT
The chairman of the State Commission of Investigation said today that the Suffolk County Police Department had displayed a ''startling lack of professionalism.'' A 14-month investigation, he said, has found evidence of perjury and fabrication of evidence by the police. In the first day of public hearings on charges of corruption and mismanagement in criminal-justice agencies here, the commission chairman, David G. Trager, also said the problems in the department were ''shamefully tolerated by the District Attorney's office.'' ''The rationalization that the ends justify the means seems to be infecting portions of Suffolk's criminal-justice system,'' Mr. Trager said. ''Unchecked, it may undermine the county's entire justice system.'' Suicide of Lieutenant Mr. Trager did not specify how many officers had perjured themselves or how many people may have been unfairly tried. He said, however, that ''as the commission's investigation has progressed - and the investigation is continuing - its scope, regrettably, has had to be widened.'' The investigation is the most far-reaching of several into the police. The United States Attorney's office and the County Legislature are also examining the department. The commander of the robbery squad, Detective Lieut. John Gaggin, killed himself two weeks ago, hours before he was to have testified in private before the S.I.C. Although he was not believed to have been implicated in wrongdoing, Lieutenant Gaggin's squad was being investigated. In the often heated and pointed questioning today of 14 witnesses - including a judge, members of the District Attorney's office and detectives - the S.I.C. examined two cases that it said illustrated the problems found in the inquiry. Two more cases are to be examined Thursday. Acquittals by Juries A county judge who presided over two of the cases, Stuart Namm, said under oath today that ''a good part of testimony'' by county detectives in the cases ''was not credible.'' The four cases include two murders, one involving the stabbing death of a nurse from Port Jefferson, Maureen Negus, 35 years old, in 1984. The other murder was of a lawyer from Brentwood, Archimedes Cervera, whowas slain in his office in 1985. The juries in both cases acquitted the defendants, citing what the commission called a ''lack of police credibility, inadequate investigation and other errors.'' The other two cases involve a person arrested in 1981 and charged with drunken driving and an incident in 1985, in which Joseph Skorupski was mistakenly arrested. These cases and the public sessions are not the end of the hearings, according to Mr. Trager, who is also Dean of the Brooklyn Law School. Procedures and Perjury In the hearing today, the five commissioners and three staff lawyers focused on the rape and murder of Mrs. Negus. The commissioners appeared incredulous that a knife, which was recovered 15 feet from where the body was discovered, was not found for almost 10 months. Other questions centered on such procedures as filing reports and taking notes that, the commission charged, were not followed. In the second case today, the commissioners said that Officer Walter Matejovic had submitted falsified evidence and committed perjury in a drunken-driving case. Officer Matejovic, called before the panel, would not answer questions about the case on the advice of his attorney. Although the prosecutor dropped the case, the commission said it had ''found no evidence of any follow-up investigation by either the District Attorney's office or the Police Department, or of any disciplinary action against the officer involved.'' 'Must Be Held Accountable' Mr. Trager said the S.I.C. inquiry indicated ''that only a minority of police officers engage in misconduct and a small number of assistant district attorneys tolerate or participate in this activity.'' But, Mr. Trager added, the ''top management of these agencies must be held accountable for creating the atmosphere allowing misconduct, first, to occur, and second, to go unpunished.'' The commission, which has the power to subpoena witnesses and documents, is not a prosecutorial agency. It will issue its findings and recommendations in months, officials said. Although he did not testify today, Police Commissioner DeWitt C. Treder has steadily denied the charges of widespread corruption and mismanagement. District Attorney Patrick Henry said the panel's comments about perjury, fabrication of testimony and misconduct ''suggest I should be ashamed of myself for not being aware of it.'' ''And I resent that,'' Mr. Henry said, adding that thousands of cases had been successfully prosecuted here. ''These are very serious allegations. If you have evidence of that kind of corruption, I would urge you to present it to a prosecutorial agency forthwith.''

814-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Burger's Goal
Warren E. Burger, the retired Chief Justice of the United States, told a visitor the other day that he always keeps a copy of the Constitution in his pocket, another in the glove compartment of his car, yet another in his desk at home and another in his desk at work. As chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, he is setting an example for the nation, which he proposes to paper with 50 million copies of the historic document, or very nearly one for every family. The commission has agreed to print and distribute 2.5 million pocket-sized Constitutions itself and has produced about 250,000 so far. These are free to individuals but cost 15 cents each if ordered in bulk. The commission is urging other would-be participants in the bicentennial, corporations and the like, to finance additional large printings to help reach Mr. Burger's ambitious national objective. Citicorp has agreed to print and distribute a million copies free. C-SPAN, the cable public affairs television network, is offering individual viewers a free copy of its edition of the Constitution and selling extra copies for 50 cents each, with a first printing of 5,000 and several more of that size expected.

817-> Books of The Times; A Tale of 2 Brothers
PALAIS-ROYAL. By Richard Sennett. 274 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95. In this, his third novel, Richard Sennett proposes to tell the story of two brothers entirely through letters, diary entries and other found bits of writing. The time is the mid-19th century; the backdrop, Paris and London; the characters, Frederick and Charles Courtland, sons of a good English family - the first, a precocious and somewhat arrogant young architect; the second, a lapsed minister given to moody ruminations about faith and doubt and the state of his own soul. The story, briefly, is this. Frederick - whose precocity and struggles with Establishment powers recall qualities of earlier Sennett heroes - has been summoned to France by one of that country's leading architects to assist in the building of the Galerie d'Orleans in the gardens of the Palais-Royal. It's a highly coveted job and a testament to his youthful vision and drive. The project, Frederick asserts, will become ''the most famous construction of the 19th century'' - it represents ''the throb of possibility'' and it will free man ''from the force of gravity through an architecture of light.'' While enjoying the distractions of Paris, Frederick meets Anne Mercure, a spirited actress, with whom he falls in love - the two will wind up living together, though they will never marry. His brother Charles, who has followed him to Paris, soon becomes friends with Adele, Anne's daughter from a former liaison, and the two gradually begin a rewarding intellectual and spiritual exchange. Though Adele obviously yearns for some sort of romantic commitment, Charles ends by brutally rejecting her - for reasons revealed only years later, after misunderstandings and hurts have long since congealed. Meanwhile, Charles struggles with various philosophical questions - he has extended meditations on and with the French priest and liberal Catholic apologist Lamennais - and he also observes, from afar, his brother's brilliant rise and equally precipitate fall. After losing out to a rival on the commission for the Crystal Palace in London, Frederick realizes that some of his architectural ideals will indeed endure, but that he himself has been consigned to obscurity. Frederick's vocation provides one of the organizing principles of this novel in much the way that music serves as an overarching metaphor in Mr. Sennett's last novel, ''An Evening of Brahms.'' And in the course of the book we're given lots of information about the emergence of Paris as a modern city of new buildings and new ideas. We learn about the consequences of the industrial revolution on 19th-century social life and custom. We see the effects of the plague in Paris. And we're given cameo portraits of leading artists of the day (including Chopin, Liszt, Sand, Hugo). Yet if ''Palais-Royal'' gives Mr. Sennett - the author of such acclaimed cultural histories as ''The Fall of Public Man'' (1977) and the co-author of ''Nineteenth-Century Cities'' (1969) - ample opportunity to display his impressive knowledge of urban public life, its commodious narrative also suffers from didacticism and a kind of lifelessness. In fact, many of the Courtlands' letters to one another sound more like term papers than intimate communications between family members (''I conclude this meditation, therefore, with the suggestion that our religion is in doctrine at odds with the compassion the doctrine inspires,'' writes Charles to his Uncle Severus. Even the reader who accepts the Courtlands' interest in the technical aspects of one another's careers is likely to balk at the prospect of having to plow through such matter as the following, written by Frderick to his father: ''There is a ventilation ridge along the roof apex, which top ventilator is too small to be effective, and side ventilators which at least circulate breezes from without. The remaking of the side panels went according to plan, and quickly. The neat removal of further roof glass proved beyond us, in the time we were given; the glass panes tended to crack if we pulled hastily on the leather edges.'' Though Mr. Sennett has done a painstaking job of orchestrating historical details and an adequate job of simulating authentic-sounding 19th-century voices, he fails to take full advantage of the narrative benefits afforded by the epistolary form - its capacity to depict varying points of view and to emphasize the ambiguities of truth created by subjectivity and missed connections. Instead, he tends to hide behind the form's indirect methodology: things happen offstage in ''Palais-Royal'' - deaths, arguments and disappointments are not dramatized but summarized secondhand through the filter of time and distance. Perhaps as a result, the characters seem a fairly boring lot, defined by one or two italicized traits and propelled along all too predictable tracks. Frederick's youthful hubris foreshadows his subsequent tumble from favor; and Charles's melancholy self-absorption is stripped away to reveal his latent homosexuality. As for Anne and Adele, we are repeatedly told that they are remarkable, independent women; and yet, as written by Mr. Sennett, they simply emerge as vaguely unpleasant stereotypes - beautiful, vain creatures, bent on little more than the manipulation of men. In the end, these characters may succeed in teaching us something about 19th-century Paris, but they do little to engage our attention as palpable human beings.

818-> 3 OF 100 MALES IN CORRECTION SYSTEM, U.S. SAYS
Three of every 100 adult males in the United States were incarcerated or under some other correctional supervision at the end of 1985, according to a Justice Department report released today. The report also said that at the end of 1985 nearly three million men and women were under some form of correctional supervision - imprisoned, on probation or on parole. The total number of adults under supervision increased by nearly 200,000 people, or 17 percent, from 1983 to 1985, according to the report, ''Probation and Parole, 1985.'' The 2.9 million adults under supervision made up 1.67 percent of the total adult population, or 1 out of every 61 adults in the United States, according to the report, which was released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department. Most Were on Probation Of those under any form of supervision, 64.4 percent were on probation, 17.3 percent were in prison, 8.7 percent were in jail and 9.6 percent were on parole, the report said. This means that about three-fourths of the adults under supervision at the end of 1985 were in the community, with the 26 percent remaining incarcerated, according to the report. The report noted that in the last two years the number of adults placed on probation rose faster than the number who were imprisoned. The probation population rose 18 percent, to reach a record of 1.9 million adults, while the number of people incarcerated rose 15 percent, to 750,000 adults. Stu Smith, a spokesman, said the bureau could not determine whether the disparity between the incarceration and probation figures meant that more people were committing minor crimes or that judges were less likely than in the past to sentence defendants to prison. He said that available prison space had decreased in recent years. Statistics were compiled by state, with 43 states reporting increased probation populations in 1985. The report also noted that of the 2.9 million adults under correctional supervision, nearly 87 percent were male; 65 percent were white, 34 percent were black, and 1 percent were of other races.

819-> A CRISIS MOOD GRIPS FRANCE, HIT BY STRIKES
A mood of disquiet and fears of violence gripped France today as a succession of public-sector strikes continued to cripple the national railroad, the Paris subway and bus systems and the state-run power company. For the first time since the strikes began nearly four weeks ago, groups of merchants and artisans occupied some electric-company offices here overnight to express their unhappiness over the power cutoffs. This has led Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to appeal for calm and ''reason.'' Speaking of a growing ''phenomenon of exasperation'' among the public, Mr. Chirac said today, ''I wouldn't want these movements to lead to initiatives undertaken by irresponsible or politicized minorities where there would be clashes among the French.'' ''Let reason return to everyone,'' Mr. Chirac said in a statement delivered this morning in his office as Mayor of Paris. ''Let the disorder brought about by certain strikers and certain groups stop.'' Mood of the Country Mr. Chirac's comments reflected a mood of crisis in this country, a sense of a slow disintegration of public functions that began nearly four weeks ago. The strikes, accepted at first with a remarkable degree of tolerance and good humor among the French, have by now produced a long list of worries. Among these are simple irritation at disruptions of public services, a concern that the economy will be profoundly damaged by the duration of the walkouts and fears that the authority of Mr. Chirac's conservative Government, which has faced a succession of challenges in recent months, is being sharply eroded. ''The strikes are illogical, irritating, and going to offend the entire public,'' a subway rider, who gave his name as Bernard, said today. He went on to say that the striking workers are among the best paid and most privileged in France. ''They don't have the right to ruin life for the rest of us,'' he said. The Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry published a full-page advertisement in Le Monde today, saying simply, ''International competition does not go on strike.'' The message reflected concern that a falling franc and a failure to deliver on contracts will harm France's ability to sell its products abroad. Some Rail Workers Return There were some signs today that railroad workers were drifting back to work after a strike lasting 24 days. After new Government concessions on Thursday night, workers at a number of centers across the country voted this morning to return to their jobs. But the main striking union, the Communist-led General Confederation of Labor, rejected the Government's offer of small salary increases and improved working conditions and vowed to spread the strike to the transport systems of provincial cities. The union, known by the initials C.G.T., has been accused by the Government of trying to ''sabotage'' Mr. Chirac's entire program. The C.G.T. issued a statement saying conservative parties had decided on ''a political escalation totally foreign to the objects of the actions in progress.'' The union said the Government ''bears the total responsibility for the disruption imposed on users that it is holding hostage and the economic consequences that have resulted in numerous domains.'' Blackouts in Paris Meanwhile, the strikes in the Paris subway and bus system and in the electric company, called to protest sharp limits on pay increases, worsened Thursday and today. Some 40 percent of the electric company's employees have failed to show up to work, causing partial blackouts throughout Paris and in the provinces. The occupations of electric-company offices here by merchants and artisans was cited as a strong sign of growing public impatience with the strike. ''We have nothing against the strikers,'' said one shopkeeper, who did not give his name. ''But while they are fighting for wage increases, we are fighting for the survival of our enterprises and for our livelihoods.'' Hospitals reported today that the electricity outages had interfered with surgery and such vital medical procedures as kidney dialysis. Jean Daurat, an orthopedic surgeon at the Ambroise Pare Clinic, said he had gone in his surgical gown to the power company headquarters and a local police station to plead that electricity, which was cut off at the end of an operation, be restored. A Determined Government One rightist legislator, Roland Nungesser, appealed for the public to gather for a large demonstration similar to one that took place here in 1968, after several weeks of protests and demonstrations by students and workers against the Goverment of President Charles de Gaulle. ''What I fear the most as the days go by is a phenomenon of exasperation,'' Mr. Chirac said. The strikes have in essence pitted workers demanding higher wages and better working conditions against the Government, which is determined to prevent a new cycle of inflation. They have produced enormous inconvenience as subways and trains have generally run at less than 50 percent of capacity, frustrating commuters and vacationers, but they have never entirely shut down any of France's major public services. This is because, unlike the United States, workers at any given enterprise are divided among three or four competing unions, some of them - such as the C.G.T. - close to a political party. While a majority of workers are unionized, there are no closed shops and there is little strike discipline, so, throughout the weeks of the walkouts, some service has been assured by nonstriking workers.

820-> ASSESSED VALUES IN NEW YORK RISE BY RECORD TOTAL
The taxable value of property in New York City has been set tentatively at $60.7 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion that is the largest annual rise in the city's history, municipal officials said yesterday. The increase in assessed property values would produce an estimated $440 million in additional tax revenues, bringing the city's total property tax collection to more than $5 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1. The increase in assessed property values, which was announced by the city's Finance Commissioner, Abraham Biderman, reflected a growth in the market for one-, two- and three-family houses, apartment buildings and commercial buildings in all five boroughs. ''It's simply because New York City has rebounded from the fiscal crisis,'' Mayor Koch said in an interview. Increase in Activity ''What I think it shows is that throughout the City of New York, not just the central business district known as Manhattan, we see that real-estate values are going up, and that's helpful to the city,'' the Mayor said. The property tax ''is the largest single tax in our portfolio,'' Mr. Koch said. Mr. Biderman said the increase was caused in part by a surge in real-estate activity in anticipation of the new Federal tax law that went into effect Jan. 1. The addition of 100 new city tax assessors, a 33 percent increase, also contributed to the growth, he said. In general, however, the Finance Commissioner said the growth rate, which was higher than expected, reflected ''the dramatic increase in property values that has taken place in New York City over the past decade.'' Because assessments on most commercial buildings must be phased in over five years, changes in the real-estate market are not completely reflected in the city's assessment roll immediately. As usual, Manhattan accounted for the bulk of the rise in property values, with 73 percent of the increase. But each of the four boroughs outside Manhattan experienced the highest increase in its history, suggesting that revitalization was progressing in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx and on Staten Island, Mr. Biderman said. The assessed value of apartment buildings and commercial property rose by about $1 billion in the four boroughs, twice the rate of last year. Property values have risen, sometimes by small amounts and sometimes dramatically, in all five boroughs for each of the last seven years. The assessment increase is likely to help avoid a rise in property-tax rates for the fiscal year that begins July 1, the Finance Commissioner said. The City Council is to determine the tax rates in June. Notices to Be Mailed Most property owners will still pay more in property tax because of their increased assessments. Of the 891,500 parcels of property in New York City, the tentative assessment has been changed on 742,679, also a record number. Assessments have been increased on 673,179 of those properties. Notices of the changes are to be mailed to property owners in the next few weeks. For the average owner of a one-, two- or three-family house, the increased assessment will raise the annual property tax bill by $58. Commercial tenants often have provisions in their leases requiring that they pay the increases in a landlord's tax bill. Such provisions do not exist for rent-controlled and rent-stabilized residential tenants, said Eric H. Weinstock, executive director of the Rent Guidelines Board. Tax-bill increases are taken into account when the board decides whether to approve rent increases, and by how much, Mr. Weinstock said. The Mayor said Thursday, when he released his preliminary spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1, that he was able to close an anticipated budget deficit in part through an unexpected growth in revenues from the general property tax and other real-estate taxes. Complex Series of Formulas The increase in property assessments will produce $70 million above the projected total in city property taxes for the new fiscal year, city officials said. The revenue from the city property tax is projected to represent about 23 percent of the city's total revenue in the coming fiscal year. The city performs tax assessments under a complex series of formulas mandated by state law. Property is divided into four categories: one-, two- and three-family houses; apartment buildings; commercial and nonresidential buildings, and property owned by utilities. Each year, municipal assessors determine the market value of each property. Then, using the mandated formulas, a percentage of the market value is used to determine the assessed value. Assessors look at the income of a rental apartment building in determining its value. They must do the same for cooperative and condominium buildings, creating hypothetical figures and ignoring sale prices of apartments; as a result, co-op and condominium buildings are underassessed. The assessments released yesterday were tentative. Property owners can appeal their assessments to the city's Tax Commission.

821-> U.S. TRIAL STARTS FOR EX-OFFICIAL OF QUEENS PARTY
The Federal trial of Richard L. Rubin, an influential Queens Democratic figure, opened yesterday with the prosecution portraying him as a man who used his influence to defraud New York State of more than $49,000 to pay the salaries of two private secretaries in his own law firm. In opening statements, Assistant United States Attorney Kevin J. O'Brien said Mr. Rubin created two ''no show jobs'' for the secretaries on the payrolls of two Queens assembly members for whom they never did any work or were asked to. One of Mr. Rubin's lawyers, Gavin Scotti, said in his opening statement that ''The political system here is not on trial,'' adding that the evidence would show that the secretaries, Marilyn J. Wagner and Mary E. Robles, in working in Mr. Rubin's Queens Boulevard law office were also called on to do duties for the Assembly and the Democratic Party. One Government witness, a former Assemblyman, David L. Cohen of Flushing, who has been given immunity, said, under cross-examination, that he did not feel he was doing anything wrong when he put the secretaries on his payroll, because it is not uncommon in Albany, he said, for employees to appear on one legislator's payroll but work for another legislator or legislative agency. Mr. Cohen said he assumed that because Mr. Rubin worked for the Assembly that they would be performing work for Mr. Rubin. 'A Strange Procedure' The Chief Judge of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Jack B. Weinstein, told Mr. Cohen, after the jury had left the courtroom, ''I just find it sort of a strange procedure.'' The prosecutor, Mr. O'Brien, also charged that Mr. Rubin paid a portion of the secretaries' salaries from funds of the Queens County Democratic Party and told them they did not have to report this money for income tax purposes. Mr. Rubin is a former special counsel to the former Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink and a former executive secretary of the Queens Democratic Party. Mr. Rubin, 46 years old, a former Queens assistant district attorney and onetime City Hall lobbyist in Albany, was a close political associate of the late Queens County Democratic leader, Donald R. Manes, and also his patronage dispenser. Manes's Name Forbidden Judge Weinstein has ordered lawyers not to mention the name of Mr. Manes, who was also the Queens Borough President. Mr. Manes killed himself last March as the corruption scandal widened to implicate him. Mr. O'Brien said that at one point, Assemblywoman Gerdi L. Lipshutz of Rockaway Park, who put Ms. Robles on her payroll after Mr. Cohen lost an election, complained to Mr. Rubin that Ms. Robles should do some work for her. ''Mr. Rubin said,'' according to Mr. O'Brien, ' ''She can't go to Albany. She's too busy. Besides, we've taken care of you. We've done favors for you in the past. You have no reason to complain.' '' Ms. Wagner, who worked for Mr. Rubin from April 1980 to October 1982, when she moved to Florida, testified for the Government under immunity, that she was placed on the Assembly payroll in early 1981. She said she received $3,500 a year from Mr. Rubin, about $7,000 a year from the Assembly, and about $5,200 a year from the party.

822-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Love Those Revolutions
A Washingtonian attending a performance of the Broadway-bound ''Les Miserables'' the other evening at the Kennedy Center discovered the Soviet Ambassador, Yuri V. Dubinin, in an adjoining box with three aides. In the course of the musical, French peasants and work-ers storm the barricades with red flags in an 1830's uprising, and the Russian theatergoers responded enthusiastically, standing to applaud during the curtain calls. The American then introduced himself to Mr. Dubinin and asked him how he had liked the revolutionary scenes. ''Excellent,'' replied the Soviet Ambassador, ''an excellent performance.''

823-> MUBARAK AND ASSAD MEET BRIEFLY
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt held a symbolically important 20-minute meeting today with one of his country's main Arab critics, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. The meeting between the two leaders, apparently another step in Mr. Mubarak's increasingly successful drive for reacceptance of Egypt in the Arab camp, was the most important of several behind-the-scenes maneuvers here at the fifth summit meeting of the 46-member Islamic Conference Organization. Egypt has been ostracized by other Arab nations for its separate peace with Israel. The Islamic summit meeting has been overshadowed by the war that two of its members, Iran and Iraq, are waging only 50 miles away, and Arab issues have dominated the discussions. Iran has boycotted the meeting over Kuwait's support of Iraq, and several Iranian-influenced Shiite Moslem terrorist groups have issued threats against the gathering. Entered Hand in Hand The Mubarak-Assad meeting, Arab sources said, took place early this morning after Mr. Mubarak approached Mr. Assad and shook hands as they were going into Tuesday night's closed summit session. Kuwaiti newspapers quoted witnesses as saying the two men had entered the meeting hall hand in hand. The two agreed to meet later and sat face to face for about 20 minutes early today. Given the time normally devoted to Arab courtesies, this would not be a particularly long discussion, but it was generally accorded symbolic significance by delegates here. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Mr. Mubarak took office in 1981 after the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat. Syria, which styles itself as pursuing ''steadfastness in confrontation'' with Israel, has been bitterly critical of the peace agreement made by Mr. Sadat.

830-> The Cardinal and Israel
John Cardinal O'Connor is not only a prince of the Church; he is a prince of a man. The extraordinary compromise he negotiated with Israel's leaders in Jerusalem this week is yet another example of what has impressed many of us about him. Not long after the Cardinal arrived in New York, I remember marching with thousands of others on Solidarity Sunday for Soviet Jews. When we came to the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, we saw Cardinal O'Connor, then a bishop, waving his support to us. It was a moment that I shall never forget - a leader of the Roman Catholic Church demonstrating solidarity with oppressed Soviet Jews. This is an era of monumental change and extraordinary progress in relations between Catholics and Jews. It is an era of great symbolic moments, such as Pope John Paul II's visit to the synagogue in Rome last year, an era of reconciliation and hope. That is why the Cardinal's trip to the Middle East is so important. It reminds us boldly what the next steps must be if the momentum of Jewish-Catholic relations is to be kept up. For indeed one of the festering sores on the body politic of modern religious life is the unwillingness of the Church to recognize Israel. The embarrassment suffered by Cardinal O'Connor in the Middle East last week brings to the surface issues that are - and should be - embarrassing to sensitive people everywhere. It was embarrasing not because the Cardinal forgot to check out the proper Vatican protocols but rather because he seemed to forget that there has been a vast transformation of Jewish life in our day - a transformation that has not yet been adequately recognized by his Church. Israel, the ancient Jewish homeland, has been reborn - at the cost of considerable blood, sweat and tears. That is why the Cardinal's persistent statements of sympathy for the Palestinian refugees strike us as odd at best and counterproductive at worst. They are odd not because these refugees do not deserve decent treatment - of course they do - but because the Cardinal's comments reflect and reinforce the distorted notion that displaced Arabs are where they are because some bad Israelis have put them there. No one should forget that the presence of Arab refugees is a direct consequence of Arab attacks on Israel, first in 1948 and then, to a lesser extent, in 1967. Nobody asked the Arabs to attack. Cardinal O'Connor was quick last week - apparently on his own initiative, not that of the Vatican - to tell the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan that the Palestinian people have the right to ''self-determination.'' He went on to predict war in the region if the Palestinian problem was not solved. Cardinal O'Connor clearly did not know he was speaking diplomatic language and that he was using the Palestine Liberation Organization's code words. But the inevitable effect is to perpetuate the myth that has kept the Palestinian and Israeli problems from being solved all these years - the myth that an intransigent Israel is the cause of Middle Eastern strife. There is one, and only one, reason why Israel-Arab problems persist: the Arabs do not recognize Israel as a nation or deal with it as such. When Egypt did, long-standing problems disappeared. Were Jordan and Syria to recognize Israel, were Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel instead of bankrolling the terrorism of the Palestine Liberation Organization, then solutions to the remaining problems would be within our grasp. There is, of course, yet another entity that does not recognize Israel -the Roman Catholic Church. It, too, has failed to come to grips with the simple but central fact that the Jewish people has been miraculously reborn as a sovereign nation in its ancient homeland. Can the intended good will of Cardinal O'Connor's trip be rescued? Yes - if he has absorbed the message of Israel's rebirth and brings it home to Rome. Let him appreciate the Palestinian problem in the proper perspective, the perspective of having and holding on to a Jewish state against great odds, and then perhaps it will be solved. Change will come when he, his Church and all of Israel's neighbors finally take the message of a Jewish homeland to their hearts.

833-> TREASURY CHIEF SAYS REAGAN WON'T AGREE TO INCREASING TAXES
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said today that President Reagan would not agree to increases in ''sin taxes'' on cigarettes or liquor or an oil import fee. Mr. Baker made his comments as members of the Senate Budget Committee sought a signal from the Administration that it would accept some form of a tax increase that could be used to help reduce the budget deficit. But the Administration, so far, is refusing any such suggestion, which makes the prospects for significant deficit reduction this year less likely. Senator Warren B. Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican who suggested the possibility of increases in cigarette or liquor taxes, said this opposition was understandable as an initial bargaining position. But Mr. Baker said, ''I've worked for the President for seven years and this does not represent an initial position in my opinion.'' On Wednesday, the budget director, James C. Miller 3d, rejected the idea of a high-level meeting between the Administration and Congress if the negotiations involved tax increases. Today, Mr. Baker said the call for such a budget ''summit'' meeting ''has been in the President's view a code word to put taxes on the table and he is just not going to do that.'' He also defended the ''one-shot'' savings proposals for the $1 trillion 1988 budget submitted to Congress this week. These include the sale of Federal loans and other assets, which would result only in a one-year saving. Mr. Baker said the Administration was not selling the assets at ''fire-sale'' prices, although it was assuming that it would get only about half the face value of the loans. ''We're sort of happy we can get 50 cents on the dollar for some of it,'' he said. Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, chairman of the Budget Committee, said, ''It occurs to me that selling assets is a device that just puts off the key issue'' of deficit reduction. Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said he would like to see Congress and the Administration start with a four-year freeze at 1987 levels on all discretionary spending, including military spending. Only salaries and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and Federal pension programs would be allowed to increase. Federal benefit programs would increase to meet a rise in caseloads.

834-> 334 Watch Devils Win
Doug Sulliman scored three goals tonight to help the Devils post a 7-4 comeback victory in a game delayed almost two hours by the heavy snowstorm that hit the area. Because of the storm, only 334 fans showed up at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena. The game, scheduled to start at 7:35 P.M., finally began at about 9:30. The team physician and four Devils players showed up late, causing the delay. The Devils, trailing by 4-3, scored three goals in a span of less than six minutes in the third period. Aaron Broten deflected in Steve Richmond's shot 3 minutes 21 seconds into the period to tie the game, and Randy Velischek put the Devils up three minutes later by converting the rebound of his own shot.

835-> SCOUTING; Parade Poll
While New York's politicians debate whether there should be a ticker tape parade for the Giants should they win the Super Bowl, the city's public favors one, but just barely. Forty-six percent of the 900 city residents surveyed in a New York Times/WCBS-TV poll lined up with City Council President Peter Vallone in favor of a parade. But 42 percent opposed it, siding with Mayor Koch, who says that because the Giants play in New Jersey, the city should not go to the expense of honoring them. The highest support for a parade was registered among Republicans and independents who lean Republican (52 percent of whom favored it), people with family incomes under $12,500 (51 percent) and Bronx residents (50 percent). The greatest opposition came from people 65 and over (47 percent of whom were opposed), Brooklynites (also 47 percent) and Queens residents (46 percent). The telephone survey was conducted from Sunday through Tuesday, and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points, or the polling equivalent of a field goal.

837-> Semiconductor Loss Narrows
The National Semiconductor Corporation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it lost $5.7 million in its second quarter, narrowed sharply from the $38.3 million loss reported a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 14 rose 31 percent, to $456.8 million, from $349.2 million a year ago. The second-quarter results included a provision of about $7.5 million related to reductions in employment that were initiated during the quarter. ''During the second quarter, the Semiconductor Group reported a moderate gain in sales and a major improvement in operating performance as compared to the last year,'' Charles E. Sporck, National's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''However, operating performance declined compared to the first quarter because of reduced bookings during the summer.'' Mr. Sporck added that semiconductor order rates have improved since the summer, and he expects that improvement to continue at a modest level in 1987. He also said continued growth for the company would come from a new generation of National Advanced Systems products, the Hitachi mainframe computers that National sells, as well as new point-of-sale products from its Datachecker unit.

838-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Panel Gets Contra Issue
To focus on some politically sensitive issues before Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is about to create a Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Communications, headed by Senator Edward Zorinsky, Democrat of Nebraska. One of its first assignments, according to State Department sources, will be to pursue the committee investigation, begun last June but never made public, of whether the counterrevolutionary forces in Niacaragua have been involved in the drug trade. Some senators had suggested giving this responsibility to the special Senate committee looking into the sale of arms to Iran and the channeling of profits to these contras. This is a matter of some political interest because President Reagan maintained in a television speech last year that the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua, which the contras are trying to overthrow, was engaged in drug traffic. At the request of Senator Zorinsky, the subcommittee will also have jurisdiction over operations of the United States Information Agency headed by Charles Z. Wick, a subject of particular interest to Mr. Zorinsky.

839-> 4TH-QUARTER G.N.P. UP A SLUGGISH 1.7%
The nation's economy grew at an anemic 1.7 percent rate in the final three months of 1986, the Commerce Department reported today, a weaker showing than the Reagan Administration and private economists had expected. The final quarter's results left growth for all of 1986 at a rate of 2.5 percent after inflation, down from the 2.7 percent increase in the gross national product in 1985 and the slowest pace since the recession of 1981-82. The White House had initially predicted 4 percent growth for the year but repeatedly revised the figure downward. Its most recent projection was 2.7 percent. The sluggish performance was attributed to the record deficit in foreign trade, weakness in the farm and energy sectors. and subdued growth of business investment. Improvement Foreseen Despite some concerns over the slowdown in the October-December period, forecasters in the Administration and the private sector are projecting a slight improvement in the economy this year based on hopes for a turnaround in the foreign trade situation. ''The fundamentals suggest a good economy for the next couple years but the players haven't walked on stage yet,'' said Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist. ''The fourth-quarter numbers were disappointing, but that doesn't mean the outlook has deteriorated.'' The White House is projecting 3.2 percent growth for 1987. Forecasts by private economists generally range from 2.5 to 3 percent. Although some of the trends that were evident in the final quarter raise concerns about growth prospects as the economy enters its fifth year of expansion, economists are pinning hopes for continued growth on the prospect that the tumbling American dollar will finally bolster the manufacturing sector and lead to a narrowing of the trade deficit. ''Unquestionably, the major positive will come from trade,'' said Christopher Caton, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm. ''If we don't get that part of the deal, then the forecast is up for grabs.'' Hints of improvement came in today's fourth-quarter G.N.P. report, with net exports growing $7.7 billion in the period, compared with a drop of $9.4 billion in the previous quarter. The Consumer Factor Economists were not overly concerned by a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in personal consumption expenditures in the period, since the figure was measured against a strong third quarter when financing incentives from auto makers produced a surge in car sales. ''The figure was largely a victim of timing,'' said Douglas P. Handler, senior economist at Wharton Econometrics, a forecasting firm. But most economists do not believe consumers are in a position this year to make as significant a contribution to growth as they did last year. Nor is there any expectation for substantial improvement in business investment - which declined 3 percent in the fourth quarter - because of the effect of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The major effect is expected to be seen in the current quarter. ''We know the initial impact is going to be bad, but we don't know how bad,'' Mr. Caton said. ''The first quarter is the most uncertain. Anything can happen in that quarter.'' Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said that spending on business equipment and commercial construction are two areas most likely to be negatively affected by the new tax law. Factoring in all these expectations, most forecasters now put first-quarter growth at around 2 percent, only slightly better than in last year's fourth quarter. These forecasts are largely based on the assumption that most individuals will not reap the full benefits of the new tax law until they file for a tax refund in early 1988. Taxes and Paychecks A complicating factor is the taxpayer confusion over filling out the new W-4 wage withholding forms, which are twice as long and more complex than the old version. Mr. Handler of Wharton Econometrics thinks many wage earners will not make adjustments in the number of withholding allowances they claim. That will result in less money being withheld from paychecks this year. ''If nobody does anything about their exemptions it could result in a surge in disposable income,'' he said. To have the proper amount withheld, many people will need to reduce the number of withholding allowances claimed, partly because the the annual deduction for each allowance increases to $1,900, from $1,080. Based on the prospect that millions of individuals will not make the proper adjustment, Wharton's forecast for first-quarter growth, at 3 percent, is higher than most others. Today's Commerce Department report was based on incomplete data and is likely to be revised in the coming month. The gross national product - the total value of the nation's output of goods and services - increased by $16 billion in the fourth quarter, to $3.7 trillion as measured in 1982 dollars, according to the report. Today's report also confirmed the sharp slowdown that has occurred in inflation. One of the report's inflation gauges, known as the implicit price deflator, slowed to a rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 3.6 percent in the July-September period. For the full year, the deflator rose 2.7 percent. The sharp drop in world oil prices was cited as a principal factor in holding inflation down. The inflation figures were in line with Wednesday's report by the Labor Department that the better-known Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December, and only 1.1 percent for all of 1986, the smallest increase in 25 years.

840-> SCOUTING; Bowl Barbs
The question from the assembled reporters yesterday was whether he favored overtime in the Fiesta Bowl, in case the 60-minute battle for the national championship ended in a tie. Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, said that he did, but that he doubted whether the N.C.A.A. would listen to him. ''I wouldn't have the clout that St. Joe would,'' he said. Johnson then began trying to mitigate the flippancy of his remark, saying it had been made partly in jest but also out of respect for Joe Paterno, his Penn State counterpart, ''for all the fantastic things he has done for college football.'' He did not sound convincing. An hour later, Paterno arrived for his own daily interview, having already been briefed about Johnson's comment. ''I left my halo home,'' he said, a mischievous look in his eye as he stepped toward the podium. And, of his casual dress, he added: ''I wanted to wear one of my unsaintly outfits.'' That made it 2-1, St. Joe, and then Paterno started running up the score. Near the end of the interview, when asked how his team would spend the afternoon awaiting game time tomorrow night, he said: ''We'll sit around and pray a little. I say mass every day.''

Allan H. Pearlstein, one of the principal shareholders of Old Court Savings and Loan Inc., was indicted today by a city grand jury on six counts of felony theft from the defunct thrift institution. The indictment accuses Mr. Pearlstein, 56 years old, of stealing $695,786 from Old Court and ''related entities'' from August 1983 through October 1984.

842-> POLICE OFFICERS LOSE BIAS AWARD
A Federal judge has overturned a $4.3 million discrimination award to 13 white Chicago police officers who charged they had been transferred from prestigious jobs because of their race and politics. The officers contended in a lawsuit that they had been transferred because they were white and supported Mayor Jane M. Byrne in the 1983 election in which she was defeated by Harold Washington. In early September a jury awarded each of the officers $55,000 in compensatory damages and $275,000 in punitive damages, more than the $250,000 sought in the lawsuit. In his ruling Tuesday, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the trial had produced no evidence of political discrimination, although he noted that a reasonable juror might have concluded there was some evidence of racial discrimination. Judge Shadur reversed a jury's finding that the 13 were entitled to punitive damages. He also said three of the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory damages. The judge also ruled that Raleigh Mathis, former executive director of the Office of Municipal Investigations, who along with the city was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was not personally liable for any damages. Judge Shadur reversed the jury's finding of racial discrimination against three of the officers and requested additional information from eight plaintiffs. He gave two officers the option of accepting $15,000 each in compensatory damages or requesting a new trial to determine damages.

843-> A SHERLOCKIAN BREAKFAST MARKS HOLMES'S 100th
Mrs. Hudson was hostess at a breakfast the other morning in the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Only an ill-read civilian who doesn't know what's Watson in the world of detective fiction would not instantly recognize the name of the housekeeper for the brilliant loner who lived on Baker Street, at No. 221B, in London. From several corners of the real world - Japan, Sweden, England and a score of American cities and hamlets - a few hundred Sherlockians rallied in New York under the auspices of the Baker Street Irregulars. They came to celebrate the companionability of the imagination, to debate the latest interpretations of the stories and to observe a joyous fictional event: the centenary of Sherlock Holmes, who was introduced to the world in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first tale of murder, ''A Study in Scarlet,'' which appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887. The all-male Baker Street Irregulars, with a 270-strong national membership, were recognizable by their regalia (neckties decorated with Holmes symbols and deerstalkers). They are led by Wiggins, who is Thomas L. Stix Jr., a New York broker. A decidedly independent all-female group, called the Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes, with 85 members, was also represented. Their leader is Evelyn Herzog, a New York legal secretary who calls herself the Principal Unprincipled Adventuress. All Sherlockians take a name from a Holmes character or case. Kiyoshi Tanaka, a civil engineer from Yokohama, Japan, said: ''We have 650 members in the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club in five branches - Tokyo, Sendai, Niigata, Osaka and Yokohama. I founded the Baritsu Society, one of the branches of the club. Holmes used baritsu -like judo - in the story 'The Adventure of the Empty House.' Last year we had an exhibition of books and movies in Tokyo and 25,000 people showed up.'' A Feeling of Nostalgia in Japan ''One reason the Japanese are interested in Holmes is that in school we studied about Victorian England through the Holmes stories,'' he said. ''We find the stories appealing because the Japanese traditional life style today is similar to Victorian London. The stories give us a feeling of nostalgia. We do not separate men and women in our club, whose ages range from 9 to 80.'' The youngest future Sherlockian present at the breakfast, Ivy Pochoda, who said she was ''going on 10,'' was accompanied by Sarah Montague, a New York book editor originally from Britain who is a full-fledged member of the Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes. Miss Pochoda said, ''The reason I like Sherlock Holmes is because he can figure things out that other people overlook,'' as scholarly an interpretation as any heard from the Irregulars or Adventuresses. The Pentagon was represented in the person of Jon L. Lellenberg, a civilian who is director of the Northern Region, European and NATO Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Security Policy. He belongs to the Sherlockian group in Washington, called the Red Circle, which has a hundred members. Yes, he said, the Pentagon could certainly use Holmes's problem-solving mind. But why wasn't Mr. Lellenberg wearing a deerstalker like a proper Sherlockian? ''Because I'm much closer to Dr. Watson - he was not too brilliant,'' he said. ''Holmes was more of an ideal. I had a call from Norwegian radio this morning. They asked me, 'How has Holmes helped you in your defense work for Northern Europe?' I told them, 'He helps me to escape from my work.' That's the wonderful thing about the Red Circle - you can flip over from your daily chores and turn to something without international security problems. Holmes and Watson help me to recharge my batteries and keep my NATO activities in perspective.'' World's Biggest Collection From Sante Fe, N.M., came John Bennett Shaw, secretary of the Irregulars, who said he has the country's biggest collector of Sherlockiana (12,000 books). His club in New Mexico is called the Brothers Three Moriarity. ''The club is named after the three Moriarty brothers in the Holmes stories,'' Mr. Shaw said, pointing to his pin. ''Our club insignia is three J's - all three were named James - with the middle one being a crooked J because Professor Moriarty was the crooked brother.'' Ake Rummquist, a Stockholm publisher who brings out the Sherlock Holmes books in Sweden, said he attended the Irregulars' affairs about every other year. His wife, Ingrid, said she wasn't a Holmes follower. Looking around at the Holmesians in deerstalkers at her table, she quickly added, ''I maintain a passive but sympathetic attitude.'' Mr. Rummquist said that Scandinavian Sherlockians hold two horse races in the town of Aalborg in northern Denmark every year. The winner receives a sterling silver plate inscribed with Holmesian symbols. The races are named ''Silver Blaze'' and the ''Moriarty,'' after the story and character. The chaplain of the Irregulars, Dr. Ben Wood, is an Episcopal priest from Holmes Beach, Fla. ''We call our branch the Pleasant Places of Florida,'' Dr. Wood said. ''The name is derived from the reference in the story 'The Five Orange Pips.' '' Prof. Philip A. Shreffler of the St. Louis Community College, the editor of the Baker Street Journal, a publication for American Sherlockians, said: ''Our approach is historical as well as literary. There's a passion about our treatment of Sherlock Holmes. To Sherlockians, Holmes and Watson are real people. There has to be a faith. Faith, above all, should be fun. Which is why we're here.''

845-> SUPER BOWL COUNTDOWN: PLAYERS RETURN TO WORK; GIANTS ARE GIVEN TWO SETS OF PLANS
The Giants received part of their game plans today for the Super Bowl: one set of plans for what to do on the field and another set for off the field. Sunday's 17-0 victory over the Washington Redskins gave the Giants their conference title. It put them in Super Bowl XXI against the Denver Broncos on Jan. 25 in Pasadena, Calif. And it earned them three days off. Today, the players returned to work at Giants Stadium and held a 90-minute afternoon practice closed to the news media. Lawrence Taylor, who suffered a deep thigh bruise Sunday, did not work, but he said he would work Friday no matter how sore he was. During the regular season, when there is a game every week, the game plan is put in on Wednesday. Because there is an extra week before the Super Bowl, this week's schedule was altered. ''We're going to work this week on some things we know we're going to do,'' said Coach Bill Parcells. ''We'll try to get 40 or 50 percent of the work done before we leave. We weren't on the field very long today and it'll be the same tomorrow, maybe a little more Saturday.'' Travel Plans The Giants plan to fly from Newark Airport at noon Sunday for Long Beach, Calif., which is close to their Super Bowl home, the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Calif. They will practice next Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Los Angeles Rams' training complex in Fullerton, Calif. There will be no practice Tuesday, though players from both teams will assemble at their training bases that day for photo sessions. The Giants will fly out players' wives on Thursday. The wives will stay at another hotel. On Friday, the Giants will move out of their hotel to one in North Hollywood, which is closer to Pasadena. The idea is to keep the players away from the fan and media mob scene and allow them to concentrate on their jobs. The players will not have a curfew until late in the week. Parcells was asked if he would prefer that the players' families stay home. ''No,'' he said. ''This may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so I want them to have their families around.'' Billy Ard, the Giants' offensive guard, said he was happy Parcells decided not to take the team to California earlier. ''It was smart,'' said Ard. ''It's nice to stay here at our own home. Being on the road is tough. I don't care if you're at the nicest hotel in the world. It's still a hotel and not home.'' Everyone Wants Tickets But Ard discovered there were distractions at home, too. ''For the last three days,'' he said, ''aside from getting a haircut, I sat home and answered telephone calls all day. Everybody wanted Super Bowl tickets. I probably could have got rid of a thousand tickets.'' ''Tickets?'' said Jerome Sally, the backup nose tackle. He smiled and shook his head sadly. 'My phone was ringing, too,'' he said. The calls, he said, went like this: ''Hey, Jerome, don't you remember me?'' ''No.'' ''Mrs. Green, remember?'' ''No.'' ''You remember. When you were a kid, I called the cops when you were playing ball in the street.'' ''Oh.'' ''Do you have any Super Bowl tickets?'' ''No.'' ''Oh.'' According to Sally, many Mrs. Greens have come out of the woods this week, and all get the same answer: no tickets. Each player is allowed to buy up to 25 tickets at $75 each, but, as Sally said, ''I have to take care of my family and I don't have enough tickets for that.'' Herb Welch, who became the starting free safety when Terry Kinard underwent knee surgery five weeks ago, also has a ticket problem. He comes from Los Angeles, and his family and many friends live there. ''I had a phone call,'' he said, ''from a former girlfriend's sister's friend's boyfriend. Honest. He said, 'Listen, I know you don't have a lot of tickets, but I need four and I could offer you $100 apiece.' ''I told him, 'I don't have any tickets, but you know what you can do? Instead of spending $400 for tickets, buy a TV set, have a party, have everyone over and after the game you'll have something to remember the game with: the TV set.' '' The ticket crush will continue next week at the Giants' hotel. So will the media crush. Parcells's daily news conference today was recorded by at least 13 microphones, 11 television cameras, 10 still cameras and at least 50 writers. ''I know the players are going to be overwhelmed by the media there,'' said Parcells. ''That doesn't bother me. It's nice they can get that attention because they've earned it. I don't think it will be a distraction. I don't think it will hurt their chance of winning. Ten years from now, no one is going to remember who lost this game.'' No one may remember animosity between the teams because everything is calm. Even a mild dig by Coach Dan Reeves of the Broncos against Parcells brought only a smile. Reeves, seeing a newspaper picture showing Parcells's ample waistline, said that Parcells had not seemed to miss many meals. ''He's right,'' said Parcells. ''I've missed a couple of them, but when I eat, I eat a lot.'' TAYLOR HONORED AGAIN PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 15 (AP) -Lawrence Taylor will receive this year's Bert Bell Award as the National Football League's outstanding player, the Maxwell Football Club announced today. Taylor will receive the honor, named after the longtime N.F.L. commissioner, at the club's 50th anniversary dinner here Feb. 17. Also to be honored at the banquet will be Vinny Testaverde, the University of Miami quarterback who was selected previously as the outstanding college player of the year.

846-> How China's Leaders Use Student Protests
In virtually all the reports about the recent student demonstrations in China, little has been said of the restraint shown by the Chinese Communist Party. Given its tremendous power, China's one-party state could have easily nipped these demonstrations at the very beginning. Yet, even as party leaders harshly denounced the demonstrators, they allowed a protest for a more open nominating process to peoples' congresses to expand into a more general demand for competitive elections and freedom of speech. The demonstrations spread for at least four weeks to China's major cities, including the capital. There are several reasons for the party's relative tolerance, including its desire to project a moderate image abroad; memories of the Cultural Revolution and a desire not to provoke another reign of terror by cracking down too harshly; and, most important, the fact that the demonstrations serve the interests of certain factions at the top levels of political leadership in ongoing debates over reform. Since the spring of 1986, the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, and his reform faction have called for political reforms to accompany economic changes. They argue that China's openness and economic development cannot be sustained unless the party decentralizes its power and reduces its role in economic management. Their attempt to gain acceptance of such a proposal at a Central Committee meeting last September was blocked by conservative leaders, led by the Politburo member and economic planner Chen Yun. The final resolution talked about building socialist spiritual civilization rather than reforming the political system. Nevertheless, the debate on politi cal reform continues and encompasses more radical suggestions. Some intellectuals insist political reform should not be merely a tool of economic reform. Others urge the party to lessen its role not only in the economy but also in the judiciary, the Government and everyday life. Although these recommendations and the student protests call for more far-reaching reforms than the Deng leadership seeks, Mr. Deng and his reform group use these protests to exert pressure on top leaders for their more limited reforms. This is not the first time they have done this. In the late 1970's, they allowed the so-called Democratic Movement to use wall posters, pamphlets and demonstrations to force out the remaining Maoists in the central leadership and to launch their own economic program. With Mr. Deng's goals achieved, he cracked down on democratic activists. A similar scenario may be unfolding today. In order to bring about limited political reform, the Deng leadership may have allowed student demonstrations to spread and capture the nation's attention. Yet after four weeks, he as well as the conservative leaders have gradually suppressed the protestors. If the demonstrations become too disruptive, the conservatives may use them as an excuse to call for an end or evena reversal of previous reforms, as they attempted to do in the ''spiritual pollution'' campaign in the fall of 1983. While the top leaders may be able to manipulate demonstrations for their own purposes, almost invariably the protests set in motion ideas and actions they cannot wholly control. In a similar fashion, Mao Zedong used the Red Guard demonstrations during the Cultural Revolution to purge the opposing political faction. His call ''to rebel against authority'' led to anarchy, which he finally suppressed with violence. But it also ultimately led to the Democratic Movement of the late 1970's. Although Mr. Deng initially used the Democratic Momement for his own purposes in the late 1970's, he too reined in the activists when they demanded more democratic rights than he was willing to allow. Yet their demands have stimulated the current debate on political reform. Even though the student demonstrations are now waning, China's recent history suggests that demonstrations, manipulated to exert pressure on the leaders at the top, ofter spark ideas and practices that the manipu-lators cannot fully extinguish.

847-> ART: DAVID SALLE'S WORKS SHOWN AT THE WHITNEY
THE exhibition of David Salle's work that has just opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art (945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street) and will be on view there through March 29, is a sobering, exhilarating event, full of handsome, intelligently made paintings that mirror contemporary life in ways we cannot help but find poignant, jarring and sometimes offensive. In addition, they do this to great decorative effect. For American art of the 1980's, Salle's painting stands out as one of its great and most paradigmatic achievements and for all the usual reasons. He builds on the past, reusing and misusing its strategies and images in order to arrive at something new, to make paintings that not only look different but also feel quite different emotionally. Pictorially, Salle's roots are in Pop Art's use of common or degraded images and in the New York School's heroic scale. As an artist, he started out outside painting and he brought something of Conceptual art's abrasive emphasis on subject matter and disjunctive narrative, as well as installation art's physical nonchalance onto the canvas. Salle's achievement is based primarily on two strategies. First, not unlike the German artist Sigmar Polke, he conceives of painting's surface as a discontinuous aggregate that can harbor a number of discordant if not contradictory images, styles, techniques, materials and even objects. Second, many of the elements he brings to this aggregate are from outside the boundaries of high art, and in particular are lifted from the rich, suggestive stew of popular culture. Almost any painting by Salle is a sparse, carefully arranged catalogue that, through materials and images, makes references to design, to older art, to current political events, to foreign cultures, to film noir and, above all, to the tricky terrain of human relations, especially those between women and men. Salle's art is enigmatic and he seems to like it that way. His often provocatively posed nudes approach the pornographic without ever quite getting there. Rather, they float behind Salle's veils of stained color shrouded in a mysterious half light and in their own kind of privacy. In interviews, Salle has suggested that the elements in his work have considerable personal meaning for him (why else would he use them, seems to be the implication). But just what they might mean for us is left - tactfully, bracingly - up to us. In ''Brother Animal'' from 1983, one of Salle's best paintings, the image of a couple in a bedroom, painted in grisaille on (or actually beneath) a field of deep blue, is paired with the monumental rendering of kidneys painted on heavily textured brown fabric, possibly used for drapes. There's a definite tension set up by the woman's pensive expression and the image of these vital organs, which also suggests the heart. It is as if some life and death decision is at hand - or is simply being ignored. The other elements layered over or attached to the bedroom image include an outline of an apartment building, a scene between two clowns and, strangest of all, two legless Eames chairs. These hover around the woman like passing memories or extraneous thoughts. The deep blue resonates with the kidneys' deep red, while the size of the liver image makes the Eames chairs look like a couple of sconces - this neither diminishes their sculptural interest nor the way they, as a couple, reiterate the presence of the man and woman. As this painting suggests, Salle combines the abilities of an experienced connoisseur with those of a rather cold-blooded documentarian. He seems to have an innate sense of what will look good next to what and also set off the desired reverberations. His paintings are formally big, but psychologically intimate, and among his carefully plotted disjunctions are equivalences that expand emotions in a continuous way. Take, for example, the painting named ''Miner,'' in which two small coffee tables are affixed to the canvas on either side of a big gray image of a seated man who seems exhausted, his eyes glazed over. The tables, which at first seem ridiculous, have big holes punched in their round tops and this seems even more ridiculous. But they also read like exaggerated eyes, and their jagged openings give evidence of a deep anger that may be bottled up within the man. No artist since Frank Stella has come up with a formula for making pictures that is as consistent and as professional as Salle's. But a problem is that, while Salle's formula rarely misses, after a while it hits the same note so regularly that the paintings begin to look very much alike. This is particularly true given the selection and installation of this exhibition, handsome as it is. Although this exhibition spans the eight years from 1979 through 1986, it is weighted toward the present; only about a quarter of its 40-odd paintings date from 1982 or earlier. In addition, these few early and transitional works are scattered throughout the exhibition with no attention to chronology, nor are there any of the many drawings and prints the artist has produced. As with the Whitney's recent Eric Fischl exhibition, one has the impression that the artist's last three shows at Mary Boone's gallery have simply been put end to end. We get what might be called a double big-bang effect: it seems that Salle came from nowhere and that he makes only big paintings, major statements. This doesn't help the public to understand the genesis of Salle's work or the shape of his development, nor to grasp in general the tremendous effort by which all important art comes into existence. (Some of Salle's genesis is laid out in the catalogue's rather pretentiously detailed chronology, but this isn't the right place for it.) There should be more 1979-1982 work here, preferably in a room of its own; even earlier, pre-1979 work, no matter how tentative, would doubtless have been illuminating. At the recent end, there could have been some of Salle's prints and drawings and perhaps color documentation of the stage sets and costumes he has done for the playwright Kathy Acker and the choreographer Karole Armitage. In these, Salle expands upon his indelible way with images and objects, fabrics and color and high-impact juxtapositions, creating what are in effect a series of enormous paintings with moving parts that are among the best theater sets being designed today. So while the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, which initiated this exhibition, and the other museums on its tour, are to be commended for their support of new art, that support should have been expended more thoughtfully and critically. What one longs for to complete this impressive exhibition is something other than the finished final product that the artist is best known for. Also of interest this week: Bill Komoski (Baskerville & Watson, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street): Bill Komoski's new paintings fall within the prescribed area of much current abstraction. They attempt a somewhat naturalized, even popularized geometry in which a closed, self-referential system has been opened to deliberate but not altogether specified associations. Komoski's colors are quiet: gray and white are usually joined by black and another color - a toned-down orange or yellow, for example. A recurring motif is a series of floating ovals or ellipses that suggest bubbles, blood corpuscles or, when they contain a smaller black dot, some unfamiliar cartoon character's eyeballs, herding about in gangs of several. These are usually backed by a wide vertical band or two, often in the brighter color. Komoski's paintings are subtly and beautifully handmade with surfaces delicately painted, rubbed or stained; they are definitely elegant. But they are also a little tame and their tameness seems to emanate from the way they suggest designer textiles and wall hangings from the 1950's, making one think more of fabric than of painting. To some extent this may be a problem of scale that can ultimately be solved. Komoski's watercolors, of which there are many on view here, convey the same motifs with greater intensity and they are much more convincing. Another good sign is the show's anomalous centerpiece: a large painting in which the ellipses and their background are both rendered in faux gray-on-gray wood grain. This painting's nonchalant surface recalls Komoski's earlier non-abstract work and brings the more robust spirit of the watercolors onto canvas. (Through Jan. 31.) Auste (56 Bleecker Street Gallery Ltd.): Auste's new work may not always qualify as serious painting. Her bewitching characters look a little too much like Keane's big-eyed waifs grown up, or emaciated cousins of the Barbie doll. Still, the sci-fi worlds that these creatures inhabit (usually with their cats), not to mention the small galaxies of jewels that float around them, make for surfaces of considerable decorative ferocity. With her talent for caricature, her wispy drawing style, and her jewel-like color, Auste has always seemed like the Florinne Stettheimer of the 1980's. Now she seems to have taken some clues from Gustav Klimt and Russian peasant art. This strengthens her work and makes quite worth a trip to this gallery, which is newly opened and slightly off SoHo's beaten path. (Through Feb. 7.) Maurice Golubov (Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 41 West 57th Street): With the artist's recent death, Maurice Golubov's fourth show at this gallery has become a memorial exhibition. Since it spans some 40 years of unstinting effort, it is also a fitting one. Golubov, born in 1905 in Russia, immigrated to the United States at an early age and exhibited his work in and around New York City from 1926 onward. Throughout his career he worked back and forth between figurative imagery and an intricately fragmented, delicate-colored abstraction. This latter also had a clear basis in reality, suggesting some elaborate machinery or multi-leveled cities. Here, where we see Golubov's tendency to fragment the figure into fields of individual strokes of color, sometimes bright, sometimes dark, the reciprocity between the two sides of his sensibility is especially self-evident. On the figurative side, the best work is a small study of two heads from 1935, which is at once futuristic and Neo-Expressionistic in its energy. Best of all, however, are a number of gouaches from the mid-1970's. Big in scale and open in both composition and surface, they combine the animation of the figurative work with the structural intelligence of the earlier abstract paintings. (Through Jan. 29.)

848-> OUTDOORS; HUNTERS ADVISED ON SHIFT TO STEEL SHELLS
A recent newsletter of Long Island's South Shore Waterfowlers Association contains some sound advice for those who are still resisting the use of nontoxic steel shot for duck and goose hunting. Long Island gunners in particular should realize, writes Steve Sanford, a waterfowl biologist with the State Department of Environmental Conservation, that the new steel loads will be required throughout the region in the 1987-1988 season. He advises Long Islanders to purchase no more lead-loaded shells than will be needed for this season's hunting. One might go a step further and suggest that, even if one hunts in an area where it isn't legally required, one should purchase a few boxes of steel-loaded shells and begin to test their efficacy. Great numbers of waterfowl die each year after eating spent lead pellets and, after decades of research, steel shot has emerged as the best nontoxic substitute. After more than 10 years of often bitter debate involving hunters, conservation organizations and state and Federal wildlife agencies, the Department of the Interior, prodded by court action initiated by the National Wildlife Federation, announced this year a program to phase out lead shot for waterfowling throughout the nation by 1991. The plan calls for first making steel shot mandatory in counties in which the annual duck harvest has been more than 20 birds per square mile. In New York State this year, this will involve Suffolk, Nassau, Jefferson, Wayne and Genesee counties. Hunter resistance to steel shot focuses on two things: The lighter steel pellets do not retain their velocity as well as lead pellets of the same diameter and therefore have less penetration at longer ranges, and steel shot can damage the barrels of fine old double guns. On the other hand, steel loads tend to produce more uniform patterns because the harder pellets are more uniform in size and shape than those of lead and also highly resistant to deformation when traveling down a gun barrel. As one who has used steel shot on both ducks and Canada geese for the last few years, I have seen no difference in practical results when shooting at ranges out to 40 or 45 yards. If you are ''on'' the birds at those distances, they will be cleanly killed with the steel-loaded shells. Another objection to steel loads is that they are more expensive, about 25 percent, than their lead counterparts, and this situation isn't likely to change very much. Over the years, many hunters have saved money by loading their own shotshells. There are a few companies offering reloading components for steel shot, an endeavor that calls for more care and precision than does reloading with lead shot. If one goes waterfowling fewer than a dozen times a year, the savings realized aren't worth the trouble. One should take care to prevent steel-loaded shells from getting wet. The pellets will rust, and an extreme result of this could be a charge fused into a near-solid mass. Factory-loaded shells with their new plastic hulls are highly resistant to rain or even being dropped into a pool of water in boat or blind. Lead pellets cannot rust, of course. I write of water-soaked shells from experience. Many years ago when I was in graduate school and as poor as a churchmouse, I often couldn't afford a box of shells with which to go forth and augment the family larder. I was given some shells that the members of a posh gunning club had decided were too old and had heaved by the case into the salt pond that fronted their holdings. A week or two after those shells went overboard, a friend dredged many of them up while oystering and gave half to me. In those days, the shell hulls, or cases, were made of paper that was waterproofed with wax. I arranged those shells, row on row, on newspapers under the black iron kitchen stove, gave them about a month to dry out and began to use them. They were swollen by the immersion, but I got around that by peeling off layer after layer of paper until they would fit in my old double gun. Hunting with them was an unnerving experience. Some performed as a new shell should, but about one in four failed to fire or produced a minuscule explosion that barely drove the pellets from the barrel. Although it is highly unlikely that any reader might have both the opportunity and the inclination to duplicate this caper, I must advise against it. It could result in damage to self or shotgun.

849-> CAPASSO, IN SURPRISE MOVE, PLEADS GUILTY IN TAX CASE 821:86,813>
Carl A. Capasso, a contractor who has done major work for New York City, pleaded guilty to tax-evasion charges in a surprise move yesterday at his arraignment. Without plea bargaining, or even notifying the prosecution, Mr. Capasso proclaimed in a clear, loud voice that he was guilty of all nine counts in the tax indictment in Federal District Court in Manhattan. By pleading guilty now, he kept his case in the hands of Judge Charles E. Stewart Jr., who was conducting arraignments this week and is known for lenient sentences. Mr. Capasso could face up to five years in prison on each of several counts and a maximum of $1.5 million in fines. In a two-page statement issued after the court session, Mr. Capasso vehemently denied any corruption in his city contracts and strongly defended his close friend, Bess Myerson, now on unpaid leave as the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner. Investigation Continuing Mr. Capasso's lawyer, Jay Goldberg, also filed a legal motion attacking the prosecution and seeking to restrain a corruption investigation involving the defendant's company, the Nanco Construction Corporation. Federal prosecutors responded to the unusual defense tactic by stressing that the investigation of Mr. Capasso and his company was continuing. The 41-year-old contractor said in his statement that he regretted ''the errors in judgment'' that led to his tax violations, adding that he would ''arrange to pay the taxes which are properly due.'' ''I now want to set the record straight,'' his statement continued, ''with respect to other erroneous allegations that have appeared in the media.'' ''First,'' he said, ''I categorically deny that any improper influence, bribery or bid-rigging was involved in my obtaining contracts with New York City and New York State. I have obtained contracts with the city and the state solely because my company provides first-class quality work at the lowest bids.'' Defense of Myerson ''Second, any claim that Bess Myerson exerted influence with the City or State of New York on my behalf is totally false,'' he said. ''She is an extraordinarily dedicated and honest public servant.'' Mr. Capasso also said Ms. Myerson had not provided any assistance ''in the conduct of my matrimonial proceeding,'' a reference to his divorce case. Mr. Capasso's former wife, Nancy, has charged that Ms. Myerson broke up the marriage. Ms. Myerson, who gained fame as Miss America in 1945, took an unpaid leave from her city post on Jan. 12, pending a special city inquiry about her invoking the Fifth Amendment in the grand jury's investigation of Mr. Capasso. The grand jury indicted Mr. Capasso last Thursday on charges of evading $774,600 in corporate and personal taxes by falsifying his company records concerning expenses on city projects. His company has done work on sewage, pollution control and street paving for the city, with more than $150 million in contracts since 1978. Standing in a large, half-empty courtroom used for arraignments, Mr. Capasso drew astonished looks from prosecutors and spectators as he entered his plea. His lawyer, Mr. Goldberg, said the defendant was pleading guilty to all nine counts. ''Is that correct?'' Judge Stewart asked, staring down at the defendant. ''Yes, sir,'' replied Mr. Capasso, who was wearing a dark pin-striped suit, white shirt and blue tie with narrow red stripes. A Firm Answer Judge Stewart explained that he could impose a maximum prison sentence of five years on each of five counts and three years on each of the four other counts, for a total of 37 years, and a maximum fine of $1.5 million. ''Do you understand that?'' the judge asked, without noting that tax defendants rarely get long sentences. ''Yes, sir,'' Mr. Capasso answered firmly. Mr. Capasso admitted that from 1980 to 1985, he ''diverted funds'' from his company to his personal use in a scheme that included checks involving fictitious claims. ''I evaded a substantial amount of personal and corporate income taxes,'' he told the judge. Mr. Goldberg interjected that the amounts cited by the Government in the indictment were inaccurate and would be contested before the sentencing. ''All right, Mr. Capasso,'' the judge said, ''I will accept your plea.'' A prosecutor, James McGuire, stressed to the judge that the plea covered only the charges in the tax indictment and did not preclude the possibility of other charges later. He said, ''The investigation relating to Mr. Capasso is still continuing.'' Mr. Goldberg then submitted a motion to the judge, seeking a court order to insure that the continuing investigation was proper. He called for an order prohibiting Government disclosures of grand-jury material, providing a hearing to identify the sources of leaks and requiring a new grand jury and a new prosecutor. Strenuous Objection Replying briefly for the prosecution, Mr. McGuire told the judge that the Government would ''strenuously oppose'' the defense motion. In a one-page statement issued later, Deputy United States Attorney Dennison Young Jr. said the Government and the grand jury ''acted responsibly'' in the investigation. ''Capasso's motion is a transparent tactic,'' he added, ''that seeks to chill the prosecutors and the grand jury and to take the focus off of himself and the serious charges to which he has admitted guilt.'' Ms. Myerson's lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, said later that it would not be appropriate for her to make any comment. Plea Met With Surprise Law-enforcement officials expressed surprise over Mr. Capasso's guilty plea and said they could only speculate about his motives. One said it was possible that Mr. Capasso, by pleading guilty to the tax charges now, was hoping to avoid the Government's creating a broader racketeering case ''based on the same material later on.'' Another possibility, this official said, was that Mr. Capasso was hoping to diminish the damaging publicity about himself and Ms. Myerson and that ''the most effective way to do that is to terminate the case.'' But another law-enforcement official disagreed, saying Mr. Capasso would have pleaded guilty only if he thought the ''case against him was so strong he was going to lose it.'' This official said he thought Mr. Capasso and his lawyer believed they would ''get a better shake'' from Judge Stewart and preferred to do so rather than take the chance of being assigned to a less lenient judge after arraignment.

853-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; President to Resign At American Can
Frank J. Connor, president of the American Can Company, announced yesterday that he would leave March 1 to pursue other business interests. American Can has gone through a major transformation, from a manufacturing company to a financial services and specialty retailing enterprise, and Mr. Connor's job appears to be a victim of the change. He made his way up through the manufacturing side and was a key figure in American Can's packaging business, which it recently sold to Triangle Industries. American Can, under Gerald Tsai Jr., vice chairman and chief executive, has started using a decentralized management style in which the varied subsidiaries run their own operations. The company, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., said it had no plans to name a successor to Mr. Connor. It plans to change its name in April at its annual meeting to reflect its transformation. Mr. Connor said, ''I'm looking forward to continuing to be very active in business,'' and added that ''I want to run my own show.'' He said that in addition to his manufacturing experience he had looked after the retailing sector at American Can and had learned the financial services business. ''I have big business experience,'' he said, ''and I know something about restructuring.'' He added that he might do some investing. ''There are a lot of opportunities out there,'' he said. Mr. Connor, who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., joined M&T Chemicals 30 years ago and moved up through sales and marketing to general management, eventually becoming president and chief executive. In 1975, American Can acquired M&T and Mr. Connor became executive vice president of the packaging division, responsible for national and international operations. He was named president and chief operating officer of American Can in 1981, and in 1983 became a member of a new office of the chairman. Mr. Connor, who is married with four children, is a graduate of Maryknoll College in Ossining, N.Y., and took courses in chemical engineering at Newark College of Engineering and Wayne State in Detroit. He said he plans no extensive vacation before seeking out his new business interests. ''I'm a businessman,'' he said. ''I'm out there ready to go.''

855-> SLUGGISH ISLANDERS DEFEATED
Mike Bossy had predicted that the Islanders would have to do better than be merely mediocre if they wanted to be victorious, and tonight their inefficiency cost them a game. The team fired 38 shots at the Capitals' goalie, Bob Mason, proof that Washington was unable to handcuff the Islanders as much as they would have liked. The trouble was, the Islanders were unable to convert their forays into goals while the Capitals, the league's least productive team, followed through on theirs just often enough to cling to a 3-2 edge. ''We had so many chances and we didn't put them away,'' said Bryan Trottier, whose line was on the ice for all three goals scored by the Capitals but managed none of their own. ''That's the disapppointing thing, but what's worse is having no opportunities at all. We should have won, we had the chances to do it, but then, so did they.'' Patience Is Factor Coach Bryan Murray of Washington thought his team's patience was the key. ''We had disciplined checking and the patience, once the game was tied 2-2, to wait for another opportunity rather than gamble to create chances. ''Too often this season we'd ended up taking risks and getting picked apart in this sort of situation. Also, if you can't stop Trottier's line, you're in trouble. We were fortunate tonight to not only stop them, but to score three goals against their line, and that made the whole game for us.'' In the first period, the defense-minded Capitals got an unexpected lift when Mike Ridley beat Kelly Hrudey after just 27 seconds had elapsed. ''It happened so fast, but Larry Murphy found me in the slot and I just got off a shot as quick as I could,'' said Ridley, who has three goals in seven games since joining the Capitals and trying to help repair the damage done to the offense by the departure of Bobby Carpenter. Ridley said the adjustment to the Capitals' style hasn't been difficult because it mimics the defensive emphasis with which the Rangers played at this time last season. Easy Transition ''They've made the trade easy for us because they feel, in getting three players for Carpenter, that they've gotten a whole line for nothing,'' Ridley said. ''The guys knew Carpenter wasn't going to get anymore playing time there, trade or not.'' Hrudey, who hadn't played in the nine days that Billy Smith honed a three-game unbeaten streak, wound up making 29 saves. ''I had a rocky start, because when something happens like that when you haven't played in awhile, you start to question yourself. ''I felt better as the night went on, but when you lose, it's always a shallow feeling.'' The game developed into a 2-2 duel the clubs nursed from the opening minutes of the second period, when Brent Sutter's deflection earned them a game-tying power-play goal at the three-minute mark. The deadlock lasted until 13:08 of the third period when Washington's Gaetan Duchesne sprinted toward the right post and snapped his second goal of the evening past Hrudey. The Islanders were beaten, 2-1, by the Capitals when the two clubs met on Dec. 26; they were smothered into submission by the Washington defense. But tonight the Capitals simply outlasted the Islanders, who have now been unconvincing, unpredictable, or both in three straight outings, and saw their four-game unbeaten streak snapped. ''I think we bring some of our problems on ourself,'' said Coach Terry Simpson, ''but we played a little better tonight than we had in our last two games. We just didn't play well enough to win, and that takes the satisfaction out of the improvement.'' ---- The assistant coach, Bob Nystrom, returned to the bench after serving a 10-game suspension for pursuing a fan into the stands after a game at the Meadowlands Dec. 11. Nystrom contends that the New Jersey fan, James G. Smith, dumped beer on him. The two have filed counterclaims for assault and are scheduled to appear in East Rutherford Municipal Court Feb. 18.

856-> DEVELOPING TOMORROW'S ART PATRONS
Paul Schnell said that two years ago he didn't know very much about the contemporary art scene but yearned to know more. Though his mother was a painter and his grandfather an art dealer, Mr. Schnell's everyday world revolves around corporate mergers and acquisitions -far from the heart of New York's art world. Rather than venture into that eclectic world with no direction, Mr. Schnell, a 32-year-old lawyer with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, approached the New Museum of Contemporary Art and its founder-director, Marcia Tucker, about creating an organization that could tailor programs to the needs of people like himself. The result was the creation of New Collectors, a group of 50 young and mostly professional people interested in knowing more about the latest waves in art. ''Large institutions are intimidating places for someone starting out,'' Mr. Schnell said during an interview in his 44th-floor office in Manhattan. ''The New Museum is the most inviting place around, an approachable institution, and I thought it would be a great place for people like me to learn about contemporary art.'' The New Museum, an experimental institution that has given artists with little following a place to exhibit, has also been a flexible place for people trying to figure out the downtown art scene. This year the museum, at 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, celebrates its 10th anniversary and will hold a gala benefit on April 27. Program Is Self-Supporting With a formal, structured membership program offering privileges similar to those at older institutions like the Metropolitan, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim, the New Museum's two-year-old New Collectors program is separate, self-supporting and self-governing. The program plans its own events and decides which aspects of the contemporary art scene it will look at. Although the group is ''closely associated'' with the museum - part of its $125 membership fee goes to supporting the museum's work, and the museum's staff assists members with special requests - members often venture outside. Restricted to people 39 years old or under with a keen interest in contemporary art, the New Collectors group hopes to refine the tastes of a membership that may someday become not only collectors, but patrons of the New Museum. ''Generally, museums have depended on the support of an older group of people,'' said Virginia Strull, the museum's director of planning and development, who works closely with the group. ''We see this as a way to get a younger group involved that may some day help the museum.'' The New Collectors has found its members largely through word of mouth. Members have brought potential candidates into the fold; most have tended to come from the well-educated ranks of young lawyers and bankers. They are invited to openings, they visit (the collectors say they dislike the connotations of the word ''tour'') artists' studios and private collections, hold discussion sessions, and exchange ideas with curators and art dealers. Members Do All the Work ''They run with it,'' Ms. Strull said. ''The best and most effective part about the New Collectors is that the members have done all the work and planning. They've been wonderful at pulling these programs together.'' Even institutions like Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, with its Museum Council, and the Junior Council at the Detroit Institute of Art have established networks to pursue followers who may some day prove beneficial to the museum. ''The Junior Council was set up about 20 years ago as a very small group that would be a training ground for future trustees for the museum,'' said Linda Downs, the curator of education at the Detroit museum. ''About 10 years ago, it was expanded to include more people who wanted to become more involved.'' Like the New Collectors, the 1,000-member Junior Council has special programs, dinners, private exhibitions and information services for its members, who are looking toward becoming collectors and who tend to fit the same under-40, privileged, professional profile. Corporate Collections One recent evening the New Collectors visited the corporate offices of Paine Weber Inc. and those of the Alliance Capital Management Corporation to view two formidable but very different collections. The Paine Weber collection - the brainchild of the chairman, Donald B. Marron, who also serves as president of the Modern Museum - contains works by Stella, Twombly, Alex Katz and many other powerhouses of the contemporay art scene. At Alliance Capital, the group was treated to an odyssey through the private print collection of Mr. and Mrs. Dave Williams. Mr. Williams, Alliance Capital's chairman, has been collecting mostly American prints, ranging from Winslow Homer to Larry Rivers, over the last 15 years. ''My feeling is that collections like these are just the tip of the iceberg,'' Ms. Tucker said. ''There must be incredible things in some of the offices on Wall Street that nobody but employees ever see.'' Lisa Suino, 28, a project manager for New York City's Financial Services Corporation, said she became interested in the museum and joined New Collectors because it was what she called ''on the cutting edge.'' I keep in touch through this program.

857-> Indiana Utility Improves
The Public Service Company of Indiana said today that it will report a much smaller loss for 1986 than it had in 1985. The company also said its board had approved the payment of preferred dividends for the first quarter, and for other quarters. Such payouts were suspended last year. The Indiana utility did not specify what its total loss will be. It said it would have operating earnings of $1.68 a share for 1986, but noted that those operating earnings would be wiped out by, among other things, losses on the canceled Marble Hill nuclear power plant.

858-> PRAISE FOR SAINT LAURENT'S TAILORED CLOTHES
After several lackadaisical seasons, Yves Saint Laurent scored this morning with a spring and summer couture collection that was totally on target. Simple and beautifully designed, it carried no excess baggage in the form of weird headgear or accessories. It was his best collection since his ''rich peasant'' clothes 10 years ago, though the emphasis has shifted. Instead of fantasy, the focus is now on reality. This is not costume-party dressing - these are clothes women can wear. Superb shoulders and good legs are helpful assets because, as the designer observed when he was accepting congratulations backstage, the key to the collection is ''short.'' And the majority of evening dresses, short or long, have strapless or, newer still, shallow off-the-shoulder necklines. All the day clothes were short, the hemlines stopping several inches above the knees. The narrow skirts, sometimes wrapped to the side or front, were accompanied by newly proportioned tailored jackets that gave a fresh look to the suits. Jackets were knuckle-length, had one-button closings at the waist and were decorated only with wide, slanting pocket flaps at the hips. Sleeves ended a few inches above the wrists. Saint Laurent said he was quite pleased with the jacket shapes. He showed them with very plain blouses - no more than T-shirts - or with no blouse at all. They weren't cluttered up with jewelry, either. The models wore earrings: collages of old coins or hammered silver earrings in the shape of a Y were prominent with the day clothes. Shoes were classic pumps with high, sturdy stacked wood heels. Just as a woman at a party in a smart black dress can make more elaborately gowned guests seem overdressed, his expertly tailored suits made other daytime clothes shown this week seem overdone. Unlike most other couture designers, Saint Laurent did not ignore trousers. Neither did Christian Lacroix. At Patou the other day, he showed one pants outfit that some women said was the most wearable style in his collection. At Saint Laurent, the pants suits, crisply tailored in dark woolen fabrics, were an alternative to the short-skirted styles. Other daytime outfits included jersey tunics, newly proportioned with short wrapped skirts, and neat linen dresses, sometimes accented with the same slanted pockets as the suits. For evening, there was a change in mood, with fragile fabrics like organza and lace taking over. The gentle, romantic shapes start with bared shoulders, which look even more pronounced when accompanied by long, snug sleeves. Long earrings dip below the shoulder line. The prints are mostly flowers, especially roses, in soft shades. There are some shockers here, including minidresses in puckered black sheer silks that barely cover the body. A bit of ruffling around the hem and neckline adds to the flirtatious look. Other dresses are almost as short in front but dip regally at the back. Fabrics are never tortured into strange shapes, and there is never any distortion of the body. No dress is encumbered with masses of petticoats. ''It is modern, intelligent design,'' said Grace Mirabella, the editor in chief of Vogue. ''All three of us loved it,'' said Kalman Ruttenstein, the senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, who was sitting with Ellin Saltzman of Saks Fifth Avenue and Sonja Caproni of I. Magnin. ''It's the way women want to look - and the way men want them to look,'' Miss Caproni added. Even the models were enthusiastic. ''I loved the black suit I wore in the show,'' Dalma said. ''I wish someone would give it to me.'' Mounia called the collection ''the best'' and said the clothes ''are not a disguise.'' Private customers, busy making appointments for fittings, agreed with the professionals. ''No costume-party crinolines, no gimmicks,'' Judith Taubman observed ''Just straightforward, beautifully cut clothes that you can wear for more than one season.'' Jasper Conran, the British ready-to-wear designer who is writing about the collections for The Sunday Times of London, called the clothes ''brilliant.'' Later in the day, Alix Gres presented her clothes with little fanfare in her mirrored salon on the Rue de la Paix, as she has since the 1930's. Like the best artists, the best dressmakers simplify as they attain mastery of their craft. Her technique is to let the fabric flow over the body, with seemingly little interference from the designer. A pinch at the waist causes a bodice to blouse softly. A slash at the shoulders looks decorative as well as cool. Her clothes are so lacking in artifice they make even Saint Laurent's look complex. The exceptions are her tucked chiffon dresses, done this time all in white, with daring flashes of bare skin. They were shown under cloaks of brown chiffon. Other designers attempt this kind of draping and always fall short of the mark. At Gres, fashion approaches art.

859-> TV REVIEWS; NBC PRESENTS 'THE TORTELLIS,' A 'CHEERS' SPINOFF
FAMILIES, extended or nuclear, are big on television these days. Comes now ''The Tortellis.'' He's unscrupulous; she's dumb; everyone lives in Las Vegas, Nev. The new NBC series, a spinoff from ''Cheers,'' begins tonight at 9:30. It's not great, but here and there it has moments. The moments, even if fleeting, are provided by Dan Hedaya. He played the ex-husband of Rhea Perlman on ''Cheers.'' Ms. Perlman, as Carla, appears briefly tonight. Mr. Hedaya, in a dream sequence, stands at the gates of Heaven, applying for admission. Various people from his life, among them Ms. Perlman, appear as character witnesses. Everyone agrees he was a louse. Mr. Hedaya awakens then. He's on a bus for Las Vegas, and like Scrooge after meeting the spirits, he's ready to begin a new life. The question is, is he truly repentant or is he still a louse? The question, presumably, will be asked on all episodes of ''The Tortellis.'' Why is this taking place in Las Vegas? Tonight's episode doesn't quite tell us, although the producers - Glen Charles, Les Charles, James Burrows and Patricia Nardo - must see comic possibilities. Gambling, divorce and flashy stage shows; Mr. Hedaya's Nick Tortelli, a television repairman, hasn't discovered any of this yet. It is likely that later he will. Tonight, Mr. Hedaya shows up at the apartment of his estranged wife, played by Jean Kasem, and asks for a reconciliation. They separated after she discovered him taking a shower with an Avon Lady. ''I've changed completely,'' Mr. Hedaya says. ''The shirt is different, but the pants are the same,'' Ms. Kasem thoughtfully replies. Ms. Kasem, tall and statuesque, is supposed to be in the Marie Wilson-Suzanne Somers-dumb blonde tradition. Miss Kasem is living with her sister (Carlene Watkins), who is divorced and has a small son. More comic possibilities then: the small son, an adorable moppet, and Mr. Hedaya will not get along. Anyway, Mr. Hedaya moves into the apartment. Then his son (Timothy Williams) by his first wife and the son's new teen-age wife (Mandy Ingber) move in, too. Welcome to television's new misshapen family. Mr. Hedaya has a comic presence; he can add weight to an otherwise slapstick joke. Save that, however, ''The Tortellis'' seems to be only a trifle. Maybe it will get going when it leaves the apartment and moves around Las Vegas.

861-> Smaller Trade Gap Seen for September
The trade deficit for September will be announced today, and the amount is likely to be lower, but not by much, than the $15.7 billion deficit for August that helped to set off the stock market collapse last month. Many economists predicted a deficit for merchandise trade of between $14 billion and $15 billion. That level is not expected to have much of an impact on the financial markets. The trade figures, compiled by the Commerce Department, are likely to contain some good news and some bad news. Help From Weak Dollar The good news is that the volume of imported manufactured goods, which rose in the spring and summer, seems to be leveling off, while exports are rising. The weaker dollar appears to be improving the trade balance, at least as far as manufactured goods are concerned. But even if the volume of manufactured imports finally drops, a new problem is developing that might prevent the trade deficit from falling significantly for many months: surging petroleum imports. ''Oil is the Achilles' heel of the trade picture now,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy specialist and a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Higher Costs for Oil The oil problem has developed almost unnoticed. With domestic production falling and consumption rising, crude oil imports have risen to more than 6.5 million barrels a day, from a low of 3.8 million in February 1986, according to the Energy Department. At the same time, while oil prices have dropped somewhat in recent months, to about $19 a barrel, they are well above the low of $11 a barrel of August 1986. As a result, the value of oil imports was $14 billion higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter, when it increased by $6 billion. Without that third-quarter increase, the August merchandise trade deficit, announced on Oct. 14, would have been closer to $11 billion than $15.7 billion. Many economists argue that the trade picture is improving because of rising United States exports and the apparent leveling off of imported manufactured goods. But Walter Joelson, chief economist at the General Electric Company, said, ''It is very disingenuous of us to talk about a decline in imports other than oil.'' And Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, observed: ''If you want to ask the question, 'Is the United States buying more than it can afford?' you can't factor out oil.'' Frustration in Cutting Deficit Mr. Lawrence and other analysts pointed out that if oil imports remained high - as many experts think they will - it will be difficult to reduce the trade deficit much. The United States' exports only equal about 60 percent of the nation's imports, and there is not great hope of them increasing enough to make up the difference. The best hope for dramatic improvement, many experts say, is to reduce imports of manufactured goods, but that is unlikely for several reasons. One is the widespread practice of American companies - including auto makers and electronics manufacturers - of importing parts for products manufactured here or of importing whole products for sale under domestic brand names. The Federal Government does not break out figures on the practice, but Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, estimated that parts and other industrial supplies account for as much as one-third of the nation's imports. Mr. Jasinowski and Albert T. Warner, director of the Commerce Department's motor vehicle division, said the practice was not much affected by a weaker dollar because the imports often come from the overseas subsidiaries of American companies or because the imported components are highly engineered items that cannot be easily replaced by American-made parts. Other Drawbacks Abroad In addition, 50 percent of the nation's imports come from Canada or from nations in Latin America and the Far East whose currencies have not risen against the dollar or are just beginning to rise. Above all, the Japanese and some foreign manufacturers have found ways to maintain their exports to the United States. General Electric's relationship with the Sanyo Electric Company of Japan illustrates the point. Sanyo makes most of the air-conditioners that G.E. sells under its own label. With the dollar plunging, Sanyo tried to raise the prices of these units, but canceled the increases after G.E. said it could not pass them along to consumers. Instead, Sanyo cut costs, mostly by moving its factory last April from Japan to Singapore, where labor costs are lower and the currency has not risen much against the dollar. Japanese Exporters Squeezed But the overall production costs of Japanese companies have risen by 50 percent in dollar terms since early 1985, when the dollar began its plunge, while the prices of Japanese exports sold in the United States have gone up only 20 percent, according to a study by Peter Hooper and Catherine L. Mann of the Federal Reserve. ''They can't hold the line forever,'' Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the Japanese and Germans. In fact, the prices of many imported products from Japan, Germany and other countries have already risen as much as 8 percent in the past year, which has cut into sales. The decline is showing up in Commerce Department trade figures adjusted for inflation. Excluding oil, import volume by this measure rose a mild 1.4 percent in the first nine months of this year, with much of the increase in the second quarter. But when petroleum is added - and petroleum accounted for 20 percent of total import volume in the third quarter -the overall increase is 4.1 percent for the first nine months, including a preliminary Commerce Department estimate for September. Many analysts expect oil imports to increase rather than decrease during the next few years. One reason is that the United States is a high-cost producer of oil, Mr. Verleger, the oil economist, said. At current prices, there is not much incentive for oil companies to increase their exploration and production in the United States, he said. In addition, oil consumption in the United States has been rising. It has increased by 800,000 barrels a day, roughly 5 percent, in two years. This increase, coupled with a decline of one million barrels a day in domestic production, goes a long way toward explaining why oil imports have risen. Looking for a silver lining, Mr. Joelson of G.E. said that if OPEC sells the United States more oil, ''they'll buy more of our exports - and that will help.''

863-> HIGH U.S. OFFICIAL ARRIVES IN POLAND
The Deputy Secretary of State, John Whitehead, arrived here today on an official visit to determine whether the United States should keep up economic sanctions against Poland. His arrival coincided with the end of a private trip by Mayor Koch, who virtually indicated that he favored the lifting of sanctions, which were imposed when Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in late 1981. During his four-day visit, Mayor Koch at times seemed to regard Poles he met as people who, if they could not vote for him themselves, might well have relatives in Greenpoint or elsewhere in New York City who could. The Mayor sought unsuccessfully to persuade General Jaruzelski to receive him, saying that he could serve as a messenger conveying the leader's views to New Yorkers, particularly to the 400,000 of Polish origin. Mr. Koch managed to steer clear of controversial pronouncements until an hour before his departure when, after meeting with Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate, the Mayor verged on an endorsement of the Cardinal's appeal for the removal of the American sanctions. Highest U.S. Official to Visit Mr. Whitehead, the most senior American official to visit since the heyday of the Solidarity movement in 1980-81, said on arrival that the issue of economic sanctions was under review, but that there were still questions ''in the areas of human rights and national reconciliation.'' Mr. Whitehead, who is the second-ranking official in the State Department, is expected to meet with General Jaruzelski before traveling on to Prague on Saturday. The American official is also scheduled to have dinner with opposition figures, including Jacek Kuron, Adam Michnik and Lech Walesa, if the Solidarity founder can get time off from his shipyard job. Mr. Walesa said Tuesday he would not be excused. If the meetings come off, it will be the first time that General Jaruzelski will have met with a foreigner who has also conferred with the opposition. Mr. Whitehead is accompanied by Thomas Simons, Assistant Secretary for Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, and Paula Dobrianski of the National Security Council staff. Mayor Koch, after meeting with Cardinal Glemp, said on his departure: ''I go back to New York City with a lot of information which will be helpful to me when people ask me my view as it relates to ending sanctions against the Polish nation. I am not going to express it now, but I must say that what the Cardinal said to me is very, very important.'' Under questioning by reporters, the Mayor added: ''The advice that I have been given by very important people whom I have great confidence in is that the sanctions have hurt the Polish people, not the Polish Government, and this has to be carefully understood and weighed.'' Elements within the church and the opposition indeed believe that the restrictions on trade and credits have caused hardships for ordinary people. But hardly anyone seriously suggests that the sanctions have not also hurt the debt-burdened Government. Cardinal Glemp, who has long favored the removal of sanctions, said he expects to make the case when he meets Thursday with Mr. Whitehead. ''I have always maintained,'' he said, ''that the good of the country requires the widest possible contact with the West.''

864-> PLASTER CASTS OF STATUES: FROM STORAGE INTO VOGUE
The vast warehouse storage room is wall-to-wall with plaster replicas of the great sculpture of the Western world - by Michelangelo, Praxiteles and hundreds of others. But the statues stand in crowded rows, their faces chipped and cracked and black with the accumulated grime of decades. Disembodied heads are found by the boxful, and many figures have no lower limbs. It is the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of plaster casts -once among the museum's most highly prized treasures but until just a few years ago ignored and crumbling in a leaky storehouse under the West Side Highway in upper Manhattan. Recently, however, the casts have benefited from a renaissance of interest among scholars, who increasingly find them worthy of study, restoration and exhibition. Riding this wave of renewed interest, the Met was able last year to transfer the collection to a storage warehouse in the Bronx, and has lent hundreds of the works to museums and universities nationwide. ''We tried for years, with limited resources and different priorities, to have them restored and placed in academies and schools, but there were no takers,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum. ''There is no question there was a period of time when there was less interest than at other times. But with this resurgence of interest, we were able to gather up the resources to cope with them. I'd love to see more of them restored and put on loan.'' A center for the renewed interest in the casts is the Queens Museum, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. In the mid 1970's, the museum began to restore some of the Met's damaged casts, and today it runs a conservation laboratory exclusively for that purpose. In return for conserving the works, the Queens Museum is granted the right to borrow them on long-term loan. Permanent Exhibition Last April, the Queens Museum opened a permanent exhibition of 22 of the restored plaster casts, including those of the Venus de Milo, the Belvedere Torso and eight sculptures by Michelangelo, including the Florentine Pieta, the Dawn and Dusk figures from the Medici Chapel and the Dying Slave. ''We're looking at a real revolution in taste,'' said Janet Schneider, the director of the Queens Museum. ''After World War II, modern artists were seeking to negate the dominant Western classical tradition, and casts were a symbol of that tradition. Many of them were destroyed. But now, in 1986, there's a whole new generation of artists who never saw a cast. They've been away so long they begin to look new.'' Among the other institutions that have borrowed plaster casts from the Metropolitan Museum are Princeton University, Carnegie Mellon University and the New York Academy of Art, a school in Manhattan that uses a curriculum based on Renaissance and Beaux-Arts principles. The new interest in plaster casts, most experts agree, is yet another expression of ''post-modern'' taste, which extends beyond pure abstract art to an interest in a variety of historical styles, ranging from figurative and expressionist art to the architectural use of classical figures and decorations. Originally, plaster casts were the most prized holdings of major American museums, which in the 19th century collected them in the belief that masterpieces of European classical art and architecture would never be available - or affordable. Casting Teams In the late 19th century, the great museums of Europe, such as the Louvre and the British Museum, made casts of the original works in their collections to sell to American museums and collectors; at other times, American museums commissioned teams of craftsmen to make casts from the originals. In the early 20th century, however, as American fortunes grew and many in Europe dwindled, masterpieces began to flow to the west. A taste for originals came to dominate, and casts were put in storage or destroyed en masse until, by the 1940's, virtually none were on view. The fragility of the plaster casts made their storage perilous, and the Met's collection was no exception. In the 158th Street storehouse, the sculptures were often piled atop one another. Wind, leaky roofs and vibrations from traffic all took their toll. The turnabout began around 1975, when the Queens Museum requested, and received, the loan of several casts from the Met. In return, the smaller museum agreed to restore the works, and a conservation studio was formed for that purpose. The restoration project stalled in the late 70's for lack of funds but was revived in 1983 with a $150,000 grant from the Chase Manhattan Bank. In June 1985, with the encouragement of Mayor Koch, $100,000 in city funds were allocated to the restoration program, and later that year, as part of a highway construction project, the city paid for the transportation of the casts from the West Side Highway site to the Bronx. Multiprocess Cleaning Today, the Queens Museum conservation laboratory is working on more than 350 borrowed casts. A team of four can take up to a month on a major piece, at an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000. The process involves soaking the surface with a mild solvent, gently scraping off the dirt, then painting and polishing the statue. According to Ms. Schneider, the casts are not without their detractors - ''many people still consider them duller than death'' - but their assets outweigh their limitations. She said that since many of the casts, such as those of the Parthenon frieze, were made before pollution decayed the original works, they actually showed far more detail than the current originals. The casts have proved popular with many artists. George Segal, the contemporary sculptor who works in roughly modeled plaster, recently visited the plaster-cast replicas of Michelangelo's Medici Chapel sculptures at the New York Academy of Art. ''Nobody stops you when you run your hand over the musculature,'' said Mr. Segal. ''One of the primary experiences of being a sculptor is physical tangibility, being able to see and touch. I thought it was magnificent to encounter a Michelangelo cast that way. These experiences are remarkably rich.''

865-> MEESE BACKS ADMINISTRATION OVER CUTS IN DRUG CAMPAIGN
Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d denied today that the Reagan Administration was scaling back its campaign against drug abuse. He charged that critics who protested cuts in some Federal drug law-enforcement programs were ''more interested in politics than progress.'' In explaining the the Administration's decision to reduce financing for some drug programs, Mr. Meese said President Reagan remained ''committed to continuing an aggressive and expanding campaign against drug trafficking and drug abuse.'' Mr. Meese spoke before the Abraxas Foundation in Pittsburgh. Excerpts from the speech were made available in Washington today. The Attorney General was responding to Congressional lawmakers who say the Administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1988 reflects a diminished concern with ending drug abuse. According to a computation by lawmakers, the new budget would eliminate $225 million to state and local governments for drug law enforcement in 1988 that had been stipulated in a major drug bill signed by President Reagan last October. The proposed budget ld also sharply reduce Federal efforts in drug education. Politics vs. Progress ''Unfortunately, we have lately been hearing a new chorus of negative criticism from those who are more interested in politics than progresss,'' Mr. Meese said. ''By distorting the budget figures and by either mistakenly or deliberately misrepresenting the facts, they are trying to give the impression that this Administration is cutting back on the battle against narcotics. Nothing could be further from the truth.'' He indicated that budget cuts were appropriate since many drug program expenditures over the last year had been used to cover one-time, start-up costs and that money spent on Federal law-enforcement efforts would actually increase, by about $72 million, in the 1988 budget. ''We are proposing increases in the most vital areas,'' he said. ''We will be able to hire more investigators and more prosecutors. And we will be able to build more prison cells for those ultimately convicted and sentenced. Those who claim 'budget cutbacks' either don't understand or are by design confusing the figures. ''By ignoring the facts that some of the 1987 funds were for one-time capital expenditures,'' he went on, ''that other monies were appropriated in that year and were to be spent over a two-year period, and that certain grants were intended by the Administration to be for start-up costs of local programs, critics have tried to show a dimunition of the national effort.'' 'Appalling,' Republican Says After the budget proposal was made public, Democratic and Republican lawmakers denounced the cuts, saying Mr. Reagan had often placed a major priority on drug abuse programs. ''These cutbacks are just appalling,'' said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of upstate New York, the ranking minority member of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. He said, ''It represents an attitude that waging war on drugs is a short-term project.'' Mr. Meese also apparently criticized news organizations for failing to publicize recent figures showing that the Drug Enforcement Administration, a division of the Justice Department, had arrested nearly 36 percent more major drug violators in 1986 than in 1985. ''The D.E.A. figures testify eloquently that the Federal law-enforcement effort is becoming more and more effective,'' he said. ''The truth,'' Mr. Meese continued, ''is that the proper Federal role in combatting drugs has received continually increasing support over the past six years, outstripping comparable commitments by most state and local governments.'

866-> LUMBER PACT WITH U.S. IS CRITICIZED IN CANADA
Canadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax. The executives were joined by politicians opposed to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government, which reached the agreement in Washington late Tuesday under the pressure of a midnight deadline set under United States trade law. The agreement will apply to Canadian exports that captured 32 percent of the United States softwood market in 1985, at a value of about $2.9 billion. Industry analysts here forecast that the new export tax will reverse a trend that has seen Canada widening its American market share in recent years, as layoffs and bankruptcies have increased in the United States softwood industry. American companies, contending that low fees in Canada for timber cutting amounted to an unfair subsidy, led the fight for a tariff penalty that resulted in a Commerce Department ruling that imposed the 15 percent import levy. Critics here had argued that Canada should resist increased softwood levies and should carry the issue into international trade tribunals if necessary. The Government, although bristling, decided to go for a quick settlement that would keep the increased duties, amounting to an estimated $435 million, in Canada. In addition, the officials wished to avoid a final ruling by the Commerce Department that they feared might encourage similar petitions by other American industries facing strong Canadian imports. The announcement of the accord was greeted with satisfaction in official quarters. The Forestry Minister, Gerald Merrithew, said that it had avoided a potentially damaging precedent for Canadian industries, while the Premier of British Columbia, William Vander Zalm, whose province accounts for 70 percent of the softwood exports involved in the dispute, maintained that any damage would lie mainly with United States consumers faced with higher prices. ''Life will go on,'' Mr. Vander Zalm said. ''The forest companies, I'm sure, will survive and continue to log and mill and do all of the wonderful things that create employment.'' This view was bitterly contested, however, by spokesmen for some of the companies affected. ''It's bizarre, it's sickening,'' said Adam Zimmerman, president of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of the country's largest forest products companies. 'An Industrial Paraplegic' Mr. Zimmerman, who is chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said that the Washington agreement had made ''an industrial paraplegic'' of Canadian lumber companies and threatened to wipe out their entire profits at a stroke. Other critics contended that the agreement would throw as many as 20,000 Canadians out of work, set a precedent for future American interference with the pricing of Canadian natural resources and encourage protectionist forces that have made this a troubled year in Canada-United States trade. ''Whether we're talking about the export of wood products, pork, corn, tubular steel, fish, any major Canadian export now is subject to this kind of action by the United States,'' said Edward Broadbent, leader of the New Democratic Party, which is heavily backed by labor unions. After announcing that Canada would put the new tax in effect on Jan. 8, officials here were critical of President Reagan's decision to impose a bridging levy of 15 percent on the Canadian imports until the new tax takes effect. A senior official in Ottawa, speaking on a background basis, called the President's action ''a bit of greed and haste.'' Beyond all this, opponents of the deal said that it cast a pall over the Mulroney Government's initiative to liberalize the rules governing trade between the two countries, the world's largest trading partners. The broad trade initiative, explored in talks that began last May, have run into major obstacles that have raised doubts about the prospects for an accord before a September 1987 deadline set by Congress. Hostile Feelings The trade tensions have generated hostile feelings among many Canadians who generally are well disposed toward the United States. Even Mr. Mulroney, whose Government's fortunes rest heavily on the attempt to negotiate a broad trade deal with Washington, has spoken about his doubts that the United States appreciates ''its friends.'' The Mulroney administration had been buffeted by a United States decision in May to impose a stiff tariff on Canadian cedar shakes and shingles, a major British Columbia export, and had retaliated with a range of tariffs on American imports as varied as computer parts and Christmas trees. Then, in October, Canada slapped a countervailing duty of about 70 percent on American corn imports, saying that United States farm policies amounted to unfair subsidization. U.S. APPLAUDS PACT WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Special To The New York Times) - Reagan Administration officials applauded the agreement with Canada that ended the often contentious lumber dispute, which had threatened to derail broader free trade negotiations between the two countries. ''We commend the negotiators on both sides of the border,'' said S. Bruce Smart Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade administration. ''The solution successfully addresses the problem,'' added Alan Woods, deputy United States trade representative.

868-> GOING OUT GUIDE
JOYCE IN PARIS The Gotham Book Mart and Gallery, 41 West 47th Street (719-4476), has had a relationship with James Joyce for more than a half-century, since ''Ulysses,'' which was classified as an immoral, unimportable work by the Federal Government, was sold under the counter at the store. The society of James Joyce admirers still meets at the Gotham and his books are sold over the counter in this most venerable of quality New York bookstores. At the moment, there is a special recognition of James Joyce in the 35 photographs on the walls of the second-floor room that serves as the gallery. They were taken in Paris by Gisele Freund, a Parisian photographer who made them in the decade before Joyce died in 1941. Ms. Freund, now in her 70's, was first published in Life magazine, and she was well-known for her portraits of literary and artistic personalities, such as Joyce, Sartre, Matisse, Eliot, Cocteau, Bonnard, Duchamp, Man Ray, Virginia Woolf, Beckett, Auden, Steinbeck, Isherwood, Nabokov, Shaw, Steinbeck and Henry Miller. The pictures at the Gotham include several that have never before been exhibited. They are displayed in a somewhat narrative order, showing the author visiting his publisher, Shakespeare & Company. It starts with two photos of Joyce paying a Paris taxi and continues with him and his associates in their book-lined office, and later has him in the country and reclining at leisure. He is a pleasantly plain, thin-faced man with features that might, if anything, betoken a retiring poet rather than a writer who pioneered a literary upheaval. Open free, through Feb. 26, from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays. A RETURN In 1984, Jane Harvey made the first of what have turned out to be annual appearances at Freddy's Supper Club, 308 East 49th Street (888-1633), and the singer starts her fourth-year round there tonight doing Stephen Sondheim tunes through Sunday. Miss Harvey arrived at Cafe Society from Jersey City in the early 1940's, scored a hit and was a popular figure in New York and Hollywood for a decade. Her career languished during the 1950's but rebounded with a popular album and a new following several years ago. In a review, John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times that she is a ''superb and classic supper club singer.'' Now Miss Harvey has made a new album, one that will be the theme of her Freddy's engagement, ''Another Side of Sondheim,'' with Mike Renzi at piano. At 8:30 P.M. today through Saturday, at 2 P.M. Sunday. There is a $12 cover and a two-drink minimum. Drinks, $3 up. Sandwiches and salads, $5.95 to $9.95. ONE SCHOOL OF MUSIC There have been noticeable living-style changes on the stretches of Second and Third Avenues in the neighborhood of East 11th Street, but the Third Street Musical Settlement, which is between the two, at 235 East 11th Street (777-3240), carries on through times of gentrification as it did through days of impoverishment. The venerable music school sponsors, through June, free concerts that present a panorama of classical and modern music. Tonight at 8 P.M., the pianist Edmund Niemann performs a program of pieces more in the modern mold. With Nurit Tilles at a second piano, he will perform such pieces as Stravinsky's Concert for Two Pianos, Oliveros's ''Gathering Together,'' Satie's ''Three Pieces in the Form of a Pear,'' Steve Reich's ''Piano Phase'' and Debussy's ''Two Etudes from Book II.'' No tickets required. CROSS-OVER Gloria Loring is a singer who is probably better known to those who have seen her as Liz Chandler Curtis in the daytime television series ''Days of Our Lives.'' She has also written a book of recipes for diabetic children, has done shows in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and tonight and tomorrow is to appear at the Bottom Line, 15 West 4th Street (228-6300). Sets are at 8 and 11 P.M. tonight, at 8:30 and 11:30 P.M. tomorrow. Admission: $12.50.

869-> COLUMNE ONE: OUR TOWNS; Providing a Friend For the Mentally Ill
TIMBER, a yellow Labrador retriever, jumped into the station wagon, but the other dog, Mindy has bad hips, and Mary Baker had to lift her onto the back seat. ''Come on Mindy,'' Ms. Baker said. ''Oh, you are so fat.'' ''Mindy is 6,'' said Ms. Baker, starting off on her usual Wednesday afternoon drive. ''I call her Melinda too. She loves everything, she mothers everybody - kittens, my nieces.'' ''So Mindy's temperament is love,'' Ms. Baker said. ''She's just like her mother, Darlyn.'' ''Now Timber is a very sociable dog for a male,'' said Ms. Baker, who is 65 years old and a longtime Labrador breeder. ''He has the same basic approach to people as Mindy.'' They are perfect dogs, Ms. Baker said, for working with mental patients. It was a 45-minute ride to Pilgrim State Hospital. Most of the buildings Ms. Baker passed on the way to Building 5 were empty. Since deinstitutionalization began in the 1950's, the hospital has shrunk to 2,800 patients, from 16,000. The volunteers, all women, arrived with their dogs a little after 1 P.M. Through the window of the locked ward they could see the patients, most sitting in chairs, doing nothing. There are 38 on Ward 1, all older women, most diagnosed as schizophrenic. Anna, as usual, was one of Ms. Baker's first visits. ''Hello, Anna,'' said Ms. Baker. It took Ms. Baker three weeks to get Anna to take Mindy's leash and another week to get a half-smile out of her. Anna has been hospitalized since 1953; in 1955, she was lobotomized. The chief of mental health treatment services, Kathleen Newcomb, says Anna had grown extremely withdrawn after being ''beaten up'' by patients on another ward. ''With the dogs,'' said Mrs. Newcomb, ''Anna's one of the ones who's come out the most.'' ''I'm being locked in?'' said Anna, puzzled. ''No, your personality has come out,'' said Mrs. Newcomb. ''Oh,'' said Anna. ''Tell why you like the dog,'' said Anke Kapsenberg, a therapist. But Anna said nothing. She took Mindy's leash and walked off. Ms. Baker recently brought Anna a small potted pine, and told her, ''You have to take care of it, a live tree in soil.'' Anna said, ''That's for me?'' Then she cried. Later, Ms. Baker said, ''You do get emotion from them.'' Aides say that Frances is the healthiest on Ward 1. She had lived outside until recently. ''You like when something's going on here,'' she said. ''It's a break in the day. It's a long day. It gets very boring, it really does. Some of the patients can communicate, but half don't know how.'' Frances said she likes dogs, but sat against the wall, away from them. ''It's better if they come to you,'' she said. On Ward 1, only bingo is more popular than the dogs. Wednesday mornings, Cleo always says, ''The dogs are coming today, right?'' The volunteers and their pets are screened by Bide-A-Wee, a humane society that runs several similar pet therapy programs. ''There's no one better than Mary Baker,'' said Debbie Feliziani of Bide-A-Wee. She called Timber and Mindy ''naturals.'' Some have said it would be better to concentrate on healthier patients, who would have a better chance to function in society, but Ms. Baker does not agree. ''We're not here as a cure,'' she said. ''We don't expect any of them to leave. We hope to make their days better. Nobody touches them, they're never touched - they look for it now.'' She says the dogs are popular on Ward 1, because a dog loves, without asking questions. Ms. Baker said she tries to follow that lead. Hattie, who is in her 70's and often holds conversations with herself, took Timber by the nose. ''Say 19, 19,'' she told the dog. ''Read something for me. I wish to speak to Professor Leach.'' She stuck her finger in Timber's mouth and asked, ''What house is he at?'' Ms. Baker spent a good deal of time with Helen, who is deaf and blind and has been at the hospital since 1943. She took Helen's hand, ran it over Timber's head and nose. Pretty soon, Helen was leaning forward in her wheelchair, doing it herself. Her lips moved, though nothing came out. During one visit Helen had taken the leash from Ms. Baker, folded it up and slipped it under Timber's collar, the way a professional handler would. ''This was a clue to me,'' said Ms. Baker, ''of Helen's past.'' Toward the end of the visit Ms. Baker went to Anna to get Mindy back and say goodbye. Anna began making little sounds and an aide had to sit her down. ''Too much excitement,'' said the aide. By 3, the session was over. As the dogs and their owners marched out, Ms. Kapsenberg, the therapist, took the key, attached by a stretch band at her waist, and locked the door behind them. Ms. Baker got the dogs into the car, giving Mindy a boost. As she drove past the empty buildings, the Labradors were quiet. ''They're tired,'' she said. ''They'll sleep.'' Ms. Baker said on the way home from Ward 1, ''You always count your blessings.'' The dogs did not stir again until she pulled onto her street.

870-> SOVIET TO CUT FORCES IN MONGOLIA
An infantry division and several other military units stationed in Mongolia will be withdrawn this spring, the Soviet Union announced today. Gennadi I. Gerasimov, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, read an announcement from the Defense Ministry at a news briefing, but declined to say how many soldiers would be involved. Mongolia, a close Soviet ally, is situated between the Soviet Union and China. ''In keeping with a decision taken by the Soviet leadership and an understanding reached with the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, one full-strength motorized rifle division and several separate units from the contingent of Soviet troops on temporary station in the territory of Mongolia will be returned to the Soviet Union next April through June,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. Moscow-based diplomats from NATO nations say there are about 38,000 Soviet troops now in Mongolia. The diplomats said a motorized rifle division has 12,695 soldiers. It was not clear how many troops are in the units on temporary assignment referred to in the Defense Ministry statement.

872-> Gooden, Mattingly File for Arbitration
Don Mattingly and Dwight Gooden, who last year negotiated their 1986 salaries after filing for salary arbitration, took the same first step yesterday, joining 95 other players in asking for arbitration on the final day of the filing period. That brought the arbitration total this winter to 104 players. Gooden was one of six members of the World Series champion Mets who placed their names on the arbitration list. Kevin McReynolds, the Mets' new left fielder, also filed, meaning all seven Mets eligible did so. Mattingly was one of four eligible Yankees, and the other three also filed. Joining Mattingly, Gooden and McReynolds were Ron Kittle, Cecilio Guante and Charlie Hudson of the Yankees, and Ron Darling, Wally Backman, Tim Teufel, Howard Johnson and Doug Sisk of the Mets. Among other players who filed on the final day were Jesse Barfield and George Bell of Toronto, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd of Boston, Willie McGee of St. Louis, Julio Franco of Cleveland, Mark Gubicza of Kansas City, Gary Gaetti of Minnesota, Kevin Bass and Bill Doran of Houston, Mike Marshall of Los Angeles and a variety of Davises - Alvin of Seattle, Mike of Oakland, Storm of San Diego and Chili and Mark of San Francisco. Two players, Ricky Horton of St. Louis and Bill Krueger of Oakland, filed and then reached agreement on new contracts later in the day. Among the players who settled on salaries yesterday without filing, Steve Bedrosian, a Philadelphia pitcher, received the most lucrative contract, two years for about $1.75 million. Most Settled Sooner On the final day of the filing period last year, a record 155 players submitted their names, making the total 159. However, only 35 players reached the hearing stage. Among those who settled before that point were Mattingly, who agreed to a $1,375,000 salary, and Gooden, who accepted a $1.32 million salary. Gooden was one of 10 Mets and Mattingly one of four Yankees who filed last year. All of the Yankees and six of the Mets settled before hearings. Ed Lynch, who was traded during the 1986 season, won his case, while Darling, Backman and Teufel lost. Mookie Wilson is the only other Mets player who has won in arbitration. The Mets have won four other times. The Yankees have a 5-3 record in cases heard but haven't had one heard since 1982, when they won cases against Ron Davis, Dave Revering and Bobby Brown. Al Harazin, a Mets' vice president, met yesterday with Tom Selakovich, McReynolds's agent, and made what Harazin called a ''handsome'' offer, but Selakovich rejected it. McReynolds was an arbitration loser last year as a member of the San Diego Padres. Other 1986 losers who filed yesterday were Franco, Gaetti, Kittle, Mike Moore of Seattle, Alvin Davis, Eddie Milner of San Francisco, Gary Pettis of California, Jeff Dedmon of Atlanta and Tim Laudner of Minnesota. Of last year's winners, Frank Viola of Minnesota, Phil Bradley of Seattle, Brett Butler of Cleveland, Charlie Leibrandt of Kansas City, Lynch of the Chicago Cubs and Marty Barrett of Boston filed yesterday. Bret Saberhagen, the Kansas City pitcher who was a big winner at $925,000 last year, did not file. He had a 7-12 record last season after having won the Cy Young Award the previous season with a 20-6 record and decided to negotiate his 1987 salary. Players eligible for salary arbitration were those with three years or more of major league service. Before this year, the requirement was two years. With the eligibility pool thus reduced, this year's total of players who filed was well below last year's record of 159. The arbitration hearings will be held next month and players and clubs may negotiate until they start.

874-> REAGAN WON'T APOLOGIZE ON IRAN, AIDE SAYS
The White House asserted today that President Reagan would not apologize for his Administration's handling of the secret arms deal with Iran and the channeling of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. ''The President feels that he has done nothing for which he feels he must apologize,'' said Albert R. Brashear, the deputy White House spokesman. Mr. Brashear was responding to a report in The New York Times, quoting Republican leaders in Congress as saying the President should take full responsibility for the crisis and apologize for any mistakes made by his Administration. The closest Mr. Reagan has come to such a statement was in a radio address on Dec. 6, when he said, ''The execution of these policies were flawed and mistakes were made.'' To many Republicans in Congress, Mr. Reagan has been damaged by the lingering nature of the Iran affair, and they have urged him to wipe the slate clean with some dramatic gesture. While some have suggested a full apology, others have recommended the dismissal of Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff. 'Not Going to Apologize' But today, a Republican strategist with close ties to the White House insisted, ''The President is not going to apologize, and Don Regan is not going to go.'' The Times report said several Republicans had asked David M. Abshire, the special counselor assigned to coordinate the Administration's response to the Iran affair, to convey their calls for an apology to the President. Mr. Brashear said that while Mr. Abshire has direct access to Mr. Reagan, it was not clear whether the requests had been delivered. It is clear, however, that if the requests did reach the President, they were not heeded. Undaunted, several of the Republicans today repeated their advice to the White House. ''The people in the country expect the President to say to the people: Mistakes have been made, I'm Commander in Chief and I'm responsible,'' said Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, ranking Republican on the special panel investigating the Iran affair. Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, a senior Republican on the special House committee, said Mr. Reagan's State of the Union speech should be ''a blockbuster, the most important speech he has ever made.'' Mr. Hyde said people would react favorably to a complete explanation of the incident. ''The American people would would think highly of him,'' he said. ''To sidestep any blame is a mistake.''

875-> JAZZ: GREY AND TATE
The trombonist Al Grey and the saxophonist Buddy Tate, both seasoned veterans of many years with the Count Basie orchestra, are constantly on the road now, either together or singly. They travel the world, picking up local rhythm sections to play with them. This week Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey are home for the holidays at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, between 11th and Perry Streets, through Sunday, with a superb ''local'' rhythm section made up of musicians as widely traveled as they - Sir Roland Hanna on piano, Major Holley on bass and the drummer Bobby Durham, on leave from Ella Fitzgerald. Despite the Basie backgrounds of Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey, there is almost as much of Duke Ellington in their style and repertory as there is of Basie. This comes not only from Mr. Grey's Ellingtonian growling with a plunger mute, or Mr. Tate's swaggering sweep, but also from Mr. Hanna, who, in this group, becomes a straight-ahead swinger rather than the more complex and innovative pianist he is apt to be in his solo or trio performances. He plays much of the time with a punchy drive that suggests the open, swinging joy of the Basie band, but when the group takes up the Duke's ''C Jam Blues,'' his solo contribution is a railroad blues with spare, ringing Ellington chords. Mr. Tate plays clarinet with increasing frequency these days, using a warm, mellow tone that is particularly effective in the bending, shimmering lines of ''Blue Tate,'' on which Mr. Grey gives a masterful demonstration of the soft, cushioned, distant sound that he can achieve with his normally growling or raucous plunger mute.

879-> HOMELESS WORKING MEN GET THEIR OWN SHELTER
For more than a year, Shawn Bateza has been living in the city's shelters for the homeless and trying to hold down a job. But in the cavernous rooms where most men are housed, it is often hard to sleep. ''There are radios blasting all the time,'' Mr. Bateza said. ''Guys are fighting. Some of them are crazy.'' And there is no way to get breakfast before 7 A.M., or to accept late-night overtime without risking the loss of his bed. In a new shelter in Brooklyn, the city is trying to make it is easier for homeless men to hold down jobs -often the first step toward getting out of the shelter system. These days, Mr. Bateza, who is a bicycle messenger, can get cereal, juice and coffee at 5 A.M. He can ask an aide to make sure he is up on time. He can call in and explain if he wants to work overtime. Responsibility Is Goal He and about 100 others who have jobs are living in a shelter at the former Greenpoint Hospital, at 300 Skillman Avenue, at Kingsland Avenue, in the Greenpoint section. They are participating in a program intended to help them keep their jobs and, within 90 days, find housing on their own. ''The concept is to make them feel special and at the same time get them to take responsibility for their lives,'' said Sylvia Castaneda, who has been running the program since it began last October. To get into the program, the men must sign a contract agreeing among other things to put half their salaries into a savings account and attend workshops on personal hygiene, how to keep a job, how to look for an apartment and how to budget money. If the men lose their jobs or do not find a place to live by then, they must return to other shelters. Since the program started, 45 men have moved out, 19 to known addresses - what Ms. Castaneda considers a clear success. Of the 26 others, a few were sent to other shelters because they refused to follow the rules. But most lost their jobs. An Experiment, for Now ''They can come back,'' Ms. Castaneda said, ''as soon as they get it together.'' If the shelter proves effective, officials of the city's Human Resources Administration said, the program will be expanded and offered to homeless women and families. With its yellow-tiled walls and linoleum floors, the shelter is far from cozy, but life here is more pleasant than in most shelters, the men there say. The rooms are quite small, but, even without doors, they offer some privacy. And, because all the men must have daytime work to get in the program, there is little noise at night. Best of all, the men say, they feel far safer segregated from the homeless who do not have jobs - men, they say, who are more likely to steal or be mentally ill. ''If you want to get it together, you can do it here,'' said Mr. Bateza, who is 26 years old and has struggled with a drug problem for several years. Some of the men in the program have been in shelters for as long as two years, holding jobs off and on. Others have been homeless for just a few months. Most are in their 20's or 30's and work as messengers, security guards and drivers of delivery trucks, earning the mininum wage of $3.35 an hour, and trying to save enough money to put down a rent deposit and buy furniture. Working 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, they would be required to save about $55 a week. Lies to Keep Jobs In the meantime, most of the men say that they must lie about where they are living or risk loosing their jobs. For that reason, many did not want their names used. A few said they had turned to the shelter system, because the housing they could afford was usually in such bad repair and in such dangerous neighborhoods that the shelters were no worse. ''Some of these rooms, you might as well be in a shelter,'' said Antonio Rivera, who has already saved $1,200 over the last few months and intends to go to Puerto Rico soon to make a new start. ''People break into those rooms like crazy.'' Mr. Bateza said that in the large shelters he had been unable to force himself to save. ''You're living rent free,'' he said. ''You got no responsibility, you tend to just go out on pay day and spend.'' Some turned to the program because they hoped the additional supervision and care would help them help themselves. Since there are only about 100 men in the program, the staff knows almost everybody and can prod those who need it to keep appointments and follow the shelter's rules. Ms. Castaneda, a woman who is quick to laugh and just as quick to dress down a 200-pound man who has been rude, spends a good deal of time reminding the men to look for apartments or keep appointments. ''Sometimes,'' she says, ''these guys are like children. They want the attention.''

Elizabeth Quinn of Glen Ridge, N.J., is one of many contributors to the 75th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund who have asked that their donations be used to aid the homeless. With a gift of $25, Mrs. Quinn sent a note that said: ''Every morning on my way to work from the PATH station I see so many poor souls huddled in the tunnel. I hope my small contribution can somehow help people less fortunate than me.'' Kimberly Cleland, a 15-year-old resident of Pleasantville, N.Y., said in a note: ''I had been seeking charities for the homeless when I saw your Neediest Cases appeal. Twelve dollars is all I can afford at present, but I'm sure it will be put to good use.''

884-> KCBS IS ACCUSED OF BIAS
A Hispanic coalition filed a Federal job-discrimination complaint Tuesday against KCBS-TV, accusing the station of racial bias in hiring and promoting on- and off-camera employees. The station denied any bias. The formal complaint to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeks imposition of an affirmative-action program at KCBS, said John Huerta, an attorney representing a group called the Hispanic Media Coalition. The commission would have to sue in Federal court if it decided there was merit to the accusations, Mr. Huerta said. Mr. Huerta said that of the station's about 400 employees, 14.2 percent were Hispanic. Mr. Huerta contended the percentage was far too low considering that 29 percent of the city's labor force is Hispanic. KCBS said it helps pay for a national computerized job bank for Hispanics. ''We are surprised that the group chose to target a station which not only has the best Hispanic employment record in the market, but has also been involved for several years in helping improve this situation nationally,'' said Tom Van Amburg, KCBS's vice president and general manager, in a written statement. Mr. Huerta said that the coalition had discussed minority hiring with station managers, but that the talks broke down in November when KCBS laid off about 20 workers, half of them minorities.

Following are the scores released by the New York City Board of Education on the reading test given in the city's public elementary schools and junior high schools in April 1986. The center column shows the proportion of pupils in each school reading at or above grade level. The righthand column gives each school's overall citywide ranking. Students with a limited proficiency in English who have been in the school system less than a year were excused from taking the test, and their scores were automatically put at below grade level. A single asterisk indicates a school in which 10 percent or more of the students fell into this category. Two asterisks indicate a school that runs only from kindergarten through second grade, and only second graders were tested.

887-> MARKET PLACE; NEW LILFE IN HIGH-TECH STOCKS
As technology stocks continued to lead the Wall Street rally today, many analysts said the bull market for these issues would continue at least through the first quarter - and possibly for much of the year. Particularly strong showings are expected from small but growing high-technology companies. Indeed, the leaders so far are those companies whose performance has significantly outpaced the economy. The rally in the technology sector has been fueled by several factors, including the better-than-expected earnings at several companies, most notably the Digital Equipment Corporation, where quarterly net income nearly doubled, to $270 million; a 9 percent jump in the semiconductor industry's leading indicator, and an influx of cash from investors who sold stocks at the end of 1986 to take capital gains before the new tax law took effect. 'Clearly Survived' ''What's driving it is earnings,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, editor and publisher of Technologic Partners Computer Letter. Mentioning some companies involved in personal computer software and hardware, such as Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Lotus Development, Compaq Computer and Seagate Technology, Mr. Shaffer said: ''All of those companies have clearly survived the computer shakeout with significant market share and consistent earnings.'' But the technology stock rally is not indicative of a general upturn in the industry. ''The big losers of last year are still the big losers of this year,'' Mr. Shaffer said. Investors are being very selective, but there is a higher level of confidence in the market, he said. ''Once you stop looking for the next takeover and start looking for solid value, you see a lot of companies with good earnings in technology.'' The most growth potential appears to be in companies with smaller capitalizations, several analysts said. ''Small stocks in general are dramatically undervalued, relative to the market,'' said Michael R. Weisberg, a partner in charge of research at Robertson, Colman & Stephens in San Francisco, pointing out that, since Dec. 31, the firm's index for technology stocks was up 17.2 percent at the close of business Wednesday, while its index of small technology stocks rose 21 percent. He continued, ''Emerging growth stocks are going to meaningfully outperform the market, particularly high-tech and service industries.'' Mr. Weisberg said he is most bullish on companies in the low end of the computer business, including Seagate Technology, Micropolis, Standard Micro Systems, Digital Communications Associates, 3Com, and Ashton-Tate. He is also recommending some niche software companies, such as Tansophic Systems, Duquesne Systems and VM Software. Another strong area will be companies, such as Cray Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc., that cater to technical users, Mr. Weisberg said. ''Everyone knows Digital is doing a great job by taking market away from I.B.M.,'' he said. But, he said, ''There are major opportunities for companies taking business away from Digital.'' Jon D. Gruber, a partner in Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he also expects ''1987 will be the revenge of the small stocks.'' Among his favorite issues are Timeplex, Intel, National Semiconductor, Am-dahl, Apple Computer and Business land, as well as disk drive manufacturers such as Miniscribe, Maxxtor and Seagate. Although he does not expect the sector's rally to continue at its present pace, Mr. Gruber said the technology stocks' overall strength will persist. ''If we had another two weeks like this, the stocks would all be on the moon,'' he said. ''But the small stocks will continue to outperform the bigger indices.'' A different perspective comes from Stephen E. Yoken, director of research at L. F. Rothschild. He said the rise has ''less to do with technology and more with the overall market.'' Investors selling stock in the fourth quarter of 1986 are now looking to get back into the market, he said. That, combined with an influx of money into mutual funds from investors in Individual Retirement Accounts, ''created a situation where there was an awful lot of money out there,'' he said, adding: ''Technology stocks up to three months ago had underperformed the market for three years, but there are signs that things are getting better.'' The positive results from Digital and the favorable book-to-bill ratio in the semiconductor industry have had a good psychological effect on the market, he said. ''The glass is half full today, rather than half empty,'' he commented. Mr. Yoken said he believes that the rise is perhaps sustainable only through the end of the quarter. ''I suspect a lot of stocks are going to get bid up to extremes beyond their fundamental value,'' he said. ''If the economy really dies, you could have a very severe correction.'' And one of the main props of the rally in the technology sector is questioned by Adam F. Cuhney, a semiconductor analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company in San Francisco. Arguing that the rise in the book-to-bill ratio was caused by phenomenal growth at Intel, Monolithic Memories and LSI Logic, while other chip makers saw only modest increases, Mr. Cuhney said the indicator's rise signaled ''a bounce, not a real recovery.'' Adding that the International Business Machines Corporation's comments about poor demand were true for other computer makers as well, particularly overseas, Mr. Cuhney said that the ''bull case for semiconductor companies simply is not happening.''

888-> FORMER ALLY CHALLENGES MAYOR IN PHILADELPHIA
Charging that Mayor W. Wilson Goode was guilty of ''ineptitude and mismanagement'' that crushed this city's renaissance under the ''rubble of unfulfilled programs and promises,'' a former District Attorney announced his candidacy today for the Democratic Mayoral nomination. The 43-year-old challenger, Edward G. Rendell, who was defeated last year in a race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, is a former ally of the Mayor's. ''I've never seen the city looking so run down,'' said Mr. Rendell, ''It's become a city of unfilled potholes, unstaffed libraries and recreation centers, unclean streets, unemployed people, unmet promises, and worst of all, unfulfilled dreams and opportunities.'' ''Something has to be done before things get worse,'' said Mr. Rendell, who is white, as he fired the opening salvo against Mayor Goode, who is black, in what is expected to be a bitter, racially polarizing campaign for the primary and general election. ''Our citizens are discouraged and despairing about the future,'' Mr. Rendell said. Outlook for Contest As the city gears up for the yearlong celebration of the bicentennial of the Constitution, a number of likely candidates have been sounding a similar theme. Chief among these is Frank Rizzo. The former Mayor who dominated this city's politics a decade ago recently switched his registration to Republican. He has left little doubt, but has not declared, that he will challenge Mayor Goode, the man who frustrated his last comeback attempt. A number of polls indicate that Mr. Rendell is the Mayor's strongest possible opponent in the May 17 Democratic primary. In Mr. Rendell's unsuccessful race for the gubernatorial nomination, he swept minority precincts on the way to winning 68 percent of the city's vote. Goode Cites Past Praises Mr. Goode has done everything but announce he will seek a second four-year-term. In a news conference this afternoon, he noted that the two men had been political allies. ''Before the governor's race, Ed Rendell was very supportive and complimentary,'' said Mr. Goode, whose administration has been rocked by scandals and snafus. ''Since he lost the governor's race, he has changed his position. I get the feeling he wants my job. But I'm not ready to give up my job.'' Mr. Goode, who swept to victory in 1983 with the support of black voters, white liberals and business, remains the favorite in polls, but he is now widely criticized among blacks and has alienated many white financial backers. Those weaknesses were illustrated earlier this week when Neil Oxman of the Campaign Group, Mr. Goode's media consultant in 1983 who was a key adviser until two weeks ago, announced he was joining Mr. Rendell's camp. G. Fred DiBona Jr., president and chief executive officer of the Keystone Health Plan, who is a former president of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, said: ''Eddie Rendell will make a marvelous candidate. Wilson did a good job of selling himself to the business community last time and Eddie will do an equally good job.'' Mr. Rendell, who starts the campaign more than $200,000 in debt from his gubernatorial effort, acknowledged today that he was ''the underdog.'' Drop in White Registration Although a proven vote-getter among blacks in Philadelphia, Mr. Rendell must overcome difficult demographic trends. In 1983, 53 percent of registered Democrats were white and 43 percent were black. In the last four years, however, the number of registered white Democrats has dropped by 123,733 to 355,686, a 25.8 percent decline. Although black registration has also fallen, the drop has been far less precipitous, 17 percent or 67,603 voters. Blacks now constitute 46 percent of the registered Democrats. The drop in white registration is now accelerating as those who once left the Republican Party to support Mr. Rizzo as a Democrat, follow his example and return to the Republican fold. Mr. Rizzo is by no means a shoo-in for the Republican nomination, and the party leaders have welcomed him with less than open arms. John J. Egan Jr., the chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, is widely expected to officially jump into the race for the nomination early next week. He was defeated by Mayor Goode in the 1983 general election. Meanwhile, Mr. Rendell started the campaign on the defensive. Mayor Goode, City Councilman Lucien Blackwell and other black leaders said that to win minority votes in the gubernatorial campaign, Mr. Rendell repeatedly promised he would not challenge Mr. Goode's re-election drive. Today, Mr. Rendell denied he had ever made such a pledge. He said he had told black leaders only that he had no ''intention'' of running. He said ''civic paralysis and pessimism'' virtually forced him to offer himself as a candidate.

889-> STATE SENATE REPUBLICANS ASSAIL TRANSIT AID PLAN
An $8.6 billion plan to rebuild New York City's mass-transit system - passed by the Legislature last month after weeks of dispute between suburban and city lawmakers - has run into a new set of delays and objections. State Senate Republicans tonight vetoed the plan when it came before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program Review Board. The board - which has four voting members, representatives of Governor Cuomo, Mayor Koch, the Assembly Speaker and the Senate majority leader - must pass on M.T.A. capital projects. A negative vote by any one of the four voting members blocks a project. Norman J. Levy, a Nassau County Republican and the representative of the Senate majority leader, cast the negative vote. He said details of the plan, which covers five years, violated agreements reached last month between suburban Republicans and the M.T.A. on how much money would be distributed to the commuter rail lines. Mr. Levy said that historically, Federal transit aid and revenues from bridge and tunnel tolls had always been divided in such a way that the commuter rail lines got 21 percent and the city subways and buses got 79 percent. The M.T.A. plan, he said, does not hold to that breakdown and shortchanges the commuter-rail lines - the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Levy Assails Agreement Specifically, Mr. Levy, the chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, cited the breakdown of Federal aid converted from highway use to mass-transit use when the Westway highway project on the West Side of Manhattan was killed. That money, about $900 million over the five years, will go to the city transit system. The agreement, he said, was that a higher percentage of other Federal aid would be diverted to the commuter rail lines to make up for that. But the M.T.A. plan does not hold to that agreement, he said. Mr. Levy also cited other problems with distribution of money to the commuter rail lines, saying that in the end, suburban residents would wind up paying $10 million to $20 million a year more than had been expected to finance the M.T.A. capital plan. The veto does not threaten an agreement to freeze bus, subway and commuter rail fares for three years, which are provided for under operating, not capital, measures. And it does not permanently kill the $8.6 billion plan. It can be resubmitted, with changes, at any time by the M.T.A. An M.T.A. spokesman, Arthur Perfall, said last night: ''We're disappointed. We'll be resubmitting a program. We're prepared to answer any questions Senator Levy has.'' Mr. Perfall said he was not prepared to discuss the specifics of Mr. Levy's objections. Someone who answered the telephone at the Manhattan home of Robert Kiley, the chairman of the M.T.A., said he was out for the evening and could not be reached. Mr. Perfall said that until the plan is approved by the review board, no capital spending contained in it can go forward. By the end of the week, he said, the M.T.A. had hoped to let contracts of $40 million for the purchase of 150 buses, of $14 million for the initial components of an automatic fare-collecting system and of $140 million to rehabilitate 200 subway cars.

891-> BRONCOS SOLIDIFIED BY OFFENSIVE LINE
Keith Bishop, Bill Bryan and Paul Howard, left guard, center and right guard, respectively, have for years been the heart of the Denver Broncos' offensive line, one of the National Football League's best. The trio, together since 1983, with Bryan and Howard going back to 1978, was broken up late in last Sunday's playoff game here against New England. The 36-year-old Howard damaged a knee and will not be playing again this season. Bishop was voted to the American Conference Pro Bowl team by the players and coaches, and Bryan wishes he had been, too. ''But I would rather play in the Super Bowl any time to the Pro Bowl,'' said Bryan, who has played in 129 consecutive games for the Broncos since 1978. More Than 8,000 Plays He has snapped the ball on every Denver offensive play except three in those nine seasons. That is about 8,100 plays, and he thinks nothing of it. ''I missed three plays in 1983 when I was thrown out of game in Chicago for fighting,'' he said. ''I was fined and I got a call from Pete Rozelle saying I could come to New York for a hearing if I wanted to appeal. Although I didn't start the fight, I paid the fine and forgot about it.'' The Super Bowl is one game away for Bishop and Bryan and it can be realized if the Broncos defeat the Browns in Cleveland on Sunday for the American Conference championship. Bishop, a Texan from Baylor, was voted to the Pro Bowl for the first time and the recognition came as a shock. He is the first Denver offensive lineman ever named to a Pro Bowl squad. Thinks Highly of Elway Bishop reveres John Elway, the quarterback, as do so many of the Broncos. Early one morning at the training site, Bishop was watching film alone. ''John came in to get some coffee,'' said Bishop. ''He told me, 'Congratulations.' I didn't know what for. We'd just voted the day before. He said I'm starting in the Pro Bowl. He'd learned from the coaches. It meant a lot to me hearing it from John.'' About the only previous honor for Bishop had come in 1981 when he won the United States Sumo Wrestling Association's championship and went to Japan on a sumo tour. He made it known to the Broncos that he was considering becoming a professional sumo wrestler. ''I wasn't serious,'' he said. ''I was just trying to get a better contract, and it didn't work. But I've got a real good contract now.'' Running Game Revived The Denver running game, which had been dormant late in the season, was dominant in the second half against the Patriots. ''The line blocking was there,'' said Bishop. ''And the backs ran awfully well. Also, we didn't want John running around.'' The backs were Sammy Winder and Gene Lang, the latter the replacement for the injured Gerald Willhite. Elway, the Broncos' third-leading rusher, had a sprained left ankle. The 31-year-old Bryan says he is delighted to be playing football for the Broncos. ''This is what I want to do and I'm going to keep doing it as long as I can,'' he said. Dwight Stephenson of the Miami Dolphins is the most acclaimed center in the A.F.C., with Bryan far behind. ''A phenomenal athlete,'' said Bryan of Stephenson. ''I'm not flashy. I don't blow people out. I'm on the small side, 6-2, 255. But I don't give up any sacks.'' Line Is Always Busy ''Also I call the blocking schemes for the linemen at the line of scrimmage, and we've got a complicated offense,'' said Bryan. ''So there's a lot to do. ''I like it here. We've got a real good team feeling and there's nobody talking about money, for example. Most of the guys have their money deferred for later. I get paid once a year. ''I sold my sporting goods store. It could be a headache. I know what it is to meet a payroll. That's the real world. Playing pro football isn't the real world.''

895-> New York No Longer Has Hospital-Bed Surplus
To the Editor: Your report that the New York City Health Systems Agency has recommended eliminating almost 5,000 hospital beds in the city (Dec. 18) failed to discuss the hospital community's major concerns with these proposals. First, the estimate of excess beds is significantly overstated. This estimate was developed using old assumptions that are not supported by current conditions. Earlier in 1986, many analysts were predicting sharp declines in hospital occupancy rates in New York City because of a change instituted last Jan. 1 in the way hospitals are paid for Medicare patients and because of anticipated growth of alternative-delivery systems such as health maintenance organizations. The new payment program has not had the expected impact so far. Moreover, the predicted penetration of health maintenance organizations has not materialized. As a result, hospital occupancy has dropped only slightly. Indeed, the citywide occupancy rate, which is expected to be about 84 percent in 1986, is only slightly below last year's level and is the highest in the United States. If the cutback recommendations were implemented today, the occupancy level would be 97 percent citywide and more than 100 percent in some boroughs (Manhattan and Brooklyn). Second, the agency's plan focuses too much on bed reductions and not enough on other critically important issues, such as linkages among various levels of care and the development of innovative programs. Third, these proposals fail to take into consideration broader economic consequences, such as the impact on jobs and local industries whose fates are frequently tied to the well-being of hospitals. In short, this plan misses the mark. The health planning process, which has had a nationally diminishing role in health care's increasingly competitive environment, can still be useful if it provides an opportunity to address systemwide issues that cannot be resolved by any individual hospital. The plan's proposals should be reassessed. This will be the challenge of health planning for the future. KENNETH E. RASKE President Greater New York Hospital Assn. New York, Dec. 29, 1986

896-> Couldn't 'Mona Lisa' Just Stay a Mystery?
To the Editor: The theory that Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'' is a self-portrait (news story, Dec. 27) is by no means new. In 1906, Marie Herzfeld speculated on the idea in ''Leonardo da Vinci der Denker.'' Computer comparisons aside, perhaps a more meaningful theory was the speculation by Sigmund Freud that the ''Mona Lisa'' is an interpretation of Leonardo's mother, Catherina. This theory would account for the facial resemblance between the ''Mona Lisa''and Leonardo's self-portrait. Freud was looking for clues to Leonardo's alleged homosexuality. Using the mother-son theme, he was quite struck by the continuity of the ''Mona Lisa'' smile in earlier and later paintings, including ''The Virgin of the Rocks,'' ''St. Anne and St. Mary'' and the ''Baptism of Christ.'' Freud thought Leonardo's mother fixation was expressed in his art. Computers may be able to tell us a great deal, but not the motives underlying artistic creation. Perhaps we should discount both Freud and the computer. If some things are best left in the realm of mystery, the ''Mona Lisa'' must surely be one of them. SALVATORE PRISCO Hoboken, N.J., Dec. 29, 1986 The writer is associate professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology.

897-> GUIDRY PARTS WITH YANKESS, BUT RANDOLPH RE-SIGNS
Ron Guidry, the anchor of the Yankees' pitching staff for 10 years, failed to reach agreement on a new contract by last night's midnight signing deadline, effectively ending his glittering Yankee career in a negotiation that his agent called ''embarrassing and humiliating'' and that concluded with the two sides only $50,000 apart. However, Willie Randolph, the team's other co-captain, agreed to a two-year, $1.75 million contract minutes before the deadline. ''I'm disappointed, but it just didn't work out,'' Guidry said by telephone from Lafayette, La., after the deadline had passed. ''I was the one kneeling down and yet they didn't want to try. I came down $700,000 in seven hours and it took them two months to come up $25,000. It was a matter of principle then.'' Guidry, who ranks among the top 10 Yankees in six significant career pitching categories, was one of eight attractive free agents who did not agree to new contracts by the deadline. The 36-year-old left-hander joined Tim Raines - the National League batting champion - and Andre Dawson of Montreal, Lance Parrish of Detroit, Rich Gedman of Boston, Bob Boone of California and Bob Horner and Doyle Alexander of Atlanta as the first free agents whose teams wanted to re-sign them to go past the deadline in the two years of its existence. They were among the free agents whose 1986 clubs had to sign them by midnight or lose rights to them until May 1. The eight players, who rejected their clubs' offers of salary arbitration, have been free to sign with any other team but had received no offers from any teams other than their former clubs. They remain free to sign with all other clubs but cannot negotiate or sign with their former clubs until May 1. Nor are they permitted to attend spring training with the former clubs on an unsigned basis. Because no free agent in a similar position went past the deadline last year, no one knows how other clubs will treat the group of eight. Agents expect them to receive offers, but it is possible that none of the offers will exceed those of their former clubs. Randolph, the Yankees' second baseman for 11 years, was one of five free agents to reach agreement by the deadline. The others were Tommy John of the Yankees, Ernie Whitt of Toronto, and Brian Downing and Doug DeCinces of the California Angels. Randolph, who last year earned $1.25 million, had steadfastly rejected the Yankees' two-year, $1.6 million offer, but his agent, Ron Shapiro, and Woody Woodward, the Yankees' general manager, negotiated off and on yesterday, speaking by telephone until they worked out a deal only minutes before midnight. Under terms of the contract, Randolph will earn $875,000 a year. Guidry, a three-time 20-game winner, also had repeatedly rejected a two-year, $1.6 million offer, most recently at about 6 P.M. yesterday. ''They didn't change a thing,'' Reggie Ringuet, Guidry's agent, said by telephone from Lafayette after talking to Woodward for the first time since Monday. ''I talked to Ron, and it took us a minute and a half to call him back and reject it. Ron said call them back right away and tell them to forget it. Woody said if I change my mind, let him know. It's really unfortunate. We drag along all this way and they call at the 11th hour to offer the same thing they offered Dec. 19.'' As the deadline neared, Ringuet called Woodward with a new proposal, two years for $1.75 million, down significantly from his earlier two-year, $2.5 million demand. At just about midnight, Ringuet said, Woodward went to two years for $1.65 million and the agent lowered his asking price to $1.7 million. Neither side, however, would agree to the other's offer. ''They didn't try; they didn't give one inch,'' Ringuet said bitterly. ''We gave until we couldn't give any more. It was embarrassing and humiliating. All Ron wanted was to be treated with respect, and he didn't get it.'' Earlier, Ringuet said he had discussed with Guidry the possibility that if he went past the deadline, he might not receive offers better than the Yankees' proposal. ''He's prepared to accept that,'' Ringuet said. Guidry's departure leaves Dennis Rasmussen and Rick Rhoden as the first two starters in the Yankees' rotation and creates the possibility of John's becoming No. 3. John, who will be 44 years old next May, agreed to a one-year contract that will pay him a guaranteed $300,000 salary plus an additional $50,000 if he makes the team. If he should win the Cy Young award, he would receive a $75,000 bonus; he would earn $50,000 for finishing second in the voting. John, pitching for the Yankees a second time, signed with them as a free agent last year and compiled a 5-3 record. After returning from a nearly two-month stay on the disabled list with an inflamed heel, he pitched three exceptional games in August. However, his season ended when he slipped on a wet bullpen mound in Oakland and suffered a torn thumb ligament on his pitching hand. The Yankees paid him the minimum of $60,000, with the California Angels paying the remainder of the $500,000 guaranteed salary, after releasing him, under his three-year contract with them. Raines, Dawson and Parrish had said previously they would not re-sign with their teams. Raines said no to a three-year, $4.8 million offer, Dawson to a two-year, $2 million deal and Parrish to one year for $1 million. The Tigers made Parrish a new offer yesterday, two years for $2.4 million, but the catcher rejected that one, too. Horner, who earned $1.8 million last year, turned down Atlanta's three-year, $4.5 million offer and was prepared to move on. No free agent went beyond the Jan. 8 deadline last year. Kirk Gibson and Carlton Fisk came closest, but Gibson agreed to Detroit's three-year, $4 million offer minutes before midnight and Fisk accepted the Chicago White Sox offer of $1.75 million for two years after the two sides received a brief extension past the deadline. NEW CONTRACT FOR TOLLESON Wayne Tolleson, who finished the season as the Yankee shortstop, wasn't a free agent, but he agreed to a two-year contract yesterday for about $800,000. He batted .284 in 60 games with the Yankees.

898-> QUARREL PRECEDED BLAZE AT HOTEL
The union member charged with setting the fire that killed 96 people at the Dupont Plaza Hotel had a quarrel with hotel security officers shortly before the blaze was set, a union official said today. Jose E. Cadiz, secretary-treasurer of Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said angry words were exchanged between the suspect, Hector Escudero Aponte, and several security officers and that a cart filled with dishes was overturned. But the union official said he could not say whether there was any connection between the incident and the fire. ''I'm told that it was not a major incident,'' Mr. Cadiz said. On the day of the fire, according to Mr. Cadiz, the hotel workers affiliated with the union held a meeting in the ballroom adjacent to the main kitchen where the members rejected what the hotel management said was its ''final offer.'' After the meeting, the union members who worked in the kitchen returned and found several security workers inside. The union members and the security guards exchanged insults but did not fight, Mr. Cadiz said. He also acknowledged that Mr. Escudero had been present at a luncheon meeting in which the union officers and the delegates from the Dupont Plaza discussed what they would present to the membership. Mr. Escudero was was one of several non-delegates who attended the meeting. Mr. Cadiz said Mr. Escudero did not contribute anything to the meeting and did not appear to be in a hostile mood. Mr. Cadiz said that at the luncheon, the union's lawyer, Jorge Farinacci, talked the delegates into giving up on some of the issues that divided the two sides.

899-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Wood Loses Appeal
A judge in United States Appellate Court has ruled against Leon Wood, the Nets' guard, in a case that tested the legality of the National Basketball Association's college draft and its salary cap provisions. Judge Ralph Winter, on behalf of a unanimous three-judge panel, held that the draft and salary cap were governed by labor law rather than antitrust law, and since they were subject to collective bargaining with the union, the draft and the cap were not subject to challenge by an individual player. Judge Robert L. Carter of the United States District Court in New York first rejected Wood's contention last February. Wood objected to the cap, which puts a ceiling on each team's total player salaries, and the draft, which assigns the rights to a player to only one team, ''because they assigned him to work for a particular employer at a diminished wage.'' But the appeals court said ''the choice of the employer is governed by the rules of the hiring hall, not the preference of the individual workers.'' Wood, who was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers, filed his suit in September 1984. Eventually, he signed a four-year contract for more than $1 million, including a signing bonus, with the 76ers. He was traded to the Washington Bullets, who then sent him to the Nets.

905-> COLLEGE BASKETBALL; CAROLINA OVERTAKES CLEMSON
Kenny Smith scored a career-high 41 points as North Carolina rallied from a 12-point halftime deficit to defeat Clemson, 108-99, in an Atlantic Coast Conference game last night. The Tar Heels outscored Clemson, 22-5, over a six-minute span to erase a 78-73 deficit and take a 95-83 lead with 2 minutes 49 seconds left. Smith, whose previous high was 23 points, had 8 points during the run among his 27 in the second half. North Carolina cut a 50-38 halftime deficit to 7 early in the second half and then used a 14-4 run to take a 63-60 lead on Smith's second straight 3-point field goal with 12:57 to go. The Tar Heels, who improved to 18-1 over all and 7-0 in the conference, have now defeated every A.C.C. opponent once this season. Clemson is 18-2 and 4-2. J. R. Reid had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Tar Heels, who outrebounded the Tigers by 36-26. Jeff Lebo added 20 points. Clemson was led by Jerry Pryor with 24 points, and Horace Grant had 19.

Lawrence's two long jumpers in the first 1:30 of overtime provided an 80-74 lead. Florida (16-4, 8-1) then made 8 of 11 free throws to hold off the Crimson Tide (15-3, 8-1). Andrew Moten finished with 25 points to lead the Gators. Derrick McKey paced Alabama with 27 points. L.S.U. 75, Auburn 73 BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -Louisiana State wasted a 17-point halftime lead that was built mostly on the hot shooting of Anthony Wilson in the Southeastern Conference game. Wilson had five 3-point goals and 19 of his 25 points in the first half, during which L.S.U. once led by 22 points and by 51-34 at halftime. L.S.U. (13-9, 4-6) went cold for the first five minutes of the second half, and Auburn narrowed the margin until it took a 57-56 lead with 12 minutes to play. Wilson then hit a basket to regain the lead for L.S.U. and the Tigers never trailed. Auburn (11-5, 4-4) was paced by Jeff Moore, who had 21 points. T.C.U. 64, Rice 38 FORT WORTH (AP) - Larry Richard and Carven Holcombe each scored 17 points as Texas Christian won its 13th consecutive game. T.C.U.

Pitt 95, Seton Hall 81 PITTSBURGH (AP) - Curtis Aiken scored 21 points and Demetreus Gore had 19 to lead five Pitt players in double figures in a Big East Conference game. Aiken had 15 points in the first half as the Panthers (16-4, 5-2) built an 18-point lead. Rod Brookin, a reserve, scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half for the Panthers. James Major had 17 points for Seton Hall (11-7, 2-7), which lost to Pitt by 87-85 two weeks ago. Providence 82 Georgetown 79 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Ernie Lewis's 3-point field goal from deep in the right corner with two seconds to play led Providence in a Big East Conference game. Lewis hit three 3-pointers in the final 2:02 as the Friars snapped an 11-game losing streak to Georgetown. The Friars (15-3, 5-2) took a 62-50 lead with 13 minutes remaining. But Georgetown's Reggie Williams, who finished with 33 points, hit a 12-foot baseline jumper with 6:22 remaining for a 71-70 lead. A free throw by Perry McDonald with 1:25 left gave Georgetown (14-3 and 4-3) the lead again, 77-76. But Lewis hit a 3-pointer to give the Friars a 79-77 lead with 44 seconds left.

The victims, employees of the Home Check Cashing Corporation, were found dead inside the locked and shuttered store at 25 West 170th Street, at Inwood Avenue, shortly after 11:30 P.M. Both died of shotgun wounds, the police said. The victims, Valdamar Barrea, 40 years old, and Varghese Ninan, 35, both of Yonkers, were found behind an intact bullet-proof partition, according to the police, who said it was unclear how the intruder got behind the barrier. The police said they believed they were shot at about 6 P.M., the store's usual closing hour. A police spokesman, Officer Peter O'Donnell, said the police had been summoned by a company supervisor who saw the employees' cars parked outside. A safe was found open with only coins in it, the police said, adding that an audit was being performed to see if any cash was taken.

907-> FIVE TIED TO KLAN INDICTED ON ARMS CHARGES
A Federal indictment opened here today charges five members of white supremacist organizations with conspiracy to acquire stolen military weapons, explosives and equipment. Samuel T. Currin, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, said he thought the indictment, handed up Wednesday by a Federal grand jury, ''really deals a lethal blow'' to the White Patriot Party, formerly the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Even before the indictment, White Patriot leaders had announced that they would disband the party. The organization's former leader, F. Glenn Miller, was convicted last July in Federal court of violating a court order prohibiting him from operating a paramilitary organization. Mr. Miller has appealed the conviction and has sought court permission to move his residence from Johnston County, N.C., to Hillsville, Va. All but One Arrested The five named in the indictment unsealed today are Stephen S. Miller, chaplain of the White Patriot Party, who is not related to Glenn Miller; Robert E. Jackson and Anthony Todd Wydra, both associated with the White Patriot Party and the Klan group, and Wendell Lee Lane and Simeon Davis, officers of Den 79 of the party. All have been arrested except Mr. Jackson, who was being sought by the Federal authorities. The indictment alleges that the five conspired to obtain stolen military materiel so as to maintain, train and equip a paramilitary force and otherwise further the goals of white supremacy. The grand jury charges that three of the defendants received military equipment stolen from a Federal armory in Wadesboro, N.C. The indictment also charges that the defendants planned robberies to finance paramilitary operations and that members of the White Patriot Party plotted to kill Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. Mr. Dees, a lawyer, had filed a suit seeking to bar both Glenn Miller and Stephen Miller from violating the rights of blacks and engaging in paramilitary training. The indictment does not allege any acts to carry out the plot against Mr. Dees.

908-> Giving Love, or Selling Life?
Who, short of Solomon, would choose to be in Harvey R. Sorkow's shoes these days? He is the New Jersey judge who must decide the legality of the contract by which Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to bear a child for William and Elizabeth Stern. Then Judge Sorkow must determine with whom the fruit of that contract, a little girl, should live - the biological mother and her husband, or the biological father (by artificial insemination) and his wife. And to help him make these difficult decisions, Judge Sorkow has about as much case law to call upon as Solomon did when he heard his famous custody suit. None. Elizabeth Stern, a 41-year-old pediatrician, is not, strictly speaking, infertile. Fearing, however, that pregnancy might aggravate her multiple sclerosis, she and her husband leased Mrs. Whitehead's reproductive potential for $10,000. Already the mother of two children by her husband, Mrs. Whitehead was, Mr. Stern said, ''too good to be true.'' She was indeed. When Mrs. Whitehead saw her baby, whom she named Sara, she was ''overpowered'' by her emotions. She turned Sara over to the Sterns but didn't accept the money. A few days later she asked if she could keep the child, whom they'd named Melissa, for a week. The Sterns agreed: ''We thought she was suicidal. She said she couldn't live without the baby.'' When Sara/Melissa wasn't returned, six policemen arrived at the Whiteheads' front door. Mrs. Whitehead handed the child out a back window to her husband and they fled to Florida. After authorities tracked them down, a New Jersey court awarded the Sterns temporary custody. Sara/Melissa, or Baby M as she is called in court papers, is not unique. More than 500 such children have been contracted for in the last few years. And the surrogate mother business appears to have a bright future, given the marked increase in infertility among the young and the marked drop in the number of adoptions. The public obligation is obvious. States need to evaluate the very idea of surrogate parenthood, decide whether it is a tolerable practice in the first place and, if so, establish guidelines just as they do for adoption and other analogous practices. Should surrogate parenthood be tolerated? Is bearing a child for someone unable to do so ''a gift of love'' as its enthusiasts suggest? Or is it simply baby-selling? If it is tolerable should society provide, as many states do in adoption cases, a period in which mothers can change their minds? In any case the business is probably here to stay, which is reason enough for regulations predicated on the child's best interests. Legislation relating to surrogate child-bearing has been introduced in 25 states but nowhere are the contracts yet legal and enforceable. They will be in New York if new recommendations of the State Senate's Judiciary Committee are adopted. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, Judge Sorkow will have to decide on his own. May Baby M be the real winner of this terrible contest.

909-> Hoechst Sets F.T.C. Talks
The American Hoechst Corporation said today that it would go ahead with its $2.8 billion acquisition of another chemical maker, the Celanese Corporation, despite a Federal Trade Commission vote to seek an injunction to block the deal. The company said it would start talks with the F.T.C. to try to resolve the matter. The F.T.C. move could scuttle the merger that would form the world's biggest chemical company. Hoechst added that it had extended its stock offer until Jan. 26. The offer was to have expired Friday. ''We assume that the takeover will go ahead as planned,'' said Hans-Bernd Heier, a Hoechst spokesman in Frankfurt. ''But we are optimistic because we are continuing to have negotiations with the F.T.C., as agreed.'' American Hoechst, the American subsidiary of Hoechst A.G. of West Germany, offered $2.8 billion for all of Celanese's stock in early November. The merger would create the largest chemical company in the world. However, the F.T.C. voted, 4 to 1, in a meeting Wednesday to authorize its staff to seek the injunction on antitrust grounds.

910-> EATING FRESH FRUIT CAN REDUCE RISK OF STROKE, RESEARCHERS REPORT
Eating an extra helping of fresh fruit or vegetables each day could cut the risk of stroke nearly in half by increasing the body's supply of potassium, researchers have concluded. The conclusions of a study by Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the University of California at San Diego and Dr. Kay-Tee Khaw of Cambridge University in England are to be published in the Thursday issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Stroke is the nation's third-leading cause of death, after heart attack and cancer. This year an estimated 155,000 people in the United States will die of stroke. ''The results indicate that one extra serving of fresh fruits or vegetables each day may decrease the risk of stroke by as much as 40 percent, regardless of other known risk factors,'' Dr. Barrett-Connor said. Fewer Strokes in U.S. ''In this country, the stroke rate has declined rather dramatically since the late 1940's and certainly before the wide use of blood pressure medicine,'' Dr. Barrett-Connor said in an interview. ''It's always been a puzzle what caused this decrease. During that time, there was an increase in the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables. This may be part of the missing link.'' She cautioned that her findings needed to be duplicated by other researchers. Some researchers were skeptical of the conclusions. ''I'm amazed the Journal would take a paper like this,'' said Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer of the New England Medical Center. ''I don't think it's very good science.'' Search for Links to Diet He said the researchers had looked for statistical links between a variety of dietary factors and stroke without having a clear idea of how they could affect this health problem. ''When you start out with a whole body of data, you are going to find correlations between some things,'' he said. ''It just has to be, depending on how much data you have.'' Dr. Franklin Epstein of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston said it was possible some stroke victims got less potassium simply because they did not feel well, had poor appetite and ate less food. He agreed that people should eat more fruit and vegetables but cautioned against taking potassium pills, which he said might cause heart trouble in people with diabetes or kidney problems.

911-> COMPANY NEWS; New Apple Devices For Business Users
Apple Computer Inc., in the first of a barrage of product announcements scheduled for the next few months, introduced two devices today aimed at gaining greater acceptance of its Macintosh computer with business customers. The products were promised by Apple two years ago, but were never brought to market. One, a file server, allows several Macintoshes to share data or documents stored on a central hard disk. The other is a circuit board that plugs into an I.B.M. personal computer or compatible machine, letting it use Apple's laser printer. The file server will permit workers with separate Macintosh computers to send messages to one another, to collaborate in the preparation of reports or to draw on a common data bank. Full use of the file server will require the development by outside companies of software to take advantage of its features. Apple had announced a file server in January 1985, but ran into engineering problems, and many Macintosh users have bought servers offered by independent vendors. The snags contributed to the company shake-up that led to the ouster later that year of Apple's founder, Steven P. Jobs, who had headed the Macintosh development group. Apple contends that the late start will not handicap the product. ''This goes well beyond what we envisioned two years ago when we announced a product we could never ship,'' John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. Rather than coming out with a separate piece of hardware, Apple is selling a software package, known as Appleshare, that turns an existing Macintosh Plus into a file server. The software, available immediately, will sell for $800, so a total file server system with 20 megabytes of hard-disk storage will sell for about $4,000. The other new product, called an Appletalk PC card, is designed to allow Macintoshes to be connected with personal computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation or with I.B.M.-compatible machines. Apple has said it will introduce an unusual number of products in coming months. In March it is expected to announce an enhanced version of the Macintosh Plus, as well as a completely new Macintosh offering expansion capabilities, higher speed and a larger, more versatile screen.

912-> GROUP SEEKS TO FREEZE $2 FEE ON PHONE ACCESS
A coalition of consumer groups and their supporters in Congress have started a campaign to freeze the $2 service charge imposed on millions of telephone subscribers each month for access to their local telephone company. The campaign comes as a panel of Federal and state regulators debates a Federal Communications Commission proposal to increase the charge to at least $4 a month, according to sources familiar with the panel's deliberations. State utility regulators, who are four of the seven members of the panel, the Federal-State Joint Board, are opposed to increasing the fee to $4 but have not united on any compromise, the sources said. The joint board makes its formal recommendation early next month to the F.C.C., which began imposing monthly access charges two years ago as part of the agency's telephone rate restructuring program. In the past, the board's recommendations on access charges have been adopted by the F.C.C. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers forced the F.C.C. to roll back the size of its original access charge plan, Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, has filed a bill in the House with 22 co-sponsors that would freeze access charges and bar any increase without Congressional approval. New Fields of Business In the Senate, Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, has filed a bill that would eliminate the access charge and also grant local exchange companies authority to enter new fields of business. ''Further increases in access charges would be unfair and unwarranted,'' said Mr. Wyden, who on Thursday is scheduled to join representatives of the coalition of groups to announce a letter-writing and lobbying effort. The coalition includes the American Association of Retired Persons, the Consumer Federation of America, the United States Public Interest Research Groups and the National Federation of Independent Businesses. ''I don't think the case has been made for further increases,'' Mr. Wyden said. Mark S. Fowler, chairman of the F.C.C., refused to comment on the joint board's deliberations. The F.C.C. originally proposed a $10.50 access charge in 1982 to be phased in over the span of the decade, but it retreated in the face of consumer and Congressional opposition. The agency considers rate restructuring a key weapon in keeping the traditional telephone network competitive with the array of new, private call completion systems available to big business customers. By shifting more of the cost of operating the telephone network to local customers, reductions can be made in long-distance rates, a big concern to big businesses and government agencies, the F.C.C. and the telephone industry contend. When those overall costs for major customers are reduced, switching to alternative call completion services, such as microwave or satellite relay sytems, becomes less attractive, they argue. Without the rate restructuring, they say, big business would abandon the local phone system in growing numbers, forcing residential and small business customers to carry a larger share of the fixed costs of local telephone service. State regulators and consumer groups have argued that this ''bypass trend'' has not been as great as the commission or telelphone industry had predicted.

913-> 23 BLACK LEADERS AND KOCH ATTACK 'PERVASIVE' RACISM
Mayor Koch and 23 black leaders agreed at City Hall yesterday to work together to attack what they called ''pervasive and systemic'' racism in the city. Several participants called the meeting helpful, with Councilwoman Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn saying that it could help ''defuse'' things in the short run. Arthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that the meeting dealt with ''complex'' issues of race relations and that the participants felt that they had ''by persuasion and the weight of our logic'' convinced the Mayor that improvements were needed. Growing Tension Their remarks came in response to growing tension in New York City over a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, on Dec. 20. One of the victims, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, was struck by a car and died. On Monday, murder charges against three whites accused in the attack were dropped for insufficient evidence after another black victim of the attack refused to testify. The black leaders said yesterday that it was not their intent to take sides in the emerging debate over the investigation or the role that witnesses and lawyers have taken. Earlier yesterday, in an emotional meeting with reporters at a Brooklyn church, lawyers for the two surviving black victims criticized not only some of the blacks who were to meet with Mr. Koch but also the police and prosecutors who have been investigating the case. One of those at the church meeting, the Rev. Al Sharpton, derisively called the City Hall meeting ''a coon show.'' 'A New Lynch Mob' ''What we have in this situation is this,'' said one of the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. ''The Mayor, the Police Department, the Queens District Attorney's Office, the Police Commissioner and some of our Negro leadership have all formed a new lynch mob. And they are hounding and chasing the messengers for speaking the truth. We have a lynch mob that is running loose in New York City.'' Mr. Maddox and another lawyer for the black victims, C. Vernon Mason, also said that their clients had stopped cooperating with the Queens District Attorney's office because prosecutors ''were making a case'' for the white defendants. Point by point, Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason sought to show how the police and prosecutors had mishandled the case and had unfairly subjected them to criticism that they had hampered the investigation. At one point, Mr. Maddox's voice quavered and his eyes began tearing as he said he was hurt and insulted by Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward's suggestion on Tuesday that the lawyer was involved in the case for the money he could make from any civil suit growing out of the incident. ''How could Ward be used by that man that way,'' Mr. Maddox said, referring to Mayor Koch. ''I have not received a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth. I have not been promised a dime from the Griffith family or from any soul breathing air on this earth. I have no expectations of receiving a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth.'' 'An Even Greater Degree' At a news conference after the hour-and-a-half meeting in City Hall, the Mayor said that he had asked for and heard the participants' recommendations for eliminating racial discrimination in the city. The Mayor conceded that it may be more difficult to eliminate the racism ''in the hearts of people.'' But he vowed that his administration would work to see that the law was vigorously applied in cases of racial bias and racial violence. ''Those who violate the law should be brought to justice very quickly and, when tried and convicted, be sentenced to an even greater degree than they would if the case did not include that bias aspect.'' The Mayor's comments came in the wake of a meeting that at first appeared to what some of the black leaders had thought to be an attempt to reinforce his call Tuesday to the lawyers for one of the victims, Cedric Sandiford, to end their refusal to allow their client to be interviewed by the prosecutors. Although spokesmen for the Mayor insisted that was not its purpose, the suggestion was much on the minds of those who attended. Comment From Rangel Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, said that he was pleased that the Mayor had not tried to convince those in attendance that they should, as a group,''second-guess the judge, prosecutor witness or attorneys'' in the case. The Rev. Floyd H. Flake, who will soon take his seat as the new Congressman from the Queens district in which the Dec. 20 attack took place, added: ''It is appropriate that the Mayor has not tried to beat us in line on this issue, or to tell us what he wants us to do or say to the people. But to ask our concerns about what we do to eliminate racism.'' When asked whether the Mayor's concern was uncharacteristic, Mr. Rangel, in the past a frequent critic of the Mayor on a host of issues, including what he has termed Mr. Koch's lack of sensitivity to black concerns, was conciliatory and praised the leadership that the Mayor had shown so far in condemning the Howard Beach attack. But he added: ''When one responds in a manner that you would want them to, it serves no purpose to attribute any ill motivation to it. There is absolutely no question in my mind that the Mayor has been an outspoken critic of those who take the law in their own hands.'' Before and after the session, others reacted to the criticism of the session. Harriet Michel, the president of the New York Urban League, when asked about the criticism, said she was ''absolutely not'' attending the meeting to join in criticism of Mr. Sandiford and his lawyer, Mr. Maddox. 'Made Sure It Was Not' Roscoe Brown Jr., the president of Bronx Community College, said that the idea of joining the criticism of the victims' lawyers was never raised and ''we made sure it was not.'' Arthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that ''there was no lynch-mob atmosphere, but a positive and exemplary one.'' Prior to the meeting, Mr. Flake had said that all of those scheduled to attend had ''reputations and constituencies'' and could not afford to simply join the Mayor in criticizing the attorneys. ''I'm not part of a lynch mob or a coon show,'' said Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten of Brooklyn. ''I would not try to pressure the lawyers. When the Mayor says he wants to discuss black issues, I have to go.'' 'Great Deal of Respect' Although most of the participants said that the issue of joining the call for Mr. Maddox and his client to cooperate with the Queens District Attorney never arose, the Rev. Leo Hamilton of the Bethany Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens, said that some did suggest to the Mayor that his evaluation of the case had caused problems. ''I have a great deal of respect for the Mayor, but he established a basis for evaluating this situation which almost seemed to throw the onus back on to blacks,'' he said of the Mayor's criticism of Mr. Maddox. ''We told him that we thought that should not have been the impression he left.'' Another participant in the meeting, who did not want to be identified, said that some had also criticized Police Commissioner Ward's suggestion at a news conference Tuesday with the Mayor that Mr. Maddox was motivated by the money that might result in a successful civil suit in connection with the racial attack. He said the comment was ''uncalled for.'' Among the things that the participants talked about, the Mayor said, was the need to do more in the city's education system and the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in housing, employment and other areas to ''improve the racial climate'' in the city. Housing Problems The Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, said that many of the issues had come up in the past in other sessions in which blacks have criticized some city policies. ''These things tend to foster a climate that permits a Howard Beach to happen,'' said Mr. Dinkins, referring to problems of poor housing, poverty and the problems that he said plagued blacks in the city more than others. The Mayor termed the group an ad hoc one that was just the first of a number of such groups he would be meeting with to devise ways of easing racial tensions in the city and improving its racial climate. Perhaps the only specific initiatives he presented to the group were some details in a briefing by Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones and the Board of Education president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., of a new curriculum on race relations and tolerance that is to be instituted within a few weeks in city schools. 'More Positive' Mr. Rangel said after the meeting that he personally saw a contrast in the way the Mayor had responded to the Howard Beach incident and his response to other issues in the past that bared racial tensions in the city. ''It is more positive,'' Mr. Rangel said, adding that he hoped that response indicated ''some continuity by the Mayor in creating an atmosphere to avoid these incidents in the future.'' The Mayor said that his feelings and attitudes toward prejudice remained the same, but allowed that he had expressed them differently and more intensely this time after the Howard Beach incident. He attributed that to his own experiences as a lawyer aiding civil-rights workers in the South during the 1960's, in which he himself was followed and chased by a group of whites opposed to the rights demonstrations. A 'Wrenching Experience' He said that the accounts of the fate of the person killed in the Howard Beach incident recalled for him his own feelings of terror then. ''This case caused me an enormous wrenching experience and I could feel the terror,'' the Mayor said. ''It was palpable and that's what caused me to single this out.'' None of the participants in the meeting responded to the use of the term ''coon'' by Mr. Sharpton. Mayor Koch noted, however, that Mr. Sharpton had sought an invitation to the session and had been refused. It was only after he had asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson to intercede for him with the Mayor that he was invited. ''Then he did what he did,'' the Mayor said, referring to Mr. Sharpton's failure to show up. These were the participants at the meeting with Mayor Koch: Betty Adams. Arthur Barnes, president of the New York Urban Coalition. Laura Blackburne, counsel to State Conference of Chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Roscoe Brown Jr., president, Bronx Community College. David N.

914-> Incentives to Put More Air Bags in Cars
To the Editor: We were very pleased by your editorial support last June for regulatory incentives to encourage air-bag production in new cars. In light of this position, we were very disappointed to read your news coverage of our proposal to provide just such incentives (news story, Nov. 22), which may have been misleading. Our standards require that 10 percent of all new cars manufactured for sale in the United States have automatic crash protection, such as automatic safety belts or air bags. This percentage will increase until Sept. 1, 1989, when all new cars must be so equipped. This regulatory deadline has not changed since it was established in 1984. Contrary to the suggestions in your article, our recent proposal does not affect that deadline. The rule requires automatic protection for both the driver and the right-front-seat passenger. In order to encourage the production of air bags, the rule allows a car that contains a driver-side air bag to be considered in compliance with the rule. Ford Motor Company asked us to consider extending that incentive, and our recent proposal would do so temporarily, for four years. If a manufacturer does not choose to install air bags (or, what the regulatory jargon refers to as ''nonbelt technology''), the manufacturer must comply with the original rule and provide automatic protection for both the driver and the passenger. In that case, the protection would in all likelihood be provided by means of automatic safety belts, as your editorial noted. We strongly believe that this incentive will encourage the production of greater numbers of air bags for the driver's side than we would have seen under the original rule, and will also encourage the orderly development and production of passenger-side air bags. The proposal has been supported publicly by safety advocates, including the National Safety Council, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, numerous insurance companies and other organizations. Your editorial in support of Ford's proposal urged us to ''meet Ford at least part way,'' to stimulate the engineers and to assist the domestic auto industry in meeting foreign competition. I particularly take issue with the news article's characterization of our proposal as ''the latest in a series of moves aimed at relaxing Federal regulation of the automobile industry.'' Our proposal would not delay or relax the automatic crash protection rule. Rather, it proposes an incentive that is available only to those manufacturers who choose to employ a more expensive, highly effective safety technology - the air bag. DIANE K. STEED Washington, Dec. 17, 1986 The writer is National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator, Department of Transportation.

915-> ENGINEER WHO OPPOSED LAUNCHING CHALLENGER SUES THIOKOL FOR $1 BILLION
A Morton Thiokol engineer, whose anguished pleas to delay the launching of the space shuttle Challenger were ignored a year ago, filed a $1 billion personal injury and damage suit against the company today and accused it of ''criminal homicide'' in the death of the seven crew members. The engineer, Roger Boisjoly, accused Morton Thiokol of fraud, negligence, manslaughter, racketeering, defamatory statements and untruthful testimony to a Presidential investigating commission and Congress, among other wrongdoings. Plan for $10 Million Claim Robert N. Levin, a Washington lawyer who represents Mr. Boisjoly, said he would also file by mail on Thursday a $10 million damage claim against the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under the Federal Tort Claims Act. A NASA spokesman said he was unaware of that imminent claim or the suit against Morton Thiokol, which made the defective rocket that caused the shuttle explosion. Mr. Boisjoly's legal actions today were his first detailed public comments on the behavior of Morton Thiokol and NASA before and after the Challenger disaster of a year ago today. The taciturn engineer has previously testified on shuttle rocket problems, but he has refrained from making strong public criticism. The suit filed today in Federal District Court here states that, because of ''intentional wrongdoings'' by both Thiokol and NASA, Mr. Boisjoly was ''severely injured in his emotional and mental health'' and was disabled by depression and by ''post-traumatic stress disorder,'' a mental disability that impairs the functioning of people who have experienced traumatic events. The damages sought in the legal actions would be awarded to Mr. Boisjoly himself, as compensation and punitive damages. The charges of criminal behavior were offered in support of his claim for personal damages and would not result in criminal penalties against the company. However, Mr. Levin, his attorney, also suggested that Federal or state prosecutors should consider bringing criminal charges against company officials. ''There are seven dead people from that flight,'' he said. ''I think somebody ought to investigate individual responsibility.'' An executive assistant to Thomas Russell, the chief spokesman for Morton Thiokol, said that company officials had no knowledge of the filing of the suit and could not respond to the charges today. The legal action comes after a year of increasing despair by Mr. Boisjoly over the events leading up to the accident and over his subsequent treatment by the company. The 48-year-old engineer was one of several Thiokol engineers who warned against launching the Challenger in cold weather, only to be challenged by NASA officials and overruled by Thiokol management. When he told his story to a Presidential commission investigating the disaster, he incurred an apparent demotion and reprisals from Thiokol, bringing a sharp reprimand to the company from the commission. For the last year Mr. Boisjoly has told friends he could never work on the shuttle again because the experience was so painful, and he has given at least one lecture to engineering students on the importance of ethical behavior by engineers. He recently left the company and is receiving long-term disability payments from its insurance program. Lawyers familiar with litigation for damages said that Mr. Boisjoly might face difficulties in proving his claim. Alan B. Morrison, director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a public interest law firm founded by Ralph Nader, expressed a ''gut-level feeling'' that corporations could be held liable for injuring a worker in such circumstances, but he said that Mr. Boisjoly might have problems establishing that his mental distress was caused by Morton Thiokol's actions as opposed to other factors in his life. A prominent Washington lawyer who is an expert in tort litigation, asking that his name be withheld, said that Mr. Boisjoly might have a sound case at bottom but that $1 billion was such an ''elephantine claim'' that the courts may react skeptically, a view in which Mr. Morrison concurred. Another Thiokol engineer who opposed the launching, Allan J. McDonald, has remained with the company and emerged as a spokesman for its redesigned rockets. Mr. Boisjoly's suit charges that, after the accident, both NASA and Thiokol ''undertook a program to discredit'' him and other engineers ''who had warned against the flight.'' As part of this campaign, the suit alleges, ''untrue and defamatory statements'' were circulated about Mr. Boisjoly, his job was threatened and his professional competence was attacked. Thiokol spokesmen ''consistently and falsely'' portrayed Mr. Boisjoly as ''a disgruntled or malcontented employee whose views should be discounted and whose professional expertise should be doubted,'' the suit said. It cited press interviews in which Thiokol spokesmen labeled Mr. Boisjoly a ''tattletale'' and an ''impatient'' employee who tried to hire subcontractors in violation of a contract. The suit contends that such allegations were false and ''made with the specific intent to injure'' Mr. Boisjoly's professional reputation ''and to punish him for testifying truthfully.'' The suit describes the events as a ''campaign to defame'' which amounted to ''intentional infliction of emotional distress.'' Mr. Boisjoly is seeking $1 million from Thiokol in compensatory damages to cover the earnings that will be lost by his inability to function as an engineer and to compensate for the mental health problems he has suffered. The suit also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages against Thiokol to serve as a warning and deterrent against similar actions by the company in the future. Under some of the relevant statutes, Mr. Boisjoly could also obtain reasonable attorneys' fees, if he wins his case. Use of Racketeering Law Mr. Boisjoly's attorneys are seeking damages under a range of statutes. The laws include the Federal ''Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,'' which was originally designed to combat infiltration of legitimate businesses by mobsters but has since been interpreted to prohibit various business frauds as well. '' The suit charges that, on the night before the accident, Thiokol used interstate telephones, wires and mails to transmit ''false certifications'' that it was safe to launch the Challenger. It also charges that Thiokol filed ''false and misleading statements'' with the Securities and Exchange Commission, stockbrokers, and its own stockholders, thereby committing securities fraud. Under Utah's version of the racketeering act, the suit alleges, Thiokol ''committed acts of criminal homicide'' and securities fraud that ultimately led to the injuries suffered by Mr. Boisjoly. His attorney, Mr. Levin, stressed that he was not accusing anyone of intentionally killing the astronauts but rather of unintentional manslaughter or criminal homicide. The suit accuses NASA and Thiokol of a long-term ''conspiracy of silence'' to ''keep secret'' their mismanagement of safety problems arising in the shuttle's booster rockets. It charges that NASA and Thiokol sought to keep a monopoly on shuttle rocket production for Thiokol in violation of antitrust and competitive contracting laws, ''testified untruthfully'' before investigating panels, pressured staff people to overlook safety problems, and committed insurance fraud by withholding information on the risks from insurance companies. It also charges that Thiokol sought to impede investigations of the disaster and tried, unsuccessfully, to get Mr. Boisjoly to alter his testimony. The widow of Dr. Ronald E. McNair, one of the astronauts killed on the Challenger, has also sued Thiokol for an undisclosed amount.

918-> SCOUTING; Compromise Is Blessing for Fans
The National Football League, mindful of Sunday morning church services - and, in some cases, to conform with local laws - has made it a point not to start regular-season games before 1 P.M. in most cities (though TV requirements frequently cause a noon kickoff in the Central time zone). The N.F.L. thus avoids conflicts with the services, many of which start at 11 A.M. That's fine for the home-team fans, but when a Western team plays on an Eastern field, it can cause a problem for churchgoers back in the Western city, particularly when the league bends its policy for the playoffs and, lessening the possibility of telecast overlap between the games, schedules one of them for 12:30. This Sunday, for example, when the Broncos play at Cleveland for the American Conference championship, it will be 10:30 A.M. in Denver when the game starts, a clear conflict with 11 o'clock services. Rather than mount a protest, some ministers in Denver have come up with another approach. They're adding special early services, kickoff at 8 A.M., to accommodate those who want to go to church without missing the game on television. The move is not universal, however. Many churches already have early services, and at least one that does not refuses to add one. The Rev. David Bruce, the pastor of the 3,000-member Riverside Baptist Church, said he would hold only one service Sunday, with the usual 10 A.M. starting time. He told his flock, however, that the service would end by 11:15. That way, he explained, ''all they would miss was a few Lite Beer commercials.'' Some of the ministers who have scheduled services for 8 A.M. say they have heard complaints that they're surrendering to football. But one, the Rev. James Barnes, pastor of the 1,600-member Trinity Methodist Church, says the accusations are not justified. ''We're just reacting to a normal, healthy event in the life of this community,'' he says. Besides, he points out, he'll also hold a service at the regular time. ''Those people for whom the game just doesn't matter can come right on in and join us at 11 o'clock if they want to,'' he says. ''I'm sure all six of us will do just fine.''

921-> CURRENCY MARKETS; DOLLAR UP IN RELATION TO THE YEN
In global currency trading roiled by rumors, the Japanese yen finally lost ground against the dollar yesterday. There were unconfirmed reports of heavy intervention by Japan's central bank to prevent the yen from gaining further strength to the detriment of vital Japanese exports. But the dollar's value continued to erode against other major currencies despite rumors that the Federal Reserve and other central banks had intervened to support it. The rumors also caused gold to plunge $5, to $410.50 an ounce, in New York. Even after the rumors were proved unfounded, the gold market was unable to recover its losses, according to Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. In both the currency and credit markets, there was conjecture that the Treasury would offer bonds denominated in a foreign currency. Central Banker's Remarks But this rumor turned out wrong when the Treasury said it planned to sell $29 billion of notes and bonds next week. It said its borrowing needs through midyear were lower than some had expected, and Treasury security prices rose. [ Page D18. ] Dealers said the currency markets were made even more nervous by remarks by the governor of the Bank of Japan, Satoshi Sumita, that a further reduction in Japan's 3 percent discount rate was being studied. Many market participants had expected a rate cut after Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, met with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d in Washington last week. Still other rumors had Mr. Baker leaving for a Group of Five currency meeting this weekend. But the White House denied that Mr. Baker was going to a meeting with the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Britain and France. Instead, it said, he leaves Sunday for a previously scheduled visit to Saudia Arabia. Idea of a Meeting Explored The Group of Five nations are exploring the possibility of a meeting next month to try to stabilize the dollar, but they are still negotiating on a date and agenda. A Reagan Administration official said the countries might not meet at all if they cannot agree on most of the outcome ahead of time. ''You don't want a meeting that's counterproductive,'' said the official, who requested anonymity. Albert Soria of the Swiss Bank Corporation observed, ''About the only solid news today was that the dollar opened weaker in Europe because the market there was disappointed that the President did not mention what, if any, moves the Administration was planning to halt the dollar's decline,'' referring to President Reagan's State of the Union address Tuesday. Mr. Soria continued: ''In Japan there were persistent rumors of massive interventions by the central bank to keep the yen from falling below the 149 level. And here in New York there were rumors that today's mid-quarter Treasury refunding terms would include special yen-denominated bonds to attract Japanese investors.'' Jack A. Kessler, manager of foreign-exchange trading at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said, ''Although all the rumors proved to be just that -rumors - they tended to help soften the dollar's drop against the West German mark and scare many who had been selling the dollar short.'' As in any market, Mr. Kessler noted, a downward trend tends to build the volume of short positions, in which traders seek to benefit from a continuing decline. Rumors of a possible turnabout tends to frighten such traders into buying out of their short positions, which was the case with the yen and, briefly, with the mark. But Steven E. Cerier, foreign-exchange economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said: ''We wouldn't completely discount the rumors about the intervention by the Japanese because of the relatively sharp rise in the yen today. Whether the money came from the Bank of Japan alone, or was raised with the help of other entities there, is less important than the fact that it must have taken a lot of money to raise the dollar's value so sharply.'' In late trading in New York, the yen was offered at 151.40 to the dollar, up from Tuesday's 150.12. But the absence of any moves by European banks to support the dollar caused the West German mark to rise to 1.7810 to the dollar from 1.7980 at the previous day's close in New York. And yesterday evening it took 1.4940 Swiss francs to buy a dollar, compared with 1.5090 the day before, while the British pound rose to $1.5410 from $1.5375, despite the huge British trade deficit reported for 1986. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar inched up further against the United States dollar, rising to 1.34, from 1.3425 on Tuesday. At the start of the year, the long-depressed Canadian dollar stood at 1.3790. ''Since then Japanese investors have been actively buying Canadian stocks and bonds,'' said Mr. Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover.

923-> FIRST CHICAGO TO BUY DELAWARE BANK
Increasing its stake in the credit-card business, the First Chicago Corporation said today that it would buy the Beneficial National Bank in Wilmington, Del., from the Beneficial Corporation for $247 million. Analysts said the acquisition would make First Chicago, already the nation's fifth-largest issuer of credit cards, a more potent player. Currently, it has $3.4 billion in outstanding balances and three million card holders. Beneficial National, whose primary business is the issuance of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, is the 12th-largest card issuer. The move would also give First Chicago, which is incorporated in Delaware, its first operating unit in that state. 'Growth in a Big Step' ''They can achieve growth in a big step with this acquisition,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., who added that he expected Beneficial to contribute to First Chicago's earnings in ''a couple of years.'' For the Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, the sale would aid in its restructuring. Two weeks ago, the Delaware company said it would sell about $1.4 billion in assets. The announcement came after it was unable to negotiate a takeover agreement with an unidentified corporation, rumored to have been the Transamerica Corporation, for about $1.74 billion. Beneficial said it now plans to concentrate on its consumer lending operations. A spokesman for the company said proceeds from this sale and from the expected sale of its insurance operations would be used to refinance debt and to repurchase shares. Beneficial National is not considered a full service bank - defined as an institution that takes commercial deposits and makes consumer loans. Beneficial officials said the bank takes in commercial deposits, but does not make consumer loans. It only issues credit cards. Of the bank's total assets of $1.1 billion, about $1 billion are receivables on credit-card accounts. Regulatory Approval Expected Bank and industry analysts said they do not expect regulatory problems. Typically, a bank acquisition across state lines requires approval from state and Federal authorities. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates bank holding companies, said, ''Although we have to look at First Chicago's application, the subject is not without precedent.'' On the state level, the issue is a little more cloudy because the sale is subject to approval by Delaware officials. ''It would be premature to issue any reponse,'' said Susan I. Winters, deputy commissioner in the Office of the State Bank Commisioner of Delaware. First Chicago officials remained confident that they would receive regulatory approval and complete the deal by mid-1987. ''It is a credit-card business, which happens to be imbedded in a bank,'' said Leo F. Mullin, First Chicago's executive vice president of consumer banking.

924-> Fixed Mortgages Fall to 8-Year Low
Mortgage rates dropped again last month, reaching an eight-year low, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said yesterday. Lenders in early December were offering, on average, 10.01 percent for fixed-rate mortgages, down from a revised 10.31 percent in early November, the bank board said. It was the sixth consecutive decline reported by the bank board, and it capped a remarkable drop of 200 basis points in the last year. During the same period, adjustable-rate mortgages with limits on rate changes fell to 8.79 percent from a revised 8.90 percent. It was the fourth consecutive drop for the adjustable mortgages, and the rates ended the year 160 basis points below their level 12 months earlier. A more recent survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, showed a slight gain for fixed-rate loans, with rates rising to 9.37 percent from 9.30 percent on Dec. 5. The figure was 10.81 percent a year ago. Freddie Mac had reported a 53-basis-point drop between early November and early December. The Freddie Mac survey is based on a conventional loan in which the homeowner makes a down payment of 20 percent. It does not include additional fees or ''points.'' The bank board survey tracks effective rates on mortgages for at least 15 years that cover at least 75 percent of the purchase price. Analysts say further declines are possible as economic sluggishness persists, although they attributed some of the recent declines to a seasonal slowdown in mortgage demand. Martin J. Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics, added: ''Long-term rates and mortgage rates will continue to go down, primarily because the economy is softer.'' He said he expected no appreciable surge in inflation and is forecasting first-quarter growth in the gross national product of about 1.5 percent. The share of adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 35 percent from 30 percent last month.

925-> PANEL URGES WEST SIDE ROAD; CUOMO FAULTS ESPLANADE PLAN
After reaching a last-minute compromise, a state panel yesterday unanimously recommended that a six-lane roadway and adjoining esplanade be constructed along the Hudson River from the Battery at the lower tip of Manhattan to 59th Street. Less than two hours after the panel adjourned its meeting, however, Governor Cuomo expressed serious doubts about financing the esplanade, a long, narrow 60-acre park whose estimated cost is $100 million. Si months ago the Governor and Mayor Koch charged the 22-member panel with recommending a replacement for the aborted Westway project and allocated $550,000 for the group's work. Without the assent of the Governor, who had not previously commented publicly about details of the panel's proposal, building any road to replace the existing West Side roads would be impossible. When it was announced, the report by the panel appeared to mark the first significant step forward in a decadelong fight to replace the existing West Side roads, widely considered to be inadequate and unsafe. Final agreement among the panel was in jeopardy until late Wednesday night over funding for the esplanade, the only large park space included in the project. No plan for financing the esplanade was included in the panel's pre-liminary report released last month. Dissent was avoided, however, when panel members representing city agencies bowed to demands by community activists and the Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, that financing to build the road be directly linked to progress on the esplanade. Representatives of state agencies had already approved the financing plan. Early yesterday morning, in an atmosphere of happiness and surprise bordering on disbelief, the panel presented its plan for the $530 million road. The panel, the West Side Task Force, included state and city officials and representatives of West Side communities. In naming the community representatives to the panel, the Governor and Mayor hoped to avoid the intense community opposition that forced the state to abandon the $2 billion Westway project. Cuomo Holds News Conference Answering questions at a Manhattan news conference before he received the report, the Governor told reporters that although he believed the panel's chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., was doing ''an excellent job,'' that did not mean he would accept the panel's recommendations. Asked his opinion of the proposed esplanade, the Governor spoke rhetorically, saying: ''If you told me an esplanade, a beautiful park on the West Side for $100 million, instead of housing for moderate-income people? Instead of money for the subways?'' ''I thought it was the people on the West Side who were telling me the money should go into the subways,'' he added. He appeared to be referring to a group of environmental and community activists who have vocally attacked the panel's composition and work since the Governor appointed it in July. The groups, along with Manhattan elected officials, have harshly criticized the panel for proposing a complex road that costs $530 million in 1987 dollars. $810 Million for Project Because at least five years would elapse before construction could begin, the road is expected to require all $810 million set aside for mass transit or a replacement roadway when the Westway project was dropped in 1985. Under the Westway trade-in approved by Congress, most of the $810 million comes from Federal highway funds not subject to increases for inflation. The Governor's comments about the esplanade were in keeping with the primary focus of his State of the State speech Wednesday, when he stressed that state spending had to be curbed. They also reflected his concern about funding for mass transit, which was the focus of a recent special session of the State Legislature. After hearing the Governor's remarks, Mr. Levitt, late yesterday called them a ''knee-jerk response in the midst of a lot of other considerations.'' ''I believe that the esplanade is a critical element in this project,'' said Mr. Levitt, who was widely credited at the morning meeting with bringing together dissenting panel members. ''Without the esplanade the project loses a good deal of its meaning.''

926-> Q & A
Q. Our house is about 10 years old and for the last couple of years I have had a problem with nail heads backing out or popping loose on the walls in several places. I have tried hammering the loosened nails back in and then plastering over them, but later the same thing happened again. Can you recommend a permanent cure for this problem? A. First, pull the loosened nails out completely or hammer them all the way in. Then about 4 or 5 inches above and below that nail hole, drive in two ringed or threaded drywall nails, or use drywall screws. These nails or screws are sold specifically for use in putting up dry wall or gypsum board. However, before driving them in, press the panel flat up against the studs and hold it in while you drive the nails or screws home. Recess the heads slightly so as to make a dimple in the surface of the dry wall, then fill the recesses and the old nail holes with joint cement, not with plaster. Q. The light bulbs on my outdoor porch always rust or corrode so that when it is time to replace them I cannot unscrew them. An electrician had to break the bulb in order to get the rest of it out. I began putting Vaseline around the threads, but an electrician told me this was a conductor and not to use Vaseline. He said baby powder would work just as well. I tried this, but powder didn't work -the bulb still got stuck. What do you suggest? A.As long as you don't smear the Vaseline on too heavily, or over the base at the bottom of the socket, I don't think there will be a problem. However, if you want to play safe you can spray the bulb's threaded metal base, and also the inside of the bulb socket, with a moisture-displacing lubricant like WD-40, LPS, CRC or any of the many other brands on the market. Q. We are planning to repaint the outside of our house, which has cedar shingles on the front and asbestos shingles on the sides. The paint has been neglected and many rusted nail heads are showing. To avoid removing and replacing all the nails is there some surface application we can use to retard the rusting and assure proper adhesion for the new paint? A. On the wood shingles you can countersink each nail head, then fill the hole with putty. On asbestos shingles you cannot countersink the nails so use steel wool to knock off loose rust, then prime all the rust marks and nail heads, as well as the previously puttied holes with a stain-killing sealer like BIN, Enamelac or Kilz. You can then paint with a latex house paint, but a sealer or primer might be required on the asbestos shingles.

The New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that it would return to its normal trading hours of 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M today. A number of smaller stock exchanges also said they would return to their regular hours. The Big Board shortened its trading hours starting on Oct. 23 to provide more time to process the huge number of trades made during Oct. 19, the day of the market's plunge, and the days immediately after. In recent days, the exchange has gradually been extending its hours and loosening its retrictions on computerized program trading.

930-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Jackson Return Feeble
Bo Jackson of the Kansas City Royals, who recently lost his regular job in left field to Lonnie Smith, was in the starting lineup on Monday and Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 7 because Danny Tartabull, the right fielder, had a sore arm. Jackson, the rookie who will play pro football for the Los Angeles Raiders as a ''hobby'' later this year, did not do much in the two games against the Rangers at Arlington, Tex., to win his way back into the starting lineup. In seven hitless times at bat, he struck out 6 times to run his total for the season to 148 whiffs in 355 times at the plate (almost 42 percent). In 101 games, he is batting .248 with 20 home runs and 49 runs batted in and 9 stolen bases. On Tuesday night Jackson misplayed a ball in right field that sailed over his head for a double and allowed the tying run to score in an eventual 3-1 victory for Texas. ''I didn't have a good game, but I've been out for 10 days,'' said Jackson. ''What do they expect? It's not like I'm Babe Ruth or something. I'm just going to try to make things happen. What else can I do? I'm not going to worry about it. I'm a man of confidence.''

931-> Make the Best of the Junta in Haiti
The Reagan Administration rightly presses Latin military dictators from Panama to Paraguay to yield power to civilian democrats. But in Haiti it supports Gen. Henri Namphy's discredited junta as long as it adheres to its announced timetable and ground rules for transition to elected government. Going along with the military is a sensible course because Haiti simply doesn't have other functioning political institutions. The elections now scheduled for November offer the only hope for a better alternative. Abandoning the junta undoubtedly would lead to postponement, at the very least, of the November vote. Paradoxically, an undemocratic junta thus seems democracy's best bet. Meanwhile the junta's record inspires scant confidence, and its commitment to a free and orderly election process cannot be taken for granted. It has squandered 18 months without producing any meaningful economic or political development. Haitians are still as poor and desperate as they were when Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to the Riviera on a U.S.-supplied jet last year. In June, the junta tried to supersede an independent electoral commission, backing down only under considerable popular and diplomatic pressure, Washington's included. Since then, at least 40 civilians have died at the hands of soldiers or police. One victim was a presidential candidate. The military has been nothing but rigid in response to popular protest. It has protected the jobs and fortunes of notorious Duvalierist thugs. These groups have an interest in provoking disorder in an attempt to derail the electoral process and keep their military protectors in power indefinitely. Breaking the pledge to hold free elections would necessarily mean a break with the United States. Washington will have to keep a watchful eye and hope the elections provide an opening for genuine democrats to emerge. Sadly, there is no alternative.

933-> Pan American Games Notebook; All They Need Now Is a Bowling Alley
At a meeting last fall in Barbados, officials of the Pan American Sports Organization approved bowling as a gold-medal sport for the 1991 games in Havana. It seemed like a logical decision, inasmuch as 100 million people in almost 80 countries bowl, according to the Federation Internationale des Quilleurs, the international bowling federation in Greendale, Wis. The trouble is, the number of usable lanes in Havana is believed to be quite small. As a result, Cuban sports officials have begun exploratory discussions with at least one United States company about building lanes in Cuba for the 1991 games. Jerry Graham, the vice president for international marketing for the Brunswick Bowling & Billiards Corporation, said there had been ''some communication'' with the Cubans about construction of lanes but for now, he added, ''things are up in the air.'' ''We're in the very, very early stages,'' he said. ''They asked us for some information, but I can't guarantee that they will even re-contact us.'' Supplying any goods or services to Cuba would be difficult, at best, for an American company. A trade embargo against Cuba has been in effect for some time, and even if the United States Government granted permission, Cuba would have to pay for the lanes. ''Money could be a problem,'' Graham said. Currently, Graham said, the Cubans have ''some equipment,'' including 16 used lanes the Japanese sent several years ago. But more would be required, he assumed, for an event like the Pan American Games. Versatile Goalie There was a fight at the end of the game the other night, but for once, it wasn't politically motivated. The United States and Cuba had just played a sensational game for the men's team handball gold medal, with the United States winning in overtime, 34-32, and emotions were running a little high. For the home team, the victory brought with it the added prize of a berth in the 12-team tournament in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The Cubans had previously qualified. In short order, the scuffle ended, and for the victors, anger turned to the jubilation of high-fives, hugs and a trip to the Far East. In the middle of it all was Bill Kessler, a 24-year-old native of West Hempstead, L.I., who had played goalkeeper through the second half and the two five-minute overtime periods. In the final 30 seconds, with the United States leading, 33-32, Kessler blocked a shot with his face. ''The greatest face block I ever made,'' he said. ''I just wish it had left a scar so I had something to remember it by.'' The victory meant the team will remain together, training in Colorado Springs and playing in tournaments. For Kessler, it also meant putting off the inevitable question: What will he do with the rest of his life? ''I have a zillion skills,'' he said. ''I would like to be a painter. I also play the piano and guitar. But I don't spend enough time at anything to be good at it.'' He took a deep breath; the night had caught up to him. ''What I really need,'' he said, ''is a woman to slow me down, so I can stop all this.'' Legal Problems Several athletes at the games have got themselves into trouble with local law-enforcement agencies. Two members of the Brazilian shooting team, amazed at so many gun shops in the area, tried to buy a shotgun, only to be refused because they are not United States citizens. Rather than give up, they prevailed upon a young volunteer working for the organizing committee to buy it for them. Afterward, the owner of the shop called the local office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. An agent found the Brazilians and returned the gun to the shop. Other athletes have been detained for shoplifting, members of the organizing committee said. ''We just joke about it now,'' one of them said. ''We assume they thought it was a two-for-one sale.'' Ready to Go One of the visitors to the games last week was Un Yong Kim, the vice president of the Seoul Organizing Committee, who said in an interview that South Korea could stage the Olympic Games now, if necessary. ''All the facilities are ready,'' he said. He also said that all the various political factions in South Korea were supporting the committee's efforts, to the point that organizers have not held even informal discussions with the current Government or potential candidates for president in the February elections. ''All the people in South Korea take pride in hosting the games,'' he said. ''The Government, the ruling party, the opposition party - they're all completely behind the organizing committee.'' Arredondo's Horse Last week, attorneys representing two relatives of a man murdered in Chile in 1973 filed papers in Federal District Court here, asking the court to freeze any assets in the country belonging to Sergio Arrendondo, a member of the Chilean equestrian team. In the action, the relatives accused Arrendondo of complicity in that murder and 71 others. Arrendondo, who was never served with the papers, left the country last week. But his horse - his only asset here - was left behind. And now, the word is that it died. A member of the Chilean delegation here said: ''We have no official word.''

934-> Indian Rebels Out of Jungle In Nicaragua
Armed and uniformed soliders are a common sight in this Caribbean town, but over the weekend it was difficult to tell whether the armed men were Sandinistas or rebels. About 80 Miskito Indian guerrillas, many of them fresh from the bush and carrying heavy armament, were freely walking the streets of Puerto Cabezas. They were a striking group, dressed in American-made camouflage fatigues, many of the men with regal manes of hair, all obviously uncomfortable. Children clustered around them while adults stared from a distance. Everyone had known that there were Indian fighters in the jungle, and many people in Puerto Cabezas, which is the principal Miskito town, said they had admired them from afar. But it was startling to see the fighters close up, and especially incongruous that they should be here, in a town that serves as a principal Sandinista garrison. The Indian rebels were in Puerto Cabezas as a result of a dramatic new agreement the Sandinista Government has reached with their commander, Uriel Vanegas. Under the agreement, the Indians will stop accepting the aid they had been receiving sporadically from the United States and will stop fighting against the Sandinistas. In exchange, they will be allowed to keep their weapons and will be assigned to defend their native villages as part of the Sandinista Army and police force. Others May Follow in Peace Mr. Vanegas is said to command about 400 men, and there were reports that other Miskito commanders, and even the leading Miskito rebel, Brooklyn Rivera, might soon follow his lead and make peace with the Sandinista Government. That could mean an end to the war on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast. ''There are going to be more surprises,'' said Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who directs policy toward the Indians. ''Peace is in the air.'' Mr. Borge, who arrived in Puerto Cabezas accompanied by three aides, nine bodyguards and a video team, spoke to the crowd that assembled at the town square Saturday to hear news of the agreement. ''We have to practice the 2,000-year-old virtues of the Lord Jesus Christ,'' said Mr. Borge, who is a professed atheist. ''Where there is offense, we give pardon.'' At a meeting with residents in the auditorium of the Child Jesus High School, Mr. Borge presented 16 Miskito prisoners convicted of collaborating with guerrillas and announced he was freeing them. Harder Stance Toward Contras Mr. Borge takes a radically different stance toward non-Indian rebels, the United States-backed contras. He has said he opposes the release of large numbers of prisoners accused of contra activity. Nor will he accept any arrangement in the western half of the country that allows contras to keep their weapons. ''You cannot see the Atlantic coast the way you see the rest of the country,'' Mr. Borge explained. The eastern half of Nicaragua, where less than 10 percent of the population lives, is a vast expanse of jungle, savanna and tropical rain forests. The region, initially colonized by the British, is webbed with meandering rivers and covered by dense foliage. It was an ideal hiding place for pirates who terrorized the Caribbean shipping centuries ago, and has proved inhospitable for Sandinista troops trying to track Miskito rebels. People in Puerto Cabezas are more likely to speak English than Spanish. Many of Mr. Vanegas's guerrillas, however, speak only the Miskito language. ''At the beginning, the Sandinista Front did not understand us, but now it does,'' Mr. Vanegas told the crowd Saturday. Puerto Cabezas is still home to thousands of Miskito refugees who were expelled from their villages along the Coco River in late 1981. Sandinista troops burned many of the villages to the ground to prevent Indian guerrillas from using them as bases. Indian leaders demanded that the displaced villagers be allowed to return to the banks of the river, which has a mystical as well as historic importance to them. In 1985 the Government finally agreed, and many Indians began to return. But conditions along the river are still difficult, and many Indians are waiting in Puerto Cabezas until they improve. Supplies Are Limited Even in Puerto Cabezas, supplies of food and other goods are limited. The town is more than 200 miles from Managua, and the only regular source of civilian supplies is Cuba, which sends boats roughly once a month. Residents say that there has been no flour or sugar in Puerto Cabezas for four weeks, and that their ration of beans has been cut to half a pound every 15 days. But for the Miskito guerrillas, Puerto Cabezas was a wonderland of luxury. Several said they were unusure the truce would hold, but expressed confidence in the judgment of their commander, Mr. Vanegas, a 23-year-old high school dropout who has been a guerrilla since he was 17. In an interview two years ago, he said his ambition was to study literature.

935-> Stunned Sri Lanka Studies Parliament Attack
Investigators said today that they were trying to determine if a grenade attack in Parliament had been made with the cooperation of security guards or employees in the building. The police were interviewing security personnel and others at the Parliament, where one or two assailants were believed to have fired at least one shot and thrown two hand grenades at President J. R. Jayewardene and members of his Cabinet. The incident occurred as Parliament prepared to convene for the first time since the signing of an accord with India last month that was intended to end four years of guerrilla warfare waged by the ethnic Tamil minority against the Sinhalese majority. Parliament is due to act next month. There were no arrests, and the police were unable to recover the pistol or revolver used in firing one or more shots. The authorities said that instead of fleeing after the incident, those responsible might have simply stayed on the scene and blended into the chaos. A spokesman for Mr. Jayewardene said tonight that Government leaders had been unaware of the identity or even the existence of the group that claimed responsibility for the shots, which killed a member of Parliament and wounded 15 others, including Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa and several Cabinet members. The incident spread shock, but there were no overt repercussions here in the capital, Colombo - which has been hit by rioting and protests since the signing of the accord - or elsewhere in the island. Most of the agitation has been by members of the nation's Sinhalese ethnic majority, mostly Buddhists. The group that claimed responsibility for the attack, the Patriotic People's Movement, told the BBC on Tuesday evening that it was seeking revenge for Mr. Jayewardene's ''betrayal'' of Sinhalese interests in granting greater political autonomy to ethnic Tamil areas. About 15 percent of the island's 16 million people are Tamils, who are mostly Hindu. War Waged for Four Years Tamil guerrillas have been waging a war of insurgency for an independent nation in northern and eastern Sri Lanka since 1983, and 6,000 people have died in the conflict. India has taken a direct interest in the conflict because its southern state of Tamil Nadu is the home of 50 million Tamils and has been a base for Sri Lankan Tamil guerrillas. When signed last month with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the accord spread anger among groups organized to back Sinhalese interests. Sinhalese groups also vehemently objected to the introduction of 6,000 Indian Army troops as ''peace-keeping forces'' in Tamil areas. Many Sinhalese say they see the Indian presence as less an agent to disarm the ethnic Tamils than an invasion force bent on establishing Hindu dominance. Government officials are known to be concerned by the possibility of disaffection over the accord within the Sri Lankan armed forces and the police, who bear the responsibility of keeping agitations under control. Infiltration by groups willing to engage in violence would undercut Mr. Jayewardene's efforts to keep the peace, win public support for the accord and protect himself against assassination. Diplomats say violence could also undermine the accord itself, which still has many steps before it is fulfilled. The Tamil guerrillas, for example, still have not surrendered more than a small part of their weapons. Among those protesting the accord have been Buddhist monks and an outlawed left-wing Sinhalese nationalist organization called the People's Liberation Front, which has been active in anti-Government protests for more than 15 years and is said to have as its members many in the Sri Lankan army and police forces. According to the BBC, the Patriotic People's Movement, in claiming responsibility, said it was separate from the National Liberation Front. In parts of Colombo today, the Patriotic People's Movement handed out leaflets calling on ''patriotic people in the armed forces'' to resist ''Indian expansionism.'' The leaflets spoke of Mr. Jayewardene as a ''traitor,'' whose death would be welcome.

941-> Not Only the Budget Worries Money Managers
Even if the budget negotiators in Washington agree to a compromise, the stock market may only get a temporary lift from the money managers whose purchases had been such a propellant this summer. While they have said for weeks that the budget deficit is the stumbling block to a rebound in stock prices, many of these managers are now citing other reasons for not buying stocks. Beneath it all is a more wary attitude after watching their clients' portfolios decline sharply since mid-October. Money managers have billions of dollars in cash waiting to be invested. There is no precise number, but the average cash position of 600 money management firms representing $131 billion was 7.7 percent at the end of last week, according to the Indata Corporation, a division of Gordon, Haskett & Company in Stamford, Conn. That is roughly one percentage point higher than the average cash position this year, but it is still well below the level before the bull market began in 1982, when the cash level was 14 percent, said Larry A. Ciccarelli, manager of equity research at the firm. Trade and Dollar Are Factors While the budget deficits have become an obsession with some portfolio managers, there are additional factors keeping them away from stocks. They are nervous about the trade figures the Government will release today. Additionally, many fund managers will not move their clients' assets into stocks until they see evidence that the dollar has bottomed. They are also nervous that an international event, such as a collapse of the Japanese stock market, could lower the value of stocks sharply. And some portfolio managers believe that by December there could be heavy tax-related selling by individuals. Managers expect that the stocks of small-capitalized companies that fell the hardest in October will be sold as individuals take capital losses. Furthermore, some portfolio managers are waiting to buy stocks until they see the Federal Reserve Board cut the discount rate. These managers believe that the economy is weakening and that the Fed should not wait for more evidence before it lowers rates. Pointing to ''lousy home sales, lousy auto sales and a worldwide correction in stock prices,'' Steven A. Kroll, executive vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company, said, ''That's about as much evidence as you need.'' Waiting for Bargains Moreover, some managers such as Michael Holland, president of First Boston Asset Management, are not buying stocks because they do not think prices are cheap enough. They want bargains. ''We don't feel we have to use up that cash in a week or two,'' said James H. Farrell Jr., a partner of Cashman, Farrell & Associates, a Wayne, Pa., investment firm that has $200 million of its clients' funds set aside in short-term investments. ''Bear markets generally don't bottom in a few weeks.'' As a result, his firm is barely nibbling at stocks. A move to cut the budget deficit obviously would be encouraging. But some money managers would like to see budget cuts larger than the $25 billion to $30 billion now under discussion. One of them is Mario Gabelli, head of Gamco Investors, which has $450 million of its clients' $2 billion parked in money market securities. But he doubts deeper cuts will be made because he does not think the budget negotiators have the ''guts'' to do so. Calls for Zero Deficit Some institutional investors want to see Congress and the Administration agree to reduce the deficit to zero within the next five years. ''It's maddening,'' said Jonathan Berg, founder of New York's Berg Capital, which has half its clients' assets in cash. ''When they raise our taxes, they expect us to adjust our personal budgets, but they're unwilling to cut spending enough. Obviously they're unwilling to address the problem.'' Many portfolio managers privately argue that Congress should make cuts ''across the board.'' They want to see cuts in Social Security, the military budget and the cost-of-living adjustments in Federal pension funds. 'No Time to Be a Hero' Money managers are also skittish about buying stocks because of concerns about their own business. If they spend what little cash they have on stocks and the market drops further, they worry that their clients will accuse them of being risky and dismiss them. ''We don't have enough confidence to take action,'' said the head of one firm that manages several billion dollars. Conversely, if money managers sell stocks in their portfolios and the market moves higher, their clients will dismiss them and hire better-performing money managers. ''This is no time to be a hero,'' said one manager.

946-> THE WORLD; New Sullivan Principles
Under the so-called Sullivan Principles, American companies could do business with South Africa if they widened opportunities for blacks and worked to end race segregation. But last week, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, the Philadelphia civil rights leader who created the code of conduct, said that the campaign had failed to crack apartheid, and he called on companies to unload their investments, and to end all commercial ties with South Africa. Spokesmen for the Reagan Administration and a number of large companies said they favored staying in South Africa and working to end apartheid. But more than 100 American companies have left in 18 months. Mr. Sullivan's new stand is expected to add to the pressure to boycott the securities and products of those that remain. American opponents of apartheid said pension funds of five states, nine cities and 59 universities have confined their investments to companies that have either left South Africa or that support Mr. Sullivan's earlier stand.

947-> Jersey City Indian Community Protests Rash of Racial Attacks
Leaders of this city's Indian community disrupted a mayoral news conference today, demanding action to halt a rash of attacks on Indians here. Mayor Anthony R. Cucci had called the news conference to announce a study to improve the efficiency of the Police Department. The session ended abruptly when several dozen members of the city's Indian community, which numbers about 9,000 people, primarily from the state of Gujarat, demanded that their concerns be addressed. ''I am as pained by what has happened as you are,'' Mayor Cucci said. ''I suffer as much as you do. ''No one should have their rights transgressed, regardless of their racial background or regardless of their ethnic background. I will not stand for it. My police director will not stand for it.'' Attack on House Described Kanti Patel, president of the Bharat Cultural Society of New Jersey and a Jersey City resident for 17 years, said after the news conference that there had been dozens of racially motivated attacks on members of the community, including an attack on his home Sunday evening. Mr. Patel said four youths threw eggs and pieces of metal at his house and shouted racial epithets. He also charged that the police were slow in responding to his call for help. He said he did not leave the house to challenge the youths because he was afraid that one or more of them might have a gun. The next evening, he added, the youths returned to call out names. Others in the Indian group described other incidents, including women being spat upon. One Death Is Cited Members of the group said the recent violence was unlike anything in the almost 20 years that there has been a sizable Indian population here. They said that in recent weeks one man was beaten to death in Hoboken and another here was beaten into a coma. ''People are afraid to go out,'' said Vishnu Patel, another Indian community leader who is not related to Kanti Patel. ''Those people who work nights or who return late at night are not going to their jobs. They're scared.'' ''We are a hard-working community and we will have to do something to protect ourselves.'' he added. ''That's part of our duty.'' Dr. Lalitha Masson, a gynecologist here, said the Indian community would hold a peace march Saturday in an attempt to marshal support from all Jersey City residents. ''There have been numerous attacks and no arrests have been made,'' she said. Hate Letter Excerpt Published The city's Police Director, Walter Adams, said the incidents are under investigation. He said there had been a sharp increase in incidents since a newspaper, The Jersey Journal, published part of a letter threatening the Indian community as part of an article about state efforts to monitor racism. The letter's writer said it was from an organization called ''Dotbusters,'' an apparent reference to the tilak, a small dot of red cosmetic worn on the forehead by Hindu men and women.

948-> 32 Are Killed in Fire At London Subway; 80 Reported Injured
At least 32 people were killed and about 80 injured Wednesday night when a fire broke out in a subway station in central London. Witnesses described a scene of panic and confusion in the King's Cross station as commuters were trapped in the ticketing areas and on platforms of the Piccadilly Line. They reported seeing people with their clothes and hair aflame, clawing desperately to make their way to the exits. ''People were running everywhere, panicking and treading on each other,'' said Paul Medland, a survivor. Another commuter, Doug McAdam, told of arriving in the station in a train just as smoke billowed down toward the tracks. ''It was like coming into a pub full of smoke,'' he said. ''The escalator had been shut down and the station guards sent us toward the Victoria Line escalator, which was working. As we went up, the smoke was worse.'' The blaze started at the foot of a wooden escalator at about 7:50 P.M., catching the last of Wednesday's evening rush hour crowd at the city's busiest underground station, where five subway lines converge. Early reports were that the fire started in the equipment room under the escalator that links the Piccadilly Line platforms with the main ticketing concourse of the station. Officials did not rule out the possibility that an incendiary device was involved, but they did not seem to strongly suspect arson. Of the 80 reported injured, 26 were known to have been hospitalized, most for burns and smoke inhalation. About 150 members of the London Fire Brigade, wearing breathing devices, searched through a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways for people trapped by the fire and smoke. 'A Major Tragedy' ''It's a major tragedy, and our heart just goes out to all those who are involved and their families,'' said Sir Keith Bright, chairman of London Regional Transport, after emerging from the station shortly after 11 P.M. and reporting the fire was out. ''I feel absolutely shattered by what has happened here tonight,'' he said. Fire officials said choking smoke, intense heat and darkness took a heavy toll on commuters and hampered rescue efforts. ''No one who was down there when the fire started could possibly be living,'' said Police Superintendent David Fitzsimmons. The Piccadilly Line is a main artery familiar to many tourists because it stretches from Heathrow Airport through such central London stops as Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square before ending at the Cockfosters station in north London. The line intersects with four others at King's Cross. After his inspection, Sir Keith singled out the wooden escalator as the origin of the fire. ''Conditions down there are pretty horrific,'' he said. ''The fire clearly started about halfway up the escalator. The bottom part of the escalator is all right. Underneath the escalator is all right. The top half of the escalator sort of vortexed into the ticket area, which is completely burned out.'' Wood Not Seen as Cause Asked if the fact that the escalator was wooden was the cause of the fire, Sir Keith said: ''No, the wood that they're made of usually, if there's ever any problem, smolders and extinguishes itself. The point of this fire, the temperature was so high. Our own experts cannot explain the situation in any way at all. ''They've been there since the underground began,'' he said of the old escalators. ''They've been steadily replaced, as you know, with metal ones. They'll all be replaced in due course.'' Joe Kennedy, assistant chief officer of the First Brigade and leader of the rescue operation, declined to speculate on the cause of the fire. He said it covered an area of about 300 square yards and confronted firefighter with a wall of blasting heat and noxious gases in addition to the smoke. Shortly after midnight, with the area cooled down, firefighters began a final search of the corridors for people who might have been trapped. A 'Sheet of Flame' Some of the survivors told of seeing a ''sheet of flame'' sweep across escalators that were being used for escape, and Mr. Kennedy said many of the injured were in bad shape. Paul Channon, the Secretary of State for Transportation, came to the scene and promised a ''full inquiry.'' He praised the rescuers, but declined comment on the adequacy of evacuation procedures. Hundreds of people were in the station at the time. Authorities said that an hour earlier, at the peak of the rush hour, the number would have been counted in thousands. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a statement, said she was ''absolutely horrified'' by the disaster and expressed sympathy for the families. The Press Association, the British press agency, quoted fire officials as speculating that a spark from a motor in the machine room under the escalator might have ignited trash. One firefighter and three employees of London Regional Transport were thought to be among the dead. The fire was at its fiercest in the ticketing area at the top of the escalator. People reported seeing bodies slumped against the wall, where the heat was so intense that it popped tiles and cracked solid concrete. One survivor, Andrew Lea, complained that initial efforts by police at the scene to direct fleeing commuters were carried out ''in a fairly casual manner.'' He said the police and firefighters initially seemed to lack a sense of urgency. ''They directed us to an alternative escalator, which was the escalator from the Victoria Line, which they said was still working,'' Mr. Lea said. ''In fact, that escalator emerges at the same point as the one that was on fire. However, we followed their directions and got on to the other escalator. About halfway up a sheet of flame shot across the top of that escalator and very soon the ceiling was on fire and debris started falling down. ''There were firemen standing by and just said, 'Get down and get out.' The people who were at the top of that escalator seemed to be very badly burned although they were still walking.'' This was the worst fire in the history of London's underground. One person died and 47 were injured in a fire in 1985. The last major disaster was in 1975, when a collision killed 43 people and injured 74.

950-> IN THE NATION; Still the 'Uncle' Policy
Good for Jim Wright, who rejects the Reagan Administration's demands on Nicaragua as ''ridiculous'' and as evidence that ''someone advising the President is trying to torpedo the peace process'' haltingly under way in Central America. What other conclusion is possible in light of Mr. Reagan's record on this issue? His Administration organized and has financed the contras, legally and illegally, first in order to ''interdict supplies'' supposedly being sent guerrillas in El Salvador, then to ''keep pressure'' on the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua to change its ways. The Reagan Administration has refused all suggestions of direct negotiations with the Sandinistas. It found reasons real and unreal to reject the various peace proposals of the Contadora nations. Mr. Reagan himself said he wanted the Sandinistas to say ''uncle'' - to surrender, not to negotiate a peace. He has already called the Central American peace plan ''fatally flawed,'' though all five nations of the region accepted it and the Sandinistas have started to put it into effect -appointing the required reconciliation commission, allowing the opposition newspaper La Prensa to start publishing again, and returning a Catholic radio station to the air. But Mr. Reagan's position is that the Sandinistas will renege on these steps as soon as possible. He wants to move ahead with $270 million in additional aid to the contras and demands that the Sandinistas go well beyond what they agreed to do in the Central American peace plan - evict all Soviet and Cuban advisers, for example, negotiate directly with the contras and stop accepting Soviet-bloc military aid. These demands invade Nicaraguan sovereignty, which even the Reagan Administration officially recognizes. They are clearly designed to be rejected, thus to ''torpedo the peace process'' - at least U.S. acceptance of it. The White House apparently believes that this is a strong domestic political position. A senior official told Joel Brinkley of The New York Times that Congressional Democrats favoring the peace plan and opposed to further aid to the contras should be prepared to answer the question: ''Are you willing to be held hostage to Danny Ortega [ Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the President of Nicaragua, who signed the Central American peace accord ] ?'' That's the wrong question. As Speaker Wright apparently recognizes, the current effort in Central America is regional. If Mr. Ortega should renege on his commitments, or reverse them at some future date, it would be up to the other signers, supported by most of Latin America - not to the United States - to bring the necessary pressures and opprobrium to bear on Nicaragua. Can the Latin nations be trusted to do so? That's the wrong question, too. For one thing, some Latin leaders believe the Sandinistas will not defy all their neighbors and their partners in the peace accord. Even if they might, it's not for the U.S. to question the good faith of these neighbors and partners - sovereign nations all - or their ability to enforce the agreement, much less to add impossible conditions in order to subvert it. Besides, if the U.S. does not accept the ''peace process'' in Central America, particularly if it renews military aid to the contras, the Sandinistas would have no alternative but to continue the anti-contra war. And it's the necessities of that war that have given them their excuse not only for repressive political measures but for the continuing weakness of the Nicaraguan economy under their regime. If the war ends, the Ortega Government will have to face up to domestic political and economic pressures without repression, or without the pretext of wartime necessity to justify repression. Surely, moreover, if the Reagan Administration wants Soviet and Cuban advisers out of Nicaragua, and an end to Soviet-bloc military aid, the wrong way to go about it is to continue putting military pressure on a Sandinista Government thus forced to fight for its life. But Mr. Reagan, as he has all along, wants more than that: he wants to overthrow the Sandinistas, so that he can claim to have rid the Western Hemisphere of a Marxist Government, one he pictures as a potential Soviet base in the U.S. ''backyard.'' He can't get that result through the Central American peace plan and so he's willing to ''torpedo'' it and continue his proxy war, no matter the cost in money, lives, hemispheric amity and the conditions of life in Nicaragua. Mr. Wright's break with the President suggests a sound democratic alternative to this ''uncle'' policy: strong U.S. support for Central American peace, through regional cooperation.

951-> Art: 'Generations of Geometry,' an Abstract Show
''GENERATIONS of Geometry,'' an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art's branch at the Equitable Center, covers over 50 years and several phases of American geometric abstraction, up to and including works from 1987 by artists who have only recently started to exhibit. Organized by Cheryl Epstein, M. Christine Hunnisett and Kimmo Sarje, all Helena Rubinstein Fellows in the museum's independent study program, this exhibition is topical, to say the least, and can be seen as symptomatic of several tendencies, some more cheering than others. On the positive side, the show suggests that geometric abstraction is an enduring strain of modern or postmodern art, capable of being revised, expanded and possibly transformed by succeeding generations. Additionally, it reveals that the resurgence of geometry has allowed many older artists to come in from the Neo-Expressionist cold and do some of their best work, even if it is not strikingly original. (This seems true of Harvey Quaytman and David Diao - both of whom investigate effects of Constructivism in the new paintings they exhibit here.) At the same time, this show suggests that geometric abstraction is an easily adopted style, an accessible bandwagon that empties and fills as the winds of fashion change. It underscores how fast things move - and run their course - in the New York art world. To see this season's latest, hottest idea - geometry - ensconced in an exhibition in a corporate-sponsored space organized by curators-in-training may be a daunting comment not just on the scene per se, but on the continuing palatability of geometric abstraction itself. On the whole, this exhibition traces the movement, evident in work from the 1930's through the 1960's, toward flatness and pure abstraction devoid of reference to the outside world. It then traces the opposite movement in the 70's and 80's away from such purity and back toward outside references. Under scrutiny is a kind of reversal, but not one that always comes full circle. Many of the younger artists in this show attempt to incorporate a new kind of outside reference into their work - one that questions originality or reveals art's commodity status. This consciousness, derived from Conceptual art, marks for many people the shift from modernism to postmodernism. The two divergent lines of recent geometric abstraction are shown most clearly in the juxtaposition of Mr. Diao's red, black and white painting with one by Andrew Spence using the same colors. The Spence painting represents a more traditional use of reference. Its two tilted squares - a white one floating above a smaller black one - click into focus as a schematic lampshade and table top as soon as you read the painting's title: ''Light.'' In contrast, Mr. Diao's red squares and rectangles on black, also angled and tilted, deal self-consciously with the history of abstraction. Their arrangement is based on a famous installation view of a 1915 exhibition of Kasimir Malevich's Suprematist paintings. (Occasional Malevichian crosses and squares, floating behind the red shapes, alert viewers to Mr. Diao's appropriational strategy.) The exhibition's opening gallery represents several kinds of earlier American geometric abstractions. The Neo-Plastic paintings of Burgoyne Diller and Ilya Bolotowsky, dominated by primary colors and inherently gridded compositions, show the crucial influence of Mondrian. Alice Trumbull Mason's and Charles G. Shaw's floating planes of color are inspired by architecture. Nearby, works by Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Jensen, and Agnes Martin, dating 1953, 1966 and 1977 respectively, attest to the various Americanizations of the grid. Despite the time span and diverse sensibilities covered by these paintings, there's a surprising common ground: a mystical, somewhat idealized quality. This quality tends to dissipate in the next gallery, where the triumph of American geometric abstraction is symbolized by Frank Stella's ''Gran Cairo'' of 1962 - a series of concentric bands that evoke Stella's well-known phrase ''What you see is what you see.'' Stella's painting signals the demise of a mystically oriented abstraction in the literalness of Minimalism, but also the onset of a series of corruptions. Several of these are pinpointed in adjacent paintings by Jo Baer, Al Held and Robert Mangold, all completed in the early 1970's. Each contrasts with Stella's flat, rational structure in ways that are, in hindsight, very telling. Ms. Baer's stark white fields convert the mystical into the aggressively perceptual, while the irony added by her painted-on frames seems especially up to date. Mr. Held counters the prevailing flatness of the time with impeccably rendered deep space, Piranesian in its complexity. Mr. Mangold inflects his flat-footed geometry with humorous imperfections: a square drawn on a slightly too large circular canvas has two corners that hit the outer edge and two that do not. These three paintings set the stage for an accelerating self-awareness that characterizes the best - and the hippest - of the recent work in the exhibition. But generally, the remaining paintings oscillate between the two extremes represented by the works by Mr. Diao and Mr. Spence. In ''Here, Now,'' Philip Taaffe reprises the signatory stripes of Barnett Newman. His tiny brown and black checks give zipper-like teeth to Mr. Newman's vertical line, which is colloquially known as a ''zip.'' Sherrie Levine's painting acknowledges the stripe as an abstract staple so generic that it represents no single artist's signature, while Ross Bleckner uses soft edges and touches of gold to imbue the black and white stripes of Op Art with a mournful air that is unique to the exhibition. James Welling and David Reed insinuate intimations of photography into their very different paintings; Mr. Welling's burgeoning black on white spheres create a deep space that is surprisingly similar to Mr. Held's. Peter Halley's work, viewed without its theoretical trappings, has an almost innocent, tongue-in-cheek representational quality that is closer to Mr. Spence's than is generally supposed. However, Mr. Halley makes more aggressive use of color and scale. His painting, titled ''Glowing and Burnt-Out Cells With Conduit,'' contrasts a fluorescent red panel with a black one. Both Michael Young and Richard Tobias seem overly influenced by Mr. Halley's circuitry. Calvin Brown's painting, an up-to-date composite of hard-edged and mostly Op motifs, illustrates how easily the appropriated can become merely derivative. Consisting of loans from the Whitney's collection, supplemented by some from private holdings in New York, this exhibition has the feel of a trial balloon. It will probably inspire someone to do a better version at a later date. But in the meantime, without being either simplistic or didactic, its careful installation in particular enables the viewer to compare, contrast and judge. (Through Aug. 26 at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Equitable Center, 787 Seventh Avenue at 52d Street.)

952-> TRACK AND FIELD; Reynolds Runs a Superb 400
Harry Lee (Butch) Reynolds Jr. is for real. The 22-year-old senior from Ohio State won a heralded confrontation in the men's 400-meter final tonight with power more appropriate for a football player than a runner. The race came on the final night of the 66th National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championships. Reynolds beat the fast-closing Danny Everett of U.C.L.A. by 3 meters. Roddie Haley of Arkansas, who had been regarded as Reynolds's major threat, led briefly. Then he faded to third, 2 meters behind Everett. The times were 44.12 seconds for Reynolds, 44.47 for Everett and 44.82 for Haley. Reynolds's time was a meet record and the fifth fastest in history. It was the second fastest at low altitude to the 44.10 Reynolds ran five weeks ago in Columbus, Ohio. The only times faster than Reynolds's were run by Lee Evans and Larry James in 1968 at high altitudes. Everett's time was his fastest ever. Only 10 men have ever run faster. Though Reynolds had never faced a field this strong, he ran as if no one else had a chance. He had a slight lead over Haley rounding the last turn. With 90 meters left, as they straightened out for home, Haley edged in front. ''I must have been there two seconds,'' Haley said. ''Then he pulled away.'' ''He came up on me on the curve,'' Reynolds said. ''That was a good move. He surprised me. He made me go. I just changed gears.'' Reynolds unleashed so much power that his body rocked. In a space of 20 meters, he moved from a foot behind Haley to 2 meters in front. He stretched his lead to 5 meters before Everett closed much of the gap. ''This is the first race I was pushed this year,'' Reynolds said. ''I hope this and my times prove I'm a world-class athlete.'' For 20 minutes after the race on a warm, humid night, Haley alternately sat and kneeled before a large fan. Then he held an ice pack to his strained groin muscle. ''I ran all right,'' he said. ''I'm real pleased with my time. He beat me. Two guys beat me. I'll beat him next time.'' The 10 women's finals produced a world best by Sheila Hudson of California in the triple jump (45 feet 2 1/2 inches) and meet records by Suzy Favor of Wisconsin in the 1,500 meters (13 minutes 43.40 seconds) and Lillie Leatherwood-King of Alabama in the 400 meters (50.90 seconds). The 10 men's finals produced a collegiate record by U.C.L.A. in the 1,600-meter relay (3:00.55) and victories by Raymond Stewart of Texas Christian in the 100 meters (10.14 seconds and Abdi Bile Abdi of George Mason in the 1,500 meters (3:35.79). The only double winner was Gwen Torrence of Georgia, who won the women's 100 meters in 13.25 seconds tonight and the 200 meters Friday. U.C.L.A. easily won the men's title. L.S.U. won the women's division.

954-> The Second Time Around
A MAN AND A WOMAN Film produced and directed by Claude Lelouch. Dubbed English-language version. With Anouk Aimee, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Pierre Barouh, Valerie Legrange. Music by Francis Lai. Warner Home Video. 103 minutes. $24.98. A MAN AND A WOMAN : 20 YEARS LATER Film produced and directed by Claude Lelouch. French with English subtitles. With Anouk Aimee, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Richard Berry, Evelyne Bouix, Robert Hossein, Philippe Leroy-Beaulieu, Charles Gerard, Marie-Sophie Pochat. Music by Francis Lai. Warner Home Video. 112 minutes. $79.95. For many people who happened to be in love in 1966, the ''dab-a-dab-a-dah'' theme from Claude Lelouche's film ''A Man and a Woman'' serves the same function as the faint perfume on an old love letter. So, when that romantic film's sequel came out two decades later, they naturally devoured it, reveling in the nostalgia and all but disregarding charges of artificiality and sentimentality leveled by some unfeeling young reviewers. Purely as a feat of imagination and filmic technique, the sequel is exciting as it picks up the touching story of lovers (Anouk Aimee and Jean-Louis Trintignant, above right in original version, below right in sequel) who have drifted apart and ingeniously weaves into it a witty parody of the classic policier. The release of the two films, in separate home-video packages, is therefore welcome in spite of certain technical drawbacks. The major objection to the video version of the 1966 film is the execrable dubbing, which drastically changes the fragile mood. Be prepared to hear Aimee and Trintignant exchange sweet nothings in prosaic English. The sequel, on the other hand, wisely retains the original French and provides English subtitles. Vital nuances of tone and taste are thus preserved.

955-> WESTCHESTER JOURNAL;
A Business Start-Up and Survival Conference will be held Wednesday at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. ''The idea was first suggested by the New York State Department of Commerce because it was getting so many requests for information on how to run a business,'' said Elaine Sall, program specialist at the college's Professional Development Center. ''It felt a hands-on, how-to conference would be very valuable to a lot of fledgling business owners.'' The sponsors of the conference, which will run from noon to 5 P.M., include the County Office of Economic Development, the State Department of Commerce and Citibank, as well as the Professional Development Center. At the center, Mrs. Sall explained, ''We provide training for the employees of area corporations in specific skills -such as computers, for example - either here or at the corporation's headquarters.'' Topics to be covered at the conference include organization, legal aspects, record-keeping taxation, insurance, risk management and banking. Technical assistance from representatives of the sponsoring agencies and the County Chamber of Commerce will be available. Although this is believed to be the first such conference in the county, others have been sponsored by Citibank around the state and have been successful, said Peter Delaney, a development specialist with the county's Office of Economic Development. ''The conference is an attempt to help new businesses in their early, fragile state of growth,'' Mr. Delaney said. ''Small businesses are the backbone of the country - in Westchester, for instance, 50 percent of the people work for companies with fewer than 100 employees. Yet unfortunately 90 percent of all new businesses fail within the first five years. We're trying to better the odds.'' Reservations for the conference can be made through Mr. Delaney's office. For further information, call 285-2925. A $10 fee includes lunch.

956-> Passenger Says Engine Loss Brought Panic
Passengers panicked when an engine fell off their twin-engine USAir jetliner more than 4,000 above New Jersey, and what worried them most was the landing, a passenger said today. ''It was very traumatic when we were up there,'' said the passenger, Kelly Coville, of Hingham, Mass. ''There were a lot of teary-eyed people when we landed.'' She was seated on the left side of the Boeing 737-200 on Saturday when passengers across the aisle saw the engine fall away just five minutes after they took off for Boston. ''Initially you could see panic,'' she said, ''but the attendants got control.'' The pilot guided the swaying plane back to a landing at Philadelphia International Airport. Federal and airline investigators said Sunday it was too soon to determine why the engine fell off. The 60 passengers and the five crew members on Flight 224 were not injured, and no one was hurt on the ground when the engine fell in an empty field. A USAir spokesman, David Shipley, said today that the 737 was designed to fly on one of its two engines if necessary. Ms. Coville, 25, said the plane rocked from side to side after the engine fell. ''It was really like when you hit turbulent weather,'' she said. ''I guess what we really feared was the landing. The crew told us how to evacuate the plane quickly, in case a fire broke out or something.''

957-> Hughes Institute Opens New Grant Program
The Howard Hughes Medical Institute announced $45.5 million in awards yesterday under a new 10-year program that will eventually provide $500 million for education in the medical and biological sciences. The largest single award this year is $7 million to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island for the development of a neuroscience education program. The Hughes Institute said the laboratory, in addition to its acclaimed work in the genetics of plants and humans, had contributed significantly to science as a ''schoolhouse'' for modern biology, giving generations of precollege teachers and students the opportunity to attend courses and workshops. The institute also set aside $30 million in awards for liberal arts colleges, including predominantly black public and private institutions, to strengthen undergraduate education and research in the sciences. These are the first awards for undergraduate education by the Hughes Institute, which has focused on supporting research in its own laboratories. Trustees of the institute directed that the awards be used to encourage greater opportunities for minorities in biomedical fields. The grants, ranging from $500,000 to $2 million, will be awarded in 1988 to colleges, chosen by a committee of scientists and educators, that show ''the most creative, effective and integrated plans for the development of faculty, students and curricula in the biological sciences.'' Looking to the Future Dr. Purnell W. Choppin, the recently elected president of the institute, said, ''We view the program as helping to insure future generations of bright, well-trained men and women who will be leaders of biomedical research in the future.'' The Hughes Institute, based in Bethesda, Md., has assets of $5.2 billion and is the country's biggest private medical research concern, undertaken through its network of 27 laboratories in medical centers and universities. In March, a 17-year-old Federal tax dispute was settled. That suit charged that Howard Hughes, the billionaire industrialist who created the institute in 1953, had used it as a ''device for siphoning off otherwise taxable income.'' Under the tax settlement, the institute paid the Government $35 million and agreed to spend $500 million in grants. The new $45.5 million program, which was announced in Washington, also provides $5 million to the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences for studies of the legal, medical and ethical effects of biomedical developments on society. The Institute of Medicine was awarded another $5 million to develop programs promoting greater public understanding of science and studies in health science policy. Another $2 million grant was made to the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me., for training, education and development of its genetic resources program. The institute gave $599,510 to the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences for a study of high school biology education, and another $356,658 to the academy to evaluate applicants for the institute's fellowship program.

958-> Cuomo Aide Is Buffeted By the Vagaries of Albany
Evan A. Davis said he used to wonder how Gov. W. Averell Harriman could be so adept at dealing with the Russians, yet never quite get the hang of dealing with the New York State Legislature. But after two years as chief counsel to Governor Cuomo, Mr. Davis says he is beginning to understand how Albany politics might stymie even a skilled diplomat. ''The issues are very difficult,'' Mr. Davis said in a recent interview. ''And everybody has very strong feelings.'' Last week, Mr. Davis and his eight assistants finished their review of the bills the Legislature sent to the Governor this session. The final tally, according to Mr. Davis, showed the Governor had signed 855 bills into law, vetoed 59, and the Legislature recalled 23. Mr. Cuomo reserves the major policy decisions for himself. But on the vast majority of bills, the Governor followed advice of his counsel, Mr. Davis said. Several of the Governor's vetoes involved significant pieces of legislation, among them bills to supplement the pensions of state and city government workers and to restructure the way New York's hospitals are reimbursed. Part of Elite Circle But even more significant than Mr. Davis's role in the bill-signing process is his role in the negotiations that lead to it. As the Governor's chief legal adviser, Mr. Davis, 43 years old, is part of an elite political circle whose members are barely known outside the Capitol. But their decisions help to determine what legislation becomes law. This circle also includes the counsels to the leaders of the Legislature and top staff aides, and before most of the significant bills are even printed, they have concluded their negotiations. This year, with the debate over ethics legislation dividing the Legislature and the Governor, the negotiations were particularly difficult. Mr. Davis said that despite the tensions, he was satisfied with the results of the negotiations. The antagonisms, he said, were ''in the nature of the process.'' The discussions, however, have left influential legislative staff members in the Assembly and the Senate at odds with Mr. Davis. Animosity Lingers Instead of negotiating, they said, Mr. Davis delivers the Governor's demands and refuses to yield on them. So keen are the antagonisms between Mr. Davis and some top legislative staff members that important compromises on the ethics bill had to be worked out by the Governor's chief of staff, Gerald C. Crotty. Legislative staff members and aides to Mr. Cuomo said some of the difficulties between Mr. Davis and his legislative counterparts can be traced to the Governor's own leadership style. Mr. Cuomo's supporters characterize that style as ''hands on.'' Detractors call it an unwillingness to delegate authority. Both sides agree that the Governor often does not authorize his aides to make deals on important issues, something Mr. Cuomo seemed to acknowledge during ethics bill negotiations with a remark that many people said was humiliating to Mr. Davis. ''Evan cannot sign off on any language,'' the Governor had said. The Governor's office and the Legislature disagree on the effect of Mr. Cuomo's leadership approach. Administration officials said Mr. Davis often plays the role of the heavy on purpose to allow the Governor to strike a more favorable compromise. ''Cuomo on the big things doesn't send staff out to cut the compromise deals,'' said one of the Governor's top advisers, who asked not to be identified. ''The issue for him is to maximize what he gets out of the process.'' The adviser said Mr. Cuomo's legislative record was good, ''so obviously the process works pretty well for him.'' Cuomo's Style Legislative aides argued, however, that by reducing the power of his counsel, Mr. Cuomo had slowed government. They said the Governor had forced legislative leaders to negotiate directly with him on relatively minor issues. Meetings between the Governor and the legislative leaders ''are filled with detailed trivialities,'' said an Assembly aide. ''It needlessly delays things.'' Mr. Davis, who has used a wheelchair since he was stricken with polio as a child, came to Albany with little experience in its politics, and this, too, has contributed to tensions, legislative officials said. They accused him of being disdainful of the kind of maneuvering that is essential here. Administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Davis was uncomfortable with some traditions of conducting government business in Albany, but denied that this had reduced his effectiveness. The Boss Praises Him In fact, they said, Mr. Davis's background - he had been a law clerk for the Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart and a partner at the New York City law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton - had allowed him to maintain distance from the political process. What legislative aides interpret as a disdain for politics, they said, is an unwillingness to compromise in what he believes is right. ''I am sure some people more used to politicians found him kind of a disparate element and kind of an unusual force to deal with,'' the Governor said. But Mr. Davis, the Governor said, ''is the best lawyer I've ever met.'' ''He is a lawyer in the finest professional sense,'' Mr. Cuomo added. Mr. Davis said he expected to eventually return to private practice, but not to sever his ties to government. Many of his predecessors have achieved prominence after leaving the Governor's office. They include Lawrence E. Walsh, the special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair, who was counsel to Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, and Robert MacCrate, the new president of the American Bar Association, who was counsel to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.

959-> U.S. STUDY FINDS FRAUD IN TOP RESEARCHER'S WORK ONMENTALLY RETARDED
One of the nation's most influential researchers in the field of mental retardation treatment has reported on experiments that were never carried out and published deliberately deceptive scientific papers, according to an investigative report by the Federal Government. The publications of the accused researcher, Dr. Stephen E. Breuning, a 34-year-old psychologist, have had a significant impact on drug treatments used to control the behavior of severely retarded patients in institutions throughout the country. In a telephone interview today, Dr. Breuning, the assistant facility director at the Polk Center, Pennsylvania's largest state institution for the mentally retarded, situated in Polk, Pa., charged that the experts on the Federal panel were ''completely wrong'' in contending that he had failed to conduct the research in question. He asserted that the panelists had ''predetermined notions'' of his guilt and held him to standards required of no other scientist. ''I was guilty until I could prove otherwise,'' he said. The Breuning case appears to be one of the most significant in a growing trickle of cases of fraudulent scientific studies that have come to public attention in recent years. Unlike many cases in which fraudulent research has affected only the research work of other scientists who have wasted time following false leads, Dr. Breuning's work has had great influence on the treatment of patients and on public policy. Reports Aided Reputation On the basis of the research reports that have now been judged fraudulent, Dr. Breuning, after only a few short years of work, ''achieved the status of a major worker in the field of mental retardation,'' the Federal report said. His deceptive reports not only had ''a significant impact'' on the entire field of study but also strongly influenced social policies for treating the mentally retarded, according to the study, which was released Friday. Some states, notably Connecticut, actually ''amended policies governing treatment practices'' in an effort to be consistent with Dr. Breuning's supposed findings, the report said. The investigation was carried out over the past two years by a panel of five distingiushed scientists appointed by the National Institute of Mental Health, a Federal agency that financed much of the research now in question. The panel was headed by Dr. Arnold J. Friedhoff, professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. The other members were Dr. C. Keith Conners, director of psychiatric research at the Children's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington; Dr. Richard I. Shader, chairman of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine; Dr. Herbert G. Vaughan Jr., professor of neuroscience at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Dr. Edward E. Zigler, professor of psychology at Yale University. The panel reached a ''unanimous conclusion'' that ''Stephen E. Breuning knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly engaged in misleading and deceptive practices in reporting results of research'' supported by the Government. Although significant studies were supposedly based on research that involved thousands of subjects, the panel said, ''only a few of the experimental subjects described in publications and progress reports were ever studied.'' The panel said its work was ''complicated by Dr. Bruening's shifting and often contradictory explanations'' of where various studies were supposedly carried out. The panel unanimously concluded that Breuning ''has engaged in serious scientific misconduct.'' Based on the panel's report, the Federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration has recommended that the Government bar Dr. Breuning from receiving grants or contracts from health agencies for 10 years. The agency has also recommended that the Justice Department consider prosecuting Dr. Breuning. The mental health agency will also send copies of the investigative report to Dr. Breuning's employer. Dr. Breuning said today that his lawyer would ask higher officials in the Department of Health and Human Services to review the his case and would explore whether there were other avenues of redress. 'A Shoddy Investigation' Dr. Breuning charged that the panel had conducted ''a shoddy investigation'' in which it reached conclusions after interviewing his accusers but well before interviewing him. He complained that a lengthy rebuttal he submitted had been included as an appendix but not given adequate attention in the body of the report. Dr. Breuning also said that the research findings he reported have not been disproved and that other scientists, in fact, had reproduced some of them. However, the Federal panel cited reports from other scientists who were unable to reproduce his findings. The core of Dr. Breuning's work has involved studies of drug treatments for the institutionalized mentally retarded who suffer from very high rates of emotional, behavioral and brain disorders. Often 30 to 50 percent of the patients in an institution are treated with drugs to reduce their aggressiveness or hyperactivity. The most commonly used drugs have traditionally been the neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs, sometimes called the major tranquilizers, but Dr. Breuning and others in the field have argued that lingering side effects make these drugs undesirable for many patients. Dr. Bruening contended that his research showed that stimulant drugs were often more effective and produced fewer side effects. That research has now been discredited, but what impact the panel's charge of fabrication of experiments will have on drug treatment for the severaly mentally retarded will have to be determined by the mental health authorities.

Murphy, chairman and president, said that ''a slight pickup in drilling activity and modest pricing improvement in some products areas'' contributed to the increase, with the company reporting lower losses in the oilfield services operations. Dresser said that revenue for the three months decreased 15.6 percent, to $750.4 million, from $889.4 million a year ago. A spokesman cited the recent formation of joint ventures between the company and the Ingersoll-Rand Company and Litton Industries. The company estimated that nearly $250 million in revenue was not included in the quarterly results this year because Dresser now holds a minority share in the partnerships.

963-> Excerpts From Agent's Testimony
Following are excerpts from testimony to the Iran-contra committees by Duane (Dewey) R. Clarridge, a Central Intelligence Agency official, as made public today by the committees. The committees, in releasing the testimony, left certain words blank. Officials have said the unidentified country under discussion in portions of the questioning by the committee was South Africa. MR. CLARRIDGE. The way I read this cable traffic and the way I remember it, somebody in the agency - I think, at least the Director - took away from that January meeting with [ deleted ] that they were offering assistance to the democratic resistance. Some of the cable traffic coming in from [ deleted ] after that meeting, after [ deleted ] had gone back, continued that fair that we were talking about [ deleted ] support for the democratic resistance. W. NEIL EGGLESTON, deputy chief counsel for the House committee. Cable No. [ deleted ] is a cable dated March 24, 1984. This is the cable that you claim makes it clear that [ deleted ] are not interested in assisting the contras? A. It tells here what they are - it states here what they are prepared to do. Q. And what it states is that they are prepared to provide training and equipment? And your explanation -- A. Just a minute. It says they are prepared to provide training and equipment. He foresees these being undertaken on a direct basis between [ deleted ] involved with C.I.A., offering behind-the-scenes advice, I guess, on where to plug in and what assistance would be truly useful. Q. But it is your testimony that the C.I.A. did not know what [ deleted ] they were talking about? A. I cannot speak for [ deleted ] whether he knew. All I know is that when I got to [ deleted ] and this issue came up and they raised it in the same context they were talking about one country or two countries, and we never could figure out what they were and they wouldn't tell us. We guessed that it was [ deleted ] . It could have been [ deleted ] . Q. But it is your testimony that assistance was only going to go to those countries, not to the contras? A. That is what I was told. Q. And when three days later Mr. Casey sends a memo to Mr. McFarlane indicating that the C.I.A. is exploring the possibility of obtaining assistance to the contras from [ deleted ] , that is just erroneous? A. It would seem so. Before I even made my trip, a decision was taken that we would not ask or, if offered, would not accept assistance from [ deleted ] for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN, Republican of Maine. Mr. Clarridge, how many languages do you speak? A. You ask at the current time? Q. How many have you spoken in the past? A. Really only two. Q. I am just curious, because one thing is evident from your record, that you are a highly skilled individual who obviously enjoys a good reputation with the intelligence community. It just struck me to the extent that you have some background in languages, it takes quite an exercise in memory, usually; and I was struck last evening in going through the depositions and I was, I must confess to you, I was going from points of laughter to points of despair as I read over the deposition itself. On practically every single major event that we have been considering, you have virtually no memory at all, and that whenever a question is directed toward you, you indicate well, it may be, I just can't recall. Q. O.K. You also indicated this morning that Colonel North would make representations to John Poindexter and Bud McFarlane and use your name when, in fact, he never spoke with you, is that correct? A. I'm saying that in that particular item that's what I think was going on. Q. But you indicated he had a habit? A. No. If I said he had a habit of doing it, I misspoke. I didn't say he had a habit. But there were on occasions - Q. You said he liked to toss your name around because it carried some weight? A. Yes. And I think he did. Q. What does that mean? A. That means he did toss my name around on occasions, saying this looked good or it looked bad. Q. Even though he had never spoken with you? A. Well, in that particular case he had never spoken to me.

966-> Heroes, and Stale Heroics
Last weekend's bloodless ouster of Tunisia's President-for-Life Habib Bourguiba was the final stanza of a sadly commonplace saga. When Tunisia wrested independence from France in 1956, Mr. Bourguiba was rightly acclaimed as liberator. But like the sampling of leaders shown above, he came to regard himself as permanently indispensable. How fortunate for America that George Washington said enough after eight years. In Tunisia, as elsewhere, there's always a reason. No one else is ready to take over, or the fragile new nation needs a unifying symbol; there's a foreign challenge or domestic crisis. Jealous liberators typically monopolize power and surround themselves with fawning courtiers. In Africa, admittedly, former colonial rulers sowed the way for post-colonial despotism by failing to encourage the development of an educated population ready to govern. The frequent result has been a vacuum filled by generals and colonels, often in complicity with civilians of leftist or populist political movements. But even where this was not the case, as in India, a single dynasty has largely monopolized power since independence in 1947. The cult of personality clings to North Korea's Kim Il Sung, as it did to China's Mao Zedong and does to Libya's Colonel Qaddafi. Fidel Castro has hoarded power for 29 years, having purged independent-minded rivals and put the armed forces under his brother, Raul. It's difficult, seeing pictures of the grizzled Mr. Castro in Moscow, to remember that he was once the young leader of a young revolution. For Cuban leftists, in Wordsworth's words, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, when but to be young was very heaven! Dawn has long since passed. As Mr. Castro, weighted with titles, heads into his late 60's, he looks like yet another caudillo. Compare him with Venezuela's Romulo Betancourt. He, too, could have reigned as liberator-for-life after the ouster of a tyrant in 1958. Instead he promoted a stable two-party system. The world is in his debt for showing that power need not corrupt, and that a true hero knows when, peacefully, to leave the stage.

968-> Eastern Air Eliminates 3,500 Jobs
Eastern Air Lines Inc., in a drastic move to cut costs, said yesterday that it would lay off 3,500 employees, or 9 percent of its payroll. About 1,000 workers in the Miami area will lose their jobs, about 700 in Atlanta and about 400 in the New York region. Those to be laid off will begin receiving notices today, with most losing their jobs by the end of the month. The reductions are the most severe action yet taken by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, Eastern's parent company, since he assumed control of the subsidiary last fall. In September 1986, the carrier cut 1,500 jobs, mostly in management. 'Essential' Reductions Phil Bakes, the president of Eastern, warned that the long-term answer to Eastern's problems was for the unions to agree to lower labor costs. ''These cost reductions, painful as they are, are absolutely essential in our current environment,'' Mr. Bakes said. ''The long-term answer to Eastern's problems is a revamped cost structure.'' The union officials could not be reached for comment yesterday. Most of the layoffs, however, will not come from the union ranks but from such nonunion classifications as administrative and clerical. Some jobs will be lost among the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in such lesser-skilled jobs as baggage handlers, cleaners and stock clerks. Struggles With 3 Unions Eastern has its hub, its headquarters and a large maintenance base in Miami and a hub in Atlanta. In the New York area, Eastern has operations at La Guardia Airport, from where it flies its shuttle to Washington, at Kennedy International Airport and at Islip, L.I. The company also has local offices in Newark. Mr. Bakes, who helped turn Continental Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary, into a formidable competitor after Mr. Lorenzo gained control, has been struggling with Eastern's main unions - the pilots, the machinists and the flight attendants. Most recently, the carrier has been involved in a dispute over safety with its pilots' union, which contends that the airline is skimping on the maintenance of its planes. The company denies the charge. Eastern has said that some of its pilots have been involved in a slowdown and said that the protest was a reason for Eastern's loss of $67.4 million in the third quarter. The loss came when most other carriers showed high profits from increased summer traffic. Losses of $72.8 Million Texas Air, the parent company, had a loss of $72.8 million in the third quarter, with Contintental showing a loss of $10.2 million. Michael Derchin, an airline analyst with the First Boston Corporation, said the cuts were to save money and to send a warning to the unions. ''This gives labor a message,'' he added. ''If you engage in slowdowns and other things that cause big losses, we will take action.'' Eastern's mechanics are not expected to lose jobs because the company said it would keep its annual $500 million maintenance budget intact even though it now has fewer aircraft than a year ago. The pilots and the flight attendants are also not expected to lose jobs. The machinists' union is Eastern's largest, with 13,000 members and a contract that expires Dec. 31. The company has proposed deep cuts in pay for unskilled workers and smaller reductions for mechanics. But Charles E. Bryan, the president of District Lodge 100 of the union, has so far kept his union from making concessions. The pilots and the flight attendants made concessions early last year. Shrinking the Airline Talks have been going on, but the two sides are far apart. Eastern, in its announcement yesterday, said the union's response to cutting the pay of unskilled workers was to propose a $10-an-hour increase that would bring baggage handlers' salaries up to $26 an hour. Some analysts believe that the current layoffs are part of an overall strategy by Mr. Lorenzo to drastically reduce Eastern's size unless the unions accept more concessions. One analyst, who asked not to be indentified, said that Mr. Lorenzo might push the machinists' union into a strike, after which he would greatly shrink the carrier and operate flights with Continental's crews and those Eastern employees who accept his terms. Eastern's management has already tried to shrink the airline's size. The company sold 19 planes this year and has reduced its fleet to 275 aircraft. The airline is flying about 10 percent fewer available seat-miles, a measure of capacity, in the fourth quarter than in a similar period last year. Continental has improved its performance and Eastern had an on-time arrival rate of 80.4 percent in September, indicating a big decrease in cancellations. The on-time rate was one of the better performances in the industry.

969-> Europeans Are Amused By Moral Stance in U.S.
The cultural chasm that sometimes seems to separate the United States and Europe has widened a bit as the scrutiny of American public figures pushes deeper into the most intimate corners of their personal lives. The collapse of Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg's Supreme Court nomination in a wisp of marijuana smoke has provoked a fresh round of incredulous head-shaking from London to Moscow over the exacting moral yardsticks that are being applied to Americans seeking high public office. And now that same spotlight seems certain to be turned on the background of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy, President Reagan's latest choice for the Supreme Court, who was nominated today. ''It's funny to learn that several years ago somebody tried marijuana, because almost everybody tried it -some admitted it, some didn't,'' said Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry. ''It's amusing, but a kind of hypocrisy is present here.'' An American moralistic streak ''effectively kills one candidate after another,'' Mr. Gerasimov said in an interview. ''Besides being amusing it's also disappointing in that the real issues your country faces are not being discussed. But superficial issues - who slept with whom and when - are discussed.'' Seeming Self-Censorship There seems little danger that the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, will intrude into the bedrooms or marijuana-smoking sessions of Soviet politicians. But in non-Communist Europe, with the exception of Britain, the private lives of politicians are also generally regarded as sacrosanct, and the press tends to censor itself rather than write about love affairs or instances of homosexuality that are well known. A seeming recent exception is Greece, where Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's affair with a 33-year-old former airline hostess has been given considerable publicity. Yet there has been no suggestion that the 68-year-old Prime Minister, who is married, should resign, and many Greek journalists say their papers aired the affair because Mr. Papandreou neglected official business to go on a cruise with the woman, and because the foreign press gave the matter dense coverage. In 1983, when it was disclosed that Mr. Papandreou had an illegitimate child in Sweden, some Greek commentators suggested that the news would enhance rather than harm his electoral fortunes since it would be seen as a demonstration of sexual prowess. 'Haunted by Myth' in France Commenting on American attitudes, Francois Caviglioli argued in the weekly Nouvel Observateur that the French not only condone the sexual peccadilloes of their leaders but actually relish learning about them. ''It is not a simple indulgence, but patriotic pride,'' wrote Mr. Caviglioli, who maintained that the French were ''haunted by the myth of their sexual superiority.'' A senior French official, evoking the case of former Senator Gary Hart's relationship with Donna Rice, said: ''No one is going to reproach a politician if he sleeps with a pretty woman. But the French do not like their politicians to be divorced.'' The official was a man, but, in another office in Paris, a woman who also holds a top governmental position echoed that viewpoint. In Italy, America's focus on its leaders' private lives is covered by press and television as farce, laced with more serious concern about whether the United States will be able to furnish vigorous leadership to match Mr. Gorbachev. It is a widely voiced worry in Western Europe. ''And what about us?'' asked Fernanda Pivano, a translator and professor of American literature in Rome. ''What are we to do about war, inflation, unemployment, lack of housing, AIDS, hunger, while the big shots of America are playing 'who's a good boy and who's a bad boy' over a mere case of pot?'' A Voice of Support Yet one can hear occasional praise for the seemingly more stringent moral standards demanded of American politicians. In Hamburg, West Germany, Hans Friedrichs, a television anchorman who lived for a long time in the United States, said, ''The tradition of scrutinizing the politician is a very necessary and important one.'' ''Morality is something a lot of German politicians do not seem to have,'' added Mr. Friedrichs. ''But morality is not prudery, that is another aspect of American life I am more ambiguous about.'' Britain in some respects shares what other Europeans sometimes label an ''Anglo-Saxon'' puritanical impulse that has halted a number of political careers in the United Kingdom. The British popular press is currently obsessed with the health of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. But in its lead editorial Tuesday, The Independent of London blamed the American press for placing the United States ''in the grip of a highly selective and deeply destructive moralism.'' ''This sort of muckraking, which likes to pass as investigative journalism, is fast becoming a bar to candidacy for higher office,'' the newspaper said. A different view was offered by David Boddy, a lobbyist and former staff member in the Conservative Party. America's fierce scrutiny of its politicians, he said, ''will certainly give people reason to pause before they enter the fray, but it won't stop many. The attraction of power is just too great.'' ''And at the end of the day,'' he concluded, ''you may possibly get a better quality of leadership because of the moral crusade.''

970-> Deaths of Dolphins Along Eastern Shore Linked to Bacteria
Common bacteria normally found in coastal waters have recently become lethal to the bottle-nosed dolphins that swim and feed along the shore from Virginia to New Jersey, a marine pathologist said today. However, Dr. Frank R. Geraci, the leader of a team of scientists investigating the deaths of hundreds of dolphins since July 1, added that the scientists did not know what was weakening the dolphins and making them susceptible to bacteria they usually ''live in harmony with.'' Dr. Geraci said the search for what weakens the dolphins, possibly a virus, a biological toxin, man-made pollution or an immunological disorder, would continue. ''We'll be in this area as long as required to unravel the mystery,'' he said, adding that he expected to have more to say in another week or two when the results of viral studies at a number of laboratories were completed. The bacteria blamed for the deaths include streptococci and a large number of Vibrio bacteria that the animals usually carry in their systems and that are found in the ocean. These bacteria normally do not cause the high rate of mortality among dolphins noted this summer. Each year, about a dozen dolphins are found washed ashore on beaches between New Jersey and Virginia. This year the toll is 203, and scientists believe hundreds more have died offshore. The bacterial infection, called septicemia, has attacked the vascular systems of dolphins coming ashore in Virginia, Dr. Geraci said. This has caused cerebral hemorrhaging and a leaking of blood from veins into the chest and abdominal cavities. The loss of blood to the skin is responsible for the phenomenon that puzzled the scientists for a time, the sloughing off of the skin, Dr. Geraci said. ''It came off like Saran Wrap,'' he said. The disease also caused ''profound changes'' in the dolphins' internal organs, he said. There is some difference in the symptoms exhibited by the dolphins dying off New Jersey. These animals show less evidence of hemorrhaging and they appear to have died more quickly, but Dr. Geraci said they were all dying from bacterial infections. ''If we can find a point source of the problem, perhaps we can do something to control it,'' Dr. Geraci said. ''If we don't find a source, we may eventually have to conclude it is part of a cyclical pattern, something we may see again in the next hundred years.'' Wider Threats Discounted Dr. Geraci, who talked to reporters at an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the work thus far had convinced him that the problem affected only dolphins and did not threaten other marine life. Dr. Geraci and those working in New Jersey on the problem, like Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, have received dozens of telephone calls as a result of the dolphin deaths from people concerned about possible health risks from swimming in offshore waters. Dr. Geraci said today that he was ''not unduly concerned'' that the dolphin disease would affect humans. ''We have been handling the sick dolphins, and while we take the usual precautions when dealing with any diseased animal, there is nothing we have found that is harmful to humans,'' he said. One important unanswered question, he said, is whether the dolphins, who travel in extended family groups, are spreading the disease to one another or if they are all being affected individually by some undetected factor in the offshore environment. Lung Bacterium Isolated Dr. Douglas Roscoe, a New Jersey state pathologist, was the first to isolate a bacterium from the lungs of a dolphin that was alive when it was beached in Delaware last month. He said that although the bacterium could have caused the bronchial pneumonia that he found, he did not believe it was the primary cause of death and has continued to search for evidence of an influenza-type virus. Dr. Geraci likened the large number of dolphin deaths this year to an outbreak of an influenza-type virus that killed a large number of harbor seals in Boston and the Cape Cod area in 1979 and 1980. Dr. Roscoe has sent tissue samples to the United States Department of Agriculture laboratory at Plum Island, L.I.,; the United States Fish and Wildlife Service laboratory in Madison, Wis., and the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis for testing. In addition, the office of the New Jersey Medical Examiner tested brain tissues from the Delaware dolphin for five chemical contaminants - hexane, xylene, methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride - after reports of an offshore chemical spill, but the tests were negative. Tissue and Blood Tested Dr. Geraci, a renowned marine pathologist who is professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Guelph in Ontario, has sent tissue and blood samples for testing to the Department of Agriculture laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and to the Eastern Virginia Medical College. He said his team of scientists, who come from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Smithsonian Institution and the Marine Mammal Commission, was also seeking some explanation for the ulcers found in the mouths of the dolphins, something not explained by the bacterial infections. Dr. Geraci had estimated earlier that there were about 1,400 dolphins in the waters from New Jersey to Virginia when the outbreak began and that the number dying from the disease represented a significant percentage of the population. Today, he was less sure about the size of the offshore population, adding that aerial flights along the coast would begin this week to count the dolphins and chart their movements. Tests of offshore waters are also planned as are a wider range of tests of dolphin tissue for specific pollutants and microbes. Thus far, the scientists have ruled out pesticides and contamination by heavy metals as contributing factors to the animals' infections, he said.

971-> Dual Role Reported for Blood Protein
A discovery that may suggest a surprising and unexpected contributor to coronary heart disease was reported yesterday by scientists of Genentech Inc., a biotechnology company, and the University of Chicago. They now suspect that a protein that has been linked to the development of heart disease accelerates the development of the fatty plaques by migrating to the site where a new blood clot is forming and contributing to clot formation. The research suggests what may prove to be the long-sought link between blood clot formation and the fatty substances that contribute to heart attacks. One of the substances known to be linked to heightened risk of heart disease has been found to be a close chemical relative of one of the body's substances for dissolving blood clots. Studies Show Heightened Risk The research focused on apolipoprotein(a), one of several proteins incorporated in fatty particles that carry cholesterol through the bloodsteam. Apolipoprotein(a) is the protein constituent of larger particles called lipoprotein(a). At least a dozen studies have shown that people who have high levels of lipoprotein(a) in their blood have greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Analyzing apolipoprotein(a), scientists of the biotechnology company were surprised to find that it bore a close chemical resemblance to plasminogen, one of the key substances in the body's complex natural system for dissolving blood clots. In the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein, it was 90 percent similar to plasminogen, said Dr. Richard M. Lawn of the biotechnology company. He said the finding carried the strong inference that the lipoprotein and plasminogen may have similar functions. One possibility, he said, is that the lipoprotein may be attracted to blood clots and damaged areas of blood vessels, become attached at those points and contribute to the atherosclerotic plaques that lead to heart attacks. 'May Provide Long-Sought Link' The report was published in the current issue of the journal Nature. ''These dramatic findings may provide the long-sought link between lipoproteins and the clotting system,'' said a commentary in the same issue of Nature by Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein who won a Nobel Prize in 1985 for research on the chemistry underlying heart disease. Scientists of Genentech said their studies suggested that plasminogen and apolipoprotein(a) evolved from a common ancestral protein about 40 million years ago. They said the basic function of apoliprotein(a) may be to help promote wound healing. The protein molecule incorporates 37 copies of a sequence of about 100 amino acids that has been named a kringle because its structure reminded scientists of a pretzel-shaped Danish cake. There is evidence that the kringle formation helps the lipoprotein to attach to fibrin, a key substance in the formation of blood clots. The presence of many copies of this structure might strengthen the tendency of apolipoprotein(a) to attach to clots. Seen as Having Inhibiting Effect Because of its similarity to plasminogen, the lipoprotein may attach to newly forming clots. But because it is different from plasminogen, it may contribute to their stability. The lipoprotein particles also bring to the site the fatty substances that are known to be constituents of the atherosclerotic plaques that lead to coronary heart disease. In addition, the presence of the lipoprotein might prevent plasminogen from adhering to the site of clot formation and exerting its clot dissolving influence. Authors of the report in addition to Dr. Lawn are Drs. John W. McLean, James E. Tomlinson, Wun-Jing Kuang, Dan. L. Eaton and Ellson Y. Chen of Genentech and Drs. Gunther M. Fless and Angelo M. Scanu of University of Chicago. Dr. McLean said the collaboration brought together the biotechnology company's expertise in molecular biology and gene cloning with the University of Chicago scientists' extensive knowledge of the blood protein. Drs. Scanu and Fless had succeeded in purifying the protein and the scientists at Genentech used samples of this material in working out the complete amino acid sequence of the protein, finding the gene that produces the protein and cloning that gene - producing it in the laboratory in large quantity for study. In their commentary, Drs. Brown and Goldstein of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, said the mechanism by which the lipoprotein accelerated atherosclerosis was still obscure but that the new report offered ''a tantalizing clue.'' They described apolipoprotein(a) as ''a deformed relative of plasminogen'' that might, when present in excessive amounts, distort the normal body chemistry that keeps a complex balance between formation and dissolution of blood clots.

Walter F. Thomas, a retired vice chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, died of cardiac arrest Nov. 7 in a nursing home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 77 years old and lived in Boca Raton. Mr. Thomas, who worked in the banking industry for more than four decades, retired as vice chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover in 1974 and as a director in 1976. A native of Plainfield, N.J., he graduated from Princeton University in 1931 and began his banking career that year, joining what was then the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. In World War II he served in the Navy. Afterward, he rejoined the bank, where he became a vice president in 1948 and senior vice president in 1957. With the merger of the Hanover Bank and the Manufacturers Trust in 1961, he was named head of operations of the combined banks. In 1963 he became executive vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and in 1970 was named vice chairman and a director. He is survived by his wife, Jeanne; two sons, Roger, of West Windsor, N.J., and Walter Jr., of Mendham, N.J.; a sister, Harriet Miller of Short Hills, N.J., and five grandchildren.

975-> Designers Work On Bellevue Rooms
DEBORAH QUINTAL designs interiors for country clubs and grand Manhattan apartments. Bonnie Roche, an architect, rebuilds rooms for clients like Paloma Picasso. And Richard Knapple coordinates lavish settings for Bloomingdale's. But for months they and 25 other New York designers have volunteered their efforts to redesign rooms at the Bellevue Hospital Center in New York, the country's oldest public hospital. More than $300,000 was raised for the first set of rooms at a benefit held in SoHo Monday night. Renderings of each room were on display during the gala, which was held in the Puck Building. The project is called ''Operation: Room Design,'' and it is a joint effort by the designers and the Bellevue Hospital Association. It is expected that the rooms will be completed in the spring. ''There is a strong link between Bellevue and New Yorkers and AIDS care and therefore a strong desire on our part to help in the way we know best,'' said Paul Schmitt, the creative director of L'Oreal, who is redesigning a day room for AIDS patients. ''The design community has been decimated by AIDS and I think most designers are welcoming the opportunity to do something in and for a hospital.'' The project is the idea of Rebecca Lambert, president of the Bellevue Hospital Association, and John Curran, a designer with Curran Humes Inc. in Manhattan who is a member of the hospital's board of directors. ''If a hospital can offer such excellent care, there's no reason why it has to be so scary and sterile,'' Mr. Curran said. The 250-year-old hospital cares for the largest number of AIDS patients in the city. Mr. Curran began looking for designers this summer, while the association chose 32 hospital rooms to be redecorated, including critical-care waiting rooms, maternity waiting rooms, patient day rooms and therapeutic activity rooms. Some designers have volunteered to redecorate more than one room. Ms. Lambert picked names and room assignments in a random drawing from a doctor's bag. The designers were given guidelines by the hospital, as well as a budget for each room. The redesign of critical-care waiting rooms could cost no more than $7,000 each; patient day rooms $12,000; maternity waiting rooms and therapeutic activity rooms $16,000. Designers could make the rooms as imaginative as they wanted as long as they followed hospital regulations, which included using seating with easy access from wheelchairs and fire-retardant materials. They could not do any actual reconstruction of rooms. ''When you got your room assignment, I think there was a tendency to think, well, how do you design a room for a patient afflicted with AIDS?'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''I wanted to make the room feel like a holiday, a wonderful place to be.'' Formerly a counselor at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Mr. Schmitt said he had been visiting AIDS patients at various city hospitals. He decided to make his room exotic; the walls will be a bright shiny green, with couches in a green print forest pattern. Plants will be placed in corners between the couches and walls. Before the project began, Richard Olsen, the director of environmental design at Bellevue and an environmental psychologist, studied the flow of patients from their beds to day rooms, where they can read or talk to other patients. He also observed families spending long hours in the hospital's waiting rooms. Dr. Olsen and his staff learned that few patients leave their rooms because the day rooms are so dreary. Families waiting for patients having operations spend the vigil in boxlike, windowless cubicles. When Mrs. Quintal, a partner in the design firm of Kisner Gutlon Quintal in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., first walked into her assigned room, a day room for patients recovering from neurological ailments, she saw four bare beige walls and hard plastic couches. ''But there was this fabulous panoramic view of the East River, so we decided to keep the water theme rampant in the redesign,'' she said. ''Water is calming and we wanted to think of happy water scenes.'' The room is divided into private areas for quiet conversation and a section with two tables - high enough for wheelchairs to fit under - for game playing. Posters designed by David Hockney feature different angles of swimming pools, with alluring hues of blue water and sky. And a bowl with goldfish will sit on a table in the center of the room. ''I think being gimmicky and having a subtle sense of humor can only help the situation,'' said Lee Stout, who is redecorating a maternity waiting room. Pictures of birds adorn the walls of the room he is redesigning; the last illustration is that of two proud parents beaming at a baby bird. ''It's the kind of thing you just don't expect to see in a hospital,'' Mr. Stout said, ''and that's precisely why I did it.''

977-> Simon, Now a Credible Candidate, Still Faces an Issue of Electability
Almost giddy from his poll numbers and his crowds as he campaigns across Iowa, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois has clearly crossed a major threshold of political credibility in the race for the Democratic nomination for President. No longer does he hear himself described as ''an extremely long shot'' candidate, he declared here Monday, still basking in the glow of a first place finish in the latest Iowa Poll, published Sunday in The Des Moines Register. But Mr. Simon's campaign now faces another, perhaps more formidable challenge: rebutting the charge that the candidate is too liberal, too closely associated with the party's traditional programs and priorities, to prevail in a general election. After losing four out of the last five Presidential elections, Democrats are achingly eager to nominate a winner, politicians say. So the electability issue looms large for all the Democratic candidates, beginning here in Iowa, scene of the first Presidential caucuses on Feb. 8. ''I think electability this time around is probably a bigger issue than taxes or arms control,'' said Phil Roeder, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. ''Among the most active Democrats in Texas, electability is the key issue,'' said Bob Slagle, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. Rival's Aide Sees Vulnerability Mr. Simon's critics assert he is particularly vulnerable on that front. ''He's defined himself as the Roosevelt-Truman candidate for President,'' said William Carrick, campaign manager for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. ''There are a lot of people in a lot of different areas who see that as a problem; that if you're looking backward, trying to recapture the past, you're not going to be able to face the future and win the election.'' Indeed, Mr. Simon began his campaign in defiance of the conventional wisdom, offering himself as the traditional Democrat in a field populated by candidates trying to re-position and re-define the party after its defeat in 1984. While many Democratic politicians shied away from talk of new spending programs, Mr. Simon has campaigned heavily on the need for a new, $8 billion-a-year jobs program and he talks expansively of initiatives on education and health care. ''When people identify me as a Harry Truman Democrat or a Hubert Humphrey Democrat, I say, ''You bet,' '' Mr. Simon told a group of Iowans at the Chief Mahaska Restaurant in Oskaloosa Monday. Simon's Fiscal Conservatism But Simon campaign strategists, who have developed an extensive rebuttal to the electability charge, argue that the traditional appeals and the ambitious domestic programs are just part of the Simon package. Mr. Simon has a strong record of fiscal conservatism, they argue, noting his support for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. They say his 1984 Senate victory over an incumbent, Charles H. Percy, achieved during a Reagan landslide, shows his ability to attract conservative and Republican voters. In addition, according to Terry Michael, the campaign's press secretary, after seven years of President Reagan, ''voters want a more activist use of the tools of government, not a big spending activist, not a big taxing activist, but a candidate who can creatively use the tools of government.'' Mr. Simon's strategists also assert that, like Mr. Reagan, their candidate has a personal appeal that transcends ideology or positions on issues. Indeed, some of the Iowans who turned out to see Mr. Simon this week seemed largely drawn by his character. 'He's Mr. Clean' ''I'm a fairly conservative Democrat, but I'm going to support him,'' said Dale West, a farmer from Grand River, Iowa. ''I think he's Mr. Clean. He's from the Middle West, and I think he knows what it's all about.'' Still, some Democrats argue that Mr. Simon has run a campaign fashioned for Iowa's older, comparatively liberal caucus-goers, but that the strategy will play less well among the broader electorate. And his success in Iowa so far appears likely to touch off debate over this state's influence in the nominating process. ''The key dynamic in the process still seems to be Iowa,'' said Al From, executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that has been trying to spur interest and participation in the March 8 series of primaries and caucuses that will be held throughout the South. ''And Paul Simon seems in many respects the perfect candidate for Iowa,'' Mr. From added. But Mr. Roeder, the Iowa Democratic spokesman, counters that Iowans are keenly sensitive to such criticism and are paying close attention to the electability issue. ''We don't want to screw up,'' Mr. Roeder said. In the South, where much of the Democratic anxiety over electability is based, Mr. Simon is only slightly known, several Democrats in the region said. ''He doesn't have much of an image in Texas now, and what image he has is of a liberal,'' said Mr. Slagle, the Texas Democratic chairman. ''Which is difficult for us to deal with, given our population.'' As for Mr. Simon, he appeared comfortable that he could turn back the charge. ''I go through it every election,'' he said. There was a price to pay for leading the pack in Iowa, Mr. Simon told reporters in Des Moines on Monday, one day after the release of the Iowa Poll of 330 Iowans who said they would definitely or probably attend the Democratic caucuses. That poll, which has a margin of sampling error of 5.4 percentage points, found Mr. Simon in first place with 24 percent, followed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts with 18 percent. ''You're going to be the target a little more,'' said. ''But given the choice, I'd rather be the front-runner and be a target a little bit.''

978-> SOME DISSIDENTS FEAR CHURCH HAS REJECTED SOLIDARITY
IN a roundtable discussion published in Tygodnik Mazowsze, the most popular of Solidarity's underground publications, a group of social activists discussed this week's visit to Poland of Pope John Paul II with a sadness bordering, in some cases, on rejection. In the view of some of them, the plans for the Pope's homecoming, as worked out by officials of the Government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, reflect the church's withdrawal from, if not abandonment of, the outlawed Solidarity union. Some participants in the roundtable complained that parish priests have been urging people not to bring Solidarity placards and insignia to public gatherings, because Polish television had agreed for the first time to show the crowds attracted by the Pope - on the condition that no political symbols are displayed. Others said that in Lodz, Poland's second largest city, women workers who will meet the Pope were selected from the most docile and party-dominated factory. John Paul is also to meet with Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, but apparently will not have discussions with other opposition figures, in contrast to the kind of bold meetings he held in April with dissidents in Chile. And when the Pope visits the grave of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the pro-Solidarity priest murdered by the secret police, crowds and cameras are to be barred. Some Solidarity supporters have concluded that the Polish church is using the papal visit to signal an end to the Solidarity epoch. Some priests around Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate, agree that the church is trying to re-establish its traditional neutrality and aloofness. Such neutrality, however, would probably be more damaging to a weak and fragmented Solidarity than to a Government that has been slowly regaining foreign contacts and turning public hostility into indifference. A member of the national Catholic Intellectuals Club was quoted in the Solidarity weekly as saying that the church's behavior reminded him of criticisms of the Vatican during World War II. Then, he said, ''one could ask how much could it truly help the suffering nations of Europe, but it was hard not to notice that its foremost concern was to prevent the bombardment of its churches in Rome.'' It was understandable that the church has to pursue and protect its institutional interests, he added, ''but when these interests are too divorced from other social issues, this has to raise doubts.'' Another participant in the roundtable, identified only as a writer, said that the church's attempts to distance itself, while painful, were instructive. ''One of the great tragedies of Solidarity,'' he said, ''was its belief that Poland is different from any place else and that here the church testifies fully to the truth without taking political conditions into account.'' He added the ''hope'' that the Pope's visit will ''mark the close of an epoch when political and social obligations were ceded to a church which could not fulfill them.'' Even during the heyday of Solidarity, influential voices in the Polish church warned that its objectives were ''sub specie eternitatis'' - of an eternal nature -and that they could not be subordinated to either the Government or any social movement. The leading proponent of this view has been Cardinal Glemp, who at times has chastised young priests for their activism, even banishing some to rural parishes. Arrayed against the Cardinal are many priests who believe that the church has an obligation to shield the forces that are challenging the prerogatives of atheistic Communist rulers. Tygodnik Mazowsze, the underground paper, quoted the Catholic intellectual club member as saying that despite the Primate's distaste for allying the church with social and political militants, many young priests are encouraging their parishioners to act in political opposition. Last week, Mr. Walesa and other top leaders of Solidarity met in a Warsaw church with priests, Catholic lay activists, artists, writers and lawyers. More than 60 people signed a statement calling for restoration of national sovereignty and democracy. Polish church leaders, meanwhile, are carefully avoiding political characterizations. They say the Pope will emphasize individual recommitment to religious and moral life and will call upon Poles to be better husbands and wives, give up alcohol and take greater pride in their work. However, such appeals to work more effectively have an unmistakable political dimension since the Government, too, has been urging workers to work harder and curb their demands for higher wages. ''The Pope will have to make it clear that in calling for greater commitments by workers he is not simply backing the Government,'' said a worker in a tractor factory who still identifies with Solidarity. ''Of course, he will have to ask workers to make sacrifices because they are the only ones who can bring Poland out of the mess it is in. But I am sure that, like every Pole, he knows which leaders and which system is responsible for the mess, and in one way or another he will tell us that, too.'

981-> Talking; Co-ops
BUYERS shopping for cooperative apartments often are surprised to learn that some co-op corporations own their buildings, but not the land on which they stand. In some cases, these landless co-ops are conversions of rental buildings that had been erected on leased land. When the co-op was set up, the land owner was not willing to sell. In other cases, the sponsor owned the land and the building, but was unwilling to give up the land at the time of conversion, believing it to be an investment worth retaining. This happened a year ago when the Rudin family, which owns many Manhattan properties, converted a 344-unit rental apartment house at 2 Fifth Avenue into a co-op. ''New York land is increasingly hard to come by,'' explained Eric Rudin, vice president of Rudin Management. There are about 50 such leasehold co-ops around Manhattan, brokers say, and one or two new ones are created each year. The majority are prewar buildings on the East Side and in Greenwich Village. The land leases run for terms of 30 to 90 years. This raises a host of concerns for anyone considering one of these apartments, as an outsider buying a resale unit or as a tenant buying into a conversion. For example, will the value remain as strong as in a freehold co-op that owns the land, or does the value sag as the term of the lease runs down? Are such units harder to sell? And what might happen when the land lease expires? When it comes to carrying costs are the tax deductions lessened? Will maintenance charges escalate as the land rent rises during the term of the lease? And does the ground rent add much to monthly costs? Unfortunately, there are no blanket answers to many of these questions. That is why lawyers say it is vital for buyers to review all the provisions of a land lease before making a decision. But some generalized answers may be given. All other things being equal, leasehold units normally take longer to sell and command prices about 10 percent lower, said Doris Benedek, a broker with Douglas Elliman-Haldenstein. But if a building has particularly lovely apartments, that advantage may equalize prices. Misgivings also seem to lessen if the land lease is long. After giving the co-op corporation at 2 Fifth Avenue a 150-year lease on the underlying land, the Rudin family sold 60 percent of the units, far more than expected, according to David Clurman, the lawyer who represented tenants in the conversion. Owners are paying an average of $1,855 a year toward the ground rent. A booming market also washes away differences. Mr. Clurman said that during the 70's he did a study of leasehold co-ops in Florida and found that in a strong market there was virtually no difference in value and salability. But as soon as the market softened, demand for leasehold units went into a tailspin. Co-ops with short leases - anything less than 40 years - also seem to erode in value since lenders are uneasy about giving full-term mortgages on these units. FOR the risk taker, however, such units may provide a splendid buying opportunity. Some of these co-ops have succeeded in buying out the landowners, hoping to increase the value and salability of units, although at a substantial cost. The shareholders at 433 East 56th Street did such a deal recently when they purchased the land under their building from Northwest Airlines Pension Trust for $2.7 million. The money for the buyout was raised by a special assessment, with shareholders paying about $50,000 each to cover the cost, according to Howard Kutner, who owns a unit in the building. In other cases, the buyout may be financed with a mortgage. An offer is most likely to be accepted if the land lease offers the owner only a minimal return for many years. ''If you can show a landlord that he could get a better return elsewhere it could be a persuasive point,'' Mr. Clurman said. If, however, it looks as if the landowner wants to retain his investment for many years, the buyer should make sure the lease terms do not allow for a dramatic rise in rent at any time in the near future, said Lewis Taishoff, a lawyer who has been involved in a number of conversions. For example, some leases have escalator clauses based on the appraised value of the land, with a review every decade or so. Buyers should also make sure the lease does not give the landowner too much control over structural changes, he added. Conversion is often an ideal moment to try to renegotiate the terms of a land lease, according to Mr. Clurman, and a tenants' committee should make such terms a priority item. If the sponsor owns the land it may be possible to obtain the land even if he had initially been unwilling to let it go. Mr. Clurman said he managed to accomplish this for tenants in an East Midtown building about two years ago after he learned that the sponsor, who had heavy commitments elsewhere, needed the cash. New residents will find that maintenance charges do not include as large a portion of tax-deductible costs as in freehold co-ops. For instance, the portion of the real-estate taxes being paid by the co-op on the value of the land will not be deductible because the land tax is being paid on behalf of someone else. (Most land leases require the lessee, rather than the owner, to pay those taxes.) The ground rent is also not deductible, unlike the interest payments that would be paid on a mortgage covering the cost of the land. The likelihood of the building's being claimed by the land owner at the expiration of the lease is regarded as slim. ''There are no ironclad protections,'' Mr. Clurman said. ''The land owner had the right to do what he wants to do at the end of the lease.'' But the expectation is that either a new lease or a sale of the land will be negotiated with the co-op corporation. That is what usually happens when leases on land under commercial buildings expire. Moreover, if a landowner tried to take back a co-op building, a political or judicial solution would probably be worked out, as recently happened in Hawaii where vast acres of land had for centuries been owned by a handful of families and leased out. In that case, homeowners were given the right to buy out their land leases at fair market value after the case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court in 1984.

982-> Careers; Partying May Help in Finding a Job
FOR thousands of recently dismissed employees in the Wall Street area and elsewhere, the holidays will be grim. But partying might help raise their spirits, according to outplacement experts. Outplacement companies, paid by the employers who are making the layoffs or doing the dismissing, provide office space, psychological and vocational testing, resume preparation, advice on interviewing and other support during the search for jobs. Outplacement is also intended to mitigate the bitterness of the dismissed workers, lessening the chance of lawsuits. Such leading outplacement firms as Drake Beam Morin Inc. and Right Associates have been hired to provide outplacement for many workers on Wall Street, often on a group basis. Right now is a good time for a job search, odd though that might sound, outplacement experts said. Despite the bleak feelings of those out of work, holiday parties provide a chance to meet people, talk frankly about the job loss and learn of new opportunities. Andrew Sherwood, who heads Goodrich & Sherwood, a management recruiting and outplacement firm, said Christmas parties brought people together ''in a positive manner'' that could lead to networking. ''There are always job opportunities for people with the right skills and experience,'' he said. The trick is finding an opening that will fit what the person has to offer. Friends and acquaintances cannot help unless they know the person needs a job. And that sad news can be passed along informally through parties. There is also what might be called the ''musical chair'' activity in the job market at year-end. Many employees wait until the Christmas bonus is awarded before changing jobs or announcing retirement. And companies often wait until year-end to announce dismissals. So those who have lost their jobs, and those who worry that they might, ought to start their hunting during the holiday season. ''Don't put your search into neutral during the holidays,'' Mr. Sherwood advised. ''It may be the best time to look for a job.'' Other outplacement firms concur that December and January are good months to hunt for jobs. John A. Artise, an independent career consultant who works for outplacement firms, observed of this time of year: ''Company personnel departments are into the test-market mode, trying to find out what type of people are available - people who solicit them directly and for whom they do not have to go through management recruiting firms.'' Many personnel departments hire directly when they can because recruiting firms are expensive. Psychology, too, is involved, because at this time of year there is less competition for jobs, just because so few people know that the holiday period provides good job hunting. Long an exponent of late-in-the-year and January job searches, James E. Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. in Chicago believes that there will be more corporate hiring in January than for the rest of the next year. ''January hiring is on average 15 percent higher than any other month of a year,'' he said. ''Job seekers should get interviews now to win a new job next year.'' In the case of securities brokers, the outlook is bad for similar jobs in the same field, he said. But that is an exception, he added, and some account executives and brokers are finding jobs at other firms in instances when they can take customers' accounts with them. Noting that most brokers are good salesmen, Mr. Challenger said, ''If they present themselves in terms of selling abilities, they can appeal to a broader spectrum of employers.'' The obvious reason is that most companies need a strong sales staff. Since job seekers learn to improve interview techniques as they gain experience, he urged that they ''save the best job prospects they have until they have sharpened their interviewing abilities.'' Mr. Challenger also recommended that job seekers stress how they can help a particular company and avoid giving the impression that they expect the company to take pity and hire them. He urged that, at the end of an interview, every applicant make sure the interviewer knows that he or she is interested in the job. It can always be turned down later, but receiving a job offer can be a psychological lift to anyone's spirits.

983-> THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER
TRYING to reach someone at Turner-Hall Publishing the other day, I was greeted by one of those now ubiquitous answering machines that parrots a lengthy pre-beep preamble about leaving one's name, telephone number, time of call and brief message. But that wasn't the end of it. This particular machine was tied into a voice mail system, so I was also told that if I really needed to speak to a human being, I could reroute my call by pressing the zero button on my telephone followed by the one for the number sign. I would then be connected with someone to whom I could actually speak. I sat drumming my fingers impatiently, unable even to interrupt the machine to leave the simple message it suggested I deposit. When the babble finally ceased, I left a pleasantly caustic reply whose gist had to do with trying to press various buttons on my rotary-dial handset. We don't have Touch-Tone service out here in the country yet. A quick call to Lotus - actually not so very quick, because it took a couple of minutes to be routed among the various answering machines there - produced similar time-consuming frustrations. Two calls and two voice message centers later - one of the mechanical respondents tried to assuage my ire with a snatch of music in the background - I found myself gripped by the temptation to call my stockbroker and buy some shares of Telephone. Instead of giving in to the urge, I stopped trying to make calls and returned to opening my mail. So help me, the first letter I picked up was from a Mr. John Shaughnessy of Shepherd & Shaw Communications that began, ''Dear Mr. Sandberg-Diment, To follow up the message I left on your machine . . ..'' And just what machine, pray tell, had he been talking to? My tractor? I don't have a telephone answering machine. Neither does my computer. It is true, however, that more and more personal computers are incorporating special circuit boards that allow them to double as telephone-answering machines. A computer equipped with one of these boards can store not one, but a series of messages that the caller activates by depressing the telephone's buttons. The computer also stores incoming messages. This trend toward the convergence of computer and answering machine has been dubbed ''voice mail.'' In an earlier age the phenomenon would surely have been classified as a psychological abnormality and assigned the proper Latin name for regularly and familiarly talking to machines. As it is, some people seem unable any longer to discern whether they are speaking to a human or to a machine. Psychological considerations aside, deciding whether or not to pursue voice mail will be a major technological hurdle facing many companies. It is acquiring a growing number of proponents. Probably the most vociferous of its advocates is Martin F. Parker, whose recent book, ''The Practical Guide to Voice Mail,'' ($24.95, Osborne McGraw-Hill) hails a future wherein voice mail will be quite common in ''residential environments,'' for which read the home, as well as in business. ''Communications,'' according to the book, ''is a simple but often cumbersome process of sending information from one person to another.'' Being both a writer and the father of teen-age daughters, I feel qualified to take strong exception to the word ''simple'' in that definition. The further observation that ''Complete communications requires that the recipient receive and understand the information being transmitted by the sender,'' I find specious. But the central problem of the book's thesis is really to be found in such of its assertions as ''Voice Mail provides a tool for effective communications because of the way it operates.'' This is simply not true. VOICE mail is, in effect, one of the latest nonservice ''services'' being proffered by our much vaunted service economy. It shifts the burden of cost and time from the company to the consumer with a ''do it yourself but do it our way'' proviso. I have timed recorded messages that went on for a full minute before I was allowed either to leave my own message or reroute my call using my hypothetical Touch-Tone pad. A minute might not seem a long time, but multiply it by a couple of dozen calls a day and something has to give, like one's lunch break. Unlike real mail, such mechanically recorded directives cannot be skimmed, skipped or discarded. Nor is there any way to stop them midbabble and go back a sentence if one is interrupted just as, say, some crucial bit of information is announced. At that juncture one has to hang up and start the whole process all over again. Yet voice mail is one of this year's hot topics in personal computing circles, and its impact on the business world is far more critical than would at first appear. If one is to believe Mr. Parker and his fellow pundits, voice mail will surely overtake the written missive of the past, because it ''improves communications, costs much less, is faster, is confidential, and can be accessed from outside the office.'' Yet, subjected to scrutiny, none but the last of these avowed benefits is likely to materialize in most situations. Certainly my own experience in trying to pierce the voice curtain that corporations have begun to throw up around their encampments repudiates the claim of faster and improved communications. Voice mail makes it increasingly difficult not only to get past the machine to speak to the person one wishes to contact, but even to reach the right answering machine to leave one's message on. The cost, however, is the truly staggering consideration. Its repercussions will be far beyond the typical cost overrun that invariably accompanies any new hardware. Roughly 10 megabytes of hard disk space is needed to store one hour's worth of recorded voice messages on a personal computer, for instance. So, at the very outset a new and larger hard disk will probably be required. Beyond all the initial investment in this high-tech promise, there is the matter of the ongoing expense for extra telephone connections themselves. Soon the telephone lines will be clogged with callers reduced to captive audiences by machines, and with other machines chattering to yet more machines. Businesses will have to add extra lines just to carry all these barely communicative conversations. And there is the cost the frustration and bitterness of the caller over the time wasted in listening to a recording - understandable responses that certainly don't help a company's image at a time when people are beginning to rebel against impersonality. When all is said and done, companies have as much to lose by adopting voice mail as their customers do. The only clear winners are the telephone companies. Come to think of it, maybe I'll buy some Telephone shares after all.

984-> THE P.L.O. HAS ITS OWN IDEAS FOR PEACE TALKS
THE Palestine Liberation Organization, now reunited under Yasir Arafat, is pressing for an Arab summit meeting to discuss strategy toward a proposed international conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict. ''The P.L.O. will take part in the peace conference if Arab states are able to unify their stand on the matter,'' Mr. Arafat said recently. The P.L.O. and the Arab states directly involved in the Middle East problem are in agreement on the principle of convening a United Nations-sponsored forum, but they differ on important details. King Hussein of Jordan was reported to have reached agreement with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on limiting the powers of an international conference and making it a prelude for direct negotiations between Israel and Arab countries. But in Damascus, the state-controlled newspapers have indicated Syria will not allow the conference to be used as a cover for direct talks with Israel. Most Arab governments are known to favor a joint P.L.O.-Jordanian delegation to the proposed conference, as envisioned by King Hussein and Mr. Peres, but the Palestine National Council, the P.L.O.'s parliament in exile, at its meeting in Algiers in April decided that the P.L.O. must be represented as a separate entity. This is opposed by the United States and Israel, which insist that the P.L.O. may not be recognized until it recognizes Israel's right to exist in peace. Chedi Klibi, the Secretary General of the 22-nation Arab League, said last week he expected a meeting of Arab kings and presidents to convene before the end of this year to consider a common policy toward a general Middle East peace conference. Mr. Arafat, the P.L.O. leader for 18 years, was driven out of his headquarters in Lebanon by the Israelis five years ago and later shaken by a sharp rift within his organization. Re-elected leader in Algiers, he has solved some of the organization's internal problems, but other serious challenges to the P.L.O. persist. In Beirut last week, the Lebanese Parliament voted to abrogate the 18-year-old agreement under which the P.L.O. was allowed to maintain bases in Lebanon. P.L.O. fighters have been returning to Lebanon by the thousands in the last few years and have fought with Lebanese Moslem militias in Beirut and in southern Lebanon. The re-establishmnent of P.L.O. bases in the south as staging points for attacks on Israel has also provoked Israeli retaliatory attacks on Lebanon. The P.L.O. policy affirmed at Algiers, insisting that the P.L.O. be represented as a separate entity at the proposed conference, sounds like a hardening of the Palestinian stance. But the fact that a united Palestinian Council has agreed to the principle of negotiations is an important development in itself, representing a victory over hard-liners who advocate warfare and reject talks. The Soviet Union, which was the first to propose the idea of a United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East, played a major role in getting the disssident P.L.O. groups, both of them Marxist, to set aside their differences with Mr. Arafat. President Hafez al-Assad made a three-day visit to Moscow last month. A joint communique issued later about his talks with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described the Palestinian unity achieved at Algiers as a positive step.

985-> Texaco Creditors Offer To Help Settle Dispute
In a move that deepens the backstage maneuvering in the dispute between Texaco Inc. and the Pennzoil Company, a committee of Texaco creditors said yesterday that it would ask for a court-appointed examiner to help settle the dispute. The committee also said it would ask to file its own reorganization plan for Texaco, setting a floor and ceiling price for a settlement. Texaco has the exclusive right until Dec. 8 to submit a its own reorganization plan, but it asked the Bankruptcy Court last Friday to extend the deadline until June 30. Joel Zweibel, the committee's chief attorney, said a settlement would increase the chances for creditors to receive all they are owed and sooner. ''No one can predict the results in the United States Supreme Court with any degree of certainty,'' he said. Charles F. Luce, chairman of the General Creditors' Committee, said in a statement that under their plan, Texaco would immediately pay Pennzoil a floor price. Then, if the United States Supreme Court does not agree to review the original $10.53-billion judgment, or upholds the award, Texaco would pay Pennzoil a higher, ceiling price that would be an amount ''that Texaco could pay and remain financially viable'' but not the $10.53 billion. ''With such an agreement,'' the Luce statement concluded, ''both Texaco and Pennzoil would be free to pursue their pending litigation to a conclusion.'' If the position of an examiner were approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the individual would have to be appointed by the United States Trustee overseeing the administration of the Texaco bankruptcy case. However, Mr. Zweibel, the committee's attorney, said the committee hoped to have a role in selecting the individual. Andrew Gray 3d, an oil-industry analyst at the Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said that various ''outsiders are becoming impatient.'' He said that common stockholders and institutions ''are worried about when they'll get what's due them, and they want this dispute to end soon.'' The stockholders have not been paid dividends because Texaco is in bankruptcy, and most institutions cannot hold stock of a company in bankruptcy. Martin I. Klein, a bankruptcy expert who has no connection with the case, criticized the committee move, calling it ''unfair and unwise.'' He said Texaco ''ought to be given time to propose its own plan to reorganize itself; to do this now smacks of an attempt to cut Texaco off at the knees.'' Anita Larsen, a spokeswoman for Texaco, said the company could not comment on the committee's proposal because it had yet to see the plan. But she said Texaco ''feels the most constructive role for the committee would appear to be to discuss its ideas with the company, rather than through specific court filings.'' Robert Harper, a Pennzoil spokesman, said the suggestion of fixing parameters for a settlement ''appears to be worth exploring.'' But he added that Pennzoil would oppose the appointment of an examiner, feeling that one would not be of help in ending the litigation.

986-> Soviet Launches Replacement Crew for Craft
Three Soviet astronauts were launched into space today aboard a Soyuz TM-4 capsule in a mission to replace a space station crew that has been setting records for endurance in space. It will be the first complete crew change at a Soviet orbital platform. The current crew of the Mir space station is headed by Yuri Romanenko, who has been in space for 319 days. The white capsule left the Baikonur space center in Soviet Kazakhstan on schedule at 2:18 P.M. Its flaming engines spread a rose-colored glow on the snowy landscape before the live television broadcast showed the spacecraft disappearing as an orange cross into the murky sky. TV Viewers See Crew Television then showed black-and-white pictures of the astronauts inside the spacecraft. It reported that everything was functioning normally and ended coverage of the launching after about 10 minutes. Tass, the official news agency, said the three astronauts had barely reached orbit when they received a greeting from the Mir space station. ''We congratulate you on a successful launching,'' it said. ''Looking forward to meeting you on board the Mir-Kvant complex.'' Kvant is a large orbital laboratory that docked with the space station on April 9. The Mir crew was forced to make a space walk to clear an obstruction between the two ships to make the docking possible. The Soyuz TM-4 carried Vladimir Titov, the 40-year-old crew chief; Musa Manarov, 31, the flight engineer, and Anatoly Levchenko, a test pilot. The capsule is scheduled to dock with the space station on Wednesday, Tass said. It said the two crews would work together on the space station for about a week before Mr. Romanenko and the flight engineer, Aleksandr Aleksandrov, leave for earth with Mr. Levchenko. Radio Moscow said they would be home by New Year's Day. ''Titov's crew, without discontinuing scientific experiments and checkups of the veterans, will take over the station and start independent work after the colleagues leave,'' a veteran astronaut, Nikolai Rukavishnikov, was quoted as saying. Mr. Romanenko, the flight commander, has been in space since Feb. 6. He set the world record for space endurance on Sept. 30. Mr. Romanenko was accompanied into space by a flight engineer, Aleksandr Laveikin, who fell ill and was replaced by Mr. Aleksandrov in July. Effects of Long Weightlessness Scientists are interested in the effects of extended weightlessness on Mr. Romanenko to help them determine the feasibility of long space flights, such as a mission to Mars. The mission marks the first time the Russians are planning to make a complete crew change at a space station. Officials have not said whether the method will be continued, creating the first permanently manned space station. Radio Moscow said the mission of Mr. Titov and Mr. Manarov will be a ''long one,'' but did not say how long they would be in space. It said they would be visited by several crews during their mission. Tass said Mr. Titov first flew a space mission when he commanded a Soyuz T-8 capsule in April 1983. He has been a astronaut since 1976. Mr. Manarov and Mr. Levchenko are making their first flights into space. Radio Moscow said Mr. Levchenko is to conduct some tests to help Soviet scientists develop a re-usable spacecraft. This summer, Soviet scientists made their first test of a rocket they say will be used to launch a re-usable craft similar to the American space shuttle. There is no indication yet when such a craft will fly.

987-> THEATER; PENGUIN REVIVES AN ELEGANT GENRE
THE Penguin Repertory Company, which can be counted on to present offbeat or strictly new plays, is putting on, of all things, a 1930's-style drawing-room comedy. Precisely what, a current theatergoer might wonder, is a drawing-room comedy? It's the sort of play in which a sporty young woman, usually English and always upper class, is apt to pop up with a line like: ''Well, Dad, you're looking grand. How's Africa?'' S. N. Behrman's ''Jane,'' from which that very line is taken, is a perfectly adequate and occasionally amusing exemplar of its own archaic genre - and how much more offbeat can one get? Thus, it seems fitting for the Penguin to be dabbling in the drawing room with a three-act play of a bygone high style. Actually, ''Jane'' was regarded as a rarity even in February 1952, when it opened on Broadway (with Edna Best and Basil Rathbone, and under Cyril Ritchard's direction). One critic then wrote: ''High comedy has almost vanished from the American theater which, for the past few seasons, has been so busy with problems and depressing people that it has almost forgotten how to induce laughter.'' It isn't long after the Penguin's handsome, rippling new gold curtain goes up on Dennis W. Moyes's spiffy Art Deco-style drawing-room setting that William Tower, a world-renowned author (fashioned after W. Somerset Maugham, who wrote the short story from which the play is adapted), talks tellingly of ''period pieces'' and ''perfectly articulated fossils,'' as though he were commenting upon the play at hand. William is constantly trotting off to India when he isn't returning from Africa, which, in response to the previously posed question, he describes as ''enormous.'' William was married once to Millicent, a character reportedly patterned after Maugham's wife, Syrie. The Towers, meantime, have remained dear friends since their divorce. Ann, their daughter, is the one who asked about Africa. (Drawing-room comedies invariably involve a divorced couple, although they do not necessarily remain dear friends or have a daughter.) The shallow Millicent's sister-in-law arrives from Liverpool. She is Jane. She's plain, very decent - as Millicent puts it, ''unbearably kind'' - and very direct. The widowed, wealthy, middle-aged Jane brings her usual ''tea cozies'' and unsettles things by simply telling the truth and speaking her mind, instead of trying to be clever or nasty, and by declaring that she's going to marry a young, very young, architect, Gilbert Dabney, a self-declared opportunist. With Gilbert having transformed her from a frump to a fashionable woman, Jane becomes the rage of London - and that becomes tiresome all too soon. Predictably, the romance between the good woman with the social conscience and the extravagant yet sensible social climber who says, ''Every class has its snobs; it's just a question of scale,'' fizzles. Jane is left to do appropriate and important things. These include adopting the wife of a radical journalist and aspiring poet, Peter - most drawing-room comedies have characters named Peter - so that he can be free to marry Ann. Peter's wife, you see, is interned in a work camp in Austria. No one said that the plots of drawing-room comedies had to be simple, or all that comic. Finally, Jane is left to choose between two suitors suitable for a woman of her age: William is one, which leaves Millicent ''in a state,'' and Allan Frobisher, a newspaper tycoon and ''old reprobate with money, power and innate vulgarity,'' is the other. Although Judy Stadt as Millicent has a ripping time announcing that she's ''in a state,'' emphasizing the final syllables of ''Indya'' and ''Ethiopya'' and making haughty exits with sweeping gestures, and Evelyn Jewell is an always pleasant Jane -more than dowdy and less than elegant - the Penguin cast is quite improperly schooled in the exchange of brittle banter, be it Maugham or Behrman style. Which means that ''Jane'' gets bogged down in verbosity. As a sad result, Joe Brancato's direction dwindles just as the play gains comic momentum, and it drags on, more than need be, to a denouement. But, remember, there's another side to ''Jane.'' For all the accents that ring false, the cast is adept at emphasizing dramatic matters, as opposed to the comedy of manners. Given an overloaded story, there is ample opportunity to do that and for Mr. Brancato to touch the play's heart, to remind one that this is 1938 and to give pause to Jane's question: ''Don't you read the papers?'' Performances of ''Jane'' continue through June 21 at the Barn Playhouse. Information: (914) 947-3741.

988-> STREET FASHION; THE SEASON'S STARS: STRIPES AND STRIPES
LOOKING for this spring's newest fashion fad? It's all there in black and white (occasionally blue and white). Stripes of those colors are most definitely in. The proof is on jackets, pants, blouses, sweatshirts, T-shirts, beach tops, socks, hats -garments, indeed, of every stripe. The direction and the width of the stripes hardly seem to matter. The important thing is that they are there. After that, wonderful clashes ensue. For instance: narrow-stripe knee socks with a bold-stripe sweatshirt, or a medium-stripe blouse with a large-stripe skirt. The rule is that there are no rules at all.

989-> Signatures Held Sufficient to Force Arizona Vote
More than enough petition signatures have been validated to force Gov. Evan Mecham to face an election to recall him from office, county recorders said today. ''It's very clear that the citizens of Arizona have spoken with the loudest voice ever yelled in Arizona history,'' said the founder of the Mecham Recall Committee, Ed Buck. ''It's now time for Evan Mecham to resign, clearly.'' The Maricopa County Recorder, Keith Poletis, and several other county recorders said they had verified 240,512 signatures, far more than the 216,746 valid signatures of registered voters required to force a recall election. In addition, many other counties have not completed the verification of their signatures and are expected to add more to the total. The only way Mr. Mecham could avoid a recall, Mr. Poletis said, is to resign or mount a successful court challenge to the petitions' validity. Mr. Mecham said today that a House investigation on whether he should be impeached for failing to report a $350,000 campaign loan was a waste of taxpayer money. In a letter to House Speaker Joe Lane, a Republican, the Republican Governor said a subpoena of his personal bank records sought as part of the investigation was an ''incredible invasion of privacy.'' He added, ''I have done nothing illegal and I have nothing to hide.'' Mr. Lane said the investigation would not be halted and accused Mr. Mecham and his lawyer of trying to confuse the issue. A spokesman for Mr. Mecham, Ken Smith, said the recall vote would not be official until a declaration is made by the Secretary of the State after the counties submit their final signature counts by Jan. 18. After a verification of the total, Mr. Mecham would be given five days to resign before an election date is set. The office of Secretary of State Rose Mofford said today that a date likely would be set in mid-May unless there was a delay caused by a court challenge.

990-> Deaver Jury Will Resume Today
The jury deliberating a verdict in the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver recessed without coming to a decision tonight and is to meet again Tuesday. Mr. Deaver, a former White House deputy chief of staff who is a longtime friend of President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, was charged with lying under oath in testimony last year to a House subcommittee and a Federal grand jury. The two panels were investigating whether he violated restrictions on lobbying after leaving the White House in May 1985. Mr. Deaver was not charged with violating those restrictions but with lying about his lobbying efforts. The jury of seven women and five men, which received the case at noon Friday, has deliberated a total of 14 and a half hours. Today they met through lunch, which was brought to them in a fourth-floor jury room at the Federal courthouse. Although required to be only on call in the case of a verdict, Mr. Deaver, who is 49 years old, spent the day at the courthouse with his wife, Carolyn. Mr. Deaver did crossword puzzles behind the closed door of a small room assigned to defense lawyers.

991-> Afghan Diplomat Accused Of Auto Attack on Woman
A high-ranking Afghan diplomat on his way to buy an air-conditioner at an appliance store in Queens has been accused of ramming a woman in a dispute over a parking space. The diplomat, according to State Department officials, is Shah Mohammad Dost, the former Foreign Minister of Afghanistan and now his country's envoy to the United Nations. Mr. Dost was described as one of the most important United Nations diplomats and a key figure in the world body's attempts to negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan. The woman he is accused of hitting was identified as Margaret Curry, who was taken to Flushing Hospital and treated for cuts and bruises after the incident on Sunday. United States officials said Mr. Dost had been on his way to a Crazy Eddie's store in Flushing when the incident occurred. Several telephone calls yesterday seeking comment from the Afghan Mission to the United Nations were not returned. The incident was not the first involving an Afghan diplomat said to have been involved in violence. Three Afghan diplomats attacked representatives of the Afghan rebel movements at the United Nations headquarters last fall shortly before the rebels held a news conference. According to the United States officials, the incident involving Mr. Dost took place at about 2:15 P.M. on the corner of 37th Avenue and Main Street in Flushing as Ms. Curry, of 97-11 Horace Harding Expressway, in Rego Park, stood by the curb holding a parking space for her boyfriend, who was backing into the spot. Mr. Dost, behind the wheel of his 1978 Lincoln, drove up, identified himself as an Afghan diplomat and insisted Ms. Curry give him the space. According to Ms. Curry's version of events, Mr. Dost started insulting her, then drove his car into her, striking her and sending her scrambling out of the road, the officials said. Ms. Curry was taken by ambulance to Flushing Hospital, where she was treated for cuts and bruises, a United States official said. She later filed a complaint over the incident at the 109th police precinct in Flushing, officials said. Afghans' Denial The Afghans have denied that Mr. Dost rammed Ms. Curry or drove his car toward her. In their version of the story, Ms. Curry suffered her injuries when she ''got excited and tripped as she left the street,'' United States officials said. City officials immediately expressed outrage over the incident and said it highlighted the need for tougher measures to protect Americans from diplomats who abuse United States laws. Foreign diplomats, covered by diplomatic immunity, can be expelled from the United States if their crimes are serious, but they cannot be prosecuted or sued for damages. Concern Over Talks Officials at the United States Mission said it was ''far too early to tell'' precisely what happened on Sunday but expressed concern over its effect on the delicate Afghan peace talks. The incident is the latest in a long series of incidents involving top United Nations diplomats and their families who violate United States laws. Last spring another senior United Nations envoy, Said Rajaie Khorassani of Iran, was arrested at Alexander's department store and held by investigators for several hours after he was accused of trying to steal a raincoat. Like Sunday's incident, the majority of cases involving diplomatic immunity occur over parking places. Two thousand United Nations diplomats and their families accumulated more 70,000 parking tickets in 1985, leaving the city with about $2 million in unpaid fines.

992-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES; Green Invasion
There are some sections of New York in which the only way you can tell the season is by the temperature. Looking out a window provides no clue when you're looking at a rubble-strewn vacant lot. There are fewer dismal vistas these days, thanks to Operation GreenThumb, now entering its 10th year of bringing life and color to blighted neighborhoods. GreenThumb, which is federally funded through the Community Development program, leases about 1,100 city-owned lots to 625 community organizations. The Sanitation Department clears the lots; GreenThumb helps design the gardens and provides the groups with training, tools, lumber, plants and seed. This spring, GreenThumb counts 175 such gardens in the Bronx, 40 on Manhattan's Lower East Side, 75 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Some of the gardens produce food. GreenThumb boasts that all the vegetable rows laid end to end would reach 60 miles. Other gardens feature flowers. The irises and poppies in the LaGuardia Place garden last weekend, for instance, were dazzlers. And all the gardens are oases on mean streets that sometimes seem as barren as the moon.

993-> T>alking: Mortgages; Making The Last Payment
PAYING off a mortgage is truly a cause for celebration. The moment is so special that it has been assigned a ritual in our society - a mortgage-burning party at which the notorious document is finally laid to rest. More and more homeowners are gaining that opportunity because so many home loans now have shorter payoff periods, such as those with 15-year terms or biweekly payments. Or they are paying off other short-term commitments, such as seller financing or equity loans. However, in paying off a mortgage, bankers and lawyers say borrowers often make strategic errors that cause problems later, particularly when the homes are being refinanced or offered for sale. Those errors include failing to do the necessary paper work to make sure that a release from a mortgage is noted on the deed; losing evidence to show that the mortgage was indeed fully paid off, and poor budgetary planning that could result in an inability to meet real-estate taxes and homeowner insurance premiums that once were the responsibility of the lender. Robert Lee, a lawyer in Levittown, L.I., who represents the Williamsburg Savings Bank, said the lender will typically send the borrower a letter about a month before the final payment is due. That letter usually outlines the procedures to expect and alerts the borrower about the need to take certain steps. For instance, Citibank in New York will recommend that the borrower call the customer-service department to discuss what must be done. Just making the final payment is not enough, said Al Sorrentino, vice president of real-estate business management at Citibank. The borrower needs a satisfaction-of-mortgage document and this cannot be sent out until all the accounting is completed. That accounting, said Parry Spahr, executive vice president at People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., includes the difference between any money that is left in the borrower's escrow account set up for taxes or insurance and the final payment amount. Depending upon the lender these adjustments could be made just before the final payment or not completed until a week or so later. It is vital, these bankers say, for the borrower to keep on top of the situation and be certain that figures are correct and that the satisfaction-of-mortgage document is being sent out so the mortgage can be taken off the deed. Procedures vary from state to state. In New York and Connecticut it is the obligation of the borrower to obtain the satisfaction-of-mortgage document and take it to the appropriate public records office. New Jersey law requires the lender to notify the records office unless otherwise advised by the borrower. A small charge may be levied for this service, but it should not exceed $25, said Angelo A. Mastrangelo, a lawyer in Madison, N.J., who is a former chairman of the New Jersey Bar Association's real property section. MAKING sure that a release is noted on the deed may be vital to the owner later if he wants to borrow against the property again or arrange a timely closing on its sale. But, Mr. Spahr said, ''too many people just don't bother.'' ''I get calls from people who paid off their loans 10 or 15 years ago and suddenly panic when they find out the mortgage is still on the title,'' Mr. Sorrentino added. Even worse, they have tossed out all the records connected with the loan and cannot even produce the loan number. It can then take up to two weeks of ''tedious'' work for the lender to locate the old loan, Mr. Sorrentino said. Making matters even more troublesome, Mr. Sorrentino said, is that most loans are now sold in the secondary investor market and may be sold again several times over. Without that original satisfaction-of-mortgage document the bank has to trace the final holder of the mortgage - a time-consuming job. Similar steps must also be taken when paying off equity loans because they are recorded as liens against the properties unless the necessary steps are taken. Most lenders do not advise borrowers about clearing the lien created by an equity loan unless asked, assuming the borrower may be intending to activate the loan again in the future. A zero balance, warned Mr. Spahr, does not necessarily mean the obligation has been removed from the records. And if the mortgage is privately held - for instance, if it involved financing offered by the seller - it is necesary to obtain the satisfaction-of-mortgage document from the lender. In such a case it may be necessary to have his or her signature notorized; otherwise the records office may refuse to accept the discharge document as adequate proof that the loan has been paid off. New Jersey is one state that requires such notorization but will allow an out-of-state notary to certify the private lender's signature, Mr. Mastrangelo said. The borrower should also get in touch with the town or city hall involved to find out how much will be owed, in the future, for property taxes, and when the billing will take place. Payments may be made four times a year or twice a year, depending upon the community. The borrower should further contact the insurance company and make sure its bills are being redirected. It may be wise to notify the family lawyer when closing out such loans, said Nancy Gordon, vice president at the Globe Mortage Company in Hackensack, N.J. Using a lawyer might also be advisable, she said, if the mortgage is being serviced by an out-of-state company, which is increasingly common now that so many mortgage service contracts are being sold off along with the mortgage loans themselves. Finally, do not burn the mortgage deed or mortgage-satisfaction document at the celebration party, warned Jane Greenstein, president of the Mortgage Clearing House of New Hyde Park, N.Y., a mortage information and brokerage service. ''Burn a copy instead,'' she said, ''and keep the old payment stubs. In a near cashless society credit ratings become more and more important. The terms plus the canceled checks are incontrovertible proof that you were given a substantial sum of money and paid it off.''

996-> THE NATION; Help for Wedtech Became a Priority
It was 1982, and the Welbilt Electronic Die Corporation, with the help of a series of letters, telephone calls and meetings organized by White House aides, had overcome Army opposition and won a $27.7 million contract to make small engines. The ''great brouhaha,'' an Army press spokesman acknowledged last week, had a side benefit for the South Bronx tool-and-die maker: It prompted an unusual letter from an Assistant Secretary of the Army to its contract monitors, instructing them ''to take all possible actions to avoid unnecessary perturbations to the contractor's performance'' and to give Welbilt, now Wedtech Corporation, ''all appropriate support.'' Wedtech grew swiftly into a $100-million-a-year company on the basis of this and other military contracts, awarded without bidding as part of a Government program to help minority-owned businesses. Late last year, however, widening corruption investigations forced it into bankruptcy. Connections between the White House and Wedtech are central to another inquiry, by a special prosecutor, James C. McKay. He is investigating Lyn Nofziger, a longtime political adviser to President Reagan who became a lobbyist in 1982, and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, who invested $60,000 with a financial consultant working for Wedtech, and their actions on the corporation's behalf. Last week Mr. McKay said investigators were also checking whether Mr. Nofziger played a role in Fairchild Industries' efforts to persuade the Air Force to buy more A10 aircraft.

Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, tying him for ninth place on the career list with 521, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the San Diego Padres tonight, 6-5. Schmidt's 26th home run of the season moved him into a tie with Willie McCovey and Ted Williams on the career list. He tied Eddie Mathews for most home runs by a third baseman with 482. Schmidt connected in the third inning off Mark Grant (3-7) after Juan Samuel singled and Milt Thompson reached on Randy Ready's error at second base. Schmidt tied Billy Williams for 26th place on the career runs-batted-in list with 1,476. Astros 2, Cardinals 1 HOUSTON (AP) - Ken Caminiti hit a two-run double in the seventh inning and Bob Knepper combined with Larry Andersen on a four-hitter as Houston won its sixth straight and sent St. Louis to its fourth loss in a row. The Astros got only four hits off Joe Magrane and Todd Worrell. Magrane (6-5) took a one-hitter and 1-0 lead into the Houston seventh. Bill Doran and Alan Ashby singled before Caminiti's two-out double. Knepper (6-13) gave up three hits in seven innings. Andersen finished for his fourth save. Cubs 9, Braves 1 ATLANTA (AP) - Scott Sanderson pitched four-hit ball for seven and two-thirds innings and Luis Quinones singled in the go-ahead run in the seventh as Chicago beat Atlanta.

998-> SOVIET AIDE SAYS NAVY WON'T ADD WARSHIPS IN GULF
The Soviet Union has no intention of augmenting its force of three small warships in the Persian Gulf despite its apprehension about United States plans to build up its fleet there, according to First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov. He said in an interview yesterday that the Soviet Union was engaged in discussions with Iran, Iraq, India and other countries on ways to assure freedom of shipping in the gulf and the Indian Ocean. He added that the Kremlin had proposed such talks with the United States but had not yet received an answer. In the wide-ranging interview, Mr. Vorontsov also said the Soviet Union was aiming for a summit meeting in Washington in October. He also expressed optimism that Soviet-American differences on a treaty to eliminate intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles in Europe would soon be overcome. Mr. Vorontosov, who declined to be quoted directly but authorized use of his remarks, indicated strong Soviet interest in reaching agreements with Washington. Soviet Consults on Shipping Moscow has had hints that there have been talks between the warring nations of Iran and Iraq on assuring freedom of shipping in the region, he said, but apparently they have not reached anything definitive. Mr. Vorontsov said the Soviet Union would like to advance consultations with the United States on stopping the gulf war, providing safety of shipping and assuring that the presence of Soviet and American warships in the waterway would not lead to incidents. Little has been done so far, he said. It would be bad all around, the official declared, if there were to be retaliation for attacks in the gulf. Other officials here have expressed concern at the possibility that Soviet and United States armed presence in the gulf might turn the local war there into a critical Soviet-American issue. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was in Moscow a few months ago. Mr. Velayati has recently visited Bonn and Rome, where he is known to have expressed concern about growing superpower presence in the gulf. Mr. Vorontsov seems to take this as a good sign, but he did not have any indication of results. Confident on Arms Treaty On the prospect of a treaty on intermediate-range missiles, Mr. Vorontsov said that a joint draft just completed still contained many disputed points but that he felt they could be resolved. He expects a meeting between the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Washington late this summer and, if it is successful, a summit meeting in the fall. Among the outstanding points are where the United States will deploy the 100 intermediate-range warheads to be allowed each side under a new treaty. It has been agreed in principle that Soviet missiles will not be deployed within range of the United States or its allies, meaning Japan. But Washington has not yet renounced basing rights in Alaska, which would be within range of Soviet territory. This is considered a bargaining point, not a real obstacle. Verifying Weapon Destruction Both sides are now working on proposals for verifying destruction of weapons to be removed from Europe and have agreed to technical talks in the near future. There are problems about where and how near to the point of destruction each side's observers would be allowed, because when the warheads are open they can reveal engineering secrets. Mr. Vorontsov said the United States was also holding out against factory inspections, having agreed to inspection in principle but insisting that monitors should stay outside factory gates because going inside could violate commercial rights of secrecy. The Soviet Union wants both sides to have the right to go inside. Precedents for Other Treaties The details of both destruction of missiles and verification are a new exercise, he pointed out, an historic precedent that could facilitate later agreements on reduction of strategic missiles and chemical weapons. He said both sides were aware of this and were doing their homework and then would discuss the technical problems together. One serious issue is the destruction of solid fuel missiles, which are very dangerous to dismantle. There are proposals to put dummy warheads on them and shoot them into the ocean, or to send them into space as launchers of commercial satellites. On Afghanistan, Mr. Vorontsov said the Soviet Union believed a solution was possible by establishing a patchwork coalition, leaving chiefs in full control of the territory they now command. King Mohammad Zahir Shah, deposed in 1973 and now in exile in Italy, could return as a leader bringing peace, he said, but he could not again become the ruler. The attitude of Mr. Vorontsov seemed to confirm American official views that the Soviet Union was not yet prepared to withdraw from Afghanistan without being assured of leaving behind a viable central government that would be friendly to the Soviet Union, even if it had only limited power in the rest of the country. Ideas on Space Defense Tests He answered questions about the United States space defense program in a conciliatory tone, saying the Russians had proposed drawing up a list of allowable experiments. The Russians would then say which ones they considered compatible with the antiballistic missile treaty and which ones they considered objectionable. When he offered this interim solution to unblock further negotiations on reduction of strategic missiles to the chief United States negotiator in Geneva, Max Kampelman, Mr. Vorontsov said the American delegate replied by suggesting that the Russians wanted to control which tests the United States could can make. Mr. Vorontsov said he answered that the United States could do what it wanted under such an exchange, but that the Russians would answer with their views. Mr. Shevardnadze made the same proposal to Secretary of State Shultz, he said, who replied that he would discuss it with President Reagan. The Russians are awaiting an answer on this and on the recent proposal for Warsaw Pact-NATO talks on restructuring conventional forces on both sides to reduce the capability of surprise attack. Mr. Vorontsov said the Russians wanted direct discussions between military commanders on both sides, but the United States had not yet answered.

1002-> Mets Outlast Cubs And Gain Ground
The Mets benefited last night from their World Series championship last season and their spirited run at a repeat performance this season: They broke their all-time season attendance record on their way to 3 million. The bottom line, though, was not the only line on their mind. Their line in the National League East standings was also important, and they benefited there, too, by edging the Chicago Cubs, 6-5. They moved to one and a half games behind the first-place St. Louis Cardinals, who lost to the Philadelphia Phillies, 3-2. Gary Carter's two-run single was the climax of a four-run rally in the fifth inning. It gave the Mets their winning margin, which Jesse Orosco protected with a performance that matched his best of the season. Orosco, who only last Friday night gave up the losing runs in a shattering loss to St. Louis, pitched the final three innings in relief of Rick Aguilera and allowed no runs and one hit. The Cubs rapped Aguilera for three home runs, including a three-run blow by Andre Dawson in the third; nevertheless, he gained his fifth victory in five starts since recovering from an elbow injury. ''I just had a real good feeling,'' Manager Dave Johnson said, explaining why he let Orosco finish the game. ''I know I left myself open for criticism when I left him in to finish after he got the left-handers out of the game. In his mind, he feels he's been maligned. I have hunches and that was one of them.'' A Single Hit Orosco, who basically has been replaced by Randy Myers as the No. 1 left-handed reliever, pitched to 10 batters, and all were right-handers. Three of them batted for left-handers among the first five batters Orosco faced. However, the only hit he gave up was a leadoff single by Dawson in the eighth. ''He certainly has a lot of good innings left in him,'' Johnson said. ''As good as Myers has done lately, Jesse is still a quality pitcher.'' The save was Orosco's 15th of the season but first since July 24. His performance was rewarded with an ovation from the crowd of 27,693, which sent the Mets' home attendance to 2,774,440, breaking the record of 2,762,417 they set in their championship season last year. Unlike last Friday night, when the Mets couldn't recover from Terry Pendleton's stunning two-out home run in the ninth inning, they overcame the Cubs' third-inning onslaught by erupting for four runs of their own in the fifth. The big hit was Carter's tie-breaking, two-run single, but equally as important to the rally was the ground ball that went between the legs of Keith Moreland, who leads the major leagues in errors. That one was his 27th. With the Mets losing, 4-2, Lenny Dykstra led off the fifth with a line drive to right field that he ran into a double, just beating Dawson's strong throw. Wally Backman then bunted for a single, and the Mets had runners at first and third. Hernandez's Key Hit After Drew Hall relieved Scott Sanderson, who appeared to be reluctant to leave, Keith Hernandez hit a sharp grounder to third. Moreland could have thrown home to get Dykstra, or he could have let Dykstra score and opted for a double play instead. He did neither, however, because he never fielded the ball, permitting Dykstra to score and the runners to be safe at second and first. Darryl Strawberry followed with a line drive to right for a single that drove in Backman with the tying run. After Hernandez moved to third on a fly to deep right by Kevin McReynolds, Strawberry stole second. That put him in position to follow Hernandez home when Carter lined a single to left. In the third inning, the Cubs roughed up Aguilera as he hadn't been since his return. Dave Martinez and Rafael Palmeiro singled, and Dawson drove the ball into the bleachers in left-center field for his 44th home run. The hit also raised his league-leading runs-batted-in total to 121. Four pitches later, Leon Durham hit a home run over the center-field fence, giving the Cubs a 4-1 lead. After the Mets went ahead, Jody Davis hit another home run against Aguilera in the sixth. That, however, was as close as the Cubs could come. Ojeda Due Friday Bob Ojeda, who had elbow surgery May 23, will pitch against Pittsburgh Friday night, marking his first start since May 9. ''We thought about starting him in Montreal,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the Mets' pitching coach, ''but there's a psychological advantage to coming back against a team he's had a lot of success against rather than a team he hasn't done well against.'' Ojeda has a 6-0 career record against the Pirates, 0-3 against the Expos. Dwight Gooden and David Cone will start the games in Montreal.

1003-> CONGRESS DEBATES LAW LIMITING LIABILITY IN NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS
A law that limits the amount the nuclear industry would have to pay after a reactor accident, no matter how great the damage to public health or property, is under sharp debate here as it comes up for renewal in the shadow of the Soviet nuclear disaster last year at Chernobyl. Under legislation passed 30 years ago to encourage the growth of nuclear power, the liability of the utility industry is limited to about $700 million. But according to anti-nuclear advocates and members of Congress with nuclear plants in their districts, that amount would cover only a tiny fraction of the cost of a major accident. And, since the accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine and the March 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., the utility industry has grudgingly accepted the contention that the liability limit should be increased. The specific issue before Congress is an extension of the Price-Anderson Act, passed in 1957 and renewed at 10-year intervals since then. Elements of the Debate Debate on the act, which expires Aug. 1, has focused on two key elements: The liability of private utilities that run nuclear power plants and the liability of private contractors who operate the Federal Energy Department's plants for making nuclear bomb fuel, most of which have experienced serious safety problems. Under the current system, each utility carries $160 million of insurance on each of its reactors. In the event of an accident at any reactor, plant owners across the country would be assessed $5 million for each of their reactors. With more than 100 licensed reactors in the United States, the assessments would raise the compensation pool to about $700 million. The figure could change slightly if new reactors were licensed or others taken out of service. In the event of an accident at one of the Energy Department's plants, the Federal Government could be required to pay up to $500 million. The private company operating the plant would be liable for nothing. Debate in Congress has focused on changing this element of the law. Damages in the Billions In either case, studies show that a major nuclear accident could result in far greater claims for damages, most of them for long-term abandonment of real estate contaminated by radiation. The consequences for homeowners would be particularly severe because their insurance policies specifically exclude nuclear accidents. A study last year by the General Accounting Office found that an ''average catastrophic accident,'' at one of six reactors in heavily populated areas could cause damage estimated at more than $6 billion. The highest figure, for Indian Point, in Buchanan, N.Y., 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan, was $14 billion to $16 billion. For some accidents under certain weather conditions, estimates run as high as $200 billion. The law provides that if damages exceed the limit specified, Congress will ''thoroughly review the particular incident and take whatever action is deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the public.'' It is not clear whether that would mean that Federal taxpayers would contribute to the money paid out by a utility after a nuclear accident. Opponents of the law say it represents a subsidy to the nuclear industry by taxpayers. They also argue that the law forces the neighbors of nuclear plants to absorb the risk of a plant accident. A report by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1983, ordered by Congress as part of the last renewal of the Price-Anderson Act, said the law took away from property owners the right they would otherwise have to sue for damages and put in its place a limited sum of money and the possibility that Congress could contribute more. The report called such a substitution ''galling to many people and an embarrassment to many defenders of nuclear power.'' But the report also said that the current system ''recognizes the national character of a major nuclear accident and the need for a national response through Congress including the use of general tax revenue.'' Waiver of Defenses One group pressing for the removal of liability limits is the Price-Anderson Campaign, which was formed by two nonprofit lobbying groups based here, the Environmental Policy Institute and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ''At the very foundation of our economic system is the principle that excellence is rewarded,'' the group argues in its literature, ''yet the Price-Anderson Act tells the nuclear industry: 'No matter how negligent, careless, or reckless you are, you are not responsible for fully compensating damages you cause the public.' '' But the industry argues that other provisions of the law provide substantial benefits to the public, primarily a ''waiver of defenses,'' which specifies that to collect, plaintiffs need only prove damage and need not show in court that the accident was the fault of the utility, the reactor builder or a subcontractor. ''We need somehow to provide assistance quickly and early,'' said Frank W. Graham, vice president of the Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry group based here. In other kinds of liability cases, he said, ''it takes years and years for our system to pay off.'' Proposals to Raise Limits Without a limit on liability, he said, the amount paid in damages ''depends on how smart the lawyers are that continue to drain the system.'' Another strength of the system, according to proponents, is the provision it makes for assessing all utilities when one of them suffers an accident, making available more money than could be recovered from a single company. Congress is considering two proposals to make that provision even stronger. Representatives Morris K. Udall of Arizona, chairman of the House Interior Committee, and Philip R. Sharp of Indiana, chairman of the Energy and Power subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, both Democrats, have recommended raising the limit to approximately $7 billion by increasing the assessment on each reactor to $10 million and by levying it for several years after an accident. Another proposal by Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Dennis E. Eckart of Ohio and Al Swift of Washington, all Democrats, would use a similar assessment system, but continue it indefinitely until all claims were paid off. That idea was formulated four years ago by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a way to pay for an accident without bankrupting utilities, but was eventually rejected by the commission. Liability of Contractors In recent days debate in Congress has centered on whether the private companies that operate the Energy Department's bomb-fuel facilities under contract should be liable for accidents if they are grossly negligent. A proposal that would make them liable for fines of up to $30 million for knowing and willful violations that cause a major accident was approved by the Senate Energy Committee in April. The issue is of particular interest because the Government has temporarily closed the N-Reactor at Hanford, Wash., which bears some design similarities to the Chernobyl plant, and has cut power at three reactors at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina because of safety problems. The Energy Department acknowledges that the reactors and other nuclear facilities used in producing bomb fuel are outmoded and require substantial improvements. At a recent meeting of the Energy and Power subcommittee on the Udall-Sharp bill, Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat whose district is downstream from the Hanford facility, said: ''It's terrible public policy to use public money to indemnify a Department of Energy contractor from all financial liability for all acts, no matter how outrageous, even where the damages are caused by reckless disregard for safety or, even, which seems incredible, intentional misdeeds.'' But some of the contractors at the bomb-fuel facilities have threatened to quit such work if they are made liable. General Electric, for example, which holds more than $4 billion in contracts with the Government, told legislators that its participation was largely for the public good and that the proposal created ''grave concern over our ability to continue this role.'' The Energy Department is eager to have the legislation renewed because without action, its contractors would lose their financial protection as their contracts expire. But commercial reactors that already have operating or construction permits would continue to be covered under the old system if Congress does not act by Aug. 1.

1004-> Falwell Groups Fined for Illegal Transactions
A religious corporation and a political action committee run by the Rev. Jerry Falwell have both been fined $6,000 by the Federal Election Commission because of an illegal series of transactions between the two. The I Love America political action committee illegally sold the Old-Time Gospel Hour 7,500 Bibles at an inflated price in 1983, according to Karen Finucan, an agency spokeswoman. Both of Mr. Falwell's organizations agreed earlier this year to pay $6,000 in civil penalties apiece. The agreements were made public this week. On Tuesday, Mr. Falwell told the House Ways and Means Committee's Oversight Subcommittee that he had never used his religious ministries to support his political operations. Neither Mr. Falwell nor his spokesman returned telephone calls today. Mr. Falwell has said the violations were inadvertent and that he really had no control over the organization. Mr. Falwell was president of the I Love America Committee when it was created in 1983 and has signed most of the group's fund-raising letters. In an interview before the Federal action was disclosed, Mr. Falwell said the political committee had purchased 25,000 Bibles for a fund-raising drive. The committee then sold 7,500 leftover Bibles to the Gospel Hour, he said.

1005-> Botha Says Foreign Envoys Undermine Pretoria's Rule
President P. W. Botha said today that some Western diplomats in South Africa were promoting opposition outside Parliament and hinted at steps to restrict certain diplomats' movements. Speaking in the white-dominated Parliament, Mr. Botha also attacked the visit last month by a group of South Africans to West Africa for talks with officials of the outlawed African National Congress. He also hinted at stricter control in the issuing and renewal of passports for South Africans who he said collaborated with the country's ''enemies,'' a reference to contacts with the African National Congress, the main exiled revolutionary group. He ruled out an early end to the nationwide state of emergency that was declared June 12, 1986, after two years of turmoil in which more than 2,500 people were killed in unrest in the country's black townships. A Change in Constitution Mr. Botha also said he would seek changes in the Constitution to extend the tenure of the white house of Parliament to five years, thus postponing the whites-only general election scheduled for 1989 to 1992. In his first major speech in two months, Mr. Botha reserved his most specific attack for Western Governments, which he said had paid for the South Africans' talks with African National Congress representatives in last month in Dakar, Senegal. He hinted at new laws ''to restrict the flow of funds from abroad to be used for undermining the state and promoting extraparliamentary politics.'' Mr. Botha said he regarded ''in a very serious light'' what he called the interference of foreign governments and their embassy personnel ''in the furtherance of extra-parliamentary politics.'' ''The Government is aware of the activites of these people and of their support for such organizations such as the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa,'' he said, referring to the group that organized the Dakar meeting. The leader of the group, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, an Afrikaner anti-apartheid leader who previously led the liberal Progressive Federal Party in Parliament, quit that post 18 months ago, declaring debate in the white-dominated institution as a ''ritual of irrelevance.'' ''Just as the Government of the United States of America is taking steps to bring the staff of embassies who are acting off-limits in that country under control, similar steps can be considered in South Africa with regard to certain members of staff of specific embassies,'' Mr. Botha said. He did not name the embassies or diplomats concerned. [ Asked to comment on Mr. Botha's assertion, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, told reporters at his daily briefing that ''I just haven't seen it.'' Another spokesman had no comment Thursday night. ] Mr. Botha had maintained an uncharacteristic silence since the mainly Afrikaans-speaking delegation of more than 50 scholars and dissidents slipped out of the country six weeks ago for four days of talks with black nationalists fighting to end white rule. Mine Strike in Fifth Day Mr. Botha spoke as the biggest wage strike in the country's history entered its fifth day, with more than 300,000 black miners trading accusations about intimidation and violence with management. Mr Botha made no reference to the strike in his speech. At least 78 strike officials have been detained; one miner has died, and at least 50 have been injured in clashes with mine guards and policemen. The miners' leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, said today that the strike had spread to another 10 mines and plants, bringing the total to 52 mines and the number of miners on strike to 352,000. Some mine employers said there had been a gradual drift back to work by some of the 230,000 miners who they acknowledged were on strike at 31 of 99 mines falling under the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, representing the six major mine companies. But the independent Labor Monitoring Group said a survey of 52 gold and coal mines indicated that the total number of miners on strike was ''in excess of 300,000'' contradicting the employers' assertions.

1006-> DIVISIONS CONQUERED; PRESYTERIAN PAPER HIGHLIGHTS MERGER
The complexity of Christian-Jewish relations and the difficulty of reconciling tensions within a reunited Protestant denomination have been underscored here at the annual convention of the nation's largest Presbyterian church. In a compromise hastily worked out over the weekend, a committee of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rewrote a landmark paper on Jewish-Christian relations that had seemed headed for defeat. The revised statement goes further than any previous Christian document in recognizing the validity of the Jewish faith and the Jewish quest for Israel. It is also unusual because it asks forgiveness for past sins. ''We acknowledge in repentance,'' it says, ''the church's long and deep complicity in the proliferation of anti-Jewish attitudes and actions through its 'teaching of contempt' for the Jews.'' Church officials expect the paper to be approved by the full convention Monday. The revival of the statement is largely a reflection of the history of the denomination, a 3.1 million-member body formed in 1983 by the union of two Presbyterian bodies, one northern and one southern. Involvement in Mideast The idea for the Christian-Jewish document emerged out of the southern branch in 1981, but it ran into problems after the union with the northern branch, which had a long history of involvment in the Middle East and greater sympathy for the Arab world. The northern church, the United Presbyterian Church U.S.A., began sending missionaries to Arab countries in the early 1800's and founded a Christian college in Lebanon that became the American University of Beirut. The Rev. Benjamin Weir, who just completed a one-year term as the leader of the merged denomination, was a missionary in Lebanon for 30 years before he was seized by Arab terrorists in March 1984. He was released 16 months later. Mr. Weir, who was ordained in the northern branch, had strongly urged that the language on Israel in the Christian-Jewish document be revised to emphasize the denomination's sympathy with the Palestinian people. Mergers of Other Denominations The Rev. W. Eugene March, who was ordained in the southern church and served as chairman of the task force that drafted the paper, said that the compromises reached over the weekend are similar to what other newly merged denominations will have to face. Numerous Protestant groups, including three Lutheran church bodies, have been joined into new denominations in recent years; others are negotiating similar mergers. The document is also a reflection of the Democratic structure of the Presbyterian church. Presbyterians are fond of saying that the American system of government is based on the original Presbyterian structure, with its synods resembling Senate districts and presbyteries similar to congressional districts. ''We Presbyterians believe in process,'' said Mr. March, who is a professor of Old Testament at the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Broad Range of Believers Unlike pronouncements from the Roman Catholic Church, such as the 1965 declaration on Jews of the Second Vatican Council or the speech of Pope John Paul II in a synagogue in Rome last year, the Presbyterian document was produced by a broad range of believers. The committee that hammered out the language included northerners and southerners, men and women, blacks and whites. Nonetheless, some Jewish leaders found it lacking, especially in the paper's support for a homeland for Palestinians. Seymour D. Reich, president of B'nai B'rith International, said in a statement released today, ''We deeply regret the apparent surrender to Arab pressure by leaders of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) in vitiating what might have been a historic document on Jewish-Christian relations.'' Others were more sanguine. ''If you want to reverse 1,900 years of bad attitudes toward Jews you need tools and building blocks,'' said Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee. ''I look at this as one major building block between Christians and Jews.'' Valid Covenant With Jews Michael Wyschogrod, director of the institute for Jewish-Christian relations of the American Jewish Congress, also praised the paper as an important advance, even though he said it fell short of what he had hoped. Mr. Wyschogrod had been a consultant to the task force that drafted the document. Although the paper was changed from a policy statement to a study paper and some of its language was tempered, it still contained statements that other church bodies have not before said to Jews. It included seven ''affirmations,'' including ones that acknowledge that God has a valid covenant with Jews and an existing ''promise of land to the people Israel.'' The paper is also important because in affirming the Jewish claim to Israel, the Presbyterians separate themselves from some fundamentalist Christians who support Israel because they see it as part of God's plan for the end of the world. According to this ideology, the gathering of the Jews will lead to the battle of Armageddon, a battle whose only survivors will be true Christians. The document calls this view ''theologically flawed.''

An article in Business Day on Aug. 11, about a midyear report of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, misidentified the deficit about which the Democratic majority warned. It was the nation's foreign debt, not the trade deficit. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the foreign debt; at the end of last year, it totaled $263.6 billion.

The amount represents a $1 billion increase over two years from the $2.5 billion A.T.&T. announced last January that it would spend annually in 1988 and 1989. The announcement was made today by A.T.&T.'s chairman, James E. Olson, at the opening of the company's new network control center here. Mr. Olson said that the company had stepped up its plans to expand its network because of the increase in the number of long-distance telephone calls and demand for digital business services, which allow companies to send voice and data message.

1015-> Playoff Picture Is Still Crowded
They went through a strike and have managed to play 14 games. And now, with the National Football League's regular-season finale looming, 15 clubs are still in contention for a playoff spot. Not one division title has yet been decided in the American Conference, where nine clubs are vying for division and wild-card berths. Three clubs are still in contention for the A.F.C. East title. The Eastern Division (Washington Redskins) and Central Division (Chicago Bears) have been sewn up in the N.F.C. The Western title will go either to San Francisco or New Orleans. In the A.F.C., only Cleveland and Denver have clinched even wild-card berths. ''It's worse than breaking down the Theory of Relativity,'' said Peter Abitante of the N.F.L.'s American Conference. He said there were 128 possible combinations of finishes in the A.F.C. alone, and that no N.F.L. race had ever come down to the final week with so many teams in contention. The reason it is so complex is that there are different tiebreaking procedures if two clubs are tied or if three or more are tied. The following is a rundown of what the teams need to do to make the playoffs. American Conference EAST: Indianapolis can finish first for the first time since 1977 by beating Tampa Bay at home. If it loses, it can still be a wild card if Houston, Pittsburgh and San Diego also lose. Miami can finish first only if Indianapolis loses and Miami wins its Monday night game with New England. Miami can be a wild-card team if it wins, Houston and San Diego lose, and Seattle wins. Or, if Miami wins and San Diego, Houston and Pittsburgh lose. New England would finish first if it beats Miami and Indianapolis loses. The Patriots could be a wild card if they win and Houston, Pittsburgh and San Diego lose. A loss puts New England out of the picture. CENTRAL: Cleveland can win its third straight division title by defeating the Steelers on Saturday at Pittsburgh (where they broke an 0-17 string last year). Cleveland can also win if Houston loses its home game against Cincinnati. The Browns have already clinched at least a wild-card spot. Houston can win the division by defeating Cincinnati if Cleveland loses. Houston becomes a wild card if it wins. The Steelers, alive for a wild card, cannot win the division. They would be a wild card if they beat Cleveland while Seattle loses. Or if Seattle wins and Houston loses, plus a loss by either Indianapolis, Miami or San Diego. WEST: Denver can win the title, and guarantee itself home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, by defeating San Diego in Denver. Denver also wins the title if Seattle loses at Kansas City. Denver is already at least a wild-card team. Seattle would be the division winner by defeating Kansas City combined with a Denver loss. Seattle would also be a wild-card by winning, or if Pittsburgh or Houston loses. San Diego cannot win the division but can be a wild card if it beats Denver coupled with losses by Pittsburgh and Houston. To break it down further, a loss by Houston, Miami, New England, Pittsburgh or San Diego eliminates those teams. National Conference EAST: Washington has clinched the division. St. Louis can be a wild card if it defeats Dallas and Minnesota loses to Washington. CENTRAL: Chicago has clinched the division. Minnesota can be a wild card if it defeats Washington or St. Louis loses to Dallas. WEST: San Francisco wins the title if it defeats the Rams or New Orleans loses to Green Bay. New Orleans will finish first if it wins and the 49ers lose. Either way, both the 49ers and Saints will be in the playoffs. The Rams were eliminated from wild-card contention when they lost to Dallas last night.

1016-> COMPANY NEWS; ASEA Merger Gets Approval
Shareholders of Switzerland's BBC Brown Boveri & Company and ASEA A.B. of Sweden approved the proposed merger of the two companies to form the world's largest electrical engineering group. At meetings in Baden, Switzerland, and Vasteras, Sweden, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of creating a new company, Asea Brown Boveri, with annual sales of around 25 billion Swiss francs, or about $18 billion, and a work force of 160,000. Brown Boveri's chairman, Fritz Leutwiler, said the merger would create a European concern capable of challenging the United States and Japanese giants of the electrical engineering industry. ASEA has been more profitable than Brown Boveri in recent years but Mr. Leutwiler insisted the merger, announced in August, was one of equals. He stressed that ASEA and Brown Boveri would operate as separate companies with their own national identities.

1017-> Nicaraguan Conflict Appears to Be in a Stalemate
Despite reports of a rebel offensive that began in northeastern Nicaragua on Sunday, the war appears to be stalemated. The Sandinista army seems to be incapable of destroying the contras and the contras cannot defeat the Sandinistas with their current tactics. Where the war goes from here depends largely upon the outcome of the peace talks, which resumed in Santo Domingo today. The contra attack is clearly intended to help the rebels bargain in those talks, which are part of the Central American peace plan signed in Guatemala in August. The fate of the contras depends not only on how those talks turn out but also on whether Congress will sustain the level of aid to the rebels that was approved Sunday in a compromise between Congressional leaders and the White House. Fighting Increased After Aid Fighting between the contras and the Nicaraguan Army has increased dramatically in the last year as the $100 million in aid Congress voted for the contras in 1986 made itself felt on the battlefield. At the beginning of the year an average of 25 clashes between the two sides were being reported each week. Since June, that figure has jumped to 90. Nicaragua's Defense Minister, Umberto Ortega Saavedra, acknowledged the increase in military activity on Nov. 26 when he said ''the war is the fiercest it has ever been.'' As contra activity increased and the rebels rejected the autumn cease-fire offered by the Managua Government, the Sandinistas mounted a winter campaign to take advantage of the dry season, which favors the Sandinistas. Mr. Ortega said the offensive would hit the contras harder than they had been hit before. To do this, the Sandinistas moved additional units, including reserves, into the mountains to search for contras, in rugged areas to the north and east of Managua. To date the Sandinistas have not scored any significant victories over the contras. The contras' manpower has been estimated at 8,000 to 12,000. The vast majority are now believed to be inside Nicaragua. There are about 75,000 Nicaraguans serving in the armed forces. Contras Outnumbered 4 to 1 Experts on the war say the numbers of people actually doing the fighting are lower. The force ratio between the combat units is estimated to be at no more than 4 to 1 in favor of the Government. Historically, anti-guerrilla campaigns have required ratios of up to 10 to 1 before they were successful. It is difficult to get accurate details on the war, because both sides exaggerate successes and play down failures. The contra attack started Sunday is illustrative: the contras have said they are using 7,000 soldiers, while the Sandinistas say there are no more than 1,000. It is apparent from discussions throughout Central America and visits to contested areas in the Nicaraguan countryside before the contra attack Sunday that the rebels have been able to seize the military initiative in some of the less populated areas of Nicaragua. But their military operations have generally been limited to attacks against undefended or lightly defended economic targets like rural power systems and Government farm cooperatives. They have yet to launch a successful attack against a major garrison or Sandinista military unit. The contras have also gained popular support of many of the Nicaraguan peasants in the remote mountain areas of the interior. Sandinista officials say the contras can now depend upon some of the farmers in the remote areas of Jinotega and Chontales provinces to provide food and medical refuge for wounded rebels who cannot be evacuated. Little Widespread Support Seen But in the more populated areas on the Pacific side of Nicaragua, there appears to be little widespread support for the contras, even among people who oppose the Sandinistas. Desertion is fairly common in both armies but there is no evidence of significant numbers of soldiers defecting to the other side despite conflicting claims by both Sandinistas and contras. Sandinista Army leaders admit that the contras have had success with American-supplied Redeye antiaircraft missiles against Soviet-made helicopters, reducing air support for Sandinista soldiers. At its headquarters in Sebaco, in Matagalpa Province, Lieut. Col. Manuel Salvatierra Rivera, commander of the Sixth Military Region, where heavy fighting continues to take place, said helicopter support for his troops must be cautious and well-planned because of the Redeyes. Ten helicopters are believed to have been shot down over the last year, although the contras maintain they have shot down as many as 27. After an uncertain start at the beginning of this year, the contras appear to have gained confidence. By October they were conducting attacks that clearly worried the Sandinistas. Until the Sunday attack, the contras' most spectacular one was along the main road connecting the port city of Rama on the Atlantic coast with western Nicaragua. The attack had little military significance, but it was an important psychological victory. Military observers also say it was notable for its size and coordination. Tenuous Supply Line The contras' Achilles heel is a tenuous supply line, which depends upon parachute resupply by planes said to fly out of Honduras. Colonel Salvatierra said the supply missions, which he described as very professional, are conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. The Sandinistas can track the resupply missions on radar, but they have no planes capable of intercepting the missions, which are conducted at night in remote areas. Some experts on the region say it is a matter of time before the Sandinistas are able to stop the flights. Thus, these experts say, it is important that the contras start capturing arms and equipment as a hedge against a disruption of supplies. American officials say the Government forces continue to be well supported by the Soviet Union. American authorities say the Soviet Union delivered 23,000 metric tons of supplies and equipment to the Sandinistas in the first nine months of this year. This, they say, matches the total tonnage delivered in 1986. Despite their growing boldness and limited success on the battlefield, the contras face a competent and organized army. Against that army there appears to be little likelihood that the contras can carry the war to the all-important Nicaraguan cities and lowlands anytime soon. Until they do, the contras will remain troublesome, but they will not be a critical military threat to the Sandinistas.

1018-> Hoyt Arrested On Drug Charges
LaMarr Hoyt, the former San Diego Padres pitcher, was arrested Saturday at his apartment here and charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, authorities said. The 32-year-old Hoyt, who served a brief sentence in Federal prison this year on drug charges, was taken to the Richland County Detention Center and released after posting a $20,000 bond. Hoyt must also answer Federal charges in San Diego charging he violated probation by testing positive for cocaine use, according to a published report. He is scheduled to answer those charges in United States District Court in San Diego on Thursday, The San Diego Union reported Saturday. The charges were made in a South Carolina probation report Nov. 12. Hoyt is trying to return to major-league baseball with the Chicago White Sox, the team he pitched for in 1983 when he won the Cy Young Award. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended Hoyt for the 1987 season because of the pitcher's drug abuse, but the suspension was reduced to 60 days by an arbitrator. The Padres released Hoyt on Jan. 7.

1019-> COMPANY NEWS; ITT and Units Settle Fraud Suit
The ITT Corporation and its loan subsidiaries have agreed to settle a fraud and racketeering suit by refunding up to $2.6 million to about 50,000 Arizona borrowers and to pay additional penalties to end a potential Government case against them, officials said. The companies, accused of raising profits by packing unneeded and largely useless insurance into consumer loans, did not admit or deny guilt. But they agreed to give current customers a broader set of insurance coverages at no charge and promised not to engage in certain selling practices in the future, the officials said. Arizona is the fifth state in which ITT or its subsidiaries have agreed to settle claims of ''insurance packing.'' The other states are Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, according to Deanna Delmar, an assistant Attorney General.

1020-> Music: Chamber Group
APPREHENSION of Ferruccio Busoni's music may eventually recapitulate the postwar ''discovery'' of Mahler. Both composers belong to that exciting period around the turn of the 20th century when everything in music was coming to a boil; both won great fame as performers but found only a limited audience for their strange, ambiguous amalgam of old and new in their compositions. Busoni's music lacks the frenetic excess that gives such an edge to Mahler and so may never gain the same prominence in the orchestral canon, but as one encounters piece after fascinating piece by the quizzical German-Italian composer, one gradually realizes that his oeuvre is both broad and rich. Such an encounter was afforded Sunday afternoon by the New York Chamber Symphony at the 92d Street Y with the Concertino for Clarinet and Small Orchestra (Op. 48). It dates from 1919, when the complex old master was fascinated with the simple purity of Mozart and Mendelssohn. He seems to have experienced in those composers a serenity attained by passing through all the storm and stress of Beethoven and Liszt, rather than an innocence that knows not struggle. The Concertino is full of limpid, sunlit clarity and also full of Italiate bel canto borrowed from the operatic fantasies the composer heard in youth from his father, Ferdinando, a clarinetist. But there is not a hint of parody or pastiche; the work is quiet, thoughtful, detached but not unfeeling, utterly elegant. David Shifrin played the solo part beautifully (though his tone did not always retain the focus in forte passages). Gerard Schwarz led a vital accompaniment, alert to the specifics of the score. The Concertino was followed by Mendelssohn's ''Reformation'' Symphony, in which the first movement was best, full of natural propulsion and clear architectonic sense. The chamber symphony's wind choir sounded ill at ease at times in the chorale-based finale, and the andante movement seemed a little overfilled with emphasis, but it was a satisfying performance. The concert began with Elliott Carter's ''Elegy,'' somewhat overplayed for this taste in the manner of the Mendelssohn andante. Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg then played the Barber violin concerto with tone sometimes fine, sometimes scrappy. The work's cheaply achieved climaxes suited the violinist's generic extraversion all too well; concerto and soloist alike were effaced by the Busoni.

1021-> Deadly Intent Underlies the AIDS Amendment
To the Editor: According to Senator Jesse Helms, people ''who don't want to risk being killed by AIDS'' should ''reject sodomy and practice morality'' (letter, Nov. 23). The inanity of the Helms policy is highlighted by the Senator himself when he describes his pending amendment on acquired immune deficiency syndrome as ''simply'' one that ''requires that AIDS education emphasize abstinence outside a sexually monogamous marriage, and abstinence from drug use as well.'' If one partner in Mr. Helms's ''sexually monogamous marriage'' has been infected with the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, even though the person is ''sexually monogamous,'' the other partner is at risk for infection. Waving a marriage certificate in the air before unprotected sex with an infected spouse will not prevent the spread of AIDS. What the Senator is suggesting is that we keep people ignorant of crucial, life-saving facts about AIDS prevention. Preaching ''morality'' is always easier than taking responsible action. If we are to discuss morality, however, we must discuss the morality of keeping from people information that would save their lives. Anyone refusing to provide life-saving information to a person who needs it is responsible for the resulting death. He is, in effect, murdering that individual. Senator Helms - and the 94 senators who voted with him - should be held accountable for every AIDS death resulting from ignorance about risk-reduction practices like condom use and the efficacy of bleach to clean needles against the AIDS virus. It is unfortunate - indeed, pathetic - that such individuals are allowed to set health policy for this nation. In any other situation, it would almost seem comical. In the era of AIDS, it is deadly. TIMOTHY R. WOLFRED Executive Director San Fancisco AIDS Foundation San Francisco, Nov. 25, 1987

1022-> Horse Racing Notebook; Whitney to Preview Some 3-Year-Olds
The ranks of the older horses are so thin this summer that the women and children of the local equine population had to be recruited for the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Track Saturday. A field of seven was drawn today for the $250,000-added Whitney, the first Grade I event of the Saratoga meeting, but only two of the seven are older males: Broad Brush, the top weight at 127 pounds, and Lac Ouimet, next in the weights at 117. The others are all 3-year-olds: Gulch at 117, Gone West at 116, the filly Seldom Seen Sue at 113, Java Gold at 113 and Gorky at 105. The presence of the 3-year-olds, though, makes this an unusually intriguing Whitney. It becomes the first yardstick by which to measure this year's 3-year-olds against the older horses and the first forecast of how they may fare in the coming months in Belmont's fall championship series and the Breeders' Cup Classic. If these 3-year-olds can even come close to beating Broad Brush, it will speak quite well for the chances of Bet Twice and Alysheba this fall. The 3-year-olds who were entered in the Whitney could have instead run Sunday against fellow 3-year-olds in the Jim Dandy, and may be entered for that race as well. The light weights and the fatter purse of the Whitney, however, could prove more attractive. Gulch, Gone West and Java Gold are prepping for a showdown against Alysheba in the Travers here Aug. 22, and Seldom Seen Sue is tuning up for the Alabama Stakes a week earlier. The early line puts Broad Brush at 8-5 and Java Gold next at 2-1, a high compliment but a well-deserved one for the latter colt. Java Gold, who missed the Triple Crown races because of a virus, has been carefully handled with the Travers as his main goal and appears on the threshold of proving himself. The Whitney will be televised by ESPN with a scheduled post time of 5:40 P.M. Good Race to Miss One reason Seldom Seen Sue was entered in the Whitney was that her handlers thought the Test Stakes here today looked like too demanding a spot. The race drew a full field of 14 that included 10 stakes-winners and was packed with early speed. It turned out to be a good race to avoid, because no 3-year-old filly in the country could have beaten Very Subtle today. The California-based daughter of Hoist the Silver dueled through torrid fractions of 21 3/5 and 43 3/5 with Devil's Bride, then shook her off and romped to a five-and-one-quarter-length victory over Up the Apalachee with Silent Turn three lengths back in third. Her final time of 1:21 was a stakes record and the track was not even particularly fast. Very Subtle is owned by Pearl Grinstead and trained by Mel Stute, the same team that campaigned Snow Chief. Very Subtle won her first seven career starts, then floundered this spring when asked to negotiate longer distances. She paid $9.20 for $2 to win in the Test and was ridden by Pat Valenzuela. She may try the Alabama, where she would run into Fiesta Gal, the nation's leading 3-year-old filly. Another one to consider there is Bound, who was left at the post yesterday and rallied well to finish fourth. Best for 2-Year-Olds The Saratoga Special, the feature here Friday, is the year's best race to date for 2-year-olds. The key to deciphering it is the third race at Belmont July 10. A field of nine went to the post, seven of them first-time starters, including the heavily tipped Lustra and Close Union. Neither one of those did much running, but Once Wild, a Baldski colt, led from start to finish in decent time on a dull track. Morgan's Levee rallied well to be second and Crusader Sword, off poorly and 10 paths wide, was up for third. In his next start, Morgan's Levee, still a maiden, ran down six winners to win the Tremont at Belmont July 20. Then Crusader Sword returned and won a maiden event July 29 by five and a half lengths. Today, Once Wild makes his first start since his debut, and Crusader Sword tops the opposition. Once Wild looks like the controlling speed of the race, so may have a tactical advantage. The others in the field of eight who appear to have a shot are Forty Niner, who won his debut impressively, and Endurance, the Tremont runner-up. The rest of the field consists of the apparently overmatched quartet of Tejano, Occultism, Stockport and Bad Bad Boy. Jim Dandy Field Cryptoclearance, fourth in the Derby, third in the Preakness and second in the Belmont, is expected to head a field of seven or eight in the Jim Dandy. Leo Castelli, Polish Navy, Landyap and Pledge Card are among the other possibilities. . . . The bettors here failed to hit the Pick-Six again, thanks mainly to an upset in an accident-filled steeplechase race. The carryover into the card Friday is $101,260.

1023-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Amfac Chief Appears To Fit Company's Plans
Richard L. Griffith, who was named president and chief executive of Amfac Inc., is a longtime company director and a prominent lawyer in Hawaii. Mr. Griffith, who is 56, has only served as the top executive of Amfac's land holdings since 1985. But his selection appears to fit with the company's new plans, which are to sell all of its operations in the continental United States. ''I wouldn't think they would bring in anybody who wants to rock the boat,'' said Charles R. Bureker, a financial analyst at Sutro & Company in San Francisco. ''By adopting a fortress mentality, it signals that Amfac is going to be a Hawaiian company and that does make sense. They know Hawaii and it's a difficult state to do business in.'' Amfac is one of Hawaii's largest employers. When the company began making plans for a restructuring plan some months ago, the state's Governor, John Wahine, threatened to bring political pressure to bear on the company if Amfac proceeded to dispose of its Hawaiian assets, which include sugar plantations. Whether Amfac's corporate overhaul reflects political arm-twisting is unclear, Mr. Bureker said. Ronald R. Sloan, Amfac's previous president, was dismissed last month in a disagreement over the restructuring plans by the company's chairman, Henry A. Walker. For Mr. Griffith, at least, Hawaiian business practices are no mystery. He has been a partner since 1969 in the Honolulu law firm of Cades, Schutte Flemming & Wright. The firm, which is the largest on Oahu, specializes in tax, estate, probate and general corporate work and has 82 lawyers. Mr. Griffith headed the tax department for the firm before departing to join Amfac as an executive. He also serves on the boards of the Hawaii Business Roundtable and the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association. Before joining the law firm in 1960, Mr. Griffith worked as an adviser to a Federal tax court and as a staff assistant to a former Colorado Senator, Gordon Allott. A native of Blue Hill, Neb., Mr. Griffith graduated from the University of Colorado in 1953 and Georgetown University law school in 1958.

1024-> Olympic Veterans On Skating Team
The 20-member United States Olympic speed skating team does not lack experience, talent or controversy. Eight members of the 1984 team will be headed to Calgary, including two skaters - Nancy Swider-Peltz and Mary Docter - who came out of retirement. Swider-Peltz became the only United States speed skater to make the Olympic team four times when she qualified Sunday on the final night of the trials. She also made the team in 1976 and 1980. The 31-year-old mother of an 11-month-old daughter will be after her first medal but for the first time will be competing in a sprint race - the 1,000 meters, where she won a trial Sunday night. Swider-Peltz who had been coaching David Cruikshank, another member of the team. Docter, who is 26 years old, didn't start training on the ice until a month ago but won both the final 3,000-meter trial and the only one at 5,000 meters. Docter is on the Olympic team for a third straight time. Erik Henriksen, another three-time Olympian, was told Sunday by a United States International Speed Skating Association Committee that he would not be punished after he was ordered in November to leave a Calgary dormitory where he had run-ins with resident assistants. Two skaters, Eric Flaim and Leslie Bader, are on their first Olympic teams. The United States team is headed to Europe for World Cup competition, but Flaim and several other skaters would prefer to skip World Cup and go straight to Calgary to train at the indoor rink. Bonnie Blair will be skating in three events after winning eight of her nine trials, and Nick Thometz and Dan Jansen, this country's top sprinters, will enter the 500 and 1,000. All three were members of the 1984 team.

1025-> POLITICS; Gephardt on Issues: Different Tacks, Not Going With the Tide
''This country is about change,'' says Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democratic Presidential candidate. ''I'd rather change and be right than be rigid and be wrong.'' This is how the Missouri Congressman responds to accusations that he has shifted his political position on significant issues to accommodate his national campaign. On most fundamental issues, he maintains, he has not shifted at all. Occasionally, he says, he has moved to a different tactical approach without abandoning long-range goals. Sometimes, when circumstances changed, he has moved to meet them. With the first 1988 delegate selection just over the horizon, Gephardt critics are stepping up their charges that he has been, at best, inconsistent and, at worst, unprincipled. Opponents in both parties say he has reversed himself on abortion, tuition tax credits, education and the 1981 tax cut, among other issues, and has thus cast doubt on his future adherence to his current positions. At the forefront of this criticism are the antiabortion forces. Through his first four House terms, Mr. Gephardt supported a constitutional amendment to bar abortion except to save the life of the mother. He withdrew that support before seeking re-election to the House in 1986, saying the amendment could not be passed and calling for alternative approaches, such as sex education and family planning, to reduce unwanted pregnancy. Assurances and Suspicion The Congressman maintains that he is still personally opposed to abortion, but that assurance does not remotely satisfy such organizations as the National Right to Life Committee. In a four-page tabloid devoted to Mr. Gephardt and abortion, the committee states: ''The extent and speed of his shift on abortion, if fully understood, may raise questions in the minds of journalists, party activists and voters regarding Gephardt's overall commitment to principle.'' Asked to respond to this, Mr. Gephardt said: ''The principle involved here is helping people avoid abortion, which is an unfavorable outcome. That's always been my belief and remains so today. The question is how to serve that belief. I understand the anger and disappointment of those who disagree with me on this issue, but what I am advocating now is what I believe will best advance that goal.'' The most recent newsletter of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life carries an unflattering picture of Representative Gephardt and calls him ''Tricky Dick.'' The newsletter says he ''dumped his decade-long anti-abortion stand to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination'' but is ''reported fading fast'' in Iowa. Caucuses in that state on Feb. 8 will provide the first concrete evidence of Presidential preference in both parties. A Nautical Metaphor Although Mr. Gephardt voted against almost all Federal expenditures for abortion in the House through 1984, he promised earlier this year that, if elected President, he would not veto bills including such appropriations. This stand has caused further anguish among anti-abortion groups. The abortion question is listed with several others in an article in the Dec. 14 issue of The New Republic, which explores several changes of issue position by Representative Gephardt since his early days in Congress. The writer, John J. Pitney Jr., concludes: ''All politicians of both parties, at least successful ones, trim their sails to adjust to prevailing winds. Few have shifted as dramatically, quickly and smoothly as Richard Gephardt.'' At the recent candidates' debate staged by NBC News. Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, one of Mr. Gephardt's rivals, challenged him on the Missourian's 1981 vote for the Reagan Administration tax cut bill. He suggested that current Gephardt criticism of the Administration's economic policies represented another shift in his political position. Gephardt aides maintain that Democrats and Republicans agreed in 1981 that a tax cut was necessary, and that the Congressman's support of the Reagan bill, after the Democratic alternative had been narrowly defeated, did not contitute an endorsment of Reaganomics, then or now. Aide Sees Consistency Mark Johnson of the Gephardt campaign staff said it would have been ''irresponsible'' for the Congressman to vote against the final tax cut bill after having supported a Democratic version of the same move. ''On the most important issue in this race, the future of the national economy, Gephardt is the one candidate with a consistent record of leadership,'' Mr. Johnson said. The Missouri Congressman once favored establishing tuition tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools, a proposal that has been criticized as government support of parochial education. Mr. Gephardt says he withdrew his backing when he became committed to tax simplification. ''I decided the tax code should not be cluttered with credits and deductions,'' he says. Votes in Carter Era Recalled One of Mr. Gephardt's major campaign pledges is a substantial increase in the quality of American education, but opponents note that during the Carter Administration he voted against creating the Department of Education The candidate says his belief that the job could be done satisfactorily in the then existing Department of Health, Education and Welfare reflected the position of the American Federation of Teachers at the time. Since then, however, he has opposed President Reagan's occasional proposals to abolish the new department. He asserts that Mr. Reagan's attempts have been intended to minimize any Federal role in education, a philosophy Mr. Gephardt opposes. Representative Gephardt concludes that a candidate should be consistent in supporting ''beliefs or goals on a particular issue, but it's also important to be willing to change some particular stands in order to achieve these goals. When facts and circumstances change, it's important that you be willing to change. Being rigid is improper.''

1026-> ROCHESTER ADOPTS BAN ON DRUG TESTS
The City Council has passed, 5 to 4, a bill that would make Rochester the second city in the nation to bar random drug testing of nearly all employees. The focus is now on Mayor Thomas P. Ryan Jr. People involved in Government and politics said he was likely to veto the long-awaited legislation, which has been strongly opposed by business leaders. The measure would bar the random tests while allowing employers to test a worker, if they have ''reasonable suspicion'' that the employee is abusing drugs. San Francisco is the only city with such a law. ''Nobody has the right to search my body or take my bodily fluid without reasonable suspicion,'' the sponsor of the bill, Councilman John G. Erb, said. Mr. Erb had fought since January to obtain the five votes needed to pass the bill. When it was passed, a crowd of supporters - members of organized labor and the clergy, as well as private citizens - erupted in applause. #6 Needed to Override If the Mayor does veto the bill, Mr. Erb would need to find a sixth vote for the nine-member council to override the action. If the Mayor vetoes the legislation, it would be his first veto since he took office in January 1986. Mr. Erb's bill regulates drug testing by businesses as well as state, county and city government offices here. It would ban random testing with the exception of police officers, firefighters, emergency communications personnel and operators of emergency vehicles. It would allow testing only when the employer could show reasonable suspicion that an employee was abusing drugs and that it was affecting work. Glassy Eyes, Slurred Speech Reasonable suspicion may entail testing someone whose eyes appear glassy or whose speech is slurred or because the person is consistently absent from work or is involved in a preventable accident. The bill would require employers to provide and pay for a second, more conclusive test, if an employee tests positive. ''Innocent people have a right to be left alone; to go to work without fear that some medicine they took that morning or the poppy-seed bagel they ate may test false positive, and they will have to explain that to their employer,'' Mr. Erb said. He was referring to the opiate in poppies or the chemicals in some medications that could cause a drug test to show a false positive. Mr. Erb said his legislation would insure that a person's civil rights ''are not left at the factory gate.'' Difficult to Enforce Those who oppose the measure said that it would be difficult to enforce, that it did not provide for random testing of people in ''safety sensitive jobs,'' such as in a nuclear power plant and that such legislation should be enacted at the state or Federal level. Business leaders have strenuously opposed the legislation and have put pressure on the Mayor to veto it. Officials at the Eastman Kodak Company, Monroe County's largest employer, said that their drug-testing policy would conform to Mr. Erb's bill but that they still opposed the legislation, asserting such matters should be dealt with at the state level. Councilwoman Joan Hensler said she worried about a person in a sensitive job who successfully masked the drug problem. Rights and Public Safety ''What about a bus driver who could endanger the rest of the community?'' Mrs. Hensler asked. ''That, to me, is the fatal flaw in this bill. ''We have a responsibility to be concerned about individual rights. We also have a responsibility to be concerned about public safety.'' ''What got us this far was a politician willing to stick his neck out in defense of workers,'' said Bruce Popper, president of Local 1199 of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees and secretary of the local A.F.L.-C.I.O. council. Mr. Popper said a coalition of union members, community and church groups, the American Civil Liberties Union and lawyers had helped the bill pass. Mr. Erb said he planned to take some of the advocates with him when he met with Mayor Ryan and tried to dissuade him from a possible veto.

1027-> OFFER TO BUY ROBINS IS DROPPED
The American Home Products Corporation said yesterday that it had withdrawn its offer to buy the A. H. Robins Company and to assume the huge legal liabilities of Robins's Dalkon Shield birth-control device. American Home gave no specific reason for dropping the offer, which it had made on Feb. 5. A spokesman for Robins said only that the company had been surprised by the withdrawal. Analysts said that American Home had probably decided to pull out of the deal after it found that the Dalkon Shield situation might be harder to control than it had first thought. The announcement that the offer had been withdrawn sent Robins's stock tumbling to $15.50, down $6.50, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. American Home's stock closed at $82.125, up 75 cents. When American Home made the offer last week, Robins's stock soared $6.50, to $19.25, in heavy trading. American Home's stock stood at $82.625 on the day of the offer. American Home and Robins would not disclose financial details of the offer, but analysts had estimated its value at from $1 billion to as much as $2.2 billion. Most of the money would have gone into a trust to pay injury claims involving the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine contraceptive device. American Home had said that it would also pay Robins's creditors. 'Uncertainties' Cited ''During the course of discussion, uncertainties surrounding the situation could not be clarified,'' a spokesman for American Home said yesterday. American Home, a New York-based based health care and consumer products company, makes Anacin and the decongestant Dristan, among other products. Kent Blair of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation assessed the situation this way: ''They attempted to acquire Robins and establish a trust of definite amount to cover the plantiffs, but after consideration it became clear that there would be a series of insurmountable problems.'' David Saks of Morgan Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner, a Los Angeles-based securiities firm, said: ''This is exactly why there have not been attempts by other firms for Robins. They perceived a series of endless lawyers battling over the situation. There would have been a quagmire of delays.'' Murray Drabkin, the lawyer who represents the Dalkon Shield claimants committee, disagreed yesterday with reports that the liability situation had caused American Home to withdraw. He said that the claimants had reached an agreement with American Home that both parties were ''entirely comfortable with.'' ''For the claimants,'' Mr. Drabkin said, ''the deal provided an acceptable level of compensation, and for American Home, it provided freedom from any continuing liability from Dalkon Shield claims.'' Other Products Robins, which is based in Richmond, makes health-care products, including Robitussin cough medicines and Chap Stick lip balm. The company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in August 1985 in the face of a flood of litigation charging that the Dalkon Shield had caused some deaths, infections and sterility. Roscoe E. Puckett, a Robins spokesman, said the company would file its plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 soon, now that American Home had withdrawn its offer. A Federal District Court had instructed Robins to submit a plan by Feb. 5, but the deadline was extended to allow the company to consider the buyout offer. The claimants committee has said that it believes a sale of Robins is the best solution.

1030-> PENN ENDS REQUIRED STUDIES FOR THE PREMEDICAL STUDENT
In another effort to broaden the undergraduate education of the country's premedical students, the University of Pennsylvania has eliminated all course requirements for admission to its School of Medicine and will no longer even recommend undergraduate courses. Instead, the School of Medicine, the country's oldest, recently adopted a policy statement that says it ''encourages students to obtain a broad education in the liberal arts, while undertaking preparation in the sciences which is appropriately rigorous.'' The policy takes effect for applicants seeking admission to the class that enters in the fall of 1988. The statement, part of a trend to persuade premedical students to take liberal arts courses, is designed to spur applicants to indulge their educational fancies and sample the entire undergraduate palette. School officials said they hoped it would lead to ''very compassionate, human physicians.'' Dr. Edward J. Stemmler, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, emphasized this week that applicants for the 150 openings in each class must still have a strong scientific background. He said that the school would continue to require undergraduate students to master the basic sciences and take standardized entrance examinations, which test science knowledge. The examinations include the Medical College Admissions Test. Change Seen as Long Overdue Medical educators who have seen the statement hailed the change as a long-overdue step and predicted that other medical schools would follow suit. They said that would lead to better-educated physicians and perhaps narrow what they view as a growing gulf between good medical care and humane medical care. ''It's unique,'' Dr. August G. Swanson, vice president for academic affairs at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said this week. ''I think it may be the trend of the future. It gives much more flexibility to college programs. And that could permit a better balance between science and the humanities.'' Dr. Daniel Tosteson, dean of the faculty of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, endorsed the move as a ''step forward.'' He predicted Wednesday that the statement would become a model for many medical schools that are now reviewing their admissions criteria with an eye to reducing science requirements. The change is the latest effort to end a situation that has led many undergraduates to emphasize science in an attempt to improve their chances of being accepted by one of the country's 127 medical schools. That leaves little time for any other type of studies and can lead to narrow-minded physicians, educators said. Comeback for the Liberal Arts The move is also another sign that the liberal arts are making a comeback on college campuses. Educators across the country report that students in a number of preprofessional and vocational fields have started adding more liberal arts courses and taking dual majors, combinations of fields like accounting and psychology. That is a welcome sign to medical educators. In September 1984, a panel sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges found ''a continuing erosion of general education for physicians'' and proposed abolishing course requirements to ease the effects of the heated competition to get into medical school. ''The present system of general professional education for medicine will become increasingly inadequate unless revised,'' the panel of 18 educators said in its report, entitled ''Physicians for the Twenty-First Century.'' That spurred a few changes. In an attempt to encourage students to sample the entire undergraduate curriculum, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced in May 1985 that it would no longer require applicants to take the Medical College Admissions Test, which is heavily weighted to assess scientific knowledge. Johns Hopkins, as well as a handful of other schools, also began to guarantee admission to some college juniors, giving them more time to indulge their educational fancies. About two-thirds of the students admitted under that program took more liberal arts courses in the senior year, school officials said. Like the University of Pennsylvania, a handful of schools, including the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and the Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine, are dropping or have eliminated course requirements. But unlike the University of Pennsylvania, they recommend courses, a recommendation that becomes a de facto requirement in the view of many undergraduates. That is why the University of Pennsylvania stopped recommending courses. Instead, it lists specific subjects with which applicants must be familiar. Dr. Frederic Burg, associate dean of academic affairs at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, said the new admissions policy would reward students who pursue their own interest. He said that should help build bridges to other disciplines, such as biomedical engineering, that are increasingly intertwined with medicine.

1031-> ON THE HUNT FOR THE UBIQUITOUS MAN-MADE EAGLE IN MANHATTAN
THE bald eagle, an endangered species, is at roost all around Manhattan - in stone, in bronze, in paint, in stitchery, on sidewalks and rooftops, canvas and quilts, on monuments and office buildings, in parks and museums. The national symbol of the United States, cherished as an emblem of strength since it was adopted by the Continental Congress in 1782 and became the Great Seal by Congressional edict in 1789, has undergone continual change. George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in the shadow of one of the earliest paintings of the American eagle, a work hanging today at St. Paul's Chapel, Broadway at Fulton Street. The painting, commissioned by Congress, depicts with robust naivete an awkward-looking bird, its turkey-like legs holding arrows and olive branches, its bald head framed against a cloud of stars and a blazing sunburst, its stomach bearing the blue-crested red-and-white-striped shield of the United States, and its beak clutching a streamer on which is written ''E Pluribus Unum.'' That fierce and scrawny rendering of the eagle, imperfect though it may be, ''does show the eagle in its earliest permutation as a bird that is very evocative of the American spirit,'' said Philip M. Isaacson, an expert eagle-watcher who is the author of ''The American Eagle'' (New York Graphic Society). Mr. Isaacson, a lawyer and art critic in Lewiston, Me., said that the founding fathers chose the eagle over other suggested symbols - which included the liberty cap, Hercules and an Indian Princess - because none of the others possessed the nobility and majesty of form that could signify the Great Republic. ''But the eagle is such an amazing bird, it visually commands respect - it is magisterial,'' Mr. Isaacson said. George Washington approved, and although he eschewed military regalia for the Inauguration, he insisted that eagle buttons be sewn to the suit he wore for the ceremonies. Once the eagle was adopted, artists went to work and studied historical interpretations of the bird, which in short order was transformed into a well-fed, more realistic and far more majestic creature in hundreds of different manifestations. No other American symbol has been represented in so many media through so many periods of American art as the bald eagle. And no other symbol has changed so frequently in form and aspect with the changing climate in art and politics. Painted, stitched, carved and cast, the bald eagle can be seen in at least 29 places in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The images add drama to patriotic paintings and decorate the surfaces of early- to mid-19th-century glass flasks, stoneware jugs, a sideboard, tables and punchbowls. They appear as finials topping silver teapots, gilded mirrors, clocks and a cast-iron stove, and are carved in the crestrail of a Samuel McIntire settee. The most imposing of all the museum's American ornithological treasures, measuring 5 feet high and 8 feet wide, reigns in carved and gilded splendor over the 18th-century-furniture gallery. The feistiest eagle in town may well be another gilded wood carving, this one from the early 19th century, that sits high above the sweeping marble staircase in the entrance hall of the Museum of the City of New York (Fifth Avenue at 103d Street). Poised to attack, its wings spread to their full span, it has clenched claws, a parted beak, and ferocious eyes - an eagle-image popular before the War of 1812. Realism of a different sort governed the hand of John James Audubon when he painted eagles in their habitat; in two watercolors at the New-York Historical Society, Central Park West at 77th Street, the bird is seen erect and listening, and crouched as if preparing to take flight. On view at the society, too, is the eagle-dominated desk and lectern that was made for the Speaker of the First Congress of the United States, which convened at Federal Hall in New York on April 1, 1789. The imperious eagle on the slant-topped lectern adorns - and obscures - the Sheraton-style desk designed by Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant. Architectural and folk-art eagles -adorning the tops, fronts, walls, lobbies, windows and doorways of buildings - are encountered in many unexpected places. Guarding the Seventh Avenue entrance to Madison Square Garden, for example, are two of a score of majestic pre-World War I specimens in pink granite that once graced the doorways of the old Pennsylvania Station. Eagles with widespread wings embellish likely and unlikely spots on the Avenue of the Americas - the rooftop of the Eagle Pub, at 16th Street, and the lobby of the American Broadcasting Company's executive offices, Avenue of the Americas at 54th Street. Glancing at the second-floor windows of Madison Avenue's folk-art dealers is one way of keeping abreast of their stock. An 1858 Pennsylvania album quilt in the window of America Hurrah, at 66th Street, boasts a grand eagle and other images. Art Deco eagles - the gargoyles of the Chrysler Building - can be seen from the curb at 42d Street and Lexington Avenue. And one block west, a huge eagle frames Mercury over the clock at the entrance to Grand Central Terminal. Amateur and professional photographers never tire of snapping the valiant-looking eagles on Grant's Tomb, at Riverside Drive and 123d Street, and the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, on the Drive at 89th Street. A New York writer and expert on folk art, Frederick P. Fried, has been eagle-spotting for more than 60 years, since his boyhood visits to the workshop of Charles Carmel, who carved carousel figures, including eagles. Among Mr. Fried's favorites are the ''Eagle and Prey'' - an 1860's classical study on the Central Park Mall near the band shell - and a large pre-World War I marble eagle by Karl Bitter that decorates the entrance to the Customs House at Battery Park. Also at the Battery, a rather benign eagle, created in the 1960's by Albino Manco, adorns the East Coast Memorial. Eagles continue to engage artists and restorers. Sal Polisi, a craftsman at the South Street Seaport, makes his living repairing the various historic eagles owned by the Seaport museum. He is currently working on three of the birds at the Maritime Craft Center, on the apron of Piers 15 and 16. After hunting down all the facsimiles, one can have a look at the real thing: a bald eagle is in residence at the Bronx Zoo, and a golden eagle at the zoo on Staten Island.

1032-> In Mindanao, Ancient Tribe Or 70's Hoax?
On a remote mountaintop overlooking the jungles where they live, a dozen of the world's most primitive people fell obediently to their knees as an evangelical preacher from the big city told them he was converting them to Christianity. ''You will have eternal life. No more death,'' cried the Manila preacher, Roger Arienda, and the tribesmen, receiving his message through a two-step translation, murmured, ''Aha, oho.'' The event, involving the Tasaday tribe of Mindanao island, was broadcast one recent Sunday on Mr. Arienda's weekly religious televison program. Mr. Arienda is a partisan in a growing controversy here in which this primitive group has become the focus of a tangle of modern-day rivalries. Dispute Touches Many Interests In recent weeks, new challenges to their authenticity have been raised and battle lines have been drawn that appear to involve major business interests as well as logging and mining concerns, local politicians and armed bands, scholars and newspapers. The tribesmen, seemingly obedient to the wishes of their various questioners, have alternately sworn that they are genuine Stone Age Tasaday, or that they were paid to pretend to be Tasaday, or that they were paid to say they had pretended to be Tasaday. ''I see the innocence and simplicity being layered over with deceit,'' said John Nance, an American journalist who published a book on the tribe and has now become embroiled in the controversy. ''They are trying to survive,'' he said. ''It is a classic and deep Philippine response: 'Who do you want me to be?' '' Marcos Aid Becomes Liability When they were discovered by modern man in 1970, the tribe, numbering only two or three dozen, was hailed as one of the most primitive groups to be found in many years. Anthropologists described them as food gatherers with no knowledge of agriculture or metal-working, and their language was said to contain no word for the sea or for another people. Philippine officials secured for them a vast protected zone in which they lived quietly for nearly 15 years until the departure of the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos. At that moment, everything Mr. Marcos had touched appeared to have been tainted by fraud, and a series of journalists who visited the Tasaday, finding them wearing T-shirts instead of leaves, pronounced them a hoax. Their defenders replied that the T-shirts, along with some metal tools and techniques of hunting, had been introduced in recent years by outsiders, including wives imported from a somewhat more advanced tribe. Tycoon's Motives Questioned The controversy seems only to have grown. Mr. Arienda is a partisan of the man who said he discovered the tribe, Manuel Elizalde Jr., the owner of a newspaper and heir to one of the country's most wealthy families, with extensive logging, mining, liquor and brewing interests. Under Mr. Marcos, Mr. Elizalde headed Panamin, the Cabinet-level office that handled minority affairs, and he became, Mr. Arienda said, the only god the Tasaday had known until Mr. Arienda's recent evangelical visit. In 1983, Mr. Elizalde abruptly vanished, leaving behind mystery and rumors about his motives. Early this year, he quietly reappeared to reclaim his businesses, and in an interview last week he said he had since been battling rivals for his liquor enterprise whose connections reach into the high levels of the current and former administrations. Potential Bonanza for Loggers The Tasaday controversy, he said, is an attempt to discredit him and to drive him from the country again. ''There's a lot more to it than meets the eye,'' Mr. Elizalde said, producing a blackboard on which he sketched a bewildering maze of competing business and political interests. ''The Tasaday thing took on a life of its own,'' he said. ''Logging interests, the Congress, academe all became involved.'' If the Tasaday can be shown to be a hoax, vast tracts of jungle, one of the last virgin regions in the country, might be opened to logging and mining. The competition is fierce in a region where the population has doubled since the Tasaday were discovered. At the end of his presentation, with chalk dust still lingering in the air, Mr. Elizalde said, ''In this whole case, the truth becomes insignificant. Whether the Tasaday are fake or not is really incidental.'' The Lure of Civilization To Mr. Nance, author of ''The Gentle Tasaday,'' who was on a visit to Manila, the question remained of passionate importance. Accused of everything from forcing the Tasaday to disrobe for his photographs to teaching them to make stone tools, Mr. Nance said he sometimes asked himself, in moments of despair, ''Could I possibly, in some incredible way, have been wrong?'' Like the anthropologists who first studied them and then revisited them early last year, he said it was not surprising that the tribesmen were now very different from the primitive group he had first recorded. Once the outside world had touched them, he said, there could be no turning back to the primitive ways of their past. ''What will kill them off in the end is that they like that stuff, just like anybody else,'' he said. ''They like the rice. They like the tobacco.''

1033-> In Space Station Plans, Houston Sees Dollar Signs and Symbolism
One thousand jobs and nearly $2 billion are expected to flow to the Houston area because of the space station contract announced by the space agency last week. But beyond those gains, it is the symbolism of the announcement that pleases city leaders. In the early days of the oil slump here, leaders here scrambled to diversify the economy, courting aerospace companies and other non-energy industries. Space was the frontier of the future, the sales pitch went, and what more logical a focal point for that frontier than Houston, home of the Johnson Space Center? But circumstance was not on the city's side, and the effort had barely begun when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in January 1986. The announcement last week is ''a confidence builder,'' said Steven Sandstedt, executive director of the Clear Lake Area Economic Development Foundation and a member of the group courting companies to resettle here. ''Perception is 90 percent of reality and the perception now is that the problems are past and we really are the place to be.'' $2.50 For Every Dollar What Houston is cheering about is the largest segment of a four-part contract awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to build the nation's first permanent outpost in space. The McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, along with its subcontractors, will receive $1.9 billion to build the structural framework of the station, along with the airlocks and the guidance, navigation and control systems. Although McDonnell Douglas is based in Huntington Beach, Calif., much of the work will be done at NASA's Johnson Space Center. In addition, $1.8 billion will go directly to the space center for administrative costs and payments to subcontractors. Of the total contract of $3.7 billion, 25 percent is expected to remain in the Houston area. And officials expect that every dollar spent will generate about $2.50 more for the local economy. In all, the Houston Economic Development Council expects the space station to generate $1.85 billion in the area. But what remains unclear is whether the increased activity will lure companies not working on the McDonnell Douglas team. The Grumman Corporation, which was a subcontractor on the losing bid for the project, had been talking with city leaders about increasing its operations in Houston before the NASA announcement. Now the pace of those plans appear to have slowed. A spokesman for the development council said the company was still ''reviewing the situation.'' Commercializing Space City officials emphasize, however, that they are not limiting their search to major established manufacturers. Mayor Kathy Whitmire says she hopes to promote the growth of smaller companies, backed by private investors, which might lay the foundation for the long predicted, but as yet unrealized, commercialization of space. There are only a handful of such companies in the United States, and two of the best known are here. One, Space Services Inc. of America, has developed a small expendable rocket and in 1982 it conducted the first private space launching in history. Deke Slayton, a former astronaut, is president of the company. The other, the Space Industries Corporation, has invested about $20 million in designing and planning equipment to be used in low earth orbits, according to Joseph Allen, a former shuttle astronaut who is executive vice president of the company. The company, in partnership with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, had originally expected to send its first payload into space aboard the shuttle in 1988 or 1989, Dr. Allen said. But after the Challenger disaster, those projections were pushed back about three years. Problems Attracting Customers Both companies are often cited by city leaders as proof that private commercial space ventures are possible. But they are also seen as examples of why it is neither simple nor guaranteed. ''It's a chicken and egg kind of problem, you can't attract customers until you have customers and prove you can do it,'' said Walter Cunningham, a former Apollo astronaut and chairman of the Aerospace and Technology Committee of the Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce. ''Sometimes it's better to be the second than to be the first.'' While Houston hopes for such evolution, it must depend on projects backed by the Government. And those projects, in turn, depend on the political and fiscal climate of the moment - a dependence that has city leaders worried. Already there is talk in Washington that the space station contract may fall victim to the push to balance the Federal budget. ''The level of Government spending in space is going to have a lot to do with how and when the private launch industry gets going,'' said Mark H. Daniels, special projects manager for Space Services. ''We can never assume that the money will be there,'' Dr. Allen said. ''It is the way this country's leaders operate to make a small decision, then another small decision, then another small decision. They don't make one big decision, one guarantee. That makes it very hard for us to run a business.''

1034-> New York's New Culture Chief
Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, the first to admit she was ''brazen'' in seeking the job as New York City's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, has now spent seven weeks in office, and she does not seem a bit daunted by the task. ''I am a political animal,'' she says, adding that she feels comfortable with the political system and intends to use it to help the arts, starting from the grass roots on up. She will be sworn in at City Hall next Monday as head of the embattled Department of Cultural Affairs. On Oct. 1, Dr. Campbell, who turned 40 three weeks later, took over a department demoralized and exhausted by the scandal over her predecessor, Bess Myerson. Ms. Myerson had taken a leave of absence last January and resigned from the $83,000-a-year post last April after being accused of improperly influencing a judge on behalf of her companion, who was being divorced. Right out of the starting blocks, Dr. Campbell has been charging around the boroughs to drum up support. She has been meeting with community boards and other city agencies, as well as dozens of arts groups, from the New York Arts Coalition to the New Theater of Brooklyn and Chinatown's New York History Project. Battler With the Bureaucracy She is a veteran of struggles with the city bureaucracy. A black woman with a confident, energetic, forthright manner, she transformed the Studio Museum in Harlem in its 10 years under her directorship. From a struggling, out-of-the-way community arts project lodged over a liquor store and a fried chicken outlet, she made it into a thriving black fine-arts museum with a $2 million annual budget. Now situated in the heart of Harlem, the museum the only one of its kind accredited by the American Association of Museums. As soon as the job of Cultural Affairs Commissioner was open, Dr. Campbell marched right over to David Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President. She told him, ''I'd like to put on the table some very specific ideas about what I'd like to do'' if given the position. On July 29, Mayor Koch named her to the post, effective Oct. 1. She oversees the department's $133 million yearly budget, which provides operating and capital improvement funds to 32 major institutions -including museums, theaters, zoos and botanic gardens - and grants program money to 400 more New York arts groups. The latter put on free and subsidized exhibitions and performances that have become a regular part of the city's cultural life. She describes her discretionary funds as ''tiny'' - $900,000 yearly. If not exactly an ''arts czar,'' she certainly wants to become an arts advocate, pushing for higher priorities for the arts in city budget requests. In two recent interviews, Dr. Campbell - who wrote her doctoral dissertation at Syracuse University on Romare Bearden, the contemporary black American painter - explained some of the most pressing ideas on her agenda. They include: * Setting up an ''arts stabilization fund'' to ensure the long-term fiscal stability of New York's cultural institutions, most of which, she said, are ''dramatically undercapitalized and in a state of persistent economic fragility.'' The money in the pool would come from foundations, corporations and private arts patrons. She said she would like to work with the National Arts Stabilization Fund, which was spun off several years ago from the Ford Foundation and has its headquarters in New York. She added, ''The fund has programs operating in Massachusetts, Missouri, Arizona and California, and I'd like to see one functioning in New York City.'' * Protecting and acquiring housing and work space for artists, whom she calls ''an endangered species'' in New York. ''They are being thrown out by the city or sued by landlords,'' Dr. Campbell said. Rather than ghettoizing them in such low-rent complexes as Westbeth, she prefers what has been done in Boston by the Brick Bottom Group, where artists banded together in a limited equity cooperative. The upper floors in a renovated building sold for top dollar, subsidizing the lower floors occupied by artists. ''It seems this solution could work in New York,'' she said. * Encouraging a wider audience for the arts. ''There is surprisingly little diversity in the kinds of people we see at most performances and exhibitions,'' said Dr. Campbell. ''In fact, these events are segregated events. We - and I do mean we - must make sure that cultural services reach as wide an audience as possible.'' She mentioned as one possibility subsidized tickets for students and their families to 'The Mahabharata,' now running in Brooklyn. At the Studio Museum in Harlem, she said, ''we made an all-out, aggressive effort to expand beyond Harlem to 'downtown' audiences.'' ''A big part of my agenda is education,'' the new commissioner said. ''I am struck by the fact that very often, you see real excellence and energy in a school where there is a strong cultural component.'' Among the most effective programs now reaching out to the city's public school pupils, Dr. Campbell said, are the ''Poets in the Schools'' project; the Repertorio Espanol theater company; the Wave Hill archeological dig in Riverdale Park, where children are being involved in the excavation of 18th-century Indian artifacts, and the Ballet Hispanico.

1035-> SELLING FASHIONABLE CASTOFFS
WHEN ''The Real Thing'' closed on Broadway, the costumes from the play ended up at a Litchfield consignment shop. Clothing racks that hold robes and trousers that were worn on Broadway is a tip-off that this is no ordinary thrift shop. And there are other hints, among them a sign on the wall next to a ruffly pink cotton skirt and blouse which says, ''Ooo la la, Parisian designer Chantal Thomas at the Litchfield Consignment Shop.'' Run by Vesta Williams and her six daughters, the shop opened nearly three years ago and is intended to bring high fashion to the second-hand clothing business. ''We don't have anything here that we wouldn't wear ourselves,'' said Karen Hartmann, one of the daughters, as she displayed such items as leather-trimmed black overalls with matching calf-length boots, lacy camisoles and cashmere sweaters. The shop is a collaborative effort, run by Mrs. Williams, 60 years old, of Bethel, and her daughters, Mrs. Hartmann, also of Bethel, and Lois Kearney, 39, of Litchfield, Vesta Gabrielle, 27, of New Preston, Cynthia, 30, of Danbury, and Lassona, 17. Another daughter, Ivy Meyer, lives in West Germany and is currently visiting. Collectively, the women call themselves the Seven Sisters Company, with Mrs. Williams designated as an ''honorary sister.'' Indeed, the shop seems very much a sisterly undertaking, although the women are careful to give ample credit to their Mrs. Williams's husband, Morgan, 65, a retired Government quality-control agent who did most of the shop's renovations. The shop opened in September 1984, but its roots stretch back to years ago in New York City, where Mrs. Williams found shopping for second-hand clothes the only viable way to clothe her large family. It is a skill she passed on to her daughters. ''We all love thrift shopping and we all love good quality,'' said Mrs. Kearney. ''It's a thrill to go to a tag sale; I can tell a cashmere sweater and zero-in on it, and get it for 25 cents.'' The sisters love a bargain, but they also know fashions. In 1983, three of them began modeling careers in West Germany, where a few years earlier Mrs. Hartmann had moved after marrying a German. Her sisters occasionally visited and Mrs. Meyer had also moved there. Mrs. Meyer, who is 5 feet 11 inches tall, was working in an orthodontist's office in West Germany when a co-worker, intrigued by her height, told her of a friend who was organizing a fashion show and needed models. When she said that she had two tall sisters, their modeling careers were launched. Eventually, Mrs. Meyer and Cynthia dropped out of modeling, but Mrs. Hartmann still works as a runway model in Europe for the Hermes, Yves St. Lauren and Jil Sander fashion houses. Like her sisters, Mrs. Meyer credits her mother for her taste in fashion. ''When her mother was young, they weren't looking for black models, but, if they had, they would have had a good one,'' Mrs. Meyer said. ''She has class. She was voguish, she was bold and outstanding, she was never conventional, never conservative. And, of course, none of us are particularly shy or conservative, either.'' The women said Mrs. Kearney came up with the idea for the shop, which they immediately embraced. They discussed the idea, then waited for Mrs. Hartmann to return from one of her modeling stints in Europe. By the following month, they had rented the store, which had been vacant for a while, and was in poor condition. ''My father and our husbands came over and did what had to be done,'' said Mrs. Kearney. ''The cosmetics are still not what a high-fashion shop should be,'' she continued, pointing out the unfinished ceilings. ''But we want people to feel at home here.'' That sense of hominess extends to the price range, which can range from $5 for a cashmere sweater with a tiny tear, to about $250 for a wide-shouldered cotton dress with leather trim by the Chiwitt, a German designer, which if new would sell for $600 to $700, said Mrs. Hartmann. Not all the clothing are designer fashions; there is a shrimp-colored jumpsuit for $25, for example. The women also make sure that they stock larger sizes, because, said Mrs. Williams, ''We want to make certain there is something for everyone.'' And they keep a corner filled with bric-a-brac and books, ''designed to keep the men happy while their wives shop,'' said Mrs. Hartmann. The sisters will even keep children occupied while parents comb through the racks. As to dividing the workload, the women make it seem effortless. ''We divide the workload naturally, by talent,'' said Cynthia. ''Lois is here everyday because she lives the closest,'' she said of Mrs. Kearney, who lives in Litchfield with her husband and two children.''We call Lois the boss,'' said Mrs. Hartmann, amidst a background of giggles. ''Now,'' Cynthia continued, ''I do the advertising and I'm the store's spokesman because I have a natural ability . . .'' ''To talk,'' interrupted Mrs. Hartmann. As for the other tasks, Mrs. Meyer is assigned the job of ''offering constructive criticism'' because she seldom sees the store and can look at it more objectively. Vesta Gabrielle is the chief cookie-maker, turning out shoeboxes filled with oatmeal cookies for her sisters to snack on, and Lassona, who is graduating from Bethel High School next month, ''helps keep us in touch with what the teen-agers want.'' Mrs. Hartmann decorates the store, and the women take turns staffing the shop. But Mrs. Hartmann's contributions go beyond the decor; because of her European connections, she keeps the shop stocked with fashionable clothing. Her specialty is persuading her fellow models in Europe to consign their castoffs to the shop, and she returns to Litchfield regularly with racks of clothing. ''Europe is ahead of us in fashion,'' Mrs. Hartmann said. ''They're getting rid of things there that are just coming into style.'' The Broadway connection is another consigner, this time a friend whom they will identify only as being connected with Neil Simon's plays. So, they are waiting for a call that will summon them to pick up the costumes from ''The Odd Couple,'' which has closed. Personal attention is also important to these shop owners. Often, they attach notes to items, with suggestions for accessories or just a fun message; a swimsuit may have a note attached that reads, ''See you in the pool, Esther.'' They let shoppers who prefer to browse alone do so, but they said they love solving wardrobe problems, or taking on a challenge. ''We have a lot of guys come in,'' said Mrs. Kearney. ''Guys who don't like shopping, but they have to go somewhere formal. They'll come in and leave with a tuxedo, cummerbund, shirt and shoes. But we're very honest. If something doesn't look good on a person, we'll tell them. And we've had people come back and tell us what a smashing success they were.'' They are also pleased with the town's reaction to their store; last fall, it was the only consignment shop invited to join several retailers for a fashion show sponsored by the Junior Women's Club of Litchfield, they pointed out. And, as to the shop's financial status, ''we have never lost a penny since the day we opened,'' said Mrs. Hartmann. But, they acknowledged, things could be better. Next year, they plan to add a line of high-fashion furs, again courtesy of Mrs. Hartmann's European consigners. And, this summer, they plan to send out brochures. ''But this won't be just any brochure,'' Mrs. Hartmann said. ''It will be filled with stories, and articles about the clothes that are coming in, and sketches done by Ivy and Cynthia. Just like our shop, it will be unique.''

1036-> Bank of Boston In Big Write-Off Of Latin Loans
The Bank of Boston Corporation, the nation's 13th-largest bank holding company, yesterday became the first major American bank to acknowledge that a significant portion of its Latin American loans was worthless. The Bank of Boston said it took the action because it believed the economic situation in Latin American was getting worse, not better. The move could lead to pressure for similar steps by other global banking companies, which are grappling with problems from energy, real estate and agricultural loans. The Bank of Boston said it was writing off $200 million of its $1 billion in loans to Latin America, which means the bank will remove these loans from its balance sheet, having deemed them uncollectible. $430 Million Reserve Established The bank, which has more than $30 billion in assets, also said it was establishing a $430 million reserve for losses on its remaining $800 million in Latin loans. And the bank said it would no longer record any interest on that $800 million in loans. Like other major lenders, the Bank of Boston last spring established reserves for its Latin loans equal to 25 percent of such loans. But with its latest actions, the banking company's reserves for losses on its remaining Latin portfolio equal more than 50 percent of its lending there. Bank accounting for bad loans is a two-step process. A bank starts by estimating future losses and setting aside reserves for those losses. This ''provision'' reduces a bank's profits and shareholders' equity. Later, when the bank actually writes off the loan, it simultaneously lowers the reserve; at that time, the reserve is no longer needed because the loans have gone off the books. Since the bank has already accounted for the bad loans in its profit-and-loss statement, the write-offs have no additional effect on earnings. Yesterday, Bank of Boston declined to estimate the fourth-quarter effects of the increase in its reserves. But it said it expected to be only marginally profitable for this year after earning $61 million in the first nine months. The fourth-quarter loss, therefore, would likely be slightly less than $60 million. Whether the true giants of American banking - Citibank, Chase, the Bank of America, Manufacturers Hanover and the rest - will follow the Bank of Boston's move is unclear. The Bank of Boston's loans to the developing world pale compared with those of the New York-based bank holding companies; Citibank's loans to the region exceed $10 billion, for instance. But bankers watch one another's moves closely and often move in herds, and they can be pressed by regulators, shareholders and auditors to account for similar loans in like fashion. Last spring, when Citibank did not actually write off its Latin loans but instead set aside $3 billion in reserves for losses on them, other banking companies nationwide followed suit in a matter of days. ''They will certainly have to pay attention,'' said George M. Salem, the director of bank research at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''The pressures that might come from various constituencies would cause the money-center banks to consider it very seriously.'' The Bank of Boston said it had consulted with the Comptroller of the Currency before acting. In Washington, an agency spokeswoman confirmed that bank examiners had been contacted. She emphasized that other banks would be encouraged to make their own decisions as to whether to follow suit. The Bank of Boston's announcement was made late in the day, so other bankers had little time to digest it and there was no chance for the stock market to respond immediately. The initial indications, however, were that other banks would try to avoid taking similar steps. At Citibank, for instance, William Koplowitz, the spokesman for the international division, said, ''We don't view Bank of Boston's action as a precedent. They made a judgment call based on their particular situation.'' Bankers Trust and Chemical Bank both declined comment. Focus on New England Yesterday's moves fit in with the Bank of Boston's previously announced plans to de-emphasize its international operations. While it has lent to Latin America for much of the 20th century, acting as a leading banker for leather tanners and sheep farmers in Argentina since 1917 and for coffee growers in Brazil since 1947, the bank has recently been focusing on its headquarters region of New England. The other money-center banks, however, have said they remain committed to the developing world. In addition, thanks to a thriving New England economy, the Bank of Boston has been among the nation's most profitable banks, putting it in a better position to take yesterday's actions. Profits at the big banks in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, by comparison, have been mediocre at best. The New York banks in particular have seen their shareholders' equity - a cushion against losses - depleted to unsatisfactorily low levels by loan losses. ''Everything comes down to affordability,'' Mr. Salem of Prudential-Bache said. But the major banks may be forced to take some action along the lines of the Bank of Boston's, if only because the condition of many of their Latin loans has deteriorated in recent months. Worsening Situation Seen Indeed, in a telephone interview from Boston, Alan L. McKinnon, the Bank of Boston's chief financial officer, said the bank decided to give a more realistic accounting for its Latin American loans after concluding the chances of collecting on them had dimmed further. Mr. McKinnon cited trends in the financial markets, where Latin American loans are traded and where prices have fallen recently to as low as 40 cents on the dollar. He also cited reports that Argentina might declare a moratorium on its foreign debt, and a recent meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, of Latin American heads of state in which officials called for a lowering of interest rates on the debt. ''There is just a general perception, among analysts and others, that perhaps the less-developed-country loans are more and more questionable,'' Mr. McKinnon said. ''Recent developments have made us reassess where we stood. In our minds, we had to do more.''

1037-> In Petition, Lawyers and Scholars Urge Senate to Reject Judge Bork
More than 90 prominent lawyers and law school deans have signed a statement urging the Senate to reject the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork. The petition, distributed by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and made public today, assailed Judge Bork for advocating ''constitutional interpretations that would diminish civil rights and liberties.'' The committee's board of trustees has 158 members and it could not be determined exactly how many refused to sign the petition. Ninety-one committee members did sign. Among those signing the statement were the deans of Harvard and New York University law schools, two former Democratic attorneys general, two former heads of the American Bar Association and former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance. The release of the committee's statement was one of several developments on the eve of the confirmation hearings for Judge Bork before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearings, which come 11 weeks after President Reagan nominated Judge Bork, begin Tuesday and are expected to last two to three weeks. Reagan Assails Bork Critics In a speech today Mr. Reagan assailed critics of Judge Bork, saying that ''too often character assassination has replaced debate in principle here in Washington.'' Also today a number of former Government officials and jurists said they expected to testify in Judge Bork's behalf at the confirmation hearings, including the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren E. Burger, and former President Ford. Mr. Ford, who was in Las Vegas for a speaking engagement, described Judge Bork as ''the most qualified candidate for the Supreme Court in the last 50 years.'' The statement by the lawyers committee was the first time in the group's 24-year history that it had urged the defeat of a judicial nomination. Among the members who refused to sign the petition was Lloyd Cutler, a Washington lawyer and one of the group's co-founders. Many prominent members of the legal establishment have been taking positions on the Bork nomination. Among those supporting Judge Bork, for example, are Carla A. Hills, a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and now a lawyer who has been active in the Republican Party, and Mr. Cutler, a self-described liberal Democrat who was President Carter's legal counselor. Among the most recent dissenters to the Bork nomination is William T. Coleman Jr., the former Secretary of Transportation in the Ford Administration. Mr. Coleman, a Republican who was part of the American Bar Association committee that unanimously supported Judge Bork's nomination six years ago to be a member of the Federal appeals court here, explains why he now opposes the nomination in an article scheduled to appear in The New York Times on Tuesday. ''I oppose appointing to the court someone whose negative views are so settled and public,'' he says in the article. Organized in 1963 While it is too early to tell whether statements such as the one by the lawyers committee will influence undecided senators, it tends to undercut the argument of Mr. Bork's proponents that those opposed to his nomination are mostly ideologically rigid liberals. The Washington-based lawyers committee was organized in 1963 at the request of President Kennedy who sought the help of private lawyers in solving the nation's civil rights problems. Among those signing the committee's petition were several Wall Street lawyers, including Thomas D. Barr of the firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Fred N. Fishman, a partner with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hayes & Handler, and Herbert M. Wachtell of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Also signing were two attorneys general under President Johnson, Ramsey Clark and Nicholas deB. Katzenbach. In Mr. Reagan's speech today, before an audience drawn from the National Alliance of Business here, he urged critics to stick to the issues regarding Judge Bork. ''Destroy someone's reputation and you don't have to talk about what he stands for,'' he said. ''Well, I hope Judge Bork's critics will be candid about why those oppose him and not fabricate excuses for attacking him personally. That way, we can have a full and open debate on an important constitutional principle, and when the votes are counted, America will win.'' A member of the lawyers committee who opposed its statement, and who asked not to be identified, said several prominent former Government officials and lawyers who support Judge Bork's nomination are considering testifying in his behalf. These include the former Attorneys General Griffin B.Bell and Edward H. Levi and the former Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Also expected to testify, according to the committee member, are two of Mr. Bork's former Justice Department colleagues, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and former Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. The refusal of the two men in 1972 to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, led to Judge Bork being called on to carry out the move as Solicitor General.

1038-> Runaway Train Chief Left to Get Candy Bar
Six unmanned locomotives that went out of control for 30 miles until they were deliberately crashed into a row of boxcars slipped away from their engineer when he left to buy a candy bar, a police officer said today. Donald Silk, the engineer, telephoned the Gardner police officer, Robert Babineau, after he realized that the connected locomotives had vanished, and the two drove through three towns at breakneck speed Monday, trying to catch the train at crossings. But the six locomotives were always a step ahead, Officer Babineau said, adding, ''He thought that if the train was rolling slow enough, he could get on them.'' The officer said the engineer had told him he did not know how the idling train had slipped into gear.

1039-> North and Poindexter At Bush Holiday Gala
Lieut. Col. Oliver North and retired Rear Adm. John Poindexter were among the guests last week at one of Vice President Bush's Christmas parties. ''They are among the people routinely invited,'' said Steve Hart, Mr. Bush's acting press secretary. ''He's had a long-term relationship with both men, and he won't exclude them because they're down.'' Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North testified last summer about their involvement in the Administration's secret sales of weapons to Iran and diversion of some profits to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. They are also among targets of the investigation by Lawrence Walsh, the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair. The Vice President and his wife, Barbara, generally invite members of the Administration, news media, Supreme Court, Congress, their staff, family and friends to their half-dozen Christmastime gatherings, Mr. Hart said. Invitations were sent to about 1,000 persons this year, he added. Colonel North was dismissed from his post at the National Security Council, and Admiral Poindexter resigned as President Reagan's national security adviser following disclosures about the affair last year.

1040-> JEROME M. LANE
Jerome M. Lane, a deputy attorney general of New Jersey from 1969 to 1978, died of complications from surgery Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 55 years old and lived in Fair Lawn, N.J. Mr. Lane, who practiced law in Hackensack, was an expert on rent control. He had been a longtime counsel to the Fair Lawn Rent Leveling Board, town representative to the Bergen County Democratic Committee and a former president of the Fair Lawn United Democratic Club. Surviving are his wife, the former Phyllis Bressler; his father, Samuel, of Manhattan and Woodland Hills, Calif.; two sons, Jeffrey, of Paterson, N.J., and David, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Tracey Schwartz, of Livingston, N.J.

1041-> Reagan Confidant Urged Pardons in Iran Case
William P. Clark, the former national security adviser, said today that he wrote President Reagan at the end of the Iran-contra hearings in August asking him to grant pardons to Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. He said he urged that the pardons be granted before the independent counsel in the Iran-contra affair concluded his investigation into the secret sales of weapons to Iran and the diversion to profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Clark, a longtime confidant of the President's, said he would not discuss Mr. Reagan's response, asserting that ''in 22 years, I have never discussed a Presidential communication.'' Mr. Clark who was national security adviser from 1982 to 1983, confirmed sections of the letter that were quoted in Wednesday's edition of The Washington Post. But he declined to elaborate. 'In the National Interest' ''I think the letter stands for itself,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in central California, where he is now practicing law. ''Beyond that, I feel it's clearly in the national interest that this matter be concluded, that it not go on.'' In the letter, Mr. Clark said that Admiral Poindexter and Colonel Northhad undertaken their roles in the affair ''at considerable professional risk'' and ''without consideration for personal gain.'' Admiral Poindexter resigned as national security adviser and Colonel North was dismissed from the National Security Council staff last November. The letter asserted that a pardon ''is not necessarily a recognition that any criminal conduct has occurred.'' Such an action, it added, ''would simply be an expression of your conclusion that the story has been told, that the people involved have suffered enough, and that neither they, the office of the President, nor the country should be forced to endure an extended criminal trial in which the central issue related to the creation and implementation of your foreign policy.'' In addition to the response from Mr. Reagan, Mr. Clark said, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., the White House counsel, sent a reply dated Aug. 21 that said in part, ''This is not the time for us to engage in a discussion of pardons.'' Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter have been identified as targets of the investigation by Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel in the Iran-contra affair. Mr. Walsh is now presenting evidence to a Federal grand jury. Questions for Reagan Mr. Reagan is preparing written answers to questions from Mr. Walsh, the White House said today. The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the questions were received Oct. 10 and the President would respond in the next few weeks. He would say little else about the questions. Mr. Fitzwater said the President ''was not a subject of investigation.'' There has been no indication that Mr. Walsh will bring any charges against the President.

1042-> Salvadoran Illusions Keep Outpacing Reality
To the Editor: Your report on the return of the rebel leaders Ruben Zamora and Guillermo Ungo to El Salvador after seven years in exile (Nov. 22) was misleading in its presentation of the facts of recent Salvadoran history. The most dubious assertion is that ''rebel officials themselves concede that they are risking attack from both ultra-rightist and ultra-leftist extremists.'' It is not credible that any officials of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, which Mr. Zamora and Mr. Ungo head, would have made such a statement. To the contrary, both the Democratic Revolutionary Front and its armed ally, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, have made it clear they will hold the government of Jose Napoleon Duarte responsible for any violence to the two returning leaders. There have never been any reported threats from the left against the Democratic Revolutionary Front leaders - neither from any group within the Farabundo Marti nor any group in the trade union federation. (Nor are there any known ''ultra-leftist'' break-away factions from either of these two principal formations of the Salvadoran left; indeed, by all accounts, there is now an unprecedented degree of unity within both organizations, and both have hailed the return of the two leaders.) On the other hand, there have been numerous threats against Mr. Zamora and Mr. Ungo from government and military officials and from the ''clandestine'' Radio Libertad, which is widely regarded as the mouthpiece of the rightist death squads. The contention that ''ultra-leftist extremists'' are equally responsible for the assassinations of human-rights advocates, trade unionists and opposition political figures has no basis in fact. But this false evenhandedness has been useful to the Government of President Duarte and his backers in Washington. President Reagan in his first term once suggested that the rightist death squads were really just leftist guerrillas disguised as rightist killers to discredit the government. Soon afterward his aides conceded there was no evidence to support the claim. Likewise, after the Oct. 26 assassination of the human rights activist Herbert Anaya, President Duarte alleged that the Farabundo Marti had killed him to create a martyr. The real purpose of such statements is to obscure the responsibility of the Duarte Government for its inability or unwillingness to stop the death squads and bring their members to justice.

1043-> Publisher Asks Reversal On Salinger Biography
Random House asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit yesterday to reconsider its Dec. 29 decision barring publication of a biography, ''J. D. Salinger: A Writing Life,'' by Ian Hamilton. The court held that the author made unfair use of some 70 unpublished letters written by Mr. Salinger. That decision was handed down by a two-judge panel, the third member of the panel having died before he could write his opinion. Random House officials said the issues involved were so important that they wanted the case heard by the full panel. The publisher's petition yesterday described the Dec. 29 decision as amounting to prior restraint. It said there was no precedent for enjoining publication of a work of scholarly biography or history, adding that such an extreme remedy theatened basic First Amendment rights.

1045-> RUNNING DOGS AND CREDIT CARDS: CLASS STRUGGLE AND A CHINESE DICTIONARY
THE patterns of color formed by the bindings of books on the shelves in my study have become as familiar and deeply ingrained in my memory as the composition of any painting with which I have lived. There is a vein of yellows and greens where the novels are gathered on the higher shelves above my desk. Splashes of orange and red proliferate to the right where books on China's Cultural Revolution reside. To the left, there is a drab wasteland of white, brown and gray that marks the repository of documents issued by the various plenums and sessions of People's Congresses and Central Committees of the Chinese Communist Party. And, just above my desk are the blues and greens of the dictionaries, encyclopedias and other reference works. Over time, these random configurations of color have become as fixed in my mind as the ocean and hills that lie outside my windows. Moreover, the placement of each individual book is as known to me as the keys of a piano are to a pianist. I imagine that even in the dark I could reach up, find any one and pluck it from its place with as much ease as a virtuoso finding the right note. One of the books I use most frequently is A Chinese-English Dictionary, which is perched between Roget's Thesaurus and the New Columbia Encyclopedia. This large green volume with gold-embossed binding was compiled in China by the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute and published by the Commercial Press in 1981. I have turned to it so often that by now I can unshelve it without even looking up. It has become such a familiar presence that once, when a friend borrowed it, the gap on the shelf made me feel as if a beloved piece of furniture had been removed. But what has become even more familiar than its physical presence is the militant language with which its 976 pages of entries have always spoken to me. Compiled during the last half of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entries are redolent of the kind of defiant Maoist phraseology that then characterized almost all Chinese writing. On the very first page the compilers of the dictionary declared: ''A Chinese-English Dictionary was begun in 1971 according to a directive from our Great Leader Chairman Mao Zedong under the benevolent care of our beloved Premier Zhou Enlai, and was finished under the guidance of our brilliant Chairman Hua [ Guofeng ] 's great strategic decision to grasp class struggle as the key link in running the country.'' Often when I have nothing to look up, I find myself browsing aimlessly through this dictionary like an archeologist sifting through earth from an excavation, copying down bits of old socialist rhetoric and quotations from Mao Zedong himself. Fengxian: Risk, hazard, danger: ''Those who wage revolution fear no danger.'' Shouxian: Of first importance: ''To be the first to arrive at the construction site. In the first place; first of all; above all.'' Shisi: To pledge one's life: ''To be ready to die in defence of Red political power.'' Xie: Evil; heretical; irregular: ''To hit at the evil influence of capitalism,'' or, ''Corrupted by bourgeois ideology, he took to evil ways.'' Sixintadi: To be dead set; to be hellbent: ''Only a handful of people were dead set on following the anti-party clique.'' Gen: Root: ''Only by sticking to the socialist road can we do away with the root cause of poverty,'' or, ''He made the mistake, but its source lay with the class enemy.'' Gai: Change; transform: ''If we don't combat and prevent revisionism, the whole of China will change its color.'' Such language was once so indelibly a part of China that the country seemed almost unimaginable without it. But, no sooner had my dictionary been published than the political reforms, which Deng Xiaoping initiated in late 1978, began radically to alter the face of the country so that it shifted underneath its language just the way a foundation heaved up by the freezing and thawing of the ground sometimes moves beneath a house. Phrases such as ''capitalist roader,'' ''counterrevolutionary,'' ''poisonous weed,'' ''running dog of American imperialism,'' ''self-criticism,'' ''bourgeois elements'' and even ''comrade,'' which had once seemed as eternal as the Great Wall itself, vanished from the public lexicon and were replaced by a whole new vocabulary of such words as: ''bonus,'' ''disco,'' ''private enterprise,'' ''washing machine,'' ''wealth,'' ''credit card,'' ''lipstick,'' ''entrepreneur,'' ''necktie,'' ''profit'' and ''Mr. and Mrs.'' As language evolved to keep pace with reality, expressions that only a few years before had been considered too dangerously bourgeois to use suddenly began to appear in print. These articles were so different in tone and subject matter that, whenever I turned to my dictionary it seemed more and more out of synch with the times. Last fall The People's Daily (the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party) announced that the paper would begin running a column on bridge by Alan Truscott, based partly on his column in The New York Times, and Katherine Wei, a Chinese-American. The Beijing Daily disclosed that a district in the capital had just opened a new privately run credit cooperative that would ''break the monopoly of state-run banks.'' The Yangcheng Evening News heralded the opening of a new ''international golf club'' in the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, lamenting that the incomplete facilities did not entitle it to an A rating. The China Daily ran a headline proclaiming, ''Bodybuilders' Bikinis Stir Controversy,'' and then a week later reassured the country's new entrepreneurs: ''Don't Worry, Get Rich, Bo Yibo [ vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Central Advisory Committee ] Assures Businesses.'' The Liberation Army Daily (official organ of the People's Liberation Army) reported that Qian Xuelin, a renowned Chinese scientist, believed that flying saucers were a ''natural phenomenon.'' The Beijing Daily declared that a ''stock scheme'' had granted a ''new lease on life'' to a local tourist bus company. The China Youth News announced that new businesses that specialized in renting fashion models (''pretty girls'' and ''stalwart young men'' at $20 U.S. per day) to shoot advertisements were opening up in Canton. Whenever I turned to A Chinese-English Dictionary to look something up, I felt as if I were entering the time-warped universe of one of those reprinted turn-of-the-century Sears, Roebuck mail-order catalogues filled with churns, wood stoves and antiquated water pumps. For instance, I looked up kaipi (''to open up; to start''), from the article about a forthcoming bridge column in The People's Daily, to find it followed by the citation among the compounds of characters: ''The birth of the Communist Party ushered in a new epoch in Chinese history.'' Looking up the word minjian: (''among the people''), from a Beijing Daily account about the opening of a new local credit cooperative, I stumbled across a citation for an adjacent compound of characters that read, ''The reactionary government fed on the flesh and blood of the people.'' Checking gei (''to give''), from The Beijing Daily article about the ''new stock scheme,'' I found ''The Party has given us strength and courage. We will not grant democratic rights to reactionaries.'' From the headline telling of a rash of new modeling agencies that had just sprung up in Canton, I checked chuxian (''to appear; to emerge; to arise; to present'') and found it illuminated by the citation ''The construction site presented an exciting scene of each one vying with the other in the socialist emulation campaign.'' And when I looked up the English word ''model,'' moter, instead of finding any allusion to the world of fashion, the citation read: ''Model worker. . . . Model member of the Communist Youth League.'' But at the beginning of this year, student demonstrations favoring democracy broke out all across China, and the Chinese Communist Party launched a counterattack and purge that hearkened back to the old Maoist days. Hu Yaobang, the party Secretary General, was suddenly dismissed from office for ''grave errors,'' the renowned investigative journalist Liu Binyan, the Marxist theorist and writer Wang Ruowang and the crusading advocate of Western democracy and former vice president of the Chinese Science and Technology University, Fang Lizhi, were all expelled from the Chinese Communist Party. The press began once again to rail against ''bourgeois liberalism,'' ''wholesale Westernization'' and to vilify those who harbored ''right deviationist ideas,'' who ''slandered the socialist system,'' who promoted ''spiritual pollution'' and who ''openly incited the people to change the true color of the party.'' With newspapers and magazines once again filled with such strident and undemocratic language, my dictionary abruptly reacquired relevance. I was reminded that, while sometimes it may have seemed to have been out of touch with Mr. Deng's ''new'' China, it was in truth maintaining its own kind of lonely witness to a part of the Chinese political system that, although temporarily obscured, was still far from passe. Reading the newly militant headlines about the need to re-establish the primacy of ''party leadership,'' the ''dictatorship of the proletariat'' and the urgency of remaking Chinese Communist ideology into a ''bastion of socialist purity,'' I felt grateful to my dictionary for having so insistently served as a reminder of this authoritarian aspect of China that no superficial reform was likely to erase. I realized that each time I had taken it from the shelf, opened its green binding and let my fingers run down the columns of characters and compounds, far from plunging me back into a useless reliquary, it had actually been speaking in a language still current on one side of China's divided political personality. In its subtle but insistent way, far from being irrelevant, it had been administering a corrective antidote against exactly the kind of historical amnesia that often grips socialist countries when, without changing the unseen political fundament, they decide to cashier one superficial ''political line'' and to proclaim another. When, for instance, sometime after my dictionary was published, authorities at the Commercial Press began slipping loose-leaf versions of a corrected preface (minus the glowingly socialist encomiums to old party leaders) into each new volume, it was tempting to believe that China had at last moved beyond its past. But as the aftermath of the student demonstrations has shown, there is a part of China still deeply anchored in the era of Chairman Mao and all that he stood for. Unlike party propaganda tracts that can be quickly replaced, chapters of history books that can be hastily re-edited, or photographs of officials that can be discreetly airbrushed to make one or another defrocked leader vanish, the real innards of a dictionary, like those of an encyclopedia, are far too complex to be altered by minor revisionist surgery. Deeply ingrained, they are not so easily purged. And, once it has been widely distributed, a dictionary cannot be readily recalled from service, particularly if there is no alternative to replace it. And so, volumes remain like time capsules on shelves such as my own. Though sometimes they may seem to be speaking from the vantage point of a distant and irrelevant past, they are actually a form of living memory that continues to tell a truth even when leaders and propagandists from one faction or another temporarily wish to forget it. Like all good works of history, they are reminders that society's political characteristics are deeply rooted; that while they may sometimes seem to have disappeared, often they have only gone underground where, like dormant genes, they wait to manifest themselves again at some later date. So, as long as A Chinese-English Dictionary clearly defines the words I wish to look up, I do not care if it does so in the roseate language of Mao's revolution. For, far from distorting their meanings, it only adds to them this other dimension inherited from China's only partially interred past.

1046-> COMPANY NEWS; S.E.C. Files Brief Backing Pickens
The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals in San Francisco supporting an investment group led by T. Boone Pickens Jr. in its battle for control of the Newmont Mining Corporation. Newmont Mining had filed suit in Federal court in San Francisco seeking to block a tender offer by the group, Ivanhoe Partners, on the ground that the sale of $1.1 billion in ''junk bonds'' by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which would be used by Ivanhoe to purchase the Newmont shares, had not been completed when the formal bid was announced. In its brief, the S.E.C. agreed with Mr. Pickens's contention that Federal securities laws allow a bidder to begin a tender offer without firm financing in place. An attorney for Newmont said that the company would have no immediate comment on the S.E.C. action.

1047-> Business and the Law; U.S. Lawyers Head for Japan
AFTER more than 30 years, the United States has resumed exporting lawyers to Japan. While Japan's Ministry of Justice has licensed only a handful of foreign lawyers so far, the new law permitting them to practice there is expected to prove quite lucrative. ''It's a tremendous potential market,'' said Roger W. Rosendahl, who served as the American Bar Association's liaison to the United States Government team that negotiated the new rule with Japan. ''They are world bankers and tremendous creditors at a time when the United States is a tremendous debtor. The baton has passed, and it isn't coming back soon.'' Mr. Rosendahl, a partner at Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, said that a clear indication of the interest of American firms can be found in their willingness to pay considerable sums of money to set up offices in Japan. ''The investment requirement is tremendous -four times the rent and salaries and the like,'' he said, comparing Japanese costs with those in the United States. ''This underscores the perceived potential which I believe is a correct perception.'' Until the United States occupation ended in 1952, Japan had about 80 foreign lawyers, mostly Americans. But within three years afterward, Japan had changed its laws, restricting all foreign lawyers. It took a decade of negotiations before Japan finally allowed foreigners to practice law there again. Last year the Japanese Parliament passed a law allowing lawyers outside of Japan to be licensed as foreign legal consultants and to become special members of the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations. In 1977, one American firm, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCoy, received special permission from the Ministry of Justice to maintain an office in Tokyo. The firm's chief lawyer in Japan at the time was Isaac Shapiro, a native of Japan whose Jewish parents settled in Tokyo after escaping from Germany in the 1930's. Mr. Shapiro, who left Tokyo in 1946 to study in the United States, has been instrumental in getting American lawyers admitted to Japan. He is now at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The firm is one of two that has lawyers who were admitted earlier this month to practice in Japan. The three lawyers are E. Anthony Zaloom, of Skadden, Arps, and Edward Frank Greene and Robert Thomson Greig, from Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. In a telephone interview from Tokyo, Mr. Zaloom said that his most important work would be to represent Japanese companies interested in investing in or acquiring American concerns. ''We finished our admission procedure about 10 days ago and we have been getting calls every day,'' he said. ''With the yen as high as it is, it makes it easy for them to buy American companies.'' Mr. Zaloom also said he expects his firm to do considerable work involving international finance, as well as representing American clients with Japanese interests. Foreigners still cannot counsel clients about Japanese law. In addition, Japan will only accept American lawyers with at least five years experience who come from areas that allow Japanese lawyers to practice. As a result, only lawyers from New York, California, Michigan, Hawaii and Washington, D.C., will be allowed in for now. But lawyers in other areas are not particularly concerned that they will lose Japanese clients to firms that have begun to get a toehold in Tokyo. ''I don't see how this change will have an effect on our operations,'' said Gerald Fink, a partner at the firm of Masuda, Funai, Eifert & Mitchell, which represents about 300 Japanese clients in Chicago. ''You get and maintain clients through the nature of your work and the quality of your work, and we're not worried about it, even if someone has a shingle in Tokyo.'' Japan has about 13,000 practicing lawyers, or bengoshi as they are called. But that number is deceptively low, according to Mr. Shapiro, because those lawyers perform the same type of work as English barristers - they are responsible for court appearances. More than 100,000 Japanese lawyers handle corporate work and other counseling, Mr. Shapiro said. So far, American lawyers have found the application process laborious, but by no means insurmountable. At least two dozen lawyers have applied for licenses, and firms such as Davis Polk & Wardwell, Shearman & Sterling and Sullivan & Cromwell of New York and Morrison & Foerster of San Francisco are hoping to open offices by the end of the year.

1051-> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: VAGARIES OF THE GOETZ TRIAL
''Those are the pro-Goetz people over there - we're anti-Goetz,'' a man explained to passers-by as he distributed fliers for a lunchtime rally in lower Manhattan last week. The two groups - one with signs and chanting marchers, the other quieter, generally with leaflets - had staked out opposite corners of the court building at 111 Centre Street, where the trial of Bernhard H. Goetz was proceeding in Room 572. The more vocal group portrayed Mr. Goetz as a racist who shot four teen-agers in a Manhattan subway car in 1984 because they were black and he was white, not - as Mr. Goetz contends - because he believed the four were about to rob and beat him. The other group called Mr. Goetz a hero who was ''defending the right of every New Yorker to safely ride the subways and walk the streets.'' The pro-Goetz people were drumming up support for a larger rally that was to be held last Wednesday, but it rained that day so the rally was postponed. Waiting for Goetz Both groups have become a part of the quirky tapestry of Mr. Goetz's trial. There are gawkers, reporters and publicity seekers - like the record promoter who came to distribute copies of a would-be hit called ''Subway Vigilante.'' And there are others who are simply curious and want to see the thin blond man around whom so many events and feelings have turned. Every day after court adjourns, many of them congregate outside the building's rear entrance to wait for Mr. Goetz, his lawyers, and the burly private investigator who always walks at Mr. Goetz's elbow. ''There he is, in the white shirt,'' a young man with a Super-8 camera said one recent evening. He was in a group of people who were peering through the glass doors to get a glimpse. Mr. Goetz, a 39-year-old electrical engineer, is always easy to spot, partly because his face is so famous, but also because he always wears the same thing to court: jeans and a plain, long-sleeved shirt, the sleeves down but unbuttoned. Only the shirt color varies. As usual, he stood inside the entrance while his lead attorney, Barry I. Slotnick, came out and briefed reporters on the defense perspective of that day's testimony, an impromptu question-and-answer period known by reporters as the ''5:00 Funnies,'' or ''5:00 Follies.'' After Mr. Slotnick had spoken, Mr. Goetz emerged, looking, as he always does, awkward and intimidated by the lights and cameras. He said nothing, but simply climbed into Mr. Slotnick's limousine and drove away. The young man with the camera, although pushed aside by the television crews, got his shot. Tale of a Shoe It was at a briefing last week that one of the trial's small tempests arose: whether one of the witnesses, angered by Mr. Slotnick's persistent questioning, had almost hurled his shoe across the courtroom at the defense attorney. The witness, James Ramseur, one of the teen-agers shot by Mr. Goetz, was testifying for the prosecution, but had angrily refused, during his second day on the witness stand, to answer any more questions. Mr. Ramseur was cited for contempt and was clearly growing more and more exasperated as the questioning wore on. Then, in a moment that has already entered the realm of Goetz folklore, Mr. Ramseur reached down and in a jerky, nervous movement, removed his shoe and scratched his right foot. As court officers watched closely over his shoulder, Mr. Ramseur then put the shoe back on. Mr. Slotnick, in his back-door briefing that night, said he believed Mr. Ramseur was about to throw the shoe, and that, ''he would have shot me if he'd had a gun.'' The comment was picked up by at least one news agency and - despite the eyewitnesses in the courtroom who never saw it and the statements from the court officers who said later that Mr. Ramseur never made any attempt or motion to throw the shoe - it somehow became accepted. Mr. Slotnick, who has consistently portrayed Mr. Ramseur to the jurors as a vicious ''predator,'' even began saying several days later that a court officer had jumped in front of the witness box to block the shoe in the event that it might be thrown. Other witnesses to that aspect of the exchange are still being sought. The 'Assertive Ukrainian' Thanks to Robert S. Hamkalo, however, the jurors at least had a clear view. Mr. Hamkalo, the court clerk, who describes himself as an ''assertive Ukrainian,'' took decisive action in Room 572 at the beginning of the trial and cut through eight years of red tape in a single night. The problem was the jury box, which because of an apparent design flaw - repeated in 10 other courtrooms in the building - featured a solid wood railing over which the jurors had to strain to see. Since 1960, apparently, jurors have been straining, and complaining, without result. Mr. Hamkalo, who simply brought in a team of carpenters and had the top eight inches of the rail chopped off, said the chief clerk's office of either the Civil Court or the State Supreme Court had been requesting since 1979 that the rails in all 11 such courtrooms in the building be fixed, but that the money, or the will, has simply not been there. He said his order from the trial judge, Acting Justice Stephen G. Crane, was all it took to move the gears, or at least get around them. ''You know how much red tape is involved in something like this,'' Mr. Hamkalo said. ''Well, we just bypassed it. I don't know why no else has.''

Avrett, Free & Ginsberg has landed two accounts that will bring in about $14 million in billings. The accounts are the Ralston Purina Company's new Almond Delight cereal, with a projected budget of $8 million devoted mainly to television, and the Upjohn Company's Haltran, a menstrual pain reliever, with an estimated $6 million budget. Ralston Purina, which helped the agency get off the ground in 1971 with the Purina Cat Chow account, already does more than $30 million worth of advertising there. It awarded the latest account to the agency after a four-way competition, which lasted three months. Upjohn, on the other hand, had originally asked Avrett, Free & Ginsberg to handle its new products. It did not hold a competition and said it had moved Haltran from its previous agency, Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, for what it called ''business reasons.''

1056-> WASHINGTON TALK: SELECTION OF AN AMBASSADOR; Grunwald's Delicate Deliberations on Austria
Relations between the United States and Austria, until several years ago a matter of such calm orderliness as to be virtually ignored in the press, are about to take a fresh turn in the spotlight with the selection of Henry A. Grunwald as the new United States Ambassador. Mr. Grunwald, who resigned Monday as editor in chief of Time Inc., is a Jewish native of Vienna who fled the Nazis in 1940, a fact that as recently as 1985 would have drawn only a polite mention in a profile of a future ambassador to Austria. In the meantime, however, Kurt Waldheim, the Austrian who had served as Secretary General of the United Nations, ran for the presidency of his country. Early in 1986, the Austrian magazine Profil and then The New York Times published accounts based on records showing that in World War II Mr. Waldheim served as an officer in Nazi Army units that had executed Yugoslav partisans, sent Yugoslav civilians to forced labor camps and rounded up Jews in Salonika for deportation to death camps. Barred From the U.S. In his autobiography and campaign literature Mr. Waldheim skipped over or covered up this activity. When the truth became known, an outcry arose among Jews here and elsewhere. The Justice Department began an inquiry that concluded last April with the placement of Mr. Waldheim, by then the President of Austria, on a list of people barred from entering the United States because of links to participation in ''activities amounting to persecution'' of Jews and others. Mr. Waldheim has not been accused of physically taking part in deportations or executions. Other countries have also said that Mr. Waldheim would not be welcome. The Waldheim affair has seriously complicated Austria's otherwise friendly relations with the United States, and thus the choice of a new ambassador to Vienna acquired a sensitivity rare in the postwar era. In Austria today, the current Ambassador, Ronald S. Lauder, announced his intention to resign, as he indicated he would months ago. As it always does when such posts open up, the State Department chose one of its own, a career Foreign Service officer, as its candidate for posting to the former imperial capital on the Danube. But the department's hopes were not high because the last seven ambassadors to Austria have been ''political'' appointees chosen for their loyalty to a President and not as career professionals. They included a lawyer, an investor, a builder, a business executive, a real-estate developer, a former personal secretary to President Reagan and a cosmetics magnate. The last three, appointed by President Reagan, were Theodore E. Cummings, the real-estate executive; Helene A. von Damm, the secretary, and Ronald S. Lauder, son of Estee Lauder. So it was that no one in Foggy Bottom was astonished when it became known that the White House personnel office had approached Mr. Grunwald. President Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, acknowledged today that although no announcement was being made, Mr. Grunwald was indeed ''undergoing background clearance'' by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a high-level Government position. The prospect of a Jew's presenting his diplomatic credentials to President Waldheim for official accreditation as the United States Ambassador to the Government of Austria unsettled Mr. Grunwald enough to cause him to consult not only old friends but also several American Jewish spokesmen. ''He wrestled with it,'' said one friend Mr. Grunwald asked for advice, former Ambassador Sol Linowitz. A senior Administration official said today that Mr. Grunwald, 64 years old, ''had conversations with a variety of Jewish leaders before he decided to go forward'' because he was concerned that Jews might oppose his selection. No Outrage ''They turned out not to be outraged,'' the official said of the Jewish leaders. ''There is another side to this coin,'' he added. ''After all, it means another Jew is being appointed in Vienna.'' He was alluding to Ambassador Lauder, whose Jewish grandparents emigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the century. A high-ranking State Department official said with regard to Mr. Waldheim: ''We distinguish between Waldheim as an individual and Waldheim as the President of Austria. At a social event it might be different, but we have to continue to deal with Austria and deal with the President of a friendly country.'' The Jewish spokesmen consulted by Mr. Grunwald apparently see this the same way. Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defmation League of B'nai B'rith, said: ''I'm proud of this appointment, proud that the United States decided, with Waldheim as President, to send a Jewish ambassador, a Jewish refugee, as Ambassador. I hope they'll receive him as an American, not a Jew or a refugee.'' As for Mr. Grunwald's presenting credentials to President Waldheim, Mr. Foxman said: ''It may be difficult for any Jew to do it, but he is representing his country, and the opportunities transcend the difficulty. It is worth the moment of discomfort.'' Mark Tannenbaum, director of international relations of the American Jewish Committee, said of the Grunwald choice: ''This is a very important and positive development. We've been very concerned about the strain that developed between the United States and Austria, and Austria and Israel, over Waldheim.'' ''Grunwald is clearly a person of first-rank intellect and abilities,'' Mr. Tannenbaum continued. ''Because he is a Jew born in Vienna, he has no illusions about realities in Austria. And I think he can help Austria overcome delusions of victimization and encourage them to understand themselves as they are. ''We welcome the decision to appoint him. The United States hasn't helped Austria face up to its past. Previous ambassadors were chosen primarily for political reasons, for their large contributions to campaigns. This hasn't helped Austria feel good about itself. It has reinforced a feeling there that they don't matter, that Austria is an ambassadorial dumping ground. This appointment - a man of quality and enormous talent - will help reverse this image.'' Reached in Los Angeles, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, struck a more skeptical note, saying: ''Grunwald will have to walk a very tight rope between representing his heritage versus his role as a representative of the U.S. Government. At present it would be inappropriate for Grunwald to meet officially with Waldheim.'' Mr. Grunwald's selection was hailed by former United States Government officials involved with Austrian affairs over many years. Philip M. Kaiser, who was Ambassador to Vienna from 1980 to 1981, said of Mr. Grunwald, ''It's a first-class choice. His knowledge of Austria must be rather unique. It's a real compliment.'' Walter R. Roberts, a Vienna native who served as an information specialist for the United States Government for four decades, also praised the Grunwald selection. Mr. Roberts said of his fellow Jews from Austria: ''The attitude of former Austrians is a highly emotional, personal one. Some say, 'I'm never going to visit it again as long as I live.' Others say the Nazi era was an aberration that happened only because the Germans took over in 1938,' and so they do go back. I am sort of in the middle.'' A Graduation Ceremony Mr. Roberts happened to be in Vienna in June 1986 a few days after Mr. Waldheim won election to the presidency, and was watching a television program about a graduation ceremony at a central Vienna high school. To his surprise about eight former pupils were on hand to receive honorary diplomas. All were former Austrian Jews who had been unable to receive their diplomas because they had fled Nazi rule. One of them was Henry A. Grunwald, Mr. Roberts reported. He added that the school had invited more than 20 such former Jewish pupils to receive honarary diplomas. ''But only seven or eight like Grunwald showed up,'' he said. As for Mr. Grunwald's Austrian connections - he is a member of the American Austrian Foundation -Mr. Roberts remarked that his father, Alfred Grunwald, was librettist for the great Austro-Hungarian composer of operettas, Emerich Kalman, and wrote the words to some of the songs of ''The Countess Maritza'' and ''The Circus Princess.'' One can't get much closer to the Blue Danube than that.

1057-> ART: JOHN MARIN'S OILS AT AN L.I. MUSEUM
JOHN MARIN was in some ways an artist with two careers. In the two decades after 1910, he established himself as a master of watercolor, absorbing the lessons of Fauvism, post-Impressionism and Cubism to form a distinct style and a major American reputation, which - nurtured by his dealer, Alfred Stieglitz -endured throughout his lifetime. But after 1930, Marin devoted himself increasingly to oil painting, a development that dismayed many of his most fervent admirers, including Stieglitz himself. In fact, it was 1950 - four years after his dealer's death and three years before his own - before Marin finally had an exhibition of only oil paintings at An American Place, Stieglitz's last gallery. This dismay was perhaps understandable. With their jewel-like colors and liquid directness, Marin's watercolors had an uncommon beauty and radical implications for the medium. His oil paintings, with their dark colors and turbulent strokes, could display the exact opposite: an uncommon awkwardness. But looking at ''Marin in Oil,'' an exhibition devoted entirely to the artist's second career, which is now on view at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., one can appreciate the multiple purposes that oil on canvas fulfilled for him. It gave Marin, literally, more material to work with and more resistance for his highly developed skills. It challenged him to readjust his primary subjects - the Manhattan skyline, the New England landscape and especially the Maine seacoast - to the medium's scale and demands. All this enabled Marin, at the age of 60, to begin again. His second apprenticeship deepened his achievement, extending and rejuvenating his life as an artist and as an American Modernist. Marin's work ends up occupying a singular position in the history of American art. Between the watercolors and the oil paintings, his career reaches from the earliest days of Modernism to the heyday of Abstract Expressionism. It maintains throughout a remarkable degree of forward momentum and an unwavering desire for modernity. Although Marin also disavowed pure abstraction, no American artist of his generation headed toward it so unequivocally or hovered around it so determinedly. Marin may have been the first American Formalist. His art rarely has the emotional depth of his contemporary Marsden Hartley, who had turned his back on Modernism by the early 1920's and whose forms - be they portrait, landscape or still life - are imbued with an engaging, distinctly psychological spirit. Instead, Marin's art is more impersonal; it supplies a sense of historical continuity and is full of connections with art that came before or after it. Looking at Marin's repeating ocean views, you might think of Cezanne and his fixation on Mont St. Victorie or of Monet's serial images of haystacks or cathedral facades. And in the years before Clement Greenberg had fully espoused his Formalist theories, Marin was reducing his vocabulary to a few semi-abstract elements and placing utmost emphasis on the picture plane. As Klaus Kertess, the exhibition's organizer, stresses in his catalogue, another aspect that set Marin apart from his generation was his belief in the autonomy of paint. In all of Marin's work, the individual mark took precedent over both shape and realistic description. Increasingly as he worked in oil, his surfaces are rhythmically measured off and flattened by discreet, bluntly applied brushstrokes. His method presaged Abstract Expressionism and particularly Jackson Pollock's development - even though Pollock's paintings may also have influenced Marin's in his last few years, when he pushed his work to more linear, calligraphic extremes. Before Pollock, Marin smashed the Cubist grid into an all-over field whose forming process was the primary subject of his art. To this point, Mr. Kertess quotes the artist, writing in rhythms that echo Gertrude Stein: ''As for message - as for story -The very doing - the very way it is done - the very what is being done by - they the parts - lead to this message - to this story - in fact is the message - is the story.'' These cadences catch much of the nervous energy and choppy, repeating brushstrokes that animated Marin's surfaces and propelled his art forward. This exhibition substantiates that Marin's forward motion, in oil paint at least, came with a great deal of effort, experimentation and plain old failure. His progress was not always a pretty sight. The exhibition's first gallery, where the work spans the years 1913 to 1935, covers a lot of ground in an erratic fashion. Here we see Marin gradually acclimate himself to his second medium, which he turned to intermittently from 1913 onward. His earliest forays into oil show him applying Fauvist color and watercolor technique to canvas in three elegantly economical, washy landscapes. In some ways these and the 1916 oil studies known as the ''Weehawken Sequence'' paintings -notable for their near abstraction -are among the most resolved performances in the entire exhibition, but they are also among the least demanding. Then, throughout the 1920's and early 30's, Marin moves toward thicker paint and more ambitious scale, often through nerve-jangling Cubistic cityscapes inspired by the architectonics of Manhattan skyscrapers. By the late 30's, as shown in the exhibition's small middle gallery, Marin's style was again on firm ground for the first time since the ''Weehawken Sequence'' paintings -although his images are mostly out to sea. By then a loose formula seems to be in place: a turbulent, exceedingly frontal foreground, dominated by rocks and waves or trees and mountains and topped by a narrow strip of sky, fills the picture plane to the brim. In ''The Sea, Cape Split, Maine,'' of 1938, one of the best paintings in this section, there's a distinct equivalence of image and brushwork. The whites of the breaking waves are frothy and upright; the green sea is rendered in longer more horizontal strokes; the grays and blacks of the rocks are conveyed by thin washes of paint. The exhibition's large and final gallery is devoted almost entirely to Marin's work after 1940, and it is here that we see his struggles pay off, although they don't entirely cease. The insinuation of generalized pink nudes into some of the late paintings is especially problematic. But in many others, Marin is able to combine grace and grandeur with diversity. To borrow from the sea, his surfaces range from roiling to becalmed. Generally, he tended to lighten both paint density and palette, frequently moving toward the open surfaces that had characterized his watercolors. In ''(Seascape)'' of 1944, a playful exuberance takes over, as Marin scratches spirals into pink and green paint with little regard for his subject - hence, the title's parentheses. In several instances, Marin further stressed the object-ness of his paintings by carving and painting their wood frames. These additions, which can give a folk art flavoring to the proceedings, sometimes expand the images in startling ways. Sometimes, when Marin's surfaces have been too worried-over, they are better than the paintings themselves. In these last paintings, Marin also reintroduces the Cubist-inspired scaffoldings that had weakened his 1930 cityscapes. Here they are much more organic and effective, especially in the periodic renderings of the Tunk Mountains, done in 1945, '46 and '51. In these, Marin seems to deploy his entire vocabulary of paint application in such well-balanced suspension that incoherence is flirted with but neatly avoided. The progression toward openness reaches its climax in ''The Written Sea,'' of 1952, in which the images of ocean, boats and islands are still legible but reduced to a series of carefully differentiated lines and dot-like strokes. This show builds to an impressive finish. Marin went down fighting, simultaneously resisting pure abstraction and, in his own distinct, restless way, keeping up with the changing times. In the few years after his death, Abstract Expressionism would bring international stature to American art for the first time and Jackson Pollock would eclipse John Marin as the greatest American painter. But as this exhibition makes clear, the backdrop against which these events emerged is always much richer and more fully formed than is often remembered.

1058-> A Bit Late, New York Finds Jobs for Students
Three weeks after conceding that a program to provide summer jobs for thousands of high school students had failed, city officials announced yesterday that almost 500 of the students had been placed in monthlong positions. The program's failure is believed to have contributed to the decision last week by Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones to step down in January, six months before his contract expires. The jobs for the students, which began last week and are to last through Sept. 10, are with city agencies, including the Parks Department, the Sanitation Department and the Human Resources Administration. They pay the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour. Summer Jobs Promised In the spring, about 7,000 students enrolled in the city's Institute for Career Exploration, the new summer school program. It is for 14- and 15-year-old students who have been admitted to some of the city's selective high schools under new, relaxed admissions standards intended to give more opportunities to black and Hispanic students. The program was to provide remedial instruction in the morning and part-time jobs in the afternoon to students who requested them. But last month a survey by the Educational Priorities Panel, a civic group that monitors the city school system, showed that few of the students who had requested jobs had received them. Many students, frustrated by this failure, had dropped out of the program, according to the panel's director, Stanley S. Litow. City officials acknowledged last month that they had placed only a few hundred students in jobs. They said the reason was that the May deadline for applying for summer jobs with the city fell a month before the students enrolled in the summer program. #1,600 Jobs Identified The jobs were to be provided through the Summer Youth Employment Program, which offers federally financed jobs in city agencies. Mayor Koch said yesterday that after learning about the program's failure, city officials had worked to find jobs for the students for the remainder of the summer. He said that they had identified 1,600 jobs in the same agencies that had planned to hire the students originally and that ''everyone who wanted a job got a job and is working today.'' Mr. Litow called the city's action a ''tribute to their ability to work under pressure,'' but added, ''It's too bad that it had to happen in August.'' Mr. Litow called the students enrolled in the summer school program some of the ''most vulnerable'' in the school system. He said that if students dropped out of summer school because they did not receive jobs and later did poorly in high school, ''it will demonstrate that not being able to execute this summer initiative was a serious faux pas.''

1059-> Agency Foresees Big Deficit Rise in '88 and '89
The Congressional Budget Office agreed today with the Reagan Administration's prediction that the Federal budget deficit would drop dramatically this year. But, unlike the Administration, it also projected big increases in the deficit for 1988 and 1989 unless Congress and the President take strong action. The budget office estimated that the deficit would fall to $157 billion in the current fiscal year, from the record $221 billion last year. The deficit has never fallen so much in a single year, according to Government data. Edward M. Gramlich, acting director of the budget office, said the decline in the deficit would occur because of ''unexpectedly strong growth in revenues.'' The surge in tax receipts is occurring in part because many people sold stocks and other capital assets last year, before the rate on long-term capital gains was raised by the new tax law. Gains May Be Short-Lived But the budget office, a nonpartisan agency, said the striking improvement in the deficit this year ''will prove ephemeral'' if current taxing and spending policies continue unchanged, because in that case, ''the deficit will reach $183 billion in 1988 and $192 billion in 1989.'' On Monday, the Administration said that if Congress approved President Reagan's budget proposals, the deficit would decline steadily, to $158 billion this year, $123 billion next year and $113 billion in 1989. Assuming no change in current tax and spending policies, the Administration said the deficit would be $161 billion next year and $166 billion in 1989. The Congressional Budget Office also issued a new economic forecast today estimating that the economy would grow 3.1 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, after adjustment for inflation. Compared with a report issued by the budget office in January, the forecast today was less optimistic about economic growth, inflation and interest rates. The new data on the deficit have political implications. Mr. Reagan is taking credit for the big reduction in the deficit expected to occur this year. But Democrats say the sharp rise expected in the next two years confirms that his policies have saddled the nation with huge deficits. A law signed by Mr. Reagan in December 1985 calls for the deficit to be reduced in large annual installments to achieve a balanced budget by 1991. But the Congressional Budget Office now projects a deficit of $165 billion in 1991, assuming a continuation of current tax and spending policies. A joint report today by the budget office and the Reagan Administration shows that, under a formula prescribed in the law, military programs would have to be cut 13 percent across the board, and most nonmilitary programs would have to be cut 19 percent, to meet the statutory deficit target of $108 billion for the next fiscal year. Under the law as originally passed, such cuts would have been made automatically, but the Supreme Court struck down that procedure as a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. So now, under an alternative procedure described in the law, Congress will consider a special bill making the cuts computed with the formula. The budget office said Government spending would exceed $1 trillion this year for the first time. The deficit of $157 billion projected for this year reflects the difference between spending of $1.01 trillion and receipts of $853 billion. The budget blueprint adopted by Congress in June would reduce the 1988 deficit by $37 billion, to a level of $146 billion, the budget office said. The savings occur only if Congress passes appropriation bills and other measures to make the cuts assumed in the budget blueprint. Most such cuts are politically unpopular. The budget office observed that ''growing surpluses in the Social Security program help to hold down the overall deficit'' in the next five years. The surplus will rise from $19 billion this year to $38 billion next year, $54 billion in 1990 and $69 billion in 1992, it estimated.

1060-> BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLAN: AUSTERE AND ORTHODOX
President Jose Sarney's tough economic austerity program marks the end of Brazil's effort to change the way that foreign governments and banks handle Latin American debt crises, according to foreign and Brazilian financial experts. The measures, which include a wage-and-price freeze, a currency devaluation and sweeping cuts in Government spending, were announced Friday and immediately welcomed by foreign bankers as an important step toward a resumption of Brazil's debt payments to its commercial creditors. Financial experts said the new Brazilian plan was similar to the orthodox economic measures that have been adopted by Mexico, Argentina and other hard-pressed Latin American debtor nations as a prelude to agreements rescheduling debt payments and providing new credits. But the economic package, which was imposed after months of hesitation, also has considerable political risks for President Sarney, who has repeatedly pledged not to accept a recession as the price for ending Brazil's partial debt moratorium. With the economy showing signs of recession, however, the impact of the new measures on workers' purchasing power is expected to bring strong protests from labor groups here. Already, in the past few weeks there have been more strikes in Brazil than in recent years. Many politicians believe that the performance of the economy will be crucial in determining how long Mr. Sarney will remain in office. A special assembly, which is writing a new constitution, will fix the length of his term before the end of this year. Brazil's negotiations with a 14-member advisory committee representing about 600 banks have been stalled since Feb. 21 when the Government was forced by its declining hard-currency reserves to suspend interest payments on $69 billion in foreign commercial debt. Its total foreign debt, the largest in the developing world, stands at $108 billion. The Finance Minister at the time, Dilson Funaro, argued that previous debt agreements had provided only temporary relief, and he said that Brazil would negotiate with commercial banks only after leading industrialized nations adopted reforms in existing ''international financing mechanisms.'' He also insisted that Brazil's economic problems could only be solved by the foreign banks and not by new internal measures. But Mr. Funaro was rebuffed by the United States and other Western powers and, as the domestic economic situation rapidly deteriorated, demands for his resignation mounted. Finally, on April 29, he was replaced by Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, who immediately promised a new economic package to control rocketing inflation and to stimulate exports. The bank advisory committee, which has been informed that Brazil will seek $3 billion to $4 billion in ''new money'' as part of any new debt agreement, in turn indicated that it saw no reason for fresh negotiations until the new economic measures were in place. ''This is what we've been waiting for,'' one foreign banker said following Friday's announcement. ''We'll obviously have to see how it is applied and whether it works, but at least we have something to talk about now.'' Deteriorating Economy Significantly, while Brazil still insists it will not bow to pressures to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Bresser Pereira is expected to ask the I.M.F. to endorse his new economic package in an effort to satisfy foreign bankers. ''It's as if we had gone to the I.M.F.,'' said Roberto Campos, a former Planning Minister and a strong critic of the Government's recent economic policies. ''Most of the measures, except for the freeze, would be prescribed by the fund. The country has suffered unnecessarily all these months because the Government refused to go to the Fund.'' But while talks between Brazil and its commercial creditors are expected to resume later this month, many financial experts believe this country's domestic economic problems are still greater than those created by its partial debt moratorium last February. ''It was the domestic crisis that forced Sarney to act,'' said one economist who formerly worked for the Government. The new measures were announced on the same day the Government disclosed that the inflation rate for May alone had reached 23.26 percent, the highest in the country's history. At the same time, interest rates exceeding 1,000 percent a year have forced hundreds of companies into bankruptcy in the past two months and left thousands of people without jobs. The decision to freeze wages and prices, however, was debated at length in Government circles because of the disastrous results of a similar freeze imposed in February 1986. That so-called Cruzado Plan led to a massive consumer spending spree and a slump in Brazil's trade deficit. When it was lifted last November, high inflation immediately returned. This time around, in order to dampen domestic demand, the Government announced the end of important subsidies and a series of sharp price increases - affecting gasoline, alcohol fuel, electricity, telephones, steel, bread and milk - before ordering the freeze. In contrast to the ill-fated Cruzado Plan, the Government also disclaimed any plan to achieve ''zero inflation.'' It said that prices would be adjusted as necessary during the 90-day freeze. In addition, the Government devalued its currency by 10 percent Friday and allowed for further devaluations.

1061-> AND IN NEW YORK, STREET FAIRS AND FIDDLES
ACCORDING to a city dweller's visceral calendar - one that has little to do with days or weeks - August often seems like the year's longest month. Everybody else under the hot summer sun seems to be on vacation, out of town, enjoying himself far from New York. But those in the city have options, even on the mangiest of the dog days of summer. August is actually filled with street fairs and performing-arts festivals of every description. Continuing attractions include the free Out-of-Doors, the myriad performing arts of Summerstage in Central Park and Celebrate Brooklyn at Prospect Park, Summergarden concerts at the Museum of Modern Art, Summerpier performances at the South Street Seaport, and free Shakespeare at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. This weekend's free outdoor offerings range from bluegrass music and farm-fresh produce in Brooklyn and political humor on sizzling midtown asphalt to a waterfront party in Hoboken, N.J., and ethnic fairs in Chinatown and Little India. Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn would seem an unlikely place for a county fair, but the runways and hangars of the city's first airport become a great urban farmyard of cows and hayrides, music and gardening tomorrow and Sunday, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., as the annual City Gardeners' Harvest Fair comes to town. One pavilion will be abloom with entries in flower and vegetable contests open to the city's legions of backyard, windowsill, rooftop and fire-escape gardeners. From ''sheep to shawl'' is the motto of the ''country crafts village,'' where sheep will be sheared, wool will be spun and garments woven. The Blue Barn is an old hangar full of farm anidressed like an egg doing omelet demonstrations, and Rick Garcia, the fails to elicit gasps as thousands of bees gather on his face. A giant circus tent is the auditorium where the Duke Washington Trio performs tomorrow at 1 P.M., and a country-variety show, with music, fiddle-dancers and magic, begins at 3:30. A petting zoo, a farmers' market, free hayrides and square dancing, wine tasting and entertainers galore also will be sprinkled about the fairgrounds. While urban gardeners will be tomorrow's center of attention, country fiddle-picking comes to Floyd Bennett Field's big top on Sunday, for the 14th annual New York City Bluegrass Band Contest, from 1 to 5 P.M. For the first time, this part-contest, part-jam session for amateur bands from throughout the northeastern United States is to be held in conjunction with the Harvest Fair. The Harvest Fair's entrance is on Flatbush Avenue, just north of the Marine Parkway (Gil Hodges) Bridge; free parking is available. A free shuttle bus will run between the Flatbush-Nostrand stop of the IRT No. 2 subway and the fair, every half-hour tomorrow and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. The fair is sponsored by the City Department of General Services, Gateway National Recreation Area, Cornell University Cooperative Extension and the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Information: (212) 233-2926 or (718) 338-7865. Satire at Summerfest The Third Avenue Summerfest might appear to be just another run-of-the-mill street fair, with hundreds of food, crafts, antiques and other vendors sprawled along a 15-block stretch from 42d Street to 57th Street. But aside from being a dead-of-summer variation on a spring-and-fall theme, Sunday's second annual Summerfest will feature an afternoon of barbed and biting political satire. Six well-known stand-up comedians -Barry Crimmins, Randy Credico, Scott Blakeman, Betty Burrows, Joan Cushing and Jerry Turner - will dissect high-level foolishness from the fair's 42d Street stage from 2 to 4:30 P.M. ''Political Follies'' is the sixth installment in a series of eight outdoor performances presented by the Association of Comedy Artists. A Dixieland band performs on the stage from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M., and other performers will be found on every street corner for the duration of the festival, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. This flea market of 420 vendors is also, of course, awash with plenty of international food and drink. Summerfest is sponsored by the East Side Rezoning Alliance, a community coalition. The rain date is Aug. 23. Information: 684-4077. Hoboken Gets In the Act It may not be within New York City, but Hoboken is just a glance across the Hudson. And tomorrow and Sunday, from 10 A.M. to dusk, if one glances hard enough, one will see a good deal of festivities along the riverfront of the ''mile square city.'' What will be there is the River City Fair, an annual event that brings out more than 100 food, crafts and other vendors, and two stages for music. Hoboken is known as a node of American regional rock music, largely thanks to a club called Maxwell's, and many of the city's best-known bands will perform on a stage near Seventh Street and the river. Cabaret, jazz and gospel music are featured on a second stage, at Fifth Street and the river. The fair, which stretches along the shore from about Fifth to Seventh Street, is being put on by the Hoboken Environment Committee to raise funds and consciousnesses, with the aim of creating a local waterfront park. Hoboken is a short subway ride from New York, and its PATH station is just four blocks from the fairgrounds. Information: (201) 792-1428. Fair in Little India The Manhattan enclave known as Little India spills westward onto Madison Avenue, between 23d and 26th Streets, for a street fair devoted to the arts and foods of India, on Sunday from 4 to 9 P.M. The fair will follow a 2 P.M. parade down Madison Avenue, starting at 56th Street, sponsored by the Federation of Indian Associations. Information: (516) 933-7671. The streets of Chinatown are always a festival of sorts, but this weekend, Pell and Doyers Streets, between Mott Street and the Bowery, will hold a bona-fide street fair. Vendors and fortune tellers will be arrayed beneath 400 flags bearing Chinese surnames today through Sunday, from noon to midnight. Sponsored by the Pell and Doyers Street Block Association, the Little Chinatown Street Fair continues every weekend through Labor Day. Information: 334-0086.

1062-> NEW YORK'S PLAN TO SPEED UP TRIALS IS MISSING ITS GOAL
An ambitious plan by court administrators to reduce the backlog of cases in New York City courts by postponing judges' summer vacations has shown progress but is falling short of its goal, according to judges, prosecutors and private lawyers. They said that although the plan, announced in May, had increased the number of completed criminal cases, the season's long-established rhythms - marked by long vacations, trial delays and crowded jail cells - have barely been altered. The administrators noted that the summer was a traditional vacation time for defense lawyers, police officers and others working in the criminal-justice system. Because of the vacations, they said, only so much can be accomplished by inducing judges to reschedule their time off. #82 Judges Reset Vacations Others in the justice system agreed. ''The initial sense was that it was going to be a much broader departure, but it's not turning out that way,'' Richard Schrader, a spokesman for the 7,000-member New York State Trial Lawyers Association, said. ''It's not going have as dramatic an effect as some people had thought, or in some cases, feared.'' According to court figures, 82 of the 235 elected or appointed State Supreme Court Justices in the city who would have taken most or all of their vacation during the summer will instead be working straight through. Rearranging the schedules has meant changing the vacations of more than 500 of the 6,000 nonjudicial workers, such as interpreters and court officers. The number of trials that opened in June, the first month of the plan, fell slightly from the same month last year, to 283, from 293, court figures showed. The total number of criminal cases disposed of - mainly through guilty pleas - rose significantly during the month, to 3,729, from 2,785. Officials cautioned about comparing the numbers with last summer, when the number of dispositions fell sharply because of a new calendar system. 'From Crisis to Crisis' One of the main goals of the plan was to reduce the jail population. On May 13, it stood at 14,693, 105 percent of stated capacity. Last week, the system was 103 percent of capacity. The administrators announced the plan in response to the mounting pressures on the jail system, saying the courts were going ''from crisis to crisis'' and called on all judges in the city to defer their vacations immediately to ease the backlog. This week they said that the strong wording of the announcement had been aimed at adjusting attitudes and expectations as much as actual calendars. The courts will still gear down to less than half capacity - in terms of the number of judges present - from next week well into the middle of August. ''You've got to create a new climate, where people expect to conduct as much business, even though the weather is a little warmer,'' the Administrative Judge of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, Burton B. Roberts, said. ''That doesn't happen overnight.'' Nor would it be desirable if it did, other officials said, because the abrupt changes might disrupt the balance between the seasonal variations in arrests and indictments. More Volunteers Than Needed Until this summer, judges and other court workers were required to take their four weeks of vacation in July or August, or during another slow season, at the end of the year. The main initiative of the new summer plan was to offer judges the opportunity to volunteer to take their vacations at other times. As it turned out, more judges volunteered than administrators wanted, according to the state's Chief Administrative Judge, Albert M. Rosenblatt. ''There's a balance,'' Judge Rosenblatt said. ''We didn't want to load up in the summer to the extent that we were weakened in the winter.'' At the Manhattan District Attorney's office, officials were unable to say exactly how many prosecutors had re-arranged their vacations, because the scheduling is handled in each bureau of the prosecutor's office. Soaring Felony Indictments ''Everybody's making an effort to get more trials, and I think we will get more trials,'' the District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said. ''But July and August are the key summer months, and the proof is in the pudding.'' Other complications in the program include a new assignment system introduced last year and the soaring number of felony indictments this year. In the first six months of the year, the number of new felony cases rose nearly 24 percent, to 19,635, from 15,838 in the first six months of 1986. Under the new system, the cases are supposedly carried from beginning to end by one judge. Under the summer rules, however, some judges are being asked to take over vacationing judges' half-finished cases, and they might be totally unfamiliar with the litigation. Another subtle factor, according to Judge Rosenblatt, involves the psychology of plea-bargaining, which is how most criminal cases are settled in New York. Judge Rosenblatt said that having additional judges in the summer would make it a bit more likely that a trial could be held if a defendant refused an offer to plead guilty in return for a promise of a certain sentence. That, he said, could significantly affect negotiations, because a defendant who was guilty would be forced to realize he could no longer hold out for a better offer on a guaranteed sentence. ''Those people who might eventually plead guilty,'' Judge Rosenblatt said, ''might advance the date if they know the case really will be tried.''

1066-> Washington Talk: Briefing; About the 'D-word'
With memories still fresh of the President and the Soviet general secretary calling each other ''Ron'' and ''Mikhail,'' denizens of the capital are pondering the duration of the new thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. Assiduously avoided has been what some call ''the big D-word'' -detente, a French-derived diplomatic term meaning a relaxing of tensions. The problem is that the word has come to be associated with the short-lived Soviet-American era of good feeling ushered in by President Nixon in the early 1970's and continued briefly under President Carter. ''Reagan is uncomfortable with the word because he spent so much time denouncing detente on his way to the White House,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman of Conservative Caucus Inc. ''I'm one of the few people around who insist on calling detente detente as a reminder that this is a resurrection of policies that got America into so much trouble.'' Secretary of State George P. Shultz told reporters in Copenhagen yesterday, ''If detente was the right word to describe what was going on in the 1970's, it's the wrong word to describe what's going on today.'' He said he could not find a single word to characterize the apparent new era in relations. ''We want to be careful about it,'' he added. ''We have to stay away from too much euphoria and also stay away from too much depression when someting doesn't go right.'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mr. Carter's national security adviser, said at a press breakfast the other day, ''I wouldn't call it detente.'' He then struggled manfully toward euphemistic substitutes, remarking: ''I'd say we were re-entering a relaxation of antagonism in relations. A breathing spell. Or better, a progressive accommodation.'' Pete du Pont, the Republican Presidential contender, said the new rapport was ''not detente because this isn't a relaxation of tension but a relaxation of the fight for freedom.''

1067-> Breeders Put 20 on Standby
Twenty of the 106 horses entered for the seven Breeders' Cup races at Hollywood Park Nov. 21 were assigned standby status yesterday and most are unlikely to start. Four of the seven races drew more than the maximum fields of 14, invoking a complex system that decides which horses will be allowed to run. In each field, the nine horses who scored best on a point system rewarding performance in graded North American stakes races won guaranteed starts. The other five starting berths were awarded by a selection committee of American and European racing officials. The remaining horses were designated as alternates and ranked in order of eligibility. They can only start if there are defections from the starting lineups when final entries are taken Wednesday. The most prominent horses designated alternates yesterday were Blazing Bart, Florida's leading grass horse; Tertiary Zone, winner of the Lawrence Realization at Belmont last month, and Laser Lane, who won the Knickerbocker Handicap at Aqueduct nine days ago. In the $1 million Sprint at six furlongs, which drew 16 entrants, Governor General and Sharp Romance were designated the first and second alternates, and all the others are assured of a starting berth. In the $1 million Mile on the grass, which drew a record 30 entrants, the nine point leaders were Air Display, Deputy Governor, Duluth, Explosive Darling, Le Belvedere, Santella Mac, Short Sleeves, Show Dancer and Temperate Sil. The committee selected Double Feint, Highest Honor, Miesque, Millgram and Sonic Lady to complete the field. The alternates, in order of eligibility, are Waajib, Asteroid Field, Noble Minstrel, Laser Lane, Hallgate, Sabona, Vilzak, Sylvan Express, Slyly Gifted, Safeera, Fioravanti, Louise a La Plage and Sharp Romance. Skywalker, Stately Don and Trempolino earned berths in other races so they were not considered. In the Juvenile for 2-year-olds, which drew 15 entrants, Jade Trade was designated the alternate, and the others drew in. In the Turf, the qualifiers on points were Autumn Glitter, Great Communicator, Louis le Grand, Rivlia, Stately Don, Storm On the Loose, Swink, Theatrical and Zaizoom. The five selected were Allez Milord, Bint Pasha, Sir Harry Lewis, Trempolino and Village Star. The six ranked alternates are Blazing Bart, Circus Prince, Tertiary Zone, Vilzak, Saint Andrews and Saronicos. The $1 million Juvenile Fillies, the $1 million Distaff and the $3 million Classic drew fields of fewer than 14.

1068-> Not So Elementary
To the Editor: As a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I was charmed to see a reference to him in the Nov. 9 letters column. But Warren Boroson commits two errors. First of all, Holmes and Watson are fictional characters. It makes no more sense to cite their behavior as guides to our own than it does to cite Holmes as evidence that a cocaine addict need suffer no mental or physical deterioration. Second, Holmes and Watson both survived the ''Sumatra disease'' because Holmes was not suffering from it. He was faking it in order to lure a villain to his bedside and trick him into making a confession. MARGARITA R. LEVIN New York, Nov. 9, 1987

1069-> Cairo Journal; People Not Ready to Ride in a Hole in the Ground
If news is made by things that seem so strange as to be anomalies, then Cairo's newly opened subway, just under three miles long and the first in all Africa and Arabia, is news. Good news, even. On the surface above its tracks and tunnel, one of the world's busiest, most congested cities blares and barges its way from snarl to snarl in its diurnal effort to contain at least four million commuters in a city whose population has almost tripled from its 1960 level of five million. A half million cabs, cars and mini-buses and more than 2,300 buses, or at least those among them that are functioning, scramble for space on the tired dirt and asphalt of its streets and thoroughfares. Passengers, in turn, scramble for a sardine's space on the buses. A tramway weaves a way among them, too. Pedestrians venture into the fray with the nimbleness born of need and practice displayed by high-wire performers at a three-ring circus. 'Clean, Safe and Fast' Below ground, by contrast, the benefits seem defined by negatives. No one smokes, spits, mugs, shoves, or scrawls graffiti. A special unit of police, in black uniforms braided with gold, sees to that. No one, in the two months it has been open, has been reported shoved onto the tracks. The blue and white cars do not howl and shudder as they enter a station. They sigh. ''It is clean, safe, fast,'' said Dr Ali el-Booz, a university lecturer and regular commuter. ''In five minutes, I can travel the same distance as the ordinary bus takes an hour to cover.'' But the subway, which represents the first stage of ambitious planning supposed to cut above-ground traffic by 75 percent, seems to say things, too, about a society framed by ambiguous superlatives. Egypt, for instance, boasts the biggest population in the Arab world, and its capital is the most populous in Africa and the Middle East; it is also the second biggest recipient of American economic and military aid, valued at roughly $2 billion; its antiquity cradled the world's oldest civilization. Poverty and Reliance Its modernity, however, bears other portends, of poverty and reliance. The average inner-city subway ride, for instance, costs the equivalent of 10 cents, but that fare, subsidized by the Government, is held to be too expensive by many used to paying three or four cents for a bus ride. So, in its newness, it seems not to have drawn crowds. ''A lot of people still use the bus because it costs less,'' said another commuter, Mohamed Zakir, a 33-year-old civil servant. The line, said Mohammed Mabrouk, a senior official of Egyptian National Railways, is running at about 80 percent of its current capacity, carrying roughly 20,000 people each hour in each direction. When completed, the line is supposed to carry three times that many passengers. Those who built the underground line, which links with an existing surface track to Helwan in the south, moreover, were tutored by French technicians. The first phase alone consumed $370 million, more than double the original estimate, because of delays and problems caused in part by underground obstacles to the tunneling, such as uncharted gas and sewage pipes, water mains and phone and power cables. Foreign Technology When the project is complete and the subway is linked to a line leading north so as to form a 26-mile above-and-below ground route along the East bank of the Nile, the French stake in credits and aid is expected to total $560 million. Just as Egypt's antiquities have long been the prey and preserve of foreigners, some intellectuals and left-wing critics of the Government argue that its modernity is beholden to foreign technology. A British-American consortium, for instance, has the billion-dollar contract for a new sewer system here; the Chinese are building a corniche along the Nile in Luxor with money from the World Bank; American technicians are repairing the Soviet-supplied turbines of the Aswan High Dam in the south. Such issues do not seem to bother the Metro's passengers. ''I think it is a great thing,'' said Dr. el-Booz. Neither is the nation's heritage forgotten in its newest showpiece. Pharaonic mosaics adorn the awesomely clean walls. Stations Named for Heroes The five underground stations bear names that include those of national heroes, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar el-Sadat, along with that of President Hosni Mubarak. Sadat Station, in Tahrir Square at the city center, bears bronze murals depicting the late Egyptian leader against a backdrop displaying the dove of peace, recalling the 1979 Camp David accord with Israel. Those who run it acknowledge that all has not been smooth. The French contractors are embroiled with the authorities in a dispute over who should pay for the cost overruns. Sometimes, said Alain Chenebier, the French project manager, there were delays because staff and passengers were not used to the underground rail system. Moreoever, he said, trains were currently running at intervals of seven to eight minutes, while the project's overall target is a train every two-and-a-half minutes. Once, said Mr. Mabrouk of Egyptian National Railways, a schoolboy threw a cassette tape at the overhead power cable to see what would happen and the system came to a halt for one hour. Another time, he said, a power failure halted the trains for 40 minutes. Newspapers here reported a modest scam, too. A man from the country, they reported, met a man from the city who purported to sell the entire subway to his credulous rural compatriot, offering him 30 used tickets as surety. But that seemed part of a tradition of the city's railroads: Once, Cairo residents say, a man from the city sold a man from the country the entire four-faceted clock at a main railroad station here, telling him he would make a living by levying a toll on those who checked the time.

1070-> America's Cup; Challengers Plot New Course
The San Diego Yacht Club's agreement last week to meet New Zealand in a closed match for the America's Cup in 1988 has created a major upheaval among other challengers. Some are taking sides in the controversy, but many appear to be reaching for middle ground. Most are hoping for compromise. International yachtsmen have called their own summit meetings in New York this week. The International 12-Meter Association, which includes future defenders and challengers for the America's Cup, plans to meet Wednesday. A smaller group of challengers interested in a sail-off next summer with New Zealand will gather Thursday. As many as eight nations are likely to be represented at the 12-Meter meeting. A defense group from Chicago is expected, as well as representatives of the San Diego Yacht Club. Gianfranco Alberini, chairman of the association, said in a telephone interview from Italy Friday that members were worried about committing additional money to 12-Meter campaigns when the next America's Cup races will be sailed in boats twice the size of 12-Meters. The group met in London last month to schedule a three-year series of races leading to a 1991 America's Cup match. ''We may have to revise our program,'' said Alberini. ''All of our activities were based on the assumption that 12-Meters would be the official class of the America's Cup in San Diego in 1991. But now we are asking what happens if the America's Cup is won by New Zealand?'' Many Challenges San Diego has accepted challenges from 21 syndicates for a multinational sail-off in 12-Meters in 1991. Thomas Ehman Jr., chief operating officer for the defense team, said at a news conference Wednesday that San Diego would abide by a court decision and race New Zealand first. Michael Fay, a merchant banker from Auckland, forced San Diego, through action by the New York State Supreme Court, to accept a challenge next summer in boats with a 90-foot waterline length. Tony Fairchild, a spokesman for a 12-Meter challenge from Denmark, said Friday that his group was waiting to see what happened next. ''They're not unhappy with anyone in particular,'' said Fairchild about the Danish group. ''They're just bewildered as to what's going on. It's their hope that San Diego will want to get back on the 12-Meter track in 1991.'' Tom Simpson, a director of Canada's Toronto-based challenge, said challengers were worried about the potential for an ''enormous economic loss.'' Simpson said that his group had not spent much of its $25 million budget. But others have. He estimated that the total figure could be as high as $250 million. ''That kind of gets lost in the shuffle between Fay and San Diego,'' said Simpson. ''It's kind of unfair that people should be exposed to that level of loss under the current circumstances.'' Simpson conceded that his group had asked to be invited to the meeting Thursday with Fay. ''We're exploring whether or not we would want to sail a 90-foot boat,'' he said, acknowledging that his Canadian team would be hard-pressed to get a yacht of that size ready by August. He would like to see San Diego open up the 1988 America's Cup match to other challengers. Bond to Attend The meeting among those sympathetic to Fay will include Alan Bond of Australia and Peter de Savary of Britain. Both men are multimillionaire backers of previous cup campaigns. Bond won the America's Cup in 1983; de Savary campaigned challenge teams in 1980 and 1983. De Savary has sent a letter to San Diego organizers asking them to allow him to negotiate a compromise between Fay and Ehman. Bond, who plans to fly de Savary to New York in his private jet Wednesday, has reportedly started to build a new boat with a 90-foot waterline. He has said that he would try to usurp the America's Cup races with his own $8 million Big Boat series in Australia if San Diego refused to allow him to participate. Others expected to meet Thursday with Fay are Masakazu Kobayashi, organizer of a Japanese challenge, and Alan Pasteur, representing a French group.

1074-> CHANNING E. PHILLIPS DIES AT 59; MINISTER AND CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER
The Rev. Channing E. Phillips, a civil rights leader and the first black to be placed in nomination for the Presidency of the United States by a major political party, died of cancer yesterday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Phillips had been minister of planning and coordination of the Riverside Church in Manhattan since 1982. He headed Robert F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign in the District of Columbia in 1968. At the Democratic convention in Chicago, he allowed his name to be placed in nomination as a favorite-son candidate because Senator Kennedy had been assassinated in Los Angeles earlier that year. Led Housing Agency Mr. Phillips, who received 67 1/2 votes, said his candidacy was meant to show ''the Negro vote must not be taken for granted.'' At that time, Mr. Phillips also served as president of the Housing Development Corporation, a Government-backed housing venture in the nation's capital. He also served for seven years as the pastor of Lincoln Temple, United Church of Christ, in Washington. He favored full home rule for the District of Columbia. Mr. Phillips was born in Brooklyn, the son of a Baptist minister. He is survived by his wife, Jane; two sons, Channing D., of Washington, and John E., of Manhattan, and three daughters, Sheilah P. Peterson and Tracy J. Phillips of Manhattan, and Jill C. Phillips, of Oakland, Calif. The funeral will be held Saturday at 10 A.M. at Riverside Church. A memorial service will be held in Washington at a later date.

1075-> N.A.S.D. Fills Top Board Job
The National Association of Securities Dealers said yesterday that it had named Stephen L. Hammerman, a Merrill Lynch executive, to be chairman of its 31-member board of governors for 1988. Mr. Hammerman, 49 years old, is executive vice president, chief adminstrative officer and general counsel of Merrill Lynch & Company. He succeeds James M. Davin, managing director of the First Boston Corporation. Mr. Davin was filling out the term of Joseph R. Hardiman, who left the unpaid position of chairman last summer to become the paid, full-time president of the N.A.S.D. The N.A.S.D. is the self-regulatory organizaiton of the over-the-counter stock market. Earlier this week, responding to criticism that some O-T-C dealers dropped out of the market when prices fell sharply last month, the organization announced several proposals to try to prevent a recurrence. Richard L. Hinton, president of Campbell Waterman Inc., in Seattle, was named vice chairman-elect, to succeed Richard C. Romano of Romano Bros. & Company of Evanston, Ill.

1076-> Baseball; Guarantee Stalling Mets and Mazzilli
The Mets admitted today that they had a Ray Knight-type problem in their negotiations with Lee Mazzilli, but Mazzilli's agent blamed the Player Relations Committee for the snag that could end the player's second term with the club. While continuing to negotiate with Mazzilli and their other two free agents, John Candelaria and Bill Almon, to whom they can offer salary arbitration until midnight Monday, the Mets also forged ahead with a possible plan to trade Jesse Orosco, Mookie Wilson and Rafael Santana in one package, perhaps to the Los Angeles Dodgers or the Cleveland Indians. The Mazzilli matter was the Mets' most pressing piece of business as they prepared for the opening Monday of baseball's annual winter meetings. They have offered their pinch-hitter deluxe a two-year guaranteed contract for about $700,000, and both the length and the money are acceptable. What isn't is the language on the guarantee. Harazin 'Floored' ''I can't believe this should be a stumbling block; I'm floored by the fact that we're in this position,'' Al Harazin, the Mets' executive vice president, told reporters at a briefing. As happened last year with Knight, a popular and sometimes productive player with the Mets in their World Series championship season, the Mets will lose negotiating rights to Mazzilli until next May 1 if they don't offer salary arbitration. Tony Attanasio, Mazzilli's agent, explained that Mazzilli would have no problem with the type of guarantee language the Mets have used in the past five years, but he said that the team now wants to add exceptions to the guarantee in wording that the agent believes is dictated by the Players Relations Committee, the owners' labor arm. ''I know it's from the P.R.C.,'' Attanasio said by telephone from his home in San Diego, ''because another general manager told me, 'We've been asked by the P.R.C. to add this language,' and it was verbatim with what the Mets had.'' In one part of the new language, the agent said, the Mets would not have to pay Mazzilli's salary in the event of a lockout by the owners. The contract would also cease to be guaranteed, he said, if the club determined that the player was not in ''first-class physical condition due to any use of any type of illegal drug, the misuse of prescription or over-counter drugs or alcohol dependency.'' Attanasio said that Mazzilli was firm in his objection to these exceptions. Harazin said the Mets were equally firm in their stand. ''If we don't have a different feeling than we do now,'' Harazin said, ''we will sign off tomorrow night. We will not retain negotiating rights to him.'' But Harazin did offer a possible way out of the dilemma for the time being. If Mazzilli agreed not to go to arbitration - the Mets don't want to contend with the implications of his $600,000 salary under a contract with Pittsburgh, from which he was released - the Mets would retain rights by offering arbitration, Harazin said. Attanasio, asked about that possibility, said he had told the Mets the idea would be acceptable. Harazin, meanwhile, said that the club planned to offer arbitration for Almon, but that he wasn't certain about Candelaria. He explained that the Mets would like to sign Candelaria, whom they acquired from Pittsburgh in mid-September, but that they don't want to go into arbitration saddled with his 1987 salary of $800,000. Interest in Package As for the team's trade possibilities, Joe McIlvaine, the vice president for baseball operations, said that one team in each league had expressed interest in the three-player package. He declined to identify the teams, but the needs of the Dodgers and the Indians seemed to fit. In the discussions with the two unnamed teams, McIlvaine said, they had agreed on ''a quality major league player'' whom the Mets would receive in return, but not on the prospects the Mets desire. McIlvaine said that he would prefer trading Orosco, Wilson and Santana as a package, but would trade them individually, too. Lou Piniella, the Yankees' general manager, said today that the Yankees ''might'' be interested in Wilson, and would talk with the Mets Monday. ''We called and talked to Lou about the possibility of trading a little more and he's all for it,'' McIlvaine said. Hot Property Bill Goodstein, the agent for Dave Righetti, said that he had many meetings planned for the next few days. He said that 13 teams have expressed interest in Righetti and that seven have made concrete offers.

1077-> Drowsy Broadway About to Be Stirred
There are no Broadway openings scheduled until the Jan. 26 premiere of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' at the Majestic Theater. But producers and theater owners have been competing feverishly during the past few weeks for the rights to a number of musicals, plays and comedies that promise one of the busiest spring seasons in years. The British will weigh in with two more big-scale musicals, each controversial, though for different reasons. The Tim Rice-Bjorn Ulvaeus-Benny Andersson musical ''Chess'' should finally arrive at the Imperial in July. The show has been a success in London since 1986 and has almost completely repaid its investment. Nevertheless, the producers were worried about how well Mr. Rice's book would be received in New York. The Shubert Organization (the major money behind the musical) hired Richard Nelson, a playwright and translator (''Principia Scriptoriae,'' Dario Fo's ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist'') to work with the director, Trevor Nunn. The result, according to Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of Shubert, is ''a new, completely rewritten libretto, with new songs and some new lyrics.'' Among the key changes in the show, a rock musical about a chess tournament set against a background of international intrigue, are that the locales have been reduced to two (Bangkok and Budapest); the number of matches between an American grandmaster and his Russian challenger to one. In London, Elaine Paige had a splashy run as the Hungarian refugee whose allegiance shifts from the American to the Russian. In the new ''Chess,'' the female lead is American. So Broadway audiences will have to wait for another musical (as they did previously, with ''Evita'') for the chance to see Miss Paige, one of the West End's most popular musical stars. ''Carrie'' in Rehearsal A key factor that remains to be figured into the ''Chess'' equation is whether the show will have a pre-Broadway run in the spring in Washington or whether Mr. Nunn (currently represented on Broadway with ''Cats,'' ''Starlight Express'' and ''Les Miserables'') will open the show cold in New York. Shubert runs the National Theater in Washington and has put three other shows wishing to try out there on hold until the organization and the director make their respective moves. Meantime, Mr. Nunn's former Royal Shakespeare Company colleague, Terry Hands, is rehearsing ''Carrie,'' a musical based on the 1976 Stephen King horror film about a teen-age wallflower with formidable mental powers. When the Royal Shakespeare co-produced ''Les Miserables'' with Cameron Mackintosh two seasons ago, there was considerable negative comment in the British press about the subsidized company turning itself over to a commercial producer. This time around, the company seems to have anticipated such criticism by making no pretense that ''Carrie'' is anything other than a commercial project undertaken to fill the company's coffers. The show, with a book by Lawrence D. Cohen and a score by Dean Pitchford and Michael Gore, isn't even going to open in London. After trying out at Stratford-on-Avon, ''Carrie'' is to open in April at the Virginia Theater (whose owner, Jujamcyn Theaters, is a major investor in the project). The company is split equally between Americans (Barbara Cook will star as Carrie's put-upon mother; Debbie Allen is the choreographer) and Britons - the first such transaction generated by the American and British actors' unions. A West End production would then follow, if the show is a success. For the First New York International Festival of the Arts, which commences in June, the producer Alexander Cohen is putting together ''Bright Lights,'' a revue of numbers from half a century of musicals that is to open at the Nederlander-owned Mark Hellinger Theater (which is to be renamed the Richard Rodgers on opening night). Portent of a Housing Crunch Three new American musicals also are in the works for the spring, one of which comes with an estimable track record. Set for a March opening is Bob Telson and Lee Breuer's ''Gospel at Colonus'' - part tent meeting, part Greek tragedy - which was acclaimed when it opened in 1983 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Michael Rupert and Jerry Colker, the minds behind ''Three Guys Naked From the Waist Down,'' are returning with ''Mail,'' about a writer whose friends appear as he reads their missives. And if ''Carrie'' isn't enough for the strong of spirit, there is to be ''Jekyll and Hyde,'' Steve Cuden and Frank Wildhorn's musical based on the Robert Louis Stevenson thriller. None of these has booked a Broadway home yet - an early portent of a housing crunch for plays as well as musicals. Shubert is moving Mbongeni Ngema and Hugh Masekela's ''Sarafina!'' from the Mitzi E. Newhouse to the Cort, while that show's current neighbor upstairs at the Vivian Beaumont, ''Anything Goes,'' will stay put at least through early summer before moving (if the current hit moves) down Broadway to the theater district. Sam Waterston and Robert Prosky are to star in Lee Blessing's ''Walk in the Woods,'' brought to the Booth Theater by Lucille Lortel following runs at the Yale Repertory Theater and at San Diego's La Jolla Playhouse. Two more plays with Yale connections also are planned for the season. In April James Freydberg is to bring Athol Fugard's ''Road to Mecca'' - starring Yvonne Bryceland, an acclaimed South African actress, and the playwright - to the Lyceum. And August Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' is expected in another Shubert house this spring, after its runs at Yale and at Washington's Arena Stage. Shakespeare on Broadway There was considerable competition among the theater owners for ''M. Butterfly,'' David Henry Hwang's drama about a love affair between a French diplomat and a transvestite Chinese opera singer. John Dexter is directing for producer Stuart Ostrow, and the star is John Lithgow. The show is to open in March at the Jujamcyn-owned Eugene O'Neill. Shubert, meanwhile, already has booked Don DeLillo's ''The Day Room,'' which begins performances tomorrow at the Manhattan Theater Club under Michael Blakemore's direction, for a spring transfer to the Golden Theater. Neil Simon, who has brought a show or two to Broadway just about every year for more than two decades, is checking in with ''Jake's Women.'' The Emanuel Azenberg production will probably open at a Shubert house in the late spring. There will be Shakespeare on Broadway this season, as well: ''Macbeth,'' directed by Kenneth Frankel and starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson, is to be brought to an as-yet unnamed theater by Barry and Fran Weissler. How audiences will respond to this fare is, of course, anyone's guess. No one yet knows how the tribulations of Wall Street will affect investment or theatergoing. But in a neat turn of events, there is almost as much grumbling about $7 movie tickets as Broadway's $50 top, and with two months to go until opening, ''The Phantom of the Opera'' had surpassed the $12 million advance-sales record set last year by ''Les Miserables.'' The industry is markedly upbeat and primed for a healthy spring.

1079-> Manhattan Walks Off
Bob Della Bovi, the Manhattan College coach, pulled his team off the floor with 8 minutes 9 seconds to play tonight after receiving his third technical foul in a game against Drexel of Philadelphia. The referees gave Drexel a 70-56 victory in the consolation game of the Spindletop Blowout. Della Bovi incurred two technical fouls for protesting a foul call with Drexel (5-2) leading by 64-56 with 8:20 left. Tom Murphy and Todd Lehmann sank the six shots from the penalties. Manhattan regained possession on a foul call with 8:13 left, but Della Bovi was again charged with a technical for yelling. The coach then pulled his team from the court and the referees ended the game. Billy Wheeler led Manhattan (5-5) with 16 points.

1080-> West Europe Resting Easy After Summit
Most West European Governments appear to be genuinely satisfied that an accord eliminating medium- and shorter-range missiles was signed but relieved that no bold or unsettling superpower initiatives were undertaken. Officials in several capitals said leading European politicians were aware that the debate on strategic defenses in the coming months may be colored and even dominated by the Senate's consideration of the treaty. There is a sense that voicing even minor misgivings might furnish ammunition to Republican conservatives who oppose the agreement. When NATO foreign ministers gathered in Brussels on Thursday, they closed ranks around the treaty. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Secretary, expressed a widely shared feeling when he declared that the ''earliest possible ratification'' of the accord was ''overwhelmingly in the Western interests.'' Celebrations in Europe Both the treaty and the likelihood of an improvement in relations between Moscow and Washington appear to be hugely popular in Western Europe, with the possible exception of France. In Comiso, Sicily, which has a missile base, the Washington summit meeting was greeted with fireworks. In Athens the American and Soviet ambassadors joined Culture Minister Melina Mercouri in smashing a bust of Mars, the god of war. In Britain and West Germany, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have sought to reap political dividends by portraying themselves as godparents of the accord and severely chastizing their domestic leftist foes for having opposed the deployment of American medium-range missiles in 1983, which they contend ultimately made the agreement possible. In a Parliament debate Thursday, Mr. Kohl attacked the opposition Social Democrats for their ''defamations and false predictions'' at the time of deployment four years ago and asserted that his Government's steadfastness had ''made peace more certain for our people.'' Cultivating an intrigued Western Europe, Mikhail S. Gorbachev highlighted Mrs. Thatcher's key role by conferring with her on his way to Washington. She later declared that the treaty showed that the Soviet leader represented ''a new era'' for his nation. Steering Clear of a Vision With potential fissures over future goals already apparent within NATO, Western European officials expressed relief that the Washington meeting steered clear of the visionary nuclear abolitionism that seized President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev when they met in Iceland just over a year ago. A senior NATO diplomat said Mr. Gorbachev might now hold dramatic new initiatives in check because of American domestic considerations. ''The Soviets know that the treaty has got to get ratified,'' the diplomat said, ''and that a fuss within the alliance will not help ratification.'' The greatest concern at NATO headquarters is that Mr. Gorbachev might spring what is called ''a third zero option'' - a proposal for eliminating so-called battlefield nuclear missiles and artillery clustered on both sides of the West German-East German border. This would almost certainly open a split between the major NATO allies and Bonn, where conservative politicians have been pressing to banish what they say is a unique threat to German soil. Since the summit meeting, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and members of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Party have hinted broadly that they will oppose NATO's 1983 decision to modernize the Lance battlefield nuclear missiles based in West Germany and other European nations. If embraced by Chancellor Kohl, this position would put Bonn on a collision course with its allies. Paris Is Tepid on Treaty In Paris, Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond tepidly welcomed the missile treaty ''with satisfaction'' but urged that the focus of arms reductions should now turn away from Europe because ''otherwise there could be a risk of a dynamic of denuclearization.'' Mr. Raimond said the treaty meant Western Europe had to do more for its own defense. It was a message echoed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Copenhagen on Saturday. A number of Western European leaders have already signaled that they do not want the new treaty to lead to an erosion of their defenses. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands has indicated that his country would retain forces committed to NATO's nuclear deterrent strategy that it had planned to abandon in exchange for deploying American ground-launched cruise missiles. And Mrs. Thatcher has called for the modernization of NATO's nuclear forces, including the possible replacement of nuclear bombs with air-launched cruise missiles. ''The Russians will be doing it,'' she said. ''They will expect us to do the same thing.''

1081-> METRO DATELINES; Nussbaum Is Taken To Another Hospital
Hedda Nussbaum, who is accused of murder in the death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg, was transferred yesterday to the Presbyterian Hospital. Ms. Nussbaum arrived in the morning from the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst in Queens, said a Presbyterian spokeswoman, Susan Parker. Bridget G. Brennan, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said the former author and children's book editor had been moved under the terms of an agreement reached with her attorney. ''It is our understanding that she can be better managed medically and psychiatrically at the new location,'' Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Nussbaum, 45 years old, had been hospitalized with various injuries Nov. 2, the same day that Lisa, whose given name was Elizabeth, was found unconscious at the Greenwich Village home Ms. Nussbaum shared with Joel B. Steinberg. He is also charged in the murder. The girl, who had been raised by Ms. Nussbaum and Mr. Steinberg, died Nov. 5. The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said last week that Ms. Nussbaum would undergo 30 days of psychiatric observation and therapy after medical treatment for her injuries.(AP)

1083-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Bound for Hawaii
Jerry Walker of St. Anthony's High School in Jersey City thinks it will be better than the Jersey Shore. His teammate, Bobby Hurley Jr., expects, ''a big ocean.'' And Corey Allen of Tolentine High School in the Bronx is eager to go snorkeling. What the three basketball stars are musing about is the Iolani Classic, a prestigious tournament in Waikiki, Hawaii, which begins Friday with St. Anthony's and Tolentine, two of the premier schoolboy teams in the country, as the top-seeded teams of their brackets. ''We're only high school students and we're going to Hawaii,'' said Jerome Holmes of Tolentine. ''It is like going to the Promised Land.'' ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Walker said. ''Not too many kids from the city get a chance to go to Hawaii.'' That, as it happens, is one of the main points of the five-year-old tournament, the braichild of Glenn Young, the coach at Iolani Prep in Waikiki, who invites eight of the finest schoolboy teams in the nation and completes the field with squads from Hawaii. ''We try to expose the basketball community in Hawaii to top-notch high school basketball,'' Young explained. ''It also gives us a special thrill to bring inner city kids to Hawaii.'' The level of competition in the Iolani is impressive. Flint Hill of Virginia, the unoffocial national high school champion last season, is returning as the two-time defending champion. Fairfax of Los Angeles, Archbishop Rommel of Louisiana, St. John's Prep of Washington and Dunbar of Baltimore are also threats for the title. Nonetheless, the two Metropolitan area teams are top-seeded and they are thinking basketball as well as beaches. ''We would just as soon play these teams on a Jersey City playground as in Hawaii,'' said Sydney Raeford of St. Anthony's. ''Playing the best teams is what is important.'' ''We are going to work hard on the basketball court,'' said Walker, ''so that we can work hard on the beaches.'' If no upsets take place, St. Anthony's and Tolentine will vie for the championship on Dec. 22. ''We have played Tolentine before and we wouldn't mind playing them again,'' said Bob Hurley Sr., the St. Anthony's coach. ''We look forward to playing St. Anthony's,'' said Malik Sealy of Tolentine. ''They beat us last year and we have a score to settle.''

1084-> Volcker Urges Firmer Dollar
Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that he thought the dollar had fallen too low, a situation that he said might depress overseas economies and produce inflation in the United States. Mr. Volcker, interviewed on the ABC-TV program ''Business World,'' said the United States should take more forceful action to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Asked at what point a low dollar threatened world trade and the world economy, he said, ''In my opinion, it's already fallen further than I would like to see it.'' Mr. Volcker, who was succeeded in August at the Federal Reserve by Alan Greenspan, also said that too much emphasis was being put on the dollar as a way to cut the United States trade deficit and not enough emphasis on persuading Japan and West Germany to stimulate their economies. ''I don't think it's helpful to have the dollar fall at this point because I think it can be depressing on economic activity abroad,'' he said, adding that it could be potentially inflationary in the United States. ''We have to, relatively, slow the growth of our consumption, make more room for exports, make more room for investment,'' Mr. Volcker said.

1086-> Farm Credit Bill Advances
The House Agriculture Committee has approved a sweeping restructuring of the farm lending system in what could ultimately be a huge Federal bailout. The vote came after a 16-hour hearing that ended late Wednesday night. But Congressmen refused to specify how much money the financially distressed system would need or how that money would be appropriated. The bill will be considered by the full House in September. The farm credit system, the nation's largest rural lender, with a portfolio of about $50 billion, lost $4.8 billion in the last 27 months because of farm loans that were not repaid. It is expected to lose billions more in the next few years. Concern has been mounting that some Federal land banks within the huge system may not survive much longer. The system currently consists of 12 districts and includes 37 large regional banks. Under the restructuring proposal, the farm credit districts would be dissolved and no more than six regional farm credit system service banks would be formed.

1087-> Con Edison Agrees to Freeze Rates for Gas Customers for Two Years
Rates for Consolidated Edison gas customers in New York City and Westchester County will be frozen at existing levels for at least two years, under an agreement announced today by Governor Cuomo. The agreement, which is subject to approval by the State Public Service Commission, is similar to four others approved by the commission this year in which utilities agreed to use anticipated Federal tax refunds to lower rates, and not seek increases until 1990. In each instance, the rate reduction was made by applying anticipated savings to the utilities under the Federal Tax Reduction Act of 1986, according to Richard Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board. In Con Edison's case, the company applied an anticipated $11 million in tax savings to keep its gas rates stable. In January, the Public Service Commission ratified an accord between the state and Con Edison that resulted in 3.3 percent reduction in the utility's electric rates. 'Cost Stability' Expected Arthur Hauspurg, the chairman of Con Edison, said, ''This freeze in gas rates, coupled with our recent electric rate agreement, brings years of energy cost stability to New York and Westchester.'' A typical residential Con Edison customer will continue to pay about $204 a month to heat with gas during the coldest months, about $36 to heat water and $12 to cook with gas. All of Con Edison's one million gas customers are in Manhattan, the Bronx, northern Queens and Westchester County. The utility was last granted a rate increase in November 1985. It did not apply for one last year because of savings from increased productivity and decreases in inflation, a Con Ed spokesman, Martin Gitten, said. Mr. Kessel said he was confident the state would reach agreements on the tax refunds with most of the other utilties in the state, with the possible exception of the Long Island Lighting Company. Lilco has been involved in a prolonged and costly battle with state and Federal authorities to open its Shoreham nuclear power plant. ---- Refunds Set in Connecticut HARTFORD, Aug. 6 (AP) - State utility regulators and Connecticut's largest producer of electricity have agreed to a formula for refunding $30 million to ratepayers over the next three months. Of the $30 million, $10 million will be evenly distributed among the customers of the utility, the Connecticut Light and Power Company, bringing each ratepayer $3.25 a month through October, the company said today. The remaining $20 million will be distributed on the basis of annual use of electricity. The company said a typical residential bill for 500 kilowatt hours of electricity, which was $47.73 in July, would fall to $42.38 in August. The refund was called for last year under an agreement signed by the company and state officials after a reduction in the company's level of authorized earnings. Revenues are placed into a special fund during months when the utility's return on equity exceeds 14.5 percent.

1088-> For Mozart's Librettist, a Queens Fanfare
It seemed an unlikely event in an incongruous place. Yesterday, a Jewish City Councilman, Italian-American dignitaries and local history buffs honored the librettist of three of Mozart's operas at a cemetery in Queens as trucks rumbled by. But perhaps the event was in keeping with the contradictory quality of the life of the honoree himself, Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838). Da Ponte, who wrote the text for Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' was a Venetian Jew who became a Catholic, a priest who became a libertine and married man, and a court poet in Europe who made a living in America as, among other things, a grocer. About 20 people gathered yesterday, which also was Italian Heritage Day, in Section 4B of Calvary Cemetery in Maspeth, at a flat, grassy plot where a four-foot granite monument was dedicated to an artist who had lived royally for a time but died poor. Speaking above the din of truck traffic from nearby Laurel Hill Boulevard, Morton Povman, a history enthusiast and Councilman from Forest Hills, said: ''He is never mentioned in the play or film 'Amadeus.' Yet, his librettos and connections were integral to Mozart's successes.'' Da Ponte had the confidence of Emperor Joseph II of Austria, something Mozart did not have. After the death of Joseph, his benefactor, da Ponte wandered around Europe and arrived in America in 1805 at age 56 in a state of debt that would be constant.He lived most of his remaining years in Manhattan, tutored students in Italian poetry, music and painting and became the first professor of Italian literature at Columbia College. He welcomed the first Italian opera company to the United States, built a short-lived opera house in lower Manhattan, and is credited with a major role in introducing Italian opera to America. As in the case of Mozart, who died in 1791, the exact spot where da Ponte is buried is unknown. He died at 91 Spring Street in Manhattan and was buried at a Catholic cemetery on 11th Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, a site that was later paved over. Felix J. Cuervo, a local historian who founded the Native New Yorkers' Historical Association in 1961, said at yesterday's ceremony that he had known about the burial site in Manhattan. ''In a garage, I found some headstones that belonged to those who had been buried in the cemetery,'' Mr. Cuervo said. ''I did some research and discovered the remains of the people were removed to Calvary Cemetery in 1909.'' 'Cultural Leader for Everyone' He notified Jeanne Capodilupo, assistant to the president of Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, who helped in obtaining the monument. ''Da Ponte was a cultural leader for everyone,'' said Jeff Gottlieb, an aide to Councilman Povman who helped set up the ceremony. ''Everyone loves Mozart's music, and the librettos for three of his great operas. In fact, my own dentist, Dr. Ezra Kulko, came here today to take part.'' Before his death at age 89 on Aug. 17, 1838, da Ponte bitterly complained: ''I, the poet of Joseph II, the author of 36 dramas, the inspiration of Salieri, of Weigl, of Martini, of Winter and Mozart! After 27 years of hard labor, I have no longer a pupil! Nearly 90 years old, I have no more bread in America!'' Yesterday, some diverse people in Queens gave some spiritual sustenance at a cemetery site in the shadow of the Kosciusko Bridge.

1089-> Film: 'Happy New Year'
HAPPY NEW YEAR'' didn't look very original or very funny back in 1973, when the original French film, written and directed by Claude Lelouch, opened in New York. The curious thing about the American remake, opening today at the Quad and New Carnegie Cinemas, is that although it's no better, it's certainly not worse. Mr. Lelouch's screenplay, about a couple of aging Paris hoods who attempt to loot the Van Cleef & Arpels shop in Cannes, has been transposed to Palm Beach. The Carlton Hotel is now the Breakers and Van Cleef & Arpels has been turned into Harry Winston, which does not have a shop in Palm Beach. Warren Lane's screenplay sticks pretty closely to Mr. Lelouch's. John Avildsen is the director. Though the story now seems just that much more tired than it did then, the new film has the advantage of good comic performances by Peter Falk, as the brains of the jewel heist, Charles Durning, as his partner, and Wendy Hughes, the Australian actress, as the classy Palm Beach shop owner who falls for Mr. Falk. Lino Ventura, Charles Gerard and Francoise Fabian were the original stars. The new version also has the advantage of the comic presence of Tom Courtenay, who plays the fastidious manager of the jewelry store and shares the film's funniest moments with Mr. Falk. These are the sequences in which Mr. Falk cases the store disguised, alternately, as a doddering Palm Beach socialite and the socialite's flirtatious, battleship-shaped sister. It's first-rate revue-sketch material. Everything else is vamping for time. ''Happy New Year,'' which has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), includes some vulgar language. Boutique Clique HAPPY NEW YEAR, directed by John Avildsen; written by Warren Lane, director of photography, James Crabe; production designer, William Cassidy; produced by Jerry Weintraub; released by Columbia Pictures. At Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street; New Carnegie, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue. Running time: 86 minutes. This film is rated PG. Nick... Peter Falk; Charlie... Charles Durning; Carolyn...

1091-> Head Rabbi Made Lord In Britain's Honors List
The New Year's honor list, which confers on a handful of people the traditional appellations of entry into the English aristocracy, includes a rather striking new life peer: Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits. The head of the United Hebrew Congregations of Britain and the Commonwealth, he will become Rabbi Lord Jakobovits and can sit in the House of Lords, alongside the bishops of the established Church of England. Making Rabbi Jakobovits a life peer this year is the kind of award that defenders of the honors system point to as evidence that it is a democratic institution, a means of giving public recognition to people of merit. And it helps explain why a system whose titles conjure medieval notions of jousting knights and feudal lords remains popular in modern-day Britain. ''There is overwhelming public support for the honors system in Britain,'' said Robert Worcester, chairman of Market and Opinion Research International, a polling organization that has surveyed British attitudes toward the honors system. 'Cheapest Coin of the Realm' Mr. Worcester added: ''And it's the cheapest coin of the realm for the Government. It is enormously valuable in terms of generating good will and costs almost nothing.'' The British honors system has been attacked by some as an anachronism that perpetuates class divisions. In the past, the honors system has been touched by a few peerage-selling scandals. And recently, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been accused of using the honors system as a crude form of political patronage, having granted knighthoods to more than 70 Conservative politicians since she came to office in 1979. Yet, like so many British institutions, the honors system has survived for centuries remarkably intact. Though the honors awards are made in the Queen's name, they are directed by the Prime Minister's office and reflect the thinking of the ruling party. Under Mrs. Thatcher, Tory politicians and industrialists have been frequent recipients of peerages and knighthoods, while union leaders are honored during Labor governments. The Labor Party is formally opposed to the honors system. But that is mostly egalitarian posturing, since there is no prospect that the system will be abolished. And Labor does not refrain from awarding knighthoods and peerages to its flock. The upper echelons of the honors list are the peers and knights. These titles have been synonymous with the British aristocracy since the 12th century. A third category of honors, the British Empire awards, was founded in 1917, designating individuals as commanders, officers or members, and perhaps best-known by the initials C.B.E., O.B.E. and M.B.E. In all, roughly 1,000 honors are announced each year, with the New Year's honors being the largest single group. On Thursday, the public will learn that this New Year's list contains 669 honors, with the names of each person in most of the major papers. In addition to naming the rabbi, this year's list contains some unusual features. A knighthood was awarded posthumously to the golfer Henry Cotton, who died on Dec. 23, after the award had been decided but before it was announced. In addition, 14 people were given special honors for their heroism in saving lives when a British ferry capsized off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on March 6, killing 188. Campaign Contributors Still, most of the honors list conforms to the pattern of the Thatcher years. For example, there are seven business executives among the 33 knighthoods awarded. A study of the honors system by John Walker, a Laborite, concluded that a British business executive roughly doubled his chances of a peerage or knighthood if his company made a hefty contribution to the Conservative Party during the Thatcher years. But the Thatcherite preference for granting top honors to business executives probably has much more to do with ideological affinity than financial contributions. An ardent advocate of free-enterprise capitalism, Mrs. Thatcher has used the honors system to try to upgrade the image of the businessman in Britain by creating a bevy of ''industrial knights.'' This, says Mr. Worcester, the pollster, is part of the ''attitudinal renovation'' of Britain that Mrs. Thatcher has tried to engineer in the 1980's. Judging by his organization's survey, the Thatcherite effort has shown some success but the revolution remains unfinished. Half of the public replied that business leaders as a group deserve honors, which compares favorably with union officials at 19 percent, civil servants, 22 percent, and judges and lawyers, 38 percent. But executives still ranked well below others in the public's view of groups deserving honors, including scientists at 85 percent, and sports stars, 60 percent.

1093-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Gains Slightly; Gold Up $1.20, to $468.70
The dollar rose yesterday despite rumors that central banks intervened to stop its advance. Gold prices calmed after fairly large price swings earlier this week. At the Republic National Bank in New York, gold rose $1.20 an ounce, to $468.70. Currency traders said the dollar bounced back after rumors circulated that both the Federal Reserve Bank and West Germany's Bundesbank were selling dollars. ''They want to keep the dollar down, but I don't think the intervention was anything major league,'' said Lou Calvello, a trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 'People Still Want to Buy' The dollar dropped sharply against the German mark as rumors began circulating early in the day, but that did not last. ''People still want to buy dollars,'' said Stephen Dakin, foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland. He said the tensions in the Middle East were causing investors to continue to seek a safe haven in the American currency. Trading was quiet, with the dollar moving only in narrow ranges, dealers said. The dollar was mostly higher in Europe, where dealers also sensed central bank intervention. In early trading, commercial demand helped the dollar rise against several major European currencies. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 150.83 yen, from 151.55 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it was quoted at 151.05 yen. The dollar finished the day in New York at 151.42 yen, up from 150.85 yen. Slightly Cheaper Pound In London, the dollar gained slightly against the British pound. It cost $1.5755 to buy one pound, down from $1.5765 Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.5773 to buy one pound, down from $1.5792. Other late dollar rates in New York included: 1.8828 West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.5630 Swiss francs, up from 1.5590; 6.2742 French francs, up from 6.2617; 1,363.50 Italian lire, up from 1,361.00, and 1.3234 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3239. Other late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.8820 West German marks, up from 1.8810; 1.5605 Swiss francs, up from 1.5583; 6.2715 French francs, unchanged; 1,362.90 Italian lire, down from 1,363.00, and 1.3230 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3243. Gold rose $1.20 an ounce, to $468, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Elsewhere, however, gold prices fell slightly in quiet trading. In London, gold dipped 30 cents, to a late bid price of $468.50 an ounce. In Zurich, the metal slipped $1, to $469.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.03, to $469.05. Silver fell 7.2 cents, to $8.26 an ounce, on the Comex. In London, silver traded at a late bid of $8.37, down 22.5 cents an ounce.

1094-> Disputed Alzheimer's Drug Faces New Tests
A clinical trial of an experimental drug that has shown some promise of reducing memory loss in victims of Alzheimer's disease, but whose value has been sharply questioned by many experts, was announced today by top Federal health officials. The officials said the $5 million study had been begun with unusual speed because of rising public clamor for the highly publicized but unproven drug, THA, for tetrahydroaminocrydine. Dr. T. Franklin Williams, director of the National Institute on Aging, called THA ''the first drug'' that offered ''some measure of hope'' for treating memory loss in Alzheimer's victims. But he also warned against ''raising false expectations'' for a drug that would never be a cure for the disease and probably would not help the sickest patients. Dr. Kenneth L. Davis of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, who will direct the new clinical trial, predicted that the drug would help some patients slow the loss of their mental capacities. ''I think we'll find a subgroup of patients who will have a moderate improvement,'' he said. The clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of THA in about 300 Alzheimer's patients at 17 treatment centers around the nation. The study will take two years to complete, but Dr. Andrew Monjan of the National Institute on Aging said, ''We expect to know within a year whether the drug might benefit Alzheimer patients.'' The drug gained prominence last November when The New England Journal of Medicine published an article asserting that THA had produced favorable results in 16 out of 17 Alzheimer's patients and ''dramatic objective improvement'' in the mental functioning of 10 of those patients. The report ignited the first hope in years for some 2.5 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a progressive mental deterioration for which there is no cure and not even a treatment for those with major symptoms. Thousands of calls were made to the California psychiatrist who had conducted the study, Dr. William K. Summers; to Federal health agencies, and to the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association, a patient-support group. But the potential value of THA has become increasingly controversial in recent months. Patients and their families have clamored for access to the drug, while leading scientists in the field have warned that the original study by Dr. Summers was deeply flawed and might in fact be wrong. A barrage of letters to The New England Journal challenged the tests used by Dr. Summers to evaluate the mental functioning of the patients, the criteria for accepting or rejecting patients from the study, the dramatic results claimed for a drug that others had found only minimally effective, and various financial arrangements in which Dr. Summers sought to charge patients up to $12,000 a year for treatment while seeking a limited-use patent for the drug that he hoped to sell for $1 million. 'Replication Study Needed' ''His report was spectacular to the point of being unbelievable,'' said Dr. John Growdon, an associate professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, which will participate in the new study. ''There's no question in anybody's mind that a replication study needed to be done.'' Dr. Paul D. Leber, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, also called for more tests of THA. ''I can't tell from the papers that have been published whether the stuff shows a lot of promise or no promise at all,'' he said. ''The only responsible thing is to go out and test it.'' The drug is not expected to stop or reverse the underlying brain deterioration in Alzheimer's victims, but it may help to alleviate temporarily the core symptoms of the disease, such as loss of memory. The drug may slow the breakdown of a key chemical in the brain, acetylcholine, which seems to be involved in memory. But it can only work as long as there are enough brain cells left to produce the acetylcholine. As the destruction of brain cells progresses, the treatment, even if it worked initially, would become ineffective. 'Unique Cooperative Effort' The new study was described as a ''unique cooperative effort'' in which the National Institute of Aging will provide $1.9 million, the Warner-Lambert Company of Morris Plains, N.J., will spend $3 million and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association will contribute $250,000. The association has set up a toll-free telephone line (800-621-0379 in most locations, 800-572-6037 in Illinois) to provide information about the drug and the 17 testing sites. Although promising drugs are usually tested at the expense of drug companies, Federal officials said the Government was helping to sponsor the new trial because it has a network of Alzheimer's research centers in operation and can lend credibility to whatever findings emerge. They also said drug companies were not interested in sponsoring, by themselves, a costly trial of a drug that cannot be patented because the chemical has been available for decades. Warner-Lambert executives said the company was taking considerable risk by putting up its $3 million share to test THA, but they acknowledged ''some commercial possibilities'' if the drug proved effective and said they would have a limited five-year protection against rapid development of competitive drugs. Dr. Summers, who chose not to participate in the new trial because he is trying to preserve his own commercial interests in the drug, said in a telephone interview that ''this drug has tremendous commercial potential'' that could reach $500 million to $1 billion a year, according to some estimates he has seen. Research Bill Introduced WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (AP) -Legislation to expand research on Alzheimer's disease and provide more care for its victims was introduced today by Representative Edward R. Roybal, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging. In a statement introducing the bill, which would provide $175 million and triple the amount of money for research on the disease, Mr. Roybal hailed clinical tests of THA as ''a potential step forward in the war against Alzheimer's.''

1096-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Insurance Broker Gets First Non-Corroon Chief
The Corroon & Black Corporation, a big insurance brokerage, has named Richard M. Miller chief executive. Robert F. Corroon, 65, and the son of a founder, has relinquished the position. Mr. Miller, 56, will be the first non-Corroon to head the company and will be its fifth chief executive since the company was founded in New York in 1905 as R. A. Corroon & Company. The company changed its name in 1966 when it acquired C. R. Black, a brokerage firm. Mr. Miller has been chief operating officer of Corroon & Black since 1976 and president since 1978. He will continue as president. John R. Lamberson, 54, has been named chief operating officer. He has been executive vice president since 1986. ''I really can't say there will be any change in strategy,'' Mr. Miller said last week. ''Bob Corroon and I have worked together for almost 12 years now. The strategy has been developed and that is the strategy we will move forward with.'' Corroon & Black, still based in New York, calls itself one of the world's largest full-service insurance intermediaries, providing brokerage, employee benefits consulting and risk management services. After several years when insurance companies pushed pricing sky high, ''insurance companies are in a competitive mood again, and prices are down,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Those who add value to the product are going to get the business.'' Mr. Miller came to Coroon & Black in 1976 when it acquired the Synercon Corporation, a Southern insurance brokerage that he headed as president and chief executive. Mr. Miller grew up in Nashville, was graduated from Vanderbilt University there, and after serving as a first lieutenant in the Marines, founded an insurance brokerage bearing his name. That company was later merged into Synercon. Corroon & Black was founded by two brothers, Richard A. and James F. Corroon. Robert F. Corroon, the current chief executive, is the son of James Corroon and has been chief executive since 1975. He will succeed Frank M. Hagan as chairman of the board's executive committee. Mr. Hagan will remain a board member.

1097-> As Deer Increase in the Suburbs, Their Charm Fades
The deer population in much of the metropolitan region has reached its highest level in centuries, posing serious, as well as occasionally comical, problems for motorists, farmers and suburban homeowners. Two months ago, for example, a white-tailed deer hit by a car stopped traffic in downtown Stamford, Conn. Two weeks ago, a deer collided with a police car in New Rochelle, N.Y., 13 miles from Times Square. ''I understand that because of some construction going on north of here, they are migrating down,'' said Capt. Louis M. Zummo of the New Rochelle police. ''Unfortunately, they are migrating in the wrong direction.'' 'Road Kills' Increase The reasons for the increase include not only the return to forest of fallow farmland and the growth of young trees with branches low enough for feeding, but also the clearing of land for new development. When land is cleared for housing, for example, deer can browse on the twigs and leaves of felled trees. And that suburban habitat becomes off limits to hunters. ''We're going back to the days before the Revolution,'' said Nathaniel R. Dickinson, a wildlife official with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ''That's why you have more turkeys. Coyotes are all over, and we're going to have bear moving in. ''People are always saying, 'Where has all the wildlife gone?' But you don't have any trouble finding wildlife today.'' Wildlife officials worry most about a dramatic increase in the number of road kills -deer killed by motorists. In New York, the number of road kills rose to 8,624 last year from 7,615 in 1985. In Connecticut, the 2,423 road kills last year were 46 percent more than in 1985 and more than double the number in 1981. But officials also report a growing number of complaints from farmers finding deer browsing in their orchards, alfalfa fields and nursery stock. And just as annoyed are homeowners in areas like Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn., who find deer stripping their shrubs. ''People say isn't it wonderful, having deer in their backyards,'' said Mr. Dickinson. ''But after a while, after the deer start browsing, they start looking at them like rats. Their attitude really changes.'' Little Change in Jersey In New York, the deer population has grown to an estimated 750,000 from about 450,000 10 years ago, In Connecticut, it grew to about 30,000 from 19,000 over the same period. New Jersey officials said their deer population has held relatively steady at 150,000 for the last 10 years. They said an increase in road kills to about 6,000 last year from 5,000 the year before was due primarily to a better reporting system. Precise statistics are unavailable, but officials said many of the New York road kills were in the Catskills and in Dutchess and Columbia Counties, while 36 percent of the road kills in Connecticut were in Fairfield County and 14 percent in Litchfield County. ''The number of road kills is very high,'' said George E. Brys, assistant communications director for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's wildlife bureau. Mr. Brys said the rise in road kills reflects increased traffic in rural areas as well as a growing deer population. He said the problem is compounded when deer move into suburban areas because deer are almost impossible to hunt when they are so close to homes. Furthermore, in most of Westchester County deer hunting with a firearm is illegal, and in Fairfield County the sport does not appear to be as popular as it is in other parts of the state. To combat the deer problem, Connecticut wildlife officials have moved the hunting season up by one week, so hunters will be in the field when the deer population is at its peak. The archery season - the first phase of the hunting season - started Friday in New Jersey, Sunday in northern New York and will begin tomorrow in Connecticut. All three states have several different seasons, depending on the location and the weapon used. Starting this year, Connecticut will require that hunters who kill their limit of two deer include at least one that lacks antlers. Such deer, experts say, are likely to be female, and killing females helps curb the population. In New York, wildlife officials have raised the number of available hunting permits from 270,000 to 400,000. They also hope to increase the number of deer a hunter can kill with a deer management permit to three from two, and they hope the Legislature will open more public lands to hunting. Last year, 178,713 deer were legally killed in New York. This year, officials hope to see that figure increase to about 230,000. In New Jersey, 33,771 were killed last year, and officials expect a harvest of about 35,000 this year. In Connecticut, 5,394 deer were killed last year. Officials would like to see 7,000 killed this year. ''We'd probably be better with fewer deer in the state,'' said James V. Spignesi, a deer biologist with the Department of Environmental Protection. 'We're Scratching Our Heads' Mr. Dickinson cited lower than projected hunting harvests as one reason for the growing deer population. He said this might be attributed to a declining interest in the sport or a decline in skill. ''We're scratching our heads over that one,'' he said. Not everyone, however, is convinced that deer are overrunning parts of New York and Connecticut. Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals Inc., a national organization based in South Norwalk, Conn., disputed the official herd-size statistics and called on the state to let a biologist from her organization take part in the state's aerial surveys of the deer population. Ms. Feral, who opposes hunting, said, ''The D.E.P. manages the deer population for hunting.'' Wildlife officials, however, reject such criticism and argue that the deer population is rapidly reaching a point where it is becoming a nuisance. Moreover, without increased hunting, they say, deer in some areas of New York and Connecticut could overpopulate to the point where they would face starvation in winter. ''We're not at the starvation point; it's mainly just a vehicle and agricultural problem right now,'' Mr. Spignesi said. ''How soon before the starving situation takes in? We couldn't tell you.''

1098-> Bangladesh President Dissolves Parliament
The Government dissolved Parliament today, almost a month after the opposition began a campaign of strikes and demonstrations to topple President H. M. Ershad. The action was taken after a Cabinet meeting presided over by Mr. Ershad, a former army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982. State-run Bangladesh Television said: ''The president has dissolved the Parliament.'' Mr. Ershad's Jatiya Party held more than two-thirds of the seats in the 330-member Parliament, which was elected May 7, 1986. The opposition accused the Government of fraud in that balloting. Mr. Ershad has offered to hold new parliamentary elections in an effort to halt the campaign for his ouster, but the major opposition parties have continued to insist on his resignation. The opposition, led by the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, has carried out a series of strikes and rallies since Nov. 10 to press its demand. Another strike was planned for Monday despite a state-of-emergency decree, issued Nov. 27, banning political activity. The 10 members of the Parliament from the Moslem fundamentalist party Jamit-i-Islami resigned on Thursday and an independent member quit Saturday, all saying they were protesting the lawmakers' ineffectiveness. There also were reports that the 76 members from the Awami League, the largest of the opposition parties in Parliament, had planned to resign. Status of Balloting Uncertain It was not immediately clear if the dissolution of Parliament meant Mr. Ershad planned new elections. Outbreaks of violence have marked the campaign to oust the president. At least four people have been reported killed, and the Goverment has said more than 2,500 people have been arrested. At least two explosions were heard tonight in the capital. There were no reports of injuries or arrests in the blasts, one of which was apparently near the Central Secretariat, a major Government building. The Government four weeks ago placed under house arrest the chief opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina Wajed of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. A Cabinet minister said Government officials had been discussing with the opposition a plan for ending the oust-Ershad campaign and holding early elections. He spoke on condition that he not be identified by name.

1099-> MUSIC: 'STILL LIVES'
PHILIP GLASS, Laurie Anderson and do-it-yourself electronic minimalists were among the subjects that the experimental composer William Hellermann amusingly twitted in his performance art music piece ''Still Lives'' at the Alternative Museum on Wednesday evening. ''Still Lives'' consisted of six short scenes depicting ''a day in the life of a composer.'' In each of them, Mr. Hellermann improvised homemade electronic background music on a Casio CT7000 synthesizer. For the first segment, ''Sheet Music,'' the composer wandered onto the stage in a nightshirt and programmed his miniature synthesizer to play woozy theme music that was soon joined by his rhythmic snores and wheezes as he feigned sleep in a miniature bed of his own design. In the second scene, ''Music Weighs an Egg,'' Mr. Hellermann cracked eggs into a mixing bowl around whose edges he twirled a wire whisk, improvising a jingly countertheme to a pre-programmed Glass-like fragment. ''Afterdinner Music'' contrasted the scratching rhythm of methodical dishwashing using a stiff brush, with similiarly textured synthesized music. For ''Evening the Score,'' the composer plugged an electric iron into the synthesizer and tried to press an exceedingly wrinkled shirt on a silver-striped ironing board. The segment called ''Rakes Progress'' found him pushing a pile of leaves around the stage to an improvised raking theme. For ''One Bar Blues,'' he donned the sort of slatted sunglasses that Laurie Anderson often wears and treated the synthesizer as a bar on which he poured himself an ale to the accompaniment of a bouncy, squeaky theme. In the final segment, ''El Ropo,'' the composer impersonated a sinister bigwig puffing on an unlighted cigar and laughing joylessly along with an electronic voice similar to the computerized pulse of Ms. Anderson's ''O Superman.'' Mr. Hellermann whimsically categorizes his various mixtures of music, activity and objects as ''sculpture.'' And in its sly, tongue-in-cheek way, ''Still Lives'' succeeded in evoking a vision of contemporary life as a cheap, push-button sensorama deserving of satire.

The second-century bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius and his horse will be restored and returned to its place on Capitoline Hill. City officials said Wednesday that they would spend $460,000 to complete restoration of the Emperor's statue, which was removed from the square in front of City Hall in 1981 because of air pollution and other damage.

1102-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Bo Jackson's 'Hobby'
To anyone who has ever stood on the sideline at a National Football League game, the noise of the collisions sounds more like an automobile crash than that of a ''hobby.'' But in explaining his decision to join the Los Angeles Raiders as a running back after his last baseball game as a Kansas City Royals outfielder this year, Bo Jackson described pro football as a ''hobby.'' At least for him. ''Like hunting or fishing,'' he said. Not quite. Trying to elude Lawrence Taylor or any other N.F.L. linebacker has never been found under any definition of a ''hobby.'' Stamp collecting is a hobby. When Bo was talking about pro football being a hobby, maybe he was really thinking of coin collecting. For a reported $2.5 million from the Raiders for five years, Jackson will be trying to do what no other athlete since Jim Thorpe has done even somewhat successfully - play both baseball and pro football in the same year. By also playing pro football, Bo is asking to be hailed as a sports superman. But more than anything else, he's asking to be hurt. Possibly seriously enough to diminish his ability not only in pro football but also in baseball. When Bo spurned the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to sign with the Royals last year, he said: ''My knees are my bread and butter. I don't feel like going under anybody's scalpel.'' He had preferred the longevity and the eventual bigger money of baseball over the lure of pro football for a Heisman Trophy winner, the very first choice in the N.F.L. draft. In the N.F.L., the scalpel is always only one collision away. Especially for a running back. Back when Bo was blasting the first few homers of the 18 he has hit this season, Sparky Anderson, the Detroit Tigers' manager, described him as ''the best athlete I've ever seen in a baseball uniform.'' Not the best baseball player, but the best athlete. Power, running speed, throwing arm. At a sculptured 6 feet 1 inch and 225 pounds, Bo had it all. But the most prevalent injuries in pro football, especially for a running back, are to a knee and a shoulder. And serious damage to either one of Bo's knees or to his right shoulder could damage, if not finish, Bo's careers in both sports. Baseball players hit with the leverage provided by their knees and their shoulders. And a damaged knee would also affect Bo's running speed; a damaged right shoulder would affect his throwing arm. Another factor is how long it would take Bo to get his knees and shoulders strengthened enough to withstand N.F.L. contact. By the nature of their games, baseball players are more flexible than football players, who need more muscle. ''I will rest as long as I think I need before joining the Raiders,'' Bo has said. Maybe so, but Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general genius, has never been known for his patience. Especially with a running back with a $2.5 million contract. And with no training camp or exhibition games, Bo would be more susceptible to injury. The last player to try to play in both the N.F.L. and the big leagues in the same year was Vic Janowicz, a Heisman Trophy running back and place-kicker with the Washington Redskins in 1954 after having been a catcher and third baseman with the Pittsburgh Pirates that baseball season. ''Janowicz was severely handicapped by the lack of preseason training camp and scrimmaging,'' the Redskins acknowledged later. Janowicz rushed for only 13 yards that season after batting .151 for the Pirates in 41 games. He drove in only two runs. Bo Jackson has already shown that he's a much better baseball player than Janowicz was. And as a fullback alongside Marcus Allen he's sure to rush for more than 13 yards. But he won't join the Raiders this year until at least their fifth game of their 16-game schedule - a Monday night visit to Denver on Oct. 12. If the Royals were to qualify or the American League Championship Series and the World Series, he wouldn't report until halfway through the N.F.L. season. ''Bo will be a baseball player,'' said John Schuerholz, the Royals' general manager, ''from the first day of spring training each year until the last game we play.'' Even so, the Royals are angry at Bo's decision. According to Schuerholz, it was not a move to increase Bo's baseball salary. ''Money was never mentioned,'' the general manager said. ''But the front office agreed to accommodate Bo's desire to play pro football rather than risk losing him to the Raiders completely. ''Our biggest fear is Bo being injured,'' Schuerholz said. ''We wouldn't want to lose a player who's had such a remarkable baseball career in such a short time.'' To protect their investment, the Royals intend to restructure Bo's contract in the event of a football injury that would affect his baseball career. But according to Schuerholz, by joining the Raiders after the season, Bo doesn't owe the Royals a refund. ''If he were to choose football only, it would be different,'' Schuerholz said. ''The liquidating damages in his contract involves an either-or situation, not a both-sports situation.'' Some of the Royals' players have complained of feeling betrayed by Bo's decision. But at the All-Star Game, their ace right-hander with a 15-3 record,, Bret Saberhagen, didn't sound too annoyed. ''If Bo can go out and play two sports, more power to him,'' Saberhagen said. ''It's not going to hurt us this year. But maybe if he gets banged up. I never played football except as a sophomore in high school. Those guys were too big. In football, guys are trying to kill you.'' It's not that way in stamp collecting.

1103-> SCOUTING; Hall of Fame Adds a Window
The window that a 3-year-old Pete Rose broke with the first line drive of his life is going to be broken forever - but not at the old Rose home in Cincinnati. Authorities at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., want the cracked window to become part of the museum's permanent collection, according to Peter Clark, registrar at the Hall of Fame. ''There is overwhelming support to acquire the window,'' Clark said. ''It is a unique item and you get a chance at something like this only once in a lifetime. We'll find a way to display it.'' The committee in charge of accessions had originally decided not to acquire the window, but had a change of heart following national publicity about Rose's first hit, Clark said. Rose broke the window pane while playing baseball with his father on the family's rear patio in 1943. He crushed a drive into what would have been right-center field and his father, the late Harry Rose, declared that the pane of glass would never be replaced. He wanted to show friends how far his little boy could hit the ball. ''After my husband passed away, I'd look at the window and think about replacing it,'' said 72-year-old LaVerne Noeth, Pete's mother. ''And then I'd think, no, Harry wanted it that way, so it's going to stay that way.'' Perma-View windows and doors, a Cincinnati-based window company, has offered to replace the window and ship it to Cooperstown free of charge, said a company spokesman, Arnold Barnett. Donald Rolf Jr., president of People Savings Association, owner of the old Rose homestead in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Riverside, said the Savings and Loan will cooperate in removing and replacing the historic window. Rose, the manager of the Cincinnati Reds and the career major league hit leader, wondered why people were making such a fuss about a broken pane of glass. ''It's just a window,'' Rose said. ''And it's not broken, it's cracked.'' His comments were echoed by Eric Davis, the Reds' All-Star center fielder. ''What kid hasn't broken a window?'' Davis asked.

1104-> Soviet Opening a New Jewish Route to Israel
The Soviet Union is opening an East European pathway for Jewish emigration Thursday by sending out at least four emigrants on a flight to Bucharest, Rumania, and ticketing them through to Israel, friends of the four said today. The family of Mark Nepomnyashchy, a recently freed prisoner from the Black Sea port of Odessa, was told today that it had permission to leave for Bucharest. The four would become the first Soviet Jews to use the Moscow-Bucharest route. The Rumanian route has been advocated by Israeli officials over the current Moscow-Vienna exit route because that route would make it virtually impossible for Soviet Jews to apply for refugee status under United States immigration laws. Up to now, Jews arriving in Vienna have had a choice of proceeding to Israel or stopping off in Austria to wait for visas to the United States. Soviet Jews who fly through Bucharest would be able to go on directly to Israel and apparently would not have the option of altering the destination. Rumania is the only Communist-bloc nation in Europe that did not break off relations with Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Many Soviet Jewish emigrants have chosen to bypass Israel and go to the United States instead. It was not clear whether the decision to send the Nepomnyashchys through Bucharest was done as a result of an agreements reached by a Soviet delegation presently holding talks with Israeli officials in Jerusalem. The delegation is the first to visit Israel in 20 years. The Rumanian route could serve the needs of the Israelis who are constantly seeking new immigrants, and might potentially help the Soviet Union by cutting back the number of would-be Jewish emigrants who file under Soviet law for the right of repatriation or to join close relatives, but actually intend to go to the United States or some West European country such as France. Israeli officials have pressed the United States to abandon its policy of granting refugee status to Jewish emigrants but thus far to no avail. Mark Nepomnyashchy's son-in-law, Yakov Levin, said that the family had chosen to go through Rumania ''on principle, to create a precedent.'' The opening of the Rumanian route comes at a time when the upsurge in the number of exit visas granted to Jews in recent months had subsided somewhat, with the number of visas in June dropping below 800. The June figure puts the 1987 total above 3,000, which is nearly four times the 814 total in all of 1986.

1105-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Cris Carter Ineligible
Cris Carter, whose 168 career receptions are tops in Ohio State history, was declared ineligible for his senior season yesterday for accepting money and signing a contract with an agent. The Ohio State athletic director, Rick Bay, speaking at a news conference, said Carter admitted that on May 1, 1986, he had signed a representation agreement and a $5,000 promissory note with Lloyd Bloom and Norby Walters, agents of World Entertainment and Sports, Inc. In addition Carter received $150 a month for almost a year after signing the contract, which was postdated to Jan. 2, 1988. Bay said Carter looked upon the payments as a loan against future earnings but that it was still an infraction of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which carries a penalty of immediate ineligibility. In a statement, Carter said, ''I regret the actions I took that make it necessary for Ohio State to declare me ineligible. I did not realize at the time the consequences that would result or the pain I would cause.''

1106-> PLAYERS; Winfield Brings Thrill in Twilight Zone
The man was taking bites out of a Popsicle. At the end of his hard day's night, Dave Winfield was not nibbling at the edges. At a time when most of his business colleagues were enjoying their long-awaited three-day summer vacation, Winfield achieved a certain distinction. For 3 hours 39 minutes on Tuesday evening as 53 other All-Stars came and went, and while Winfield's Yankee teammates were dining or resting or visiting or reintroducing themselves to their families, he was at work. Winfield stood in right field and left field. He flailed at pitches no one could see. He had several adventures at home plate in the California twilight, including the kind of collision that has been known to ruin a career. He was the only All-Star to endure all 13 innings. And although this method of making a living cannot be compared to the work of the real world, Winfield was entitled to the act of wolfing down his Popsicle. ''When did this game stop being fun and start being a hassle?'' someone asked. ''About the 12th inning,'' Winfield said, and giggled. His seven seasons at Yankee Stadium have occasionally included complaints from the executive offices that Winfield has lacked a sense of leadership and commitment. The early part of this week - a time for most of his peers to escape from their work - provided further evidence that Winfield possesses a sense of both. On Monday, Winfield attended a meeting of players and baseball officials to discuss ways to create opportunities in management positions for members of minority groups. Winfield and Don Baylor of Boston, a former Yankee teammate, have provided ideas of ways to include this generation of players - potential candidates for future management positions - in the long-overdue discussions. Then on Tuesday, he just went about his work longer than anyone else. ''We didn't have many outfielders,'' Winfield said, so he kept playing in a 13-inning exhibition that came within two minutes of becoming the longest extra-inning All-Star Game. And in the bottom of the ninth inning of a bizarre scoreless game, Winfield nearly became remembered for a play that captured, within a few moments, the way he plays the game. He was taking the turn at third base, looking back to first, as the National League's attempt for a double play was going bad. Steve Bedrosian of the Phillies, the pitcher, was late covering first. Hubie Brooks of Montreal, the shortstop, made a relay that sailed to the left and toward the dirt. Bedrosian had to fly forward to backhand the throw, and as Winfield turned, he realized that the pitcher would have to make a diving, game-saving catch and then an alert throw to prevent him from scoring. Winfield wanted to go home. At that point, everybody wanted to go home. ''Try to make something happen,'' Winfield said. ''Try to avoid going. . . .'' He interrupted himself. ''How long did it go?'' Winfield wondered. ''Thirteen? Try to avoid going 13.'' He smiled at his joke, but the fact was also that he was running a risk in an attempt to win a game that has no bearing on the season. But one needs to look no further than the videotape image from 17 summers ago, when Pete Rose became a hero for smashing through to a game-winning run, and Ray Fosse of Cleveland was left in a heap in the dirt, his career as a catcher suddenly in a decline. The National Football League's Pro Bowl is not known for its violent collisions. The National Hockey League All-Star Game could be accompanied by waltz music. The National Basketball Association's All-Stars produce stunning displays of offensive grace, but seldom is there the sight of a defensive player stepping up to risk the consequences of creating a charging foul. Winfield, playing for a league whose All-Stars had recently been known for a less-than-intense attitude, decided to take a chance. Once his decision to gamble had been made as Bedrosian stood to throw, he was thinking the kind of thoughts that would seem more appropriate for a September pennant race than a July exhibition. ''If he got up and threw home, they could get me,'' he said. ''But I could still count on the impact, jarring the ball loose.'' Impact? Ozzie Virgil of Atlanta held the ball, both parties survived the collision, and Winfield was just another out at the plate, dusting himself off for some overtime in the outfield. For all his financial security, Winfield may have unwittingly discovered a way to pick up some extra cash. Perhaps sometime between now and his next All-Star Game, he can have his contract amended so that he would be paid by the hour.

1109-> PROTECTIN 'NEW' SISTINGE CEILING: A DEBATE FLARES
More than midway through their 12-year project, the restorers of the Sistine Chapel frescoes seem to have dampened a debate over the use of solvents to strip away old varnish and five centuries' accumulation of soot. But the controversy seems to have entered a new phase, this time over how best to protect what now is being revealed. Some critics contend that as the Michelangelo masterpiece is exposed again to the light, it also faces greater exposure to humidity and airborne pollutants that could damage the frescoes. This week, officials at the Vatican Museums began studying a preliminary plan for an air conditioning and filtration apparatus designed to control the climate inside the chapel. The degree to which the air around fresco paintings can cause them harm has become a matter of intense study in Italy in recent years. Conservators and scientists disagree, however, on the kinds of damage that may be done to the frescoes and on the best ways to protect them. The Vatican has minimized the threat posed by modern pollutants and has never performed tests to determine whether airborne pollutants are settling on the Sistine frescoes and damaging them in any way. But chemists have concluded that under certain circumstances pollutants can start a process they call ''fresco cancer'' that crystallizes plaster, eventually destroying whatever may be painted on it. Why the Dispute? The Priceless Works The Vatican's restoration project, begun in 1980, was sure to generate debates if only because it is altering the appearance of one of the world's best-known masterpieces, Michelangelo's epic depiction of history from the world's creation to its end. The restoration is being done one section at a time. This summer the workers will reach the ''Creation of Adam,'' which, with its outstretched hands, is perhaps the most famous pictorial image produced by Western culture. Disagreements began over the removal of the 16th-century animal glue varnish that had combined with candle soot and dust to form a dark patina over the plaster. Critics protested that the workers' solvents were wiping away some of Michelangelo's original work and that, since no new protective coating is being applied in place of the old varnish, the frescoes could be damaged by exposure to the air. Prof. James Beck, chairman of the art and archeology department at Columbia University and a leading opponent of the restoration, acknowledges that he has no evidence to prove that the frescoes are now being damaged by the absence of what he calls the ''protective layer'' provided by the old varnish. But he continues to demand that the work be halted until new technologies are discovered. According to some of the supporters of the Vatican's project, the controversy might never have developed if the restorers had sought more scientific proof to back up what they said they knew on the basis of instinct and experience. Speaking of the Sistine team, a senior Italian restorer who asked that his name not be used said, ''They have been a little ingenuous in not anticipating that they would be questioned about every step they took, and as a result they have not done some easy things which would have avoided problems.'' For example, Vatican officials said they decided the restoration was essential after discovering that the animal glue varnish was contracting with age and pulling off flecks of the original paint. But no scientific survey was conducted to determine the extent or rate of the damage; the restorers simply concluded that there was an overall danger because there was varnish all over the vault. ''It is no longer good enough for us to be able to say what we know,'' said Fabrizio Mancinelli, curator of Byzantine, medieval and modern art at the Vatican Museums. ''People are asking us what we can prove. But in restorations the issues cannot be reduced to abstractions, the answers to problems are not cut and dried.'' A Panel of Experts Vs. the Many Critics Since the Sistine project began, the Vatican has repeatedly been advised to form a scientific commission to review and comment on technical issues as they developed. Mr. Mancinelli, who directs the Sistine operations, said that the Vatican chose instead to have informal consultations with a variety of specialists. After several opponents of the project criticized the lack of independent oversight of the restoration work, the Vatican permitted the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of artworks in Italy, to invite a group of conservators, including top officials from several American museums, to examine the restoration firsthand earlier this spring. The conservators unanimously supported the Vatican's diagnosis of the frescoes' condition and the method being used to restore them. Despite the expressions of confidence from scholars and specialists, the Sistine restoration is plagued with unanswered and perhaps unanswerable questions in the area of potential damage by environmental pollutants. The effect of airborne pollutants on frescoes has been studied in recent years by several Italian chemists working on major restorations. One of them, Giorgio Torraca of ICCROM, an intergovernmental organization for the study of restoration techniques, described the question as ''a difficult and unpredictable problem that still needs a great deal of work.'' ''We are not in a position to make broad forecasts yet,'' he said. ''All we can do is monitor constantly and be very careful.'' Paolo L. Parrini, assistant chief of research at Montedison S.p.A., a chemicals company, said he had found that airborne pollutants in combination with the right amounts of humidity can permanently damage a fresco. After studying the effects of pollution on numerous frescoes, including da Vinci's ''Last Supper'' in Milan and the Giotto frescoes in Padua, Maurizio Marabelli, a chemist at Italy's Central Institute of Restoration, has concluded that ''many, many different factors affect the degree and speed of damage, but there is no doubt that allowing contact with airborne pollution is very dangerous for a fresco.'' No tests have ever been performed, however, to determine whether pollutants are floating into the Sistine Chapel or whether they are settling on the surface - or whether they are, in fact, causing any damage. Air Pollution: How Big a Threat? Some specialists, like Mr. Marabelli, say they think critics of the restoration might be correct in saying that the work is stripping the frescoes of a protective layer that has kept them from direct contact with modern pollutants. Others argue that the layer of varnish and soot was porous enough to let the pollutants get through anyway, and the Vatican says the contracting varnish is dangerous by itself. Mr. Mancinelli said there was no need for testing for airborne pollutants because the Sistine chapel is not directly exposed to Rome's polluted air. He said he even considered it safe to open the Sistine's windows regularly for ventilation because the chapel is not in the immediate vicinity of traffic. He said, however, that outdoor statuary within the Vatican walls had suffered damage from airborne pollution. A Vatican-commissioned study of the frescoes also indicated that there might be a third source of damage, in addition to air pollution and varnish removal: the crowds of people who have come in increasing numbers since the advent of mass tourism in the postwar era to see Michelangelo's frescoes. The Vatican commissioned a study of the Sistine Chapel in 1982 and 1983 by Dario Camuffo, a physicist at Italy's National Research Council. Mr. Camuffo measured the variations in temperature and humidity caused when tourists crowd into the chapel for a few hours a day. With an average of about 6,000, and a maximum of up to 18,000, visitors a day crowding through the chapel, Mr. Camuffo said the frescoes were constantly being weakened and that tiny cracks were spreading across the plaster. He said a major cause of these cracks was the changes in temperature and humidity caused by the crowds. So far, the Vatican has put into effect some, but not all, of Mr. Camuffo's recommendations. Low-heat lighting has been installed, and so has an electrostatic carpet that collects dust from tourists' shoes. He also recommended that tourists be prohibited from carrying wet umbrellas and raincoats into the chapel, but this point was rejected. Climate-Control System: Some Gaps in the Armor The Vatican has repeatedly stated that the real protection for the frescoes from all forms of environmental damage will be a climate-control system. This week the Vatican received a preliminary proposal for such a system from Carrier Delchi S.p.A., a subsidiary of the American air conditioning company that has been studying the problem. According to Walter Persegati, secretary-treasurer of the Vatican Museums, the system will control temperature and humidity and thoroughly filter the air going into the chapel. Mr. Persegati said, however, that he did not think the system would filter out gases. Government studies have shown that sulphur dioxide gas from automobile emissions is a major pollutant in Rome. Mr. Camuffo and other specialists argue that the Vatican faces a unique and extremely difficult task as it works on devising a climate control system. The shape and size of the chapel, the manner in which it was built and the fact that a vaulted ceiling must be protected all contribute to the problem. The drastic changes in temperature and humidity that occur when the chapel opens and closes to the public will present a far greater challenge than is faced when controlling a climate that does not change suddenly. Also, Mr. Marabelli says the most dangerous pollutant threatening the frescoes is airborne sulphurous particles that are smaller and more difficult to filter out than simple dust. The very idea of a climate control system is already viewed skeptically by Mr. Camuffo and others who say they believe that an active system carries inherent dangers. ''What happens on the day the system breaks down or the workers go on strike?'' he asked in an interview, worrying that if the system suddenly shuts off for any reason, the frescoes would be subjected to a devastating shock. Those who share this view say they believe the Vatican will eventually have to limit the influx of warm, humid human bodies that perhaps pose the greatest danger to the frescoes. Restricting public access to the chapel is something that the Vatican has been unwilling to consider so far, and if other alternatives, like the climate control system, do not succeed the guardians of Michelangelo's frescoes may have to face an extremely difficult decision. ''With so many people going through that room,'' Mr. Torraca said, ''the frescoes are beset by a very aggressive environment, and what the Vatican does do to control that environment will be as important as anything it has done so far.''

1111-> ON LANGUAGE; Going Gentle On My Mind
IT IS MORE THAN PASS-ing strange to me,'' Robert C. McFarlane told the Iran-contra investigating committee, ''that we cannot aspire to a policy which is more effective to deal with terrorism.'' Few of the solons caught the poetic allusion. In all probability, the speaker used it unconsciously. In the first act of Shakespeare's ''Othello,'' the Moor explains his initial attraction to Desdemona, when she asked him to tell her the story of his life. Othello recalls: ''My story being done,/ She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;/ She swore, in faith 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;/ 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.'' Shakespeare liked to use the word passing as an adverb modifying adjectives (passing fair, passing strong, passing gentle), meaning ''surpassingly, exceedingly.'' Today the term is familiar only as passing strange, even in the most wondrous pitiful testimony. The Bard is also the underlying source of many obvious allusions. Erica Abeel wrote in The New York Times Magazine about country homes: ''A final irony: in our passion for a getaway, we are killing the thing we love.'' That is, of course, a reference to ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol,'' by Oscar Wilde: ''Yet each man kills the thing he loves. . . .'' The trick in the allusion dodge is to get to the original, in this case Shakespeare's ''The Merchant of Venice,'' in which Bassanio asks Shylock: ''Do all men kill the things they do not love?'' That double take can also be applied to a Times Op-Ed piece by Matthew Gurewitsch of Connoisseur magazine, writing about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's much-admired statue of the Egyptian cat that is suspected of being a forgery: ''Within the Gallery of Illustrious Fakes that I envision, beauty will be truth, truth beauty.'' PAW (Poetic Allusion Watch) enthusiasts will catch that reference to John Keats's quotation of a Grecian urn, which revealed to him, ''Beauty is truth, truth beauty''; that was supposedly all we needed to know. Keats, however, was answering the question posed almost two centuries earlier in the first stanza of George Herbert's poem ''Jordan'': ''Who says that fictions only and false hair/ Become a verse? Is there in truth no beauty?'' John Keats did not think that unheard melody came under his need-to-know rule, but the PAW disagrees. Nor do I join the disapproving chorus (almost as famous as the Anvil Chorus) at the verbification of nouns with -ize. We should lie back and see if such coinages turn out to be useful, or are merely bureaucratic pomposities. Poetic allusions can make the difference: in ''Life & Death on 10 West,'' a gripping account by Eric Lax of medical heroism at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center, the author recalls a fistfight that broke out between two surgeons during an operation, with ''the patient etherized upon the table between them.'' This is an allusion to the beginning of T. S. Eliot's ''The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'': ''Let us go then, you and I,/ When the evening is spread out against the sky/ Like a patient etherized upon a table. . . .'' This department is not infallible and sometimes misses even primary allusions. In a piece searching for the female equivalent of womanizer, written with eerie prescience on the eve of Gary Hart's downfall, I reported that most readers cited man-eater, a term in use for the last decade, meaning ''a woman who treats sexual relations frivolously.'' Geoffrey Stokes, the Press Clips columnist of The Village Voice, calls my attention to ''Ariel,'' a poem by Sylvia Plath published posthumously in 1965 (its title is from the sprite in Shakespeare's ''The Tempest''), in which the poet concludes: ''Out of the ash/ I rise with my red hair/ And I eat men like air.'' This popularized man-eater in its present promiscuous sense; the origin may have been in Aldous Huxley's 1928 ''Point Counter Point'': ''Marjorie isn't the only bore. Nor Lucy the only man-eater.'' The aftermath of the Hart story brought forth this lead from T. R. Reid in The Washington Post: ''Former Presidential candidate Gary Hart is making it clear to his friends and supporters that he will not go gentle into that political night.'' The allusion is to Dylan Thomas's 1952 poem ''Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.'' In a recent PAW, I made a passing remark (passing the ordinary participle used as adjective, not passing the strange adverb) that the Welsh poet had a reason for using gentle rather than gently, but that it eluded me. That was a fishhook observation, designed to elicit instruction from the Lexicographic Irregulars, and it worked: ''If Thomas had said gently,'' writes Marianne Fridell of Custer, S.D., ''he would have been modifying go and telling how one goes. Instead he says gentle, which refers back to the understood 'you.' '' ''Gentle is an adjective referring to the understood subject,'' explains Marilyn V. van der Velde of Ann Arbor, Mich. ''Were one to substitute naked or speechless for gentle, it would be more obvious.'' In grammatical terms, though, is gentle necessarily an adjective? Although it is almost always used as an adjective, it has also been used as an adverb since the early 1600's. ''If you have a grammatical problem with the use of what appears to be an adjective after a non-copulative verb,'' writes Allan J. Curran of Boston, ''I sympathize: so many of our memorable English teachers damned the analogous 'Go slow.' Jacques Barzun, with good sense, encourages the use of the 'short form of the adverb' after verbs of motion.'' Let's go quick to Professor Barzun, who covered this subject in 1986 in ''A Word or Two Before You Go. . . .'' He says predicate adjectives follow copulative, or linking, verbs, such as be or become (''Be gentle''; ''Become famous''). Beyond that, however, Professor Barzun tells me: ''Verbs of motion and sensation take adverbs that do not have the -ly ending -'Go slow,' 'Think fast,' and so forth. Even though they lack the -ly, these words are not predicate adjectives but adverbs. And there are many examples of such adverbs. You would tell someone, 'Sleep sound,' not 'Sleep soundly'; 'sound' is correct as the adverb's short form.'' I disagree with the professor, and agree with most of the readers who wrote in: the poet was using the adjective gentle to describe the condition he hoped his dying father would not be in, rather than to describe the method of his going, or dying. He chose to modify the person, which called for an adjective, and not to modify the action, which would usually have called for the adverb ending in -ly. That triggers another question: do poets and other writers, as they do their thing, knock themselves out worrying about predicate adjectives versus adverbs? In most cases, no. Interpreters use these grammatical explanations to show what the writer had in mind. If I go to a wine tasting and write, ''They taste good,'' the reader can tell I'm talking about the wines; if I write, ''They taste well,'' in the sense of the adverb goodly, I am talking about the expert way the tasters are slurping up the booze. Understanding grammar helps us figure out where the emphasis lies. The writer, who knows what he is thinking and what he is modifying, need not go through these interpretive gyrations. Consider John Hartford, writing the 1967 song ''Gentle on My Mind,'' who knows that ''your door is always open,'' which is what ''keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory/ That keeps you ever gentle on my mind.'' In this case, as in Dylan Thomas's poem, what is being modified or described is not the action - not the keeping - but the person. Thomas did not want his father to be gentle; similarly, if contrariwise, Hartford liked his woman gentle. Nobody had to tell them to use an adjective instead of an adverb. They knew what they were describing.

1112-> Deborah Gerard Wed To John Robert Frank
Deborah Margaret Gerard, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Egon Gerard of New York and Sherman, Conn., was married Sunday at the Stonehenge Inn in Ridgefield, Conn., to John Robert Frank, the son of Doris Frank and Eugene Frank, both of New York. Rabbi David Seligson officiated. The bride graduated from the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School and cum laude from Tufts University, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in physical therapy at New York University. She is a physical therapist at the Sports Training Institute in New York. The bride's father retired as chief real-estate counsel at W. R. Grace & Company in New York. Her mother, Karen N. Gerard, a vice president of Moran, Stahl & Boyer Inc., management consultants in New York, was Mayor Koch's Deputy Mayor for Economic Policy and Development in 1981 and 1982. The bridegroom, a graduate of the Riverdale Country Day School and the University of Vermont, is the vice president of the Sidney Frank Importing Company, wine importers in New York. His father is the company's president.

1114-> Saratoga Names City Opera To a Visiting Residency
The New York City Opera has been named a resident company at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, the center and the company have announced. The City Opera will join the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra in regular annual appearances at the upstate New York arts facility, a joint statement said yesterday. To support the City Opera's Saratoga residency, $2.5 million has been donated by the H. Schaffer Foundation and its trustees, Herman Stall, Lawrence A. Wien and Richard R. Bieber. The Saratoga center will attempt to match that figure, providing a $5 million endowment, the income from which will support the City Opera's appearances. The City Opera first performed at Saratoga in 1986, offering Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide.'' This year, the company appeared for another week, with Puccini's ''Tosca'' and ''Boheme.'' Next year, the company will again appear for a single week, but will perform three operas. The hope for the future is engagements for two or more weeks. This latest agreement points to another expansion of City Opera performances under the aegis of Beverly Sills, the general director. The company is scheduled to perform for 32 weeks in the 1987-88 season, assuming a weeklong engagement in Boston next May falls into place. That compares with 36 weeks of scheduled Metropolitan Opera performances during the same period and an additional three weeks of recording, which are counted contractually as performance weeks.

1115-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER; REUNION TACTICS FOR THE FAMILY
If you drew the short straw and are in charge of the family-reunion arrangements, I sure hope it's for the 1988 season. Your leverage for this year is pretty much used up. And depending upon the site you've chosen, you may be barely in time for '88. Of course, you can hand the whole proposition over to your wonderful travel agent, if you have one. But as a veteran of the logistical battles, I recommend that you act as your own agent. Your hours and phone work are likely to pay off in a discount on prices - we've saved 10 percent or better - and if anything goes haywire, you will know the people in the hotel management to get hold of. You may even have their home phone numbers. If you're budget-bound, you may also be able to track down a school or scout camp or some other noncommercial enterprise that will rent you rooms for a modest fee. Begin thinking of yourself as a convention, looking for the best deal you can get for your people. Some hotels provide discounts for a booking of as few as 5 rooms; at a popular resort the minimum may be 20 rooms. Make a rough estimate of attendance now; later you will have to guarantee the exact number. If someone reports in ill or divorced after that, you may have to enact a head tax to cover the loss, but at least you won't have to house anyone in an auto. In preparing to interview hotels or resorts, first put together a list of your group's needs. Teen-agers should have space to stretch long muscles and lungs, and a hotel that advertises its antique furniture or that sets a premium on romantic quiet, candlelight and wine is probably a mistake. You could end up with the young people letting off steam by running up and down the corridors if it rains, and this can ripen into a problem. A year-round swimming pool is probably the best safety valve available. More hotels than you would believe have electronic game rooms, but this is a mixed blessing in the opinion of one organizer. If anyone in your family has limited mobility, add ramps and good access to your list. Also ask about rooms with bathrooms equipped with rails. Splendid food may matter a lot, but with some groups rapid service, or even buffets, can reduce the frustration created by slow older eaters and youthful metabolisms that require instant attention. Ask how weekend meals are served if the reunion will fall on a weekend. Buffets and brunches may be standard on Sunday, or on both days. Get a list of accommodations in the area; the local chamber of commerce or county tourist organization can usually provide one. If it's a popular place, there may even be a tourism magazine devoted to it. If it's a national park, write there, and soon. Even if you're a complete novice at bargaining, be aware that you are not begging for a room, you're offering something the proprietor wants a lot: a guarantee of future business, something better in some ways than money in the till because it enables the hotel to plan personnel on the basis of concrete numbers rather than estimates. Places where anyone in your family has attended a convention or arranged a dinner ought to be responsive if you mention previous dealings. Is there a restaurant where a family wedding reception was once held? This can cause wheels to turn. This next tip seems obvious, but some people miss it. A city that, like Washington, functions on a business week offers splendid bargains on the weekend. Recently a suites-only hotel in the capital with a free breakfast buffet and a refrigerator in each suite charged $79 a night for putting up four people on a weekend, whereas the week-night price was $134. The pool was filled with families. A city that survives on tourism, on the other hand, would rather have you mid-week, although it may offer three-day weekend packages in winter. At some summer resorts that cannot start serving meals until student employees arrive to do the serving, cabins and other quarters are priced at an out-of-season rate, with no meals, in June and September. At a resort in Door County, Wis., a group discount may not be offered for a booking of less than 20 rooms, but the regular June rate may be $80 a day without meals as against $120 modified American plan in July. At Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., a favorite with families, a group with 20 adults will get a discount midweek. To improve your leverage in getting a hotel, make sure you have several alternatives. My moment of clarity came over me when we were arranging to get everyone to Newport, R.I., the year the East Coast branch of my husband's family was in charge. Calling our usual hotel, I found it was booked solid for our date, and that was 14 months off. I was ready to cash in my chips as a tourist broker, but I pressed on. I called an older hotel that had just been bought and renovated. Before I could say any more than ''10 rooms,'' I was transferred to the banquet and sales department and was dealing with a manager who really wanted our business. I summoned my courage and asked if we couldn't get a better rate for an early deposit, and she began to outline group rates before I had time to regret my audacity. Your group will probably want a room to gather in, other than a dining room. At the Paradise Inn at Mount Rainier, where we convened one year, we just took over a big table-and-chair cluster in the cavernous main room of the lodge, since the bedrooms were basic, to say the least. But in Newport, where the lobby of our hotel was small, we added a suite to our list of wants. We could have had a hospitality room for a cocktail hour, but we wanted a place to flop down after swimming and hiking. After three phone conversations, we received a big packet of information on the hotel, including banquet menus and floor plans, plus brochures on activities in the area. We drove out to Newport one day to look at rooms and to choose a private dining room for dinner Saturday night. We got a nice small dining room, but best of all we got three experienced waiters, and the highchairs were already in place when the family arrived for dinner. We asked about renting a room refrigerator for storing milk and juice for the kids. The hotel did not have them, but in the Yellow Pages we found a rental place that did, so we called to reserve one. This problem was slight, however, compared with replacing a forgotten baby bottle on Mount Rainier; the stores outside the park boundary still tended to specialize in things old prospectors must have liked, beef jerky and such. Those who camp out a lot probably have a list of don't-forgets that might have prevented this loss of time. Wherever we meet, the Florida contingent keeps a giant cooler filled with soda on hand. We take our electric coffee maker and a batch of thrift-shop mugs. In Newport, we set these up on top of the rented refrigerator and were ready for hours of talk and snapshot swapping. We got a discount for the harbor boat tour by arriving in time for the first trip of the morning and asking for one. We did not hesitate, either, to take lower prices for the children and the seniors wherever we went. On Mount Rainier, a Golden Age Passport got one car into the park at a reduced fee; I suppose the message is to distribute your older people widely through a caravan. Once I saw a huge family group -there must have been 50 people - all dressed in T-shirts that said something like ''1984 Reunion of the Merry Family'' on the front. The back bore a family tree, with the names of the forebears on the trunk and the children's names out at the leaves. Envy gnawed at me for days. If you want custom-printed T-shirts for your reunion, those negotiations should start now, too. You can ship the shirts ahead to the hotel. This year we are returning to the family's roots in the Middle West, although few relatives live in the old hometown. We of the middle generation decided that too many of our younger members had never seen the places that mattered in our family history, including the famous Little Brown Church where the grandparents were married in the 1920's. So the organizers, in addition to pre-empting the local motor court for the long weekend, have rented a school bus for a tour of these sites. The bus company was delighted to have the business on the weekend. The historian in the family will be the barker.

1117-> 'WOMEN'S ISSUES' MOVE TO FORE IN UNIONS
MATERNITY leave, child-care agreements and pay-equity adjustments, once considered ''women's issues,'' are now getting priority from unions at the bargaining table. In their attempts to expand their membership rosters, unions need to organize women to make up for the loss of members caused by declines in blue-collar jobs, according to Patrick Vaccaro, the managing partner in the White Plains office of Jackson Lewis Schnitzler & Krupman, a labor-relations law firm that represents management. Union membership has been declining steadily over the last decade, Mr. Vaccaro said, adding: ''Unions now represent only 18 percent of the work force, the lowest percentage since the inception of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, a decline from 23.7 million in 1975 to 19.8 million in 1984. ''Labor,'' he said, commenting on unions' appraisal of the situation at the present time, ''has to redouble its efforts to organize new workers, so unions are beginning to play on the issues that are of interest to women.'' Even those unions noted for their male dominance and direction, such as the United Steel Workers, the United Mine Workers and the United Automobile Workers, have negotiated child-care programs and sought parental-leave concessions in agreements in recent bargaining. Mr. Vaccaro said, adding: ''Right now, there are roughly 20 million members of the Baby Boom generation who work in service jobs that aren't traditionally blue collar or white collar. They've been dubbed 'new collar,' by Ralph Whitehead, a professor at the University of Massachusetts. ''They make up a tremendous reservoir of potential union members who are younger, female and more interested in the new issues of the day. To reach them, labor has to go beyond the bread-and-butter benefits and examine such things as flexible work arrangements, child-care, maternity and paternal leave if it's going to interest women in unions.'' A report on maternity benefits, made last year by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, found that maternity-leave provisions were provided in only about 36 percent of United States collective-bargaining agreements. The report concluded that union efforts to strengthen maternity benefits were quite minimal. Unions in the garment industry, where the numbers of female workers has traditionally been high, have made maternity leave a priority, said Michael A. Trinchi, district manager of the Lower Hudson District Council of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, based in Hawthorne. ''As a union dominated by women, we are very responsive to social changes,'' he said. This remains the case, he said, ''even though in recent years we have been going to the bargaining table with our tail between our legs. Imports have been our ruination. This is a labor-intensive industry and we can't compete with wages overseas.'' Nationwide, only one million textile garment workers now have jobs in the industry compared with 2.5 million 10 years ago, Mr. Trinchi said, adding: ''In Westchester, 40 garment factories have closed in the last 10 years. Only 1,800 garment workers are still employed in the county.'' Seven years ago, Mr. Trinchi said, the union negotiated for full coverage for maternity leave. Before then, women in the union received only a lump sum of $150. ''Child-care and pay equity are priority issues with our members,'' he said. ''Many new garment workers are young and more politically aware and active than older members. They belong to groups such as the National Organization for Women, and they are pressing for pay equity and flexible work arrangements.'' Mr. Trinchi said that during the current economic downturn in the industry, when companies were folding, saving jobs was the major theme. ''The survival of companies like Tarrytown Garment Inc. - a bathing-suit contractor in Tarrytown that has traditionally supplied employment to new immigrants - is important to the economy.'' He added: ''In Westchester we've seen Italian women, Portuguese women, Hispanic women, and most recently Chinese women working in the garment industry and becoming acclimated to this country. These women are highly skilled but because of language barriers and lack of transportation it's hard for them to find other jobs when factories close.'' The remaining garment factories in Westchester, are producing bathing suits and lingerie, Mr. Trinchi said, ''because unlike men's suits or women's dresses, there is less labor involved in making those garments. We're still turning out quality bathing suits and lingerie items in the United States, thankfully.'' Pay equity is not an issue for women in the construction industry, according to Lee Douglas, president of Thunderbird Constructors of Yonkers. Miss Douglas, a founding member of Professional Women in Construction, a Westchester-based trade group, noted that the Ironworkers Locals 40 and 361, based in Manhattan, made no discrimination in the pay rates. ''Full journeymen get $18 an hour and full benefits,'' she said. ''However, women journeymen are still rare. There are only two members in Local 40, out of a membership of over 1,000.'' Miss Douglas, a Mohawk, spent half her childhood on the Kahnawake Reservation near Montreal, and the other half in New York City, where her father was an ironworker. She returns to the reservation periodically to recruit other North American Indian women for construction work. ''I feel it's a good field for women, and I was able to get 20 applicants on my last trip back in March,'' she said. ''Women, thanks to the equal opportunity law, are being accepted in contruction unions. When I first came into the industry, there were no women in them at all. Now the union wants women ironworkers and has set up training programs for them.'' The work is hard but the pay and the benefits are very good, she added. Miss Douglas, who began her company in 1981 to work with structural steel in bridge erection and rehabilitation and subway rehabilitation, said: ''We have plenty of work. Especially in bridge rehabilitation. We have a contract for the Manhattan Bridge and judging from the number of bridges slated for rehabilitation, we should be busy for a long time.'' Women entering the construction industry often start as traffic monitors on road crews flagging cars, Miss Douglas said. ''Unions in the construction industry may be male-dominated,'' she said, ''but women get the same pay, which is a big attraction and not always the case in other industries.''

1118-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Top Executive At Delta Air Lines
Ronald W. Allen, president and chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., has been named chairman and chief executive. He replaces David C. Garrett Jr., who recently reached age 65, Delta's mandatory retirement age for senior executives. Separately, Delta reported earnings of $58.8 million, or $1.21 a share, for its fourth quarter ended June 30, more than double the $22.2 million, or 55 cents, posted in the period a year earlier. The increase reflects its merger with Western Air Lines Inc. and strong growth in domestic and international traffic, the company said. Revenue increased 42 percent, to $1.57 billion, from $1.1 billion in 1986. Mr. Allen will assume the top position at the nation's fourth-largest carrier on Aug. 1 in the midst of its most serious image problem. Delta, which has long enjoyed a reputation for good service, suffered a number of mishaps in recent months, including six incidents involving errors by Delta pilots. The most serious was a near-collision on July 8, in which a Delta jet came within 100 feet of smashing into another plane over the Atlantic Ocean. In his new position, Mr. Allen will also be responsible for overseeing the combination of Delta and Western. Mr. Allen, a 45-year-old native of Atlanta, came to Delta in 1963 as a part-time methods analyst and was promoted to staff analyst the following year. He served as director of methods and training from 1966 to 1967, when he was named assistant vice president of administration. He became vice president of administration two years later and senior vice president of personnel in 1970. He was elected to the board in 1975 and was named senior vice president of administration and personnel in 1979. He became president and chief operating officer in 1983. Mr. Allen graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1964, with a degree in industrial engineering. He will be succeeded as president and chief operating officer by Hollis L. Harris, who has served as senior vice president of operations and passenger service since 1973. In that position, Mr. Harris has been responsible for Delta's flight control, flight operations and dining service. Mr. Allen's secretary said he was in meetings yesterday and unavailable for an interview. Mr. Garrett served as chairman and chief executive since 1983, after serving as president of the airline since 1970. He has been with Delta since 1946.

1119-> POP: FATS COMET IN A NIGHT OF RAP
RAP MUSIC'S emphatic, stripped-down speech rhythms are bringing an economy and urgency of gesture and line to the spacious sonic architecture of dub-style reggae. Recording-studio maestros are forging a new vocabulary of quick-cut juxtapositions from the turntable-scratching of hip-hop disk jockeys and the mix-and-match strategies of William Burroughs's cut-up prose experiments. A new wave of funk classicists is filtering James Brown's dance-groove legacy through the man-machine interface of digital technology. These trends have been bubbling under pop music's hyperactive surface; Thursday night at the Cat Club, an impressive gathering of British and American musicians, producers, singers and rappers brought the mixture to a boil. The evening was a showcase for an ongoing collaboration involving Adrian Sherwood, a British reggae and dance-music producer, and three musicians who formed the nucleus of the house band at New Jersey's Sugarhill label during its rap-record glory days - Keith LeBlanc, drums; Doug Wimbish, bass, and Skip McDonald, guitar. Collectively, this foursome records as Fats Comet. They also produce, arrange and perform on records by several singers and rappers, including Mark Stewart and Gary Clail, who were on hand Thursday. Mr. Sherwood treated and embroidered the combined vocal and instrumental sounds from the mixing booth, and the result was definitive postmodern dance music, a turbulent gumbo. Distinctions between foreground and background, lead and accompaniment, melody and rhythm were being shattered and redefined moment by moment. Mr. Wimbish worked the front of the stage, playing lead bass in a style that's both organic to the instrument and highly original. Mr. LeBlanc has integrated digital drum-machine and synthesizer technology and the traditional drum kit into a single, versatile instrument. Mr. McDonald's guitar and keyboard work combines rhythm, lead and harmonic ambiance in a coolly incisive blend. Mr. Sherwood adroitly orchestrated the instrumental trio's rave-ups, Mark Stewart's drily incantatory singing and Mr. Clail's exuberant chants and wails. The evening ended gloriously, with the rappers Melle Mel, Scorpio and Duke Bootee joining the Fats Comet musicians to recast their rap hit ''The Message'' as a celebratory tribal stomp.

1120-> WINFIELD INJURY CLOUDS VICTORY
Dave Winfield stepped into the batting cage last night, took a half-swing at the first pitch and felt a sudden twinge. Moments later, he was lying face down in the trainer's room as heat packs were applied to the left side of his neck. The last thing the Yankees needed was another injury. But there is one more to fret over now. Winfield was scratched from the starting lineup with a pinched nerve in his neck, but the evening was not a total loss. Two of the team's other heavy hitters - Gary Ward and Ron Kittle - crushed home runs to give the Yankees a 4-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers before 30,231 at the Stadium. Ward hit a two-run shot in the first inning that landed in the Yankee monument area some 430 feet away in left-center field. Kittle's was a line drive to left in the fifth, his third homer in four games and his fourth in the span of 20 times at bat. ''The home runs will come,'' said Kittle, who has hit seven this season despite a part-time role. ''I'm strong. I can hit the ball out of any park. But it's more fun to do it when you're winning.'' The offense complemented the Yankees' third successive strong pitching performance, this one by Rick Rhoden, who won his team-leading seventh game. Rhoden went seven innings before needing help from Dave Righetti, who pitched the eighth and ninth and picked up his 13th save. Rhoden's effort followed exceptional performances by Tommy John and Dennis Rasmussen, who each worked into the eighth in the team's previous two games. Rhoden, who walked three and struck out five, allowed a run in the sixth on Mike Felder's leadoff triple and Robin Yount's single to center, but he held the Brewers in check despite loading the bases on two singles and a four-pitch walk to Rick Manning later in the inning. With the bullpen moving into action behind him, the right-hander got Jim Gantner on a bouncer back to the mound to end the threat. ''I've felt good in my last five starts,'' Rhoden said, ''but it seems like I'm still having that one bad inning where my control goes out the window. I feel like I need better control, and maybe it's just a lack of concentration.'' Even with the victory, the Yankees' second in a row over Milwaukee, there was concern over the condition of Winfield, who was scheduled to play right field. The team already has two starters - Rickey Henderson and Don Mattingly - on the disabled list, and another regular, Claudell Washington, is out with a hamstring pull. ''All day it bothered me,'' Winfield said after the game, ''but you don't know how it will affect your baseball until you get to the park. I got in there, took my stance and couldn't see the ball because I couldn't move my head. It's better, but let me see how it feels tomorrow.'' Winfield's injury could have been a severe loss. With the Brewers starting Juan Nieves, a left-hander, he was surely going to be missed. Consider that Winfield was hitting .414 against left-handers this season with nine home runs and 19 runs batted in. His replacement, Dan Pasqua, was hitless in 21 times at bat against lefties with 10 strikeouts at the start of the game. He was 0 for 2 with a strikeout against Nieves. The injury-riddled Yankees, in fact, started three left-handed hitters -Pasqua, Mike Easler and Mike Pagliarulo - against Nieves. ''Maybe that's the secret,'' Manager Lou Piniella joked. ''Use left-handed hitting against left-handed pitching. But the real secret is getting good pitching.'' Ward's homer, his eighth of the season, followed Willie Randolph's single to open the game, giving Rhoden an early lead. The Yankees added a run off Nieves in the third when Mike Easler drove home Henry Cotto from third with a sacrifice fly, and Kittle's home run made it 4-0. ---- A foul ball hit by Cotto in the third inning could be costly to the Yankees. It struck the team's computer on the press level, shattering the screen like a broken mirror. Kevin Elfering, who feeds information into the computer, suffered a small cut on his hand in the mishap. . . . Washington, recovering from a pulled left hamstring, could be available as a pinch-hitter and possibly a designated hitter as early as Tuesday, Piniella said. Washington said he does not expect to return to the lineup full-time until the Yankees begin their next road trip Friday in Boston.

1121-> Delta Revises Discount Plan
Delta Air Lines announced a new system of round-trip discount fares today, designed to reduce the severe cancellation penalties of some current fares. The new fare structure, effective Dec. 13, creates three categories of discount round-trip excursion fares, with 30-day, 14-day and 7-day advance purchase requirements. Delta said the new structure was not a fare increase. Under the new plan, tickets bought 30 days in advance will be discounted by as much as 73 percent from Delta's full coach fares and carry a cancellation penalty of 25 percent. Tickets bought 14 days in advance, which are generally $40 higher than 30-day tickets, will carry a penalty of 35 percent. And tickets bought seven days in advance, which are generally $80 higher than 30-day fares, will carry a penalty of 50 percent. The new plan also includes peak and off-peak fares, a provision to allow passengers to change flight reservations for a fee, and somewhat different requirements for trips involving flights between Florida and other East Coast states.

1122-> Dow Is Up 4.30 in 4th Straight Gain
The stock market edged higher yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average - which backed and filled all day - gained 4.30 points, to close at 2,613.04. It was the Dow's fourth straight rise, and the key blue-chip indicator has now gained back about 40 percent of the 177.3 points it lost in the sharp correction that began when it reached a record 2,722,42 on Aug. 25. But with both the dollar and bond prices little changed, and a ''triple witching hour'' in stock options, index options and index futures due at the end of this week, investors remained cautious. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 154.4 million shares, and there was no real buying bias: 833 stocks were up and 752 were down. The Big Board's composite index was up 0.52, to 180.54, and the S.&P. 500-stock index gained 1.10, to 323.08. Some Hope on Trade Some traders said they were encouraged that the currency, bond and stock markets had seemed to take the latest trade deficit record in stride. While the figures look dismal, they argue, the nation's position in relation to its major trading partners is beginning to improve, and this should help to bolster the dollar and encourage foreign buying of American Treasury bonds. In their most recent market strategy report, analysts at E. F. Hutton & Company said, ''We believe that better trade statistics can stabilize the dollar and, alongside still low inflation, result in a healthy move lower for long rates in the quarters ahead.'' A low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment would presumably be good for stocks, which compete with fixed-income securities, such as bonds, for investors' funds. One note that traders found disquieting yesterday, however, was that oil prices edged higher. Despite the rise in the price of crude, oil stocks sagged yesterday: Mobil fell 3/8, to 48 1/8; Exxon 1 3/4, to 94, and Chevron 3/8, to 53 7/8. Traders said the drop might be an indication that investors do not believe that oil prices will continue to rise. Telex had a rough day, plunging 13 1/2, to 51 7/8. The company said its earnings for the quarter and for the fiscal year ending next spring would be less than expected. Telex's collapse - at one point this year the stock had topped 101 - led one trader, who asked not to be named, to warn that investors would be very hard on companies whose earnings are considered disappointing. Telex, which carried a price/ earnings ratio of 18 when investors expected good earnings, has been sold off so sharply that its P/E ratio is now only 10. ''The minute the profits stop, this market is going to get killed,'' the trader said. Takeover rumors pushed Merrill Lynch up 1, to 38 3/4. But some traders said they thought a takeover of the huge broker unlikely. Two other rumored takeover stocks also gained: Zayre was up 2 5/8, to 31 5/8, and Burlington Northern, added 1 3/4, to 75. In over-the-counter trading, IGI Inc. slumped another 7 1/2, to 11 1/2. On Friday, IGI traded wildly between 13 and 32, and closed at 18. Investors are apparently having a hard time deciding if the Vineland, N.J., company's proposed drug development deals with heavyweight companies such as Pfizer and Rorer are solid. The Nasdaq index of O-T-C trading closed at 445.49, off 0.68.

1123-> Perspectives: Nonprofit Institutions; Handling a Project Without a Developer
WHEN a nonprofit institution in Manhattan sets out to make use of the full development rights inherent in its land, it normally allies itself at an early stage with a developer. Thus Carnegie Hall chose the Rockrose Development Corporation as developer well before the proposed mixed-use building next to the hall began its landmark and land-use review; the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center is working with the Brodsky Organization on plans for development on Amsterdam Avenue from 59th to 60th Street, and the Metropolitan Club has been dealing with Park Tower Realty in its effort to win approval for a tower atop its library wing and annex on East 60th Street. But in isolated cases a nonprofit institution undertakes the perilous and unpredictable process of taking a plan through the city land-use review on its own. It may move its plan all the way to the Board of Estimate, handling the environmental review, preliminary architectual planning, legal work and public presentations. This can be done when the institution owns the land, has the professional capability available on its board of directors and staff, and has a plan that is assuredly ''buildable'' without further revision. When these conditions exist, nonprofits may be undertaking the development role more frequently. ''We recommend it to all nonprofits when landmark issues or zoning issues are involved,'' said Henry Hart Rice, the chairman of James Felt Realty Services, a consulting concern. The Young Men's Christian Association of Greater New York has provided the latest example of a nonprofit institution taking this role. The Y hopes to develop a mixed-use tower on land formerly occupied by the McBurney School on West 63d Street behind the West Side Y on Central Park West. In April, the association showed residents of the area a rendering of a 41-story building designed by the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, to be architecturally compatible with the 14-story Y building, a Tuscan Italianate structure designed by Dwight Baum in 1929. ''We're trying to develop it to a high level of detail before bringing a developer in through a request-for-proposals process,'' said Paul L. Kendall, the vice president of property management for the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York. ''We feel we are better able to protect some of the broader community interests by establishing a design standard that can be honored in fact. No matter how we structure it legally, it will always be viewed as 'the Y project.' '' He also noted that the value of development rights is enhanced when the nonprofit institution assumes the costs and risks of the development process. At Lincoln Center, excavation is imminent for a far larger project, also brought to the construction point by a nonprofit institution without a developer. It is Lincoln Center North, a 45-story apartment building and a 17-story dormitory for students of the Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet, all atop a 350,000-square-foot, 12-story base and a five-level, 375-car garage. In the base building will go rehearsal space, offices, archive space, a 300-seat movie theater, a firehouse and the relocated Riverside branch of the public library. The site is between 65th and 66th Streets, west of the existing Juilliard building. The Lincoln Center of the Performing Arts, with Davis Brody & Associates as its architect, chaperoned this project through land-use review last year, and then put out a request for proposals to development organizations. Nathan Leventhal, a former Deputy Mayor, is president of Lincoln Center, and Frederick P. Rose, the chairman of Rose Associates, is on its board of directors. THE winning proposal came from the Stillman Group of White Plains, an investment building company whose principals are Allan Stillman and his son, Abbott, in association with the George Hyman Company, which will do the base building as general contractor. The apartment tower, with about 350 units and 400,000 square feet of net salable space, will rise to a height of 600 feet, starting from the top of the 150-foot-high base building. Lincoln Center contracted with the city in 1966 for the land on which it would eventually expand. Detailed planning began three years ago after Louis Brandeis High School, which occupied the site, was declared surplus. Developers bid not only for the right to build the condominium but also for the construction of the Lincoln Center space, so that the gap between these figures was critical. Though no figures have been made public, it is expected that Lincoln Center will offset close to half the cost of its own space in the new structure. Roughly $100 per salable square foot, or about $40 million, is understood to have been paid for the right to develop the condominium. At the Y.M.C.A. building, the intent is to utilize the benefits of a zoning ordinance that the City Planning Commission is proposing to permit a 20 percent floor-area bonus in high-density Manhattan residential districts if low-income housing units are provided. The Y would preserve 25 such units and create 40 new ones as part of the proposed project. Even though the existing building does not have landmark status, staff personnel of the Landmarks Preservation Commission have been consulted on the design. The land straddles the boundary of the Lincoln Square special district, and waivers are required from certain rear-yard requirements to achieve design goals and community-space requirements. The Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York fol-lowed the opposite approach in another project, currently in construction. After doing preliminary architectural work on expanded space for the 47th Street branch of the Y between Second and Third Avenues, it sold to the Hakimian Organization rights to build 200,000 square feet of space just east of the branch, and Hakimian and its architect, Liebman Liebman Associates, obtained a permit to build under the city's Housing Quality ordinance. A 174-unit condominium with 30,000 square feet of space for the Y is in construction. The Y got a new 45-by-90-foot swimming pool, a day-care center, athletic facilities and community space. Several lawyers noted that one advantage of developer participation is that the plan ultimately approved will be buildable without further revisions. If a plan is developed to too high a degree of specificity without builder participation , time-consuming revisions may be required. Moreover, the nonprofit institution may not have the capital to finance the architectural and legal services needed in the predevelopment process; and it may not have the capacity for rapid decision-making needed. For these reasons, the conventional pattern is likely to continue in most instances. ''We felt we wanted a genuine partnership with the developer,'' said Lawrence P. Goldman, the director of real-estate planning and development at Carnegie Hall, ''because the design is complex and the project required the skills that a developer brings to the table.'' The office building planned just east of Carnegie Hall, designed by Cesar Pelli, is undergoing land-use review. The design has already been approved by the landmarks panel.

1124-> The Pop Life
Bossa Nova Redux Few musicians have been more involved in the cross-fertilization of North and South American music than Antonio Carlos Jobim, the 60-year-old Brazilian composer who was a principal architect of bossa nova. In 1962, the classically trained composer had his first American hit with ''Desafinado,'' the jazz-samba standard recorded by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd. Two years later, Mr. Getz and Astrud Gilberto had an even bigger hit with ''The Girl From Ipanema,'' which established Mr. Jobim as one of the world's most successful pop composers. ''In America, bossa nova was much more welcome than in Brazil, where purists attacked it as an Americanized simplification of samba music,'' he recalled in an interview last week. ''As a result, bossa nova is probably going to be remembered historically as a branch of jazz rather than as an offshoot of samba. What was so surprising to me 25 years ago was that a song like 'Desafinado,' which was an in-joke, and not designed to be on the hit parade, became an international hit.'' At Avery Fisher Hall on Nov. 23, Mr. Jobim and Mr. Getz will participate in a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the concert that officially introduced bossa nova to the United States. And in October, Polygram Records will release ''Passarim,'' Mr. Jobim's first American album since 1980. On the album, which features seven new Jobim songs, some in English and others in Portuguese, the composer sings and plays piano with a quintet that includes his son, Paulo, on guitar. ''In the past 25 years, the relationship between North American and South American music has reversed,'' Mr. Jobim continued. ''Today, bossa nova is much more popular in the United States than in Brazil. If you go to Brazil looking for Brazilian music, you will find very little of it. Most of what you hear is rock-and-roll. One reason is that in Brazil, the mass media are very controlled. Television dictates fashions. Soap operas have become so popular that when you come home from work and turn on the TV, you are going to see soap opera whether you look for it or not. The same is true of rock-and-roll. The media have imposed it on the public. ''For many years, Brazilians saw the United States as an imperialist, racist country isolated from the rest of the world,'' Mr. Jobim went on. ''But that attitude has changed. Today everybody in Brazil wants a house and a car and to live the American dream. I must admit that for me, America has by far the best popular music of any country, because it assimilates everything. Brazilian rhythms have been blended with rock and funk into something very rich.'' A Country Surprise K. T. Oslin, a New York-based singer and songwriter, is a woman whose spectacular, late-blooming success in country music has defied the conventional wisdom of the record industry. Three weeks ago, her debut album, ''80's Ladies'' (RCA Victor), crashed onto Billboard's country album chart at No. 15, becoming the highest-placing solo debut album by a woman in country-music history. What makes Ms. Oslin's achievement so remarkable is the fact that she is 45 years old, an age when most pop careers are in eclipse. Moreover, Ms. Oslin is not a part of Nashville's clubby country-music world. The singer, who grew up in Houston, has lived in New York City for 20 years, currently on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Until this month, her image was familiar to the general public only through her acting work in television commercials for denture cream, hemorrhoid preparations, soap and cat food. ''In my typical TV commercial roles, I was usually a Middle Western housewife wearing a plaid shirt,'' Ms. Oslin said the other day. ''I hated looking like that.'' The album ''80's Ladies'' has struck a chord with female baby-boomers who listen to country music. The album's title song follows the history of three high school friends over three decades. The chorus goes: Oh we've burned our bras and we've burned our dinners And we've burned our candles at both ends And we've got some children who look just like The way we did back then. Ms. Oslin has been a professional songwriter for less than a decade. ''I had taken standard classical piano lessons as a kid and later taught myself some pop-rock piano,'' she recalled. ''When I started writing, to my total amazement, what came out was country. I had never been much of a country fan except as a very young kid. When I got into high school everything was rock-and-roll. My first professional gig was as a folk singer in a Houston club in the early 60's. Then I got into the theater.'' It was the musical theater that brought Ms. Oslin to New York in 1967. From a chorus singer in the national tour of ''Hello, Dolly!'' she joined the New York production of the show and went on to appear in a revival of ''West Side Story'' and in ''Promises, Promises'' on Broadway. ''I didn't have the devotion to the theater that people must have in order to succeed,'' she said. ''I fell in love and moved upstate for a couple of years, then fell out of love and moved back to Manhattan where I got into the jingle business.'' Ms. Oslin's initial inspiration to write songs came in 1978 when she was traveling South and stopped in a cafe in Due West, S.C. Her attention was struck by a piece of neatly written graffiti that read, ''I ain't never gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford.'' The words inspired her first song, after which she went about methodically honing her craft, working first with collaborators, and now by herself. Before making her own album, her songs were recorded by several country singers, including Gail Davies and Dottie West. ''A lot of baby-boomers are switching over to country, because we've been rocked out,'' Ms. Oslin said. ''I also think country music is changing. It's getting less schmaltzy and dated, and I'm thrilled to be in on it.'' Springsteen's 'Tunnel' Bruce Springsteen will release a new album, ''Tunnel of Love,'' on Columbia in late September or early October. Sources say the scale of the record is somewhat smaller and its mood more intimate than either ''Born in the U.S.A.'' or ''The River,'' although it is a fully-produced studio album. Contrary to rumors, the music is not country-influenced.

1125-> WASHINGTON TALK: LATE-NIGHT FOOD DELIVERIES; Policy, Any Way You Slice It
The midnight oil burned late Tuesday night and into this morning at the White House as policy debates raged over President Reagan's address to the nation tonight. Should Mr. Reagan look forward or backward on the Iran-contra affair? Should he unequivocally endorse a peace plan signed by five Central American nations? What should he say about the policy of escorting and re-registering Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf? The budget deficit? But the White House staff members awaiting the resolution of such weighty matters of state were pondering a different set of questions: Pepperoni or mushroom? Thick crust or thin? There is nothing like a political debate to whet the appetite. So, at Domino's Pizza, the largest fast-food delivery service in the capital, business was booming. Pepperoni, the choice ultimately made Tuesday night, is the favored topping at the White House, according to Maynard Clark, night manager at Domino's Foggy Bottom, the outlet that serves most of the downtown Washington area and, hence, most of the Government bureaucracy. ''When they get real adventurous over there they go for pepperoni and mushroom,'' Mr. Clark went on. ''Now at the State Department, you're talking pizza. Those guys order 40 a night sometimes, and its always The Extravaganza.'' That is Domino's special pizza with everything, formerly known as The Destroyer. At the Pentagon, the thinking about pizza is divisive. ''They tend to be one extreme or the other,'' said Ken Rosenbaum, another Domino's manager. ''Either it's just pepperoni or it's the works.'' Domino's, which has 15 outlets in the metropolitan area and delivers until 1 A.M., says about 50 percent of its night orders are from law firms and Government offices. On a busy night like Tuesday, the Foggy Bottom shop alone was turning out 40 to 50 pizzas an hour. ''We Deliver'' is still a new concept in this city of button-down bureaucrats accustomed to late hours and brown bag dinners. Unlike New York, where late-night deliveries from delicatessens and ethnic eateries are a way of life, Washington has been slow to attract establishments that are willing to cater to the gastronomic needs of the briefcase and Reboks set. Until recently it was all but impossible to procure even an unassuming BLT after 10 P.M., let alone have it delivered. Good pastrami, alas, is still a distant dream. The telephone directory shows only 12 eating establishments in the entire metropolitan area that advertise delivery. Of these, five offer only Chinese food, one is an African restuarant that delivers only during the day, and the other six, which offer pizza, chicken, ribs, subs and the like, have limited night hours or circumscribed delivery areas that do not include downtown. But delivery is catching on. Rick Marsh, co-owner of Chick N Bucket, which makes occasional runs to the White House and State Department, says three or four years ago his restaurant was one of the few that delivered at night. ''The problem is, with the high rent in this city, it's just not worth it,'' he said, adding that most of the office business he gets these days is outside the Domino's delivery area. Frank O. Meeks, owner of the Domino's outlets, said: ''You have to have a high enough ticket price to make delivery worth it. You can't make it on hamburgers or sandwiches. More places are opening up, but they keep going out of business.'' Because this is Washington, certain protocols must be observed. For example, the Secret Service can't let just any pizza through the iron gates of the White House or the neighboring Old Executive Office Building. Paul Steindl, who delivers to the Executive branch regularly, outlined the routine at the E.O.B. ''You go in, and the guards send you to this little room off to the right of the doorway to get the pizza X-rayed,'' he said. Meanwhile, the bureaucrat who placed the order is summoned by telephone to collect his dinner, kept piping hot in a bright red insulated plastic case, sized small and large. (''There is no medium at Domino's,'' Mr. Steindl said.) X-rays completed, the deliverer waits by the metal entry gate to hand over his precious cargo and collect the tab. A Lapse in the System? Mr. Steindl said he had detected a serious lapse in the pizza security system. What is to prevent an unpatriotic pizza bearer from slipping a gun or a bomb into the pizza case once it has been X-rayed? he asked. In response, the Secret Service said it did not discuss security procedures - or, for that matter, its own choice of pizza toppings. At the White House, deliveries, edible or otherwise, are made to the guardhouse on Pennsylvania Avenue, and staff members must trudge out the long driveway from the West Wing to pick them up. The system is similar at the Pentagon, where staff members must make an even longer trek out to the bus stop at the south parking lot to take possession of their orders. Not surprisingly, the Central Intelligence Agency has the most cautious system of all. ''They make us call before we send the delivery person out and give them the delivery person's name,'' said Sam J. Rinehart, a night manager at the Domino's pizza parlor in McLean, Va. ''About four months ago, they started asking if the drivers were American citizens,'' Mr. Rinehart said, noting that most of them are. ''Some of our drivers were really offended.'' But the most curious thing, Mr. Rinehart confided, is the way employees of the C.I.A. order their pizzas. ''It just dawned on me recently,'' he said. ''They all use these four letter, one-syllable story-book names, like John or Bill.'' At the Agency, he said, ''you never get an unusual name ordering a pizza.''

1128-> LIBYAN WARPLANE IS DOWNED IN CHAD BY FRENCH FORCES
French forces in Chad shot down a Libyan warplane today over Chad's capital, an action that some French officials fear could lead to direct conflict between their country and Libya. French and Chadian officials said that members of France's 1,200-man force in Chad used an American-made Hawk missile to down the Soviet-made TU-22 bomber as it was about to attack the capital, Ndjamena. According to reports, no crew members survived. Libya acknowledged that one of its planes was shot down, but said another bomber flew a successful raid against Abeche, a town in eastern Chad. A statement issued here by the Libyan Embassy said the planes had been sent in retaliation for a Chadian attack over the weekend on an air base 60 miles inside Libya. 'Pouring Oil on the Fire' Foreign-affairs analysts said the latest development has made it much harder for France to maintain its previously quiet role in the war between Chad and Libya. Libya's Ambassador to France said today that ''those countries pouring oil on the fire risk also being burned.'' In a television interview, the Ambassador, Hamed el-Houdairi, added, ''All French people should realize that the situation could be dramatic.'' Tonight, the Libyan press agency, Jana, said the Libyan Government had sent a message to the United Nations Security Council about ''the serious dimensions resulting from the direct participation by France and the U.S.A.'' in the conflict. Chad Move Into Libya The Libyans are angry at France not only for shooting down their plane, but also for supplying large amounts of arms and ammunition to Chadian forces. Over the weekend the forces of Chad's President, Hissen Habre, embarrassed Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, by making their first attack into Libya and reportedly capturing and destroying the important Matan as Sarra air base there. Issa Boukar, a spokesman for Chad's Embassy to France, said his country had withdrawn its troops from the Libyan air base. French officials said that the shooting down of the Libyan plane did not represent any change in its position in the long war in central Africa. France had told President Habre it would not support him in his efforts to take back the disputed Aozou Strip along the Libyan border in the Sahara. France has long said it would defend Chad, a former French colony, if Libya attacked deep into that country. ''France's involvement in Chad,'' said Andre Giraud, France's Defense Minister, ''is essentially defensive and dissuasive. We want no Franco-Libyan confrontation, and the risks of confrontation between Libya and France can only come from Libyan interventions, notably the air bombings inside Chadian territory. Some French officials and defense analysts said they were concerned that the Libyan threats could lead to attacks against French forces in Chad or terrorist reprisals against French targets around the world. France's troops in Chad are based around the Ndjamena airport and Abeche, near the Sudanese border. Its forces in Chad include Mirage F-1 fighters, Jaguar fighter-bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, radar units and anti-aircraft artillery. The Libyan press agency said that a Libyan bomber was downed in Ndjamena, 600 miles south of the Libyan border. Chadian and French officials said a second TU-22 bomber had passed near the capital and evaded the French forces. Chad's Ambassador to France, Ahmad Allam-Mi, said today that Libyan planes had dropped five bombs on Abeche that killed several villagers. French troops were working there to extend an airstrip to increase France's air cover to defend Chad's border with the Sudan. Ndjamena Bombed in 1986 The TU-22, introduced by the Soviet Union in 1961, carries a crew of three, is capable of supersonic speeds and has a range of 1,400 miles. On Feb. 17, 1986, a Libyan TU-22 dropped a bomb on the runway of the Ndjamena airport. In the last eight months, the 14-year-old war between Libya and Chad has heated up as Chadian forces pushed Libyan troops out of most of the country. On Aug. 8, President Habre's forces captured Aozou, the main village in the 43,000-square-mile Aozou Strip that Colonel Qaddafi's forces took in 1973. It was a major loss for the Libyan leader, but his forces retook the town on Aug. 28. On Saturday, 2,000 Chadian troops pushed into Libya for the first time, moving on to Matan as Sarra. That base had 30 aircraft, artillery and close to 3,000 Libyan soldiers, according to Chadian and Western military intelligence. Chadian forces said the raid into Libya was part of a counterattack they launched after Libya pushed south of Aozou toward the town of Ounianga Kebir. Mr. Houdairi denied today that Libyan forces had pushed south of Aozou. Mr. Giraud, France's Defense Minister, said his country ''was not informed'' of the raid on Matan as Sarra, and added that ''there was no French element that had participated.'' Dominique Moisi, associate director of the French Institute for International Relations, said that France has been seeking to minimize its role in the war because it is concerned about its hostages in the Middle East and does not want a huge explosion before next spring's presidential elections.

1129-> Nuclear Emergencies Aren't the Only Kind
To the Editor: John Chubb is almost certainly right that the national interest, where energy security is concerned, argues against a state veto over nuclear power (''License Seabrook, Shoreham,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 3). But there is another more immediate human reason for state cooperation in emergency plans for nuclear power plants -there is far too little attention paid to emergency preparedness for all types of industrial accidents. Rather than stonewall on nuclear emergency plans, New York and Massachussets should embrace those efforts as many other states have. Indeed, all states should take the initiative to extend emergency planning for any and every facility that poses a risk to a community in the event of an accident, whether it is a dam upstream from a town, a storage facility for explosive materials, such as gasoline and natural gas, or rail tanker cars for transporting chlorine, or storage facilities for the highly toxic chemicals associated with many high-tech industries. Numerous plans already in place have been used for the safe evacuation of people for nonnuclear emergencies. MONICA E.

1132-> The Board of Education Surrenders to Janitors
Imagine reading that a large New York corporation had signed a contract with its janitors union and that under the terms of the contract the janitors were given virtual control over the corporation's physical plant. Imagine that the janitors could refuse to change a light bulb and move a desk, that they would be allowed to charge the company ''rent'' for keeping the company's own offices open on weekends or evenings. Unbelievable, you say? What corporate executive would ever agree to something so crazy? And if the management did sign such a contract, the stockholders would surely get rid of it. Alas, the unbelievable is happening at the New York City Board of Education. The board, the city's largest employer, has for years been routinely signing such ''crazy'' contracts with its janitors - school custodians. The most recent agreement gives the custodians - not the principals, teachers or parents - physical control of school buildings. Not only do janitors have civil service status but also they are treated as independent contractors. The current contract with Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, which expired last June and is being renegotiated, allows custodians to run school buildings as if they were their own property. The principals, who are ostensibly responsible for managing their schools, can't tell their custodians what to do; it is the custodian who tells the principal what can or can't be done with the facilities. Parent and community groups who want to use the buildings for after-school programs must rent them back from the custodians at exorbitant rates. Principals who want to get a light bulb or a window replaced don't even bother asking the custodian; ''it's not in the contract,'' they are often told. To get the work done, principals must place an order with central maintenance, and wait. Teachers who wish to do extra preparation in their classrooms before 8 A.M. must get the custodian's permission; more often than not, it's not forthcoming. Parent groups throughout New York City are trying to enrich their children's education by raising extra funds for art, music and library facilities. But one of the biggest obstacles they face is the custodians' contract. For example, at P.S. 183, on Manhattan's East Side, parent volunteers have been running a successful weekend flea market in the cafeteria. Unfortunately, about $40,000 of the $150,000 raised last year didn't go to programs for the children. Instead, the money went to the custodians in the form of ''opening fees'' and fees for using school space. Inexplicably, the Board of Educa-tion has relinquished control over its own staff. It has accepted a contract under which custodians are accountable to no one. Yet this bizarre arrangement is hardly an aberration. Indeed, the custodial contract is something of a model for the way the entire school system is being run. The Board of Education presides over a structure in which there is virtually a total absence of accountability and a consequent lack of management controls. Thus, whereas custodians are unaccountable to the principals, the principals - thanks to an outmoded and rigid system of tenure - are virtually unaccountable to anyone else in the system. It's hardly a secret that our schools are plagued by all too many incompetent and burned-out principals responsible for ruining the educational dreams of thousands of children. Nevertheless, nothing can be done to remove these principals under the present contract. Nowhere is the rule of unaccountabilty more firmly established than at the board's headquarters. The thousands of bureaucrats who work at 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn know that incompetent work goes unpunished and good work is rarely rewarded. They have figured out that in this system special claims can even be made for redundant fiefdoms such as the Board of Examiners. This institution continues to require separate and costly qualifying tests for city teachers, even though the state accepts a perfectly valid national test. We have created a bureaucratic monster that functions essentially as a special-interest state. It is a state in which every powerful group's prerogatives are protected, everyone's special claims are honored - the custodians, the principals, the 110 Livingston Street bureaucrats, the Board of Examiners. Everyone, that is, except the children. All the talk of educational reform and new initiatives emanating from the board will be meaningless unless the board demonstrates that it is capable of breaking the strangle hold special interests have over the system. Our next schools chancellor - no matter how brilliant, how creative, how tough - will fail as spectacularly as the current one unless the chancellor is given the power to control the workforce. The current negotiations over the custodians' contract should be seen as a litmus test of the board's intentions. If the board can't stand up to 986 custodians and seize control over its own physical plant, how will it deal with the far more nettlesome questions of principals' tenure and its own bloated bureaucracy? And if the board can't demonstrate any resolve on these fundamental management issues, then let's scrap the board and give full responsibility for running the school system directly to the Mayor. At least he is accountable to the voters.

1135-> Du Pont's Earnings Rise 31.8%
E.I du Pont de Nemours & Company, the nation's largest chemical company, said today that its third-quarter net income rose 31.8 percent, to $452 million, despite another steep decline in its petroleum refining and marketing business. On a per-share basis, profits climbed to $1.87 from $1.42 as sales rose 18.8 percent, to $7.6 billion. The results matched Wall Street forecasts, although some industry analysts said they were cutting 1988 profit estimates for Du Pont because of the threat of a recession. Strong Sectors Cited Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., attributed the large earnings increase to strong performances in a number of segments, notably fibers, agricultural and industrial chemicals and coal. The company also benefited from a gain of $31 million, or 13 cents a share, from the sale of a chlorine and caustic soda production facility in Texas. After-tax operating income at Du Pont's Conoco petroleum refining and marketing business slumped 63 percent, however, to $33 million. For the first nine months of 1987, it is down 79 percent, to $104 million. Conoco's petroleum exploration and production operation earned $43 million in the third quarter, in contrast to a year-earlier loss of $48 million, due to higher oil prices. Du Pont stock fell $6.75, to $81.25, today as Wall Street suffered another sharp downturn. Analysts said they retained their 1987 earnings estimates ranging from $7.15 to $7.40 a share. But they said the stock market turmoil clouded next year's outlook. Jack Henry of E.F. Hutton & Company said he lowered his 1988 profit forecast for Du Pont to $8 a share from $8.30 because of the general economic situation. Goerge Krug, an analyst at Eberstadt & Fleming Company, said Du Pont was better positioned than many other companies to weather a possible economic downturn. He cited its improved cost controls and the room for improvement in Conoco's oil refining operations. ''I would be surprised to see next year below this year's earnings, barring a depression,'' Mr. Krug said of Du Pont.

1136-> Market Place
WEAKNESS in the dollar has forced interest rates higher, stirred fears of renewed inflation and, periodically, rattled both the stock and bond markets in the United States. On Friday the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions to 6 percent, from 5 1/2 percent. This was seen in part as a move to stabilize the dollar by pushing up domestic interest rates. The weakening dollar, however, has been a boon for shareowners of international mutual funds that invest in foreign stocks. When stock holdings abroad are translated into dollars, these investors automatically reap the benefits of cheaper dollars. So far this year the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shows a total return - market appreciation plus reinvested dividends - of 34.6 percent. But international funds on average gained 36.99 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services. ''Nothing beats good stock picking,'' one professional manager said. ''But dollar weakness certainly has helped the internationals.'' For these fund managers, one common theme this year has been to switch some investments out of Japan and into Europe, primarily Britain. At the T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, Japanese issues account for only 24 percent of a worldwide portfolio - down from 30 percent early this year. Similarly, the Transatlantic Growth Fund has 27 percent invested in Japan, compared with 41 percent at the start of 1987. ''The near-term outlook for profit growth in Japan was considered to be poor,'' explained Henry B. W. de Vismes, president of the London-based Transatlantic fund. Through last Thursday this fund produced a return of 33.47 percent for 1987. It is managed by Kleinwort Benson International Investment Ltd., a subsidiary of Britain's largest merchant bank. In the same period the Baltimore-based Rowe Price fund was ahead 32 percent. Investing abroad always involves a currency risk. If the dollar were to change its recent course and appreciate against foreign currencies, overseas stocks would have to rise enough in price to provide an offset. Fund managers often take different approaches in a given country. On Friday Mr. de Vismes said he was de-emphasizing financial stocks that had been good winners in the Tokyo market. ''I am focusing more on domestic stocks, since the economy there is showing healthier signs,'' Mr. de Vismes said. ''Also, we have added some companies with a moderately high export content.'' Newcomers include Kyocera, a ceramic package producer, and Fujitsu, a computer maker. By contrast, Hakan Castegren, portfolio manager of the Ivy International Fund in Boston, said, ''In Japan I am almost exclusively in financial stocks.'' His holdings include Yamaichi Securities, Daiwa Securities and Dai-Tokyo Fire and Marine. Like many other fund managers, he has avoided Japan's big export companies where profits have suffered from the strength of the yen. Ivy International, one of three funds in the Ivy Group, shows a return of 53.5 percent this year. Its portfolio includes 15 percent in Japan and 25 percent - the largest country exposure - in Britain. ''Our holdings in Britain include Rio Tinto Zinc, B.A.T. Industries and Lloyds Bank,'' Mr. Castegren said. ''We basically have avoided Germany, Switzerland and Holland, where export companies have been affected by rising currencies.'' One of Ivy's unusual commitments is a stake in Brazil, which it established by purchasing an interest in Brazilian Investments S.A., a mutual fund in that country. ''The Brazilian market is flat on its face, having lost 90 percent of its value between May 1986 and May 1987,'' the manager said. ''But the values there are fabulous.'' Rowe Price International, with 30 percent of its assets in Britain, regards Britain and Hong Kong as the most attractive markets now. Transatlantic Growth has 22 percent of its assets in Britain, a market that has benefited from rising oil prices, falling interest rates, growing profits and, in June, a Conservative election victory. ''But since the good news is out, that market may be fairly dull over the rest of this year,'' Mr. de Vismes said. ''Accordingly, we have taken some profits recently.'' What lies ahead for the dollar? The Transatlantic fund president sees a probability of further weakness in the last quarter of 1987 or soon thereafter. Mr. Castegren of the Ivy fund said, ''I am hoping for stability.'' Recent weakness in the dollar primarily reflects America's huge trade deficit. But the dollar's value has actually been slipping since early 1985. Thanks to this factor - and to judicious stock picking - international funds are the top-performing fund group for the five years ended June 30. Their gain of 297.4 percent even beat the S.&P. index's 242.5 percent.

1142-> Washington Talk: Briefing; On Second Thought . . .
When two supporters of Governor Cuomo filed papers last month with the Federal Election Commission, establishing a draft committee in an effort to persuade the Governor to run for President, they didn't realize what they were getting into. Already, the two, Marc A. Brailov and James W. Brandon, say they are scaling back their effort. Days after they had formed their committee, they asked two organizers of separate Cuomo draft committees to join their effort. But they soon learned that both men had questionable backgrounds. Moreover, Mr. Brailov and Mr. Brandon learned that organizing a grass-roots draft committee across the country was not cheap. It would cost nearly $1 million just to get the appropriate lists and to send letters to the registered Democrats in Iowa seeking support. ''This is all sort of sobering,'' said Mr. Brailov, a financial research analyst. ''When we first started out, we thought maybe we could have a campaign with a national focus. But we're going to have to change the scope of the committee. We were motivated by heart, nothing else, but all of this has made us very careful.''

1143-> Protein From AIDS Virus Linked To Mental Impairment of Victims
Scientists have found that a protein from the virus that causes AIDS blocks the action of an important nerve growth chemical, a finding they say may help explain the mental impairment suffered by many AIDS patients. Researchers at the University of Chicago said today that part of the protein coat of the AIDS virus appeared to keep the necessary nerve chemical from reaching neurons, denying the nerve cells a conditioner that keeps them healthy and functioning. Scientists have been mystified by the progressive neurological problems associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and why the brain is so affected by a disease that primarily attacks the immune system. Specialists estimate that two-thirds of those who die from AIDS have suffered moderate to severe dementia in the course of their disease, and that 90 percent of all patients show some signs of complications in the brain and nervous system. Virus Blocks a Nerve Chemical Dr. Mark E. Gurney said in an interview that the AIDS virus blocks a nerve chemical, neuroleukin or NLK, which also is secreted by white blood cells and plays a role in the body's disease-fighting immune system. ''Neuroleukin also is a lymphokine, or a biological modifier like interleukin-2, that we think is important for antibody production,'' he said. ''Neuroleukin appears to have two roles in the body and acts on the two different systems that the AIDS virus affects.'' Biological modifiers, such as interferon and interleukin-2, are substances that help mobilize the immune system to attack bacteria, viruses and other material alien to the body. While blocking NLK might explain some of the symptoms of AIDS dementia, it does not account for all the changes seen in the brains of AIDS patients, other experts familiar with the Chicago research said. Research Termed Promising Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an AIDS expert at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said dementia in AIDS patients was probably caused by a number of factors and that NLK-blocking might be one of them. Some research indicates that the AIDS virus may directly bind to nerve cells and affect them that way, he said, while other research indicates that infected cells called macrophages may secrete toxic substances that can affect brain cells. ''The work with neuroleukin is promising and not inconsistent with what we know about AIDS dementia,'' Dr. Fauci said in an interview. In a report to be published Friday in the journal Science, Dr. Gurney and his colleagues say they found that an AIDS virus envelope protein known as gp120 is genetically and chemically similar to neuroleukin. Dr. Gurney, Dr. Mark R. Lee at Temple University in Philadelphia and Dr. David D. Ho of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles found that adding deactivated AIDS virus or gp120 concentrations to cultures of nerve cells prevented NLK from influencing the survival of the cells. The researchers think that nerve cells have binding sites called receptors that latch onto NLK so it can work. The gp120 viral protein, because of its likeness to NLK, may be attracted to the same receptors and keep NLK from attaching, they said. Similar results were obtained in cell cultures tested against SIV, a monkey virus closely related to the AIDS virus that causes immune system disease in animals, the researchers said.

1144-> Salvagers Suggest Titanic Exploded
Spokesmen for a salvage expedition that surveyed the wreck of the Titanic said today that an explosion and fire, rather than an iceberg alone, may have caused the luxury liner to sink 75 years ago. That theory arose after divers discovered a hole in the front of the wreck that appeared to have been caused by a blast, said Jacques Montlucon, who is overseeing the preservation of artifacts retrieved from the ship. Expedition organizers have asked naval architects to examine the possibility that something in addition to an iceberg caused the sinking, said John Joslyn, president of Westgate International film production company, a partner in the salvage venture.

1145-> SCIENCE WATCH; Life in the Roman Empire
Discoveries on Cyprus have provided a ''snapshot'' of everyday life in the late Roman Empire. Digging this summer, archeologists from the University of Arizona found the skeletons of two men who must have been killed instantly by the earthquake in the year 365 that destroyed the Roman city of Kourion in one of the great disasters of antiquity. Seven other skeletons and a wealth of artifacts were found there in earlier excavations. One of the skeletons was of a man in his early 20's who was apparently alone at a workbench when the roof caved in on him. Coins and ceramic pots lay about. In the next room of what was probably a row of live-in shops was the skeleton of another man. A bronze pot was sitting on an open oven. A finely fashioned bronze oil lamp was lying at the doorway. ''At this rate, we estimate that at least 500 people must have been killed,'' said David Soren, a University of Arizona archeologist. ''In every place where people might have lived, we're finding skeletons.'' Exploration of the ruins at Kourion, once a bustling Mediterranean port, is being conducted under the direction of the Cyprus Department of Antiquities and is supported in part by the National Geographic Society.

1147-> COMPANY NEWS; I.B.M. INTRODUCES SYSTEM/36 MODE
The International Business Machines Corporation introduced a new entry-level model of its System/36 minicomputer line yesterday. The System/36 is a mid-range office computer often used as a host for a number of terminals. I.B.M. said the new System/36 model 5363 offers greater performance and more features than its predecessor, the model 5364. The older computer, which is known as the System/36 PC, has not sold well and is expected to be discontinued. Users have complained that the model 5364 requires a personal computer to act as the gateway to the network on which the System/36 computer resides. In its new model 5363, I.B.M. said it has eliminated the need for a personal computer and placed the external communications and network functions directly inside the new machine. The model 5363, designed for small business offices and departments of large companies, can be expanded to 210 megabytes of memory, a 62 percent increase over the maxium storage capacity of the model 5364, I.B.M. said. In addition, the new machine can support up to 100 personal computers connected by local area networks. Analysts said that the $11,000 price for the new System/36 model was competitive and some predicted that the new machine would win new customers for I.B.M. But analysts said the model 5363 still does not have enough processing capability to distract users from the Digital Equipment Corporation's Microvax 2000. I.B.M. is expected to combine its System/36 computer and its more sophisticated System/38 computer in a new machine that the trade press said has the code name ''Silverlake.'' On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, I.B.M. stock recovered in part from Monday's selloff, gaining $11.75, to $115 a share.

1148-> COMPANY NEWS; Dart Group Ends Its Bid To Buy Dayton Hudson
The Dart Group Corporation said yesterday that it was giving up its $68-a-share takeover bid for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, a move that is expected to result in an after-tax loss of about $70 million. Dart also said Madison Partnership, which is owned 95 percent by Dart, would not solicit any more authorizations to call a stockholders meeting to unseat the Dayton Hudson board, which has spurned two Dart offers. Dart, which is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, had been seeking to take over Dayton Hudson since July and had valued its bid at $6.6 billion. Sharp Drop in Shares Dayton Hudson's stock fell $1.25, to $28.75 a share, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Dart had originally offered $65 a share in cash and then raised it to $68. Like other large retail chains, Dayton Hudson has seen its stock hit hard by the market plunge. Since last Friday, Dayton Hudson shares have fallen $20.25. Madison, which Dart said owned about 4.6 million of Dayton Hudson common shares, sold about 1.4 million shares yesterday. ''Depending on market conditions, Madison intends to continue selling its remaining shares of Dayton Hudson,'' Dart said. Dart said that the sale will result in significant losses. Sources estimated that those losses could total about $70 million after taxes. Dart, however, is known to have a cash reserve of about $400 million. ''We may retain some of our shares in Dayton Hudson,'' said Robert Haft, president of the Dart Group. But he declined to indicate whether he and his father, Herbert Haft, chairman of Dart, might later renew their efforts to acquire Dayton Hudson. Mr. Haft said Dart was still interested in buying a major retail company. ''But we will wait until things settle down,'' he said. 'Seeking to consummate a transaction in today's capital market is practically impossible.'' Mr. Haft said Dart was not now buying depressed retailing shares. ''The capital markets are just chaotic.'' he said, but added, ''We believe that the circumstances will change and that there will be opportunities for us.'' Dayton Hudson officials did not return calls for comment yesterday.

1149-> ADVERTISING; China Assignments For Leading Packager
The man behind the packaging of Ronzoni, Weight Watchers and 9-Lives, as well as Corningware and Combos, a snack product from M&M Mars, is now going to do a design job for China's airline. Would you call that a change of pace? The man is Charles G. Biondo, 50-year-old chairman of Charles Biondo Design Associates of 389 West 12th Street. He admits to being born in the Bronx and being fascinated with China for as long as he can remember. In his fashionably comfortable, and personally designed, conference room he explained yesterday the long and involved path that led him to this exotic assignment. ''I feel like I'm a pioneer in this area,'' he said. ''Me, a kid from the Bronx.'' He explained that the job he would be doing for the Civil Aviation Administration of China would be to produce designs, including a logotype, for the Chinese international airline and the five regional airlines that are proposed as part of the reorganization of the one Government air carrier. Mr. Biondi has a second, equally fascinating job that is China-related, designing uniforms for sales personnel for a proposed chain of retail outlets. The stores will be open to both tourists and Chinese. As tourists have found, they, but not the Chinese, can shop in China's so-called Friendship Stores. The retail project is called the Shenyang Commercial Building (previously Mansion) and, while Mr. Biondo thinks the building in which the first store is now housed can certainly keep that name, he is adamant about having the store name changed. ''They don't want something that looks Chinese,'' Mr. Biondo said, ''They want to open up. What they want to communicate is what foreigners perceive China to be.'' Do you follow that? The graphics executive, who returned to the United States Oct. 29 after a three-week stay in China, his second visit, has already learned a thing or two about Chinese conceptions. For example, when he suggested that the shop use black shopping bags, the Chinese were turned off, remembering the black garbage bags they frequently saw in New York. They also considered polyester better than cotton or wool. Mr. Biondo surmises that this is due to the lack of good dry cleaning facilities in China, which make the synthetic fabric's qualities more desirable.

1150-> Iran Says Iraqis Raided a Nuclear Plant
Iranian news outlets reported that Iraqi warplanes raided an unfinished Iranian nuclear power plant today, and that an Iranian nuclear official said the attack could lead to a release of radiation across international borders. Iraq announced it had raided a chemical complex at Bushire, near the site, but did not announce any attack on the nuclear plant. Iran's official press agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the energy official, Reza Amrollahi, as saying the plant contained nuclear material. The raid might lead to ''the same transfrontier radioactive release and radiological consequences as the Chernobyl nuclear accident,'' he said, referring to the Soviet disaster in 1986. There was no independent confirmation of a raid on the nuclear plant or of the presence of nuclear material at the site, which had been bombed at least five times since 1984. U.S. Experts Discount Threat In Washington, American nuclear experts said the reported bombing could not produce a Chernobyl-like disaster. Gary Milhollin, a University of Wisconsin law professor and former Pentagon nuclear consultant, said Iran's two reactors at Bushire ''are not complete, so they do not have any high level radioactive material in them.'' He said the Iranians ''could have put fresh reactor fuel in it, if they had some, but unless the reactor is operating, it does not create the kind of radioactivity that is dangerous to health.'' ''The dangerous materials from Chernobyl were products of the fission reaction, which occurs when a reactor operates,'' he said. Dan Butler, a Department of Energy spokesman, said: ''There is no reactor in Iran. I've checked with three sources.'' None of the experts said they had any reports of radioactivity from the site. Construction at the plant, which was begun under the Shah, was interrupted in 1979, when the Islamic fundamentalist regime took power in Teheran. Iran Reports 11 Killed Iran said 11 people were killed in the raid today. The Iranian news agency said that Mr. Amrollahi, president of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, had sent an ''urgent protest note'' to Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, asking him to rush a team of experts to the scene to monitor the effects of the raid. In Vienna, a spokesman for the energy agency said he knew nothing about a request for such a team. But the spokesman, James Daglish, said an Iranian representative was seeking a meeting with Mr. Blix. No one answered the telephone at the Iranian mission there. Iraq said in a military communique that its jets had conducted two raids against ''the Iranian industrial and chemical production complex at Bushire,'' 37 miles from the nuclear installation. An Iraqi News Agency broadcast hinted that the industrial complex was engaged in making and storing chemical weapons. Iran said last year that it had moved ''fissionable material'' into the plant and warned an attack could set off another Chernobyl disaster. The explosion and fire at the Soviet nuclear plant in April 1986 killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radioactive material around the world. Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier that they could not confirm the assertion about fissionable material because no on-site inspection had been made. The Teheran radio said that among the 11 killed at the unfinished plant were ''one of the plant's top nuclear power experts'' and a West German engineer.

1151-> 5 Receive Kennedy Center Honors for Artistic Contributions
The presence of the actress Bette Davis at the White House this evening gave President Reagan another opportunity to repeat one of his favorite lines. ''If I had gotten roles as good as yours and been able to do them as good as you did,'' he said, ''I never would have left Hollywood.'' Miss Davis was at the White House as part of a weekend of activities surrounding the awarding of the Kennedy Center Honors to Miss Davis and to the singer Perry Como, the singer and dancer Sammy Davis Jr., the violinist Nathan Milstein and the choreographer Alwin Nikolais. Irving Berlin Also Honored In addition, a surprise tribute was paid at a gala to the composer Irving Berlin, who is nearing his 100th birthday. Mr. Berlin has been in failing health and was unable to travel to Washington, and the Kennedy Center has been under criticism for not having given its award to him. The White House has been occupied with preparations for this week's summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, but for this time, there was also a combination of the contributions of the arts. As if to make that point, Irek Mukhamedov and Lyudmila Semenyaka, two dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow also performed tonight at the gala, held at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Applause for Soviet Dancers When they finished, President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, rose to their feet to applaud. Those in the audience took the cue and also rose to applaud. Earlier, President Reagan, in the presentation ceremonies in the East Room of the White House, noted that Miss Davis had recently completed her 100th motion picture, ''The Whales of August.'' Mr. Reagan noted that Miss Davis had been praised for her performance in The New York Times and then added, ''Since getting this job, I've found out just how difficult it is to get a good notice from The New York Times.'' The master of ceremonies for the gala in honor of the award recipients was the television news broadcaster Walter Cronkite. Those performing or speaking of the honorees included Lucille Ball, Ray Charles, Pinchas Zukerman, Angela Lansbury, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Don Ameche, Diahann Carroll, Vic Damone, Joseph Papp, Jacques D'Amboise, Rosemary Clooney and Joe Williams. Because the tribute to Mr. Berlin was kept as a secret until the last minute, it allowed for a rousing finale of Berlin songs, with Mr. and Mrs. Reagan, in the Presidential box, joining the audience in singing. First the Reagans sang along with Mr. Williams in ''Alexander's Ragtime Band.'' Then the actor James Stewart recited the beginning lines of Mr. Berlin's ''God Bless America,'' and when it was switched into song, the Reagans joined along once again. Nikolais 'in 77th Heaven' ''You feel like an idiot, but the happiest idiot in the world,'' Mr. Davis said of receiving the award, which is given for lifetime achievement in the performing arts. Mr. Davis will be 62 years old Tuesday. Mr. Nikolais was enchanted. ''I'm in 77th heaven,'' he said, ''because I was 77 two days ago, and this is an extra occasion.'' Miss Davis, 79, who has been in ill health in recent years, did not appear to be as able as the others to ''work the room,'' as performersa and politicians are accustomed to doing. So Mr. Stewart, also 79 and perhaps the most unaffected person ever to come to Washington, went over to Miss Davis's table to say hello. ''Find a script!'' Miss Davis exclaimed to Mr. Stewart. ''I made just one film with him, and I'd like to make another.'' Mr. Stewart identified the movie as ''Right of Way.'' Mr. Milstein, 83, kept mostly to himself and his wife, expressing reluctance to try to sum up his feelings in a few words. Mr. Como, 75, summed up with self-consciousness: ''This is the darnedest thing I've ever Tonight's gala performance was taped for television broadcast by CBS on Dec. 30.

1152-> Ireene Wicker Hammer Dies, 86; Storyteller to Millions of Children
Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old. She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.'' In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly. She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success. With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.'' The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy. Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948. When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices. During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies. After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985. Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.

1153-> FILM: 'NO MAN'S LAND'
''No Man's Land'' was shown as part of the 1985 New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times Oct. 5, 1985. The film opens today at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street. EACH of the four principal characters in Alain Tanner's ''No Man's Land'' wants to be someplace else. Madeleine, who runs a disco on the French-Swiss border, dreams of going to Paris to pursue a singing career. Her lover, Paul, who makes his living smuggling money, gold and goods across the border, plans to emigrate to Canada. Mali, a pretty young Algerian woman who lives in France and works in Switzerland, would like to be anywhere except where she is. Louis, born on a Swiss farm and trained as a clockmaker, would give anything to leave his mistress, Lucie, and move in with Mali. Not for nothing is the film titled ''No Man's Land,'' which, of course, refers not only to the strip of land between the French and the Swiss customs stations, through which the characters are constantly passing, but also to their states of mind. Thus, what we have here is an all-too-explicit metaphor that traps Mr. Tanner's drama as effectively as his characters are trapped by their lives. Once you've understood the title, there's no place for the film to go that you can't anticipate long before the gloomy, none-too-bright young characters. Mr. Tanner is Switzerland's most interesting, most gifted film maker, but his best films (''La Salamandre,'' ''The Middle of the World,'' ''Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000'') have all been made in collaboration with John Berger, the English novelist and critic. Without Mr. Berger's assistance, Mr. Tanner's films, like this one, tend to be completely humorless and cold, memorable only for their picturesque landscapes and cloud formations. ''No Man's Land'' has a cast of attractive young actors and a soundtrack score by Terry Riley, the American minimalist composer who's been strongly influenced by Indian music. The music is actually the most interesting thing in the movie. ON THE BORDER: NO MAN'S LAND, directed by Alain Tanner; screenplay (French with English subtitles) by Mr. Tanner; photography by Bernard Zitzerman; edited by Laurent Uhler; music by Terry Riley; produced by Mr. Tanner and Marin Karmitz; production companies, Filmograph; M.K.2 Productions in association with Westdeutscher Rundfunk/Channel Four Television/Film on Four International/Television Suisse Romande/Films A2.

1155-> 11 Are Arrested In Gay Protest At St. Patrick's
In an act of planned civil disobedience, 11 gay Catholics were arrested yesterday at St. Patrick's Cathedral when they stood in protest during the priest's homily and then refused either to be seated or to leave the church. Similar protests at the cathedral have occurred on the first Sunday of every month since March, when the Archdiocese of New York ordered an end to special masses for gay Catholics at a Greenwich Village church. But today, for the first time, the protesters remained standing after ushers read a statement demanding they ''conform to the normal Catholic form of worship or leave the premises immediately.'' 'Never Stopped Speaking' The protesters, who are members of Dignity, a Catholic group that condones homosexuality, had warned police officials of their intention and were immediately arrested on the misdemeanor charge of aggravated disorderly conduct. They were taken to the 17th Precinct station house and were later released with summonses to appear in Criminal Court in January. The incident took place in the absence of John Cardinal O'Connor, who normally celebrates the 10:15 A.M. Mass, but this week is in the Philippines representing Pope John Paul II at a Eucharistic congress. The Mass, on the second Sunday of Advent, was celebrated instead by the Rev. Thomas Neilson, who at the time of the arrests had just completed the Gospel reading, from the book of Mark, and was in the midst of his homily. ''He never stopped speaking,'' said Robert Pusilo, a Dignity official who was in St. Patrick's but was not among those arrested. ''We heard all those catch words like 'love' and 'community.' It's devastating to people to know those are just hollow words. There is no loving going on toward the gay and lesbian community.'' Taunted the Cardinal The 11 people arrested, including a priest and a person with AIDS, were among about 35 demonstrators at the service, according to police estimates. Mr. Pusilo said that the 11 had volunteered for arrest because they had already identified themselves as gay in their communities and at work and therefore ''had the least to lose.'' While the remaining protesters left the church, the 11 stayed. ''When they refused to leave, the police were summoned,'' said a spokesman for the Archdiocese, Msgr. Peter Finn. ''Those still refusing were taken outside and placed under arrest.'' The arrests followed several months of increasing acrimony between the Archdiocese and Dignity, which has about 250 members in Manhattan and 5,000 nationwide. Last winter, Dignity received a letter expelling them from St. Francis Xavier Church, at 30 West 16th Street, where since 1979 they had celebrated a special Saturday evening Mass. The expulsion, like a similar one in the Brooklyn diocese, followed a Vatican document that called homosexuality an ''intrinsic moral disorder.'' Dignity now worships at the Lesbian and Gay Community Center at 208 West 13th Street and on Jan. 2 will begin services at the Universalist Church at Central Park West and 76th Street. Meanwhile, once a month, several dozen protesters wearing lavender arm bands gather at St. Patrick's. At first, the Archdiocese tolerated them. But in October - after complaints from parishioners, according to Monsignor Finn - the ushers began reading the statements and threatening to summon police officers from the rear of the cathedral. Other gay demonstrators, not affiliated with Dignity, had also begun attending the Mass, some of them turning their back on the altar or taunting the Cardinal. For two months, the Dignity protesters left the church peacefully after the ushers' request. ''But this month we decided a stand must be made,'' Mr. Pusilo said. ''We are people of faith, devout Roman Catholics in committed relationships. We want the right to worship in our church. We are standing up for human rights.'' Dignity officials informed the police of their intentions at a meeting last week. A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Diane Kubler, said a detail of 75 officers was assembled in the area, with 20 of them inside the Cathedral. The protesters were aware that the Cardinal would not be present but decided to go ahead anyway. ''The issue is bigger than the Cardinal,'' Mr. Pusilo said.

1156-> Software Eccentric's Big Step
Even in an industry known for its eccentric entrepreneurs, Philippe Kahn has stood out - for his loud Hawaiian shirts, for his impromptu saxophone solos at news conferences, and last, but certainly not least, for the success of the microcomputer software company he founded. Neither Mr. Kahn nor his four-year-old company, Borland International Inc., is a household word. But among his peers in the microcomputer industry, he is nearly as famous as Bill Gates, the founder of the Microsoft Corporation, and Mitchell Kapor, the founder of the Lotus Development Corporation. Mr. Kahn built Borland into a small but thriving niche player catering mainly to computer hobbyists with relatively inexpensive software for writing programs and organizing data. But now Mr. Kahn - a mathematician who was an illegal alien from France when he founded Borland - is trying to transform his company into a giant that sells a broad range of software to a broad range of customers, including one sector it has largely ignored: corporations. Smaller Is Weaker Mr. Kahn's quest for size reflects a relatively new trend in the industry: small companies are having an increasingly hard time surviving as marketing power and breadth of product offerings become more important. But as Borland demonstrates, the path to bigness is fraught with risks. Borland expects to complete the acquisition of Ansa Software, a respected maker of data base management programs, this month. The merger's success, however, will depend on integrating Borland's unconventional ''Hawaiian shirt'' corporate culture with Ansa's more traditional ''pinstripe suit'' culture. At the same time, Mr. Kahn is moving Borland into the applications software market by offering programs ranging from a spreadsheet to word processing. But that will place it in more direct competition with such big software guns as Lotus Development, Microsoft and the Ashton-Tate Company. In making these strategic switches, Mr. Kahn seems to be deviating from the unconventional tactics that have been responsible for Borland's success. The leading software companies -Microsoft, Lotus and Ashton-Tate -grew large by selling applications programs to business users for several hundred dollars each. In contrast, Borland has prospered by selling such programming languages as Turbo Basic and Turbo Pascal (which are used to create applications programs), mainly to computer hackers at prices below $100. In addition, its Sidekick program - an electronic calendar, address book, clock and calculator in one -has been a hot seller for more than two years. But in a departure from this strategy, Borland introduced a spreadsheet program named Quattro that is aimed squarely at Lotus's widely used 1-2-3 program. And Mr. Kahn says that one of the reasons he first was attracted to Ansa was its Paradox program. That program, however, not only sells for a very un-Borlandlike $495 to $695 but also competes with another highly popular data base management program: Ashton-Tate's dBase. ''It's hard for me to see a strategic direction for Borland,'' said Stewart Alsop, editor of the Personal Computer Letter, who thinks the company is going off in too many directions. His Real Goal Interviewed at poolside at his sprawling glass-walled house overlooking Scotts Valley, Mr. Kahn said that the acquisition of Ansa, in a stock swap valued at about $37 million, moved him closer to his real goal: to make Borland one of the two major microcomputer software companies. (He would not say which he thought the other would be.) With 400 employees and sales for the year ended March 31 of $29.2 million, Borland was the eighth-largest software company before the Ansa merger. Mr. Kahn insisted that Borland and Ansa would fit together well. Ansa's field sales force of 40 offers Borland an entree to major business customers, he said. And Borland, which also recently introduced a word-processing program called Spring, can supply Ansa's sales force with an array of new programs. ''We needed more products; they needed a sales force,'' said Ron Posner, Ansa's president and chief executive, who will join Borland as a director and vice president for domestic and international sales. Unlikely Match Seen Given the companies' different cultures, though, many analysts have pronounced the marriage an unlikely match. There already are rumors in the industry that a number of Ansa's talented employees are unhappy and may leave. Still, even most of the skeptics acknowledge that the 35-year-old Mr. Kahn - who started Borland above an automobile repair shop here with virtually no money - is both a technical and marketing innovator who consistently confounds their expectations. Borland's products have steadily earned favorable reviews, both for technical innovation and for proper performance when first released -which has not always been the case with some larger competitors. Borland's profits declined to $2.1 million in the fiscal year 1987, from $5.2 million in 1986. Mr. Kahn said that one main reason was the cost of developing new products. The company delayed shipping the programs until they were ''bug-free,'' he said. A Key Figure Analysts of the merger point out that one of the most influential figures in the electronics industry, Benjamin M. Rosen, seems to think it can work. Mr. Rosen, a venture capitalist, has backed such successes as Lotus and the Compaq Computer Corporation - and very few failures. He had been Ansa's chairman and has agreed to serve as a director of the merged companies. ''The fact that Ben is on the board and is willing to work with the company makes it all worthwhile,'' said Richard Shaffer, editor of the Technologic Partners Computer Letter. Mr. Rosen, noting that both Ansa and Borland ''aspired to be one of the major microcomputer software companies,'' said that ''together they can achieve that goal a lot faster.'' And rather than being concerned about Mr. Kahn's unorthodox style, Mr. Rosen said that ''one of the things that gives the company a lot of excitement'' is the fact that Mr. Kahn, along with Bill Gates of Microsoft, ''is one of two chief executives in the industry who is still technically active in designing products.'' Mr. Kahn also is still Borland's biggest shareholder. He owns 19.6 million, or nearly 30 percent, of Borland's 66 million shares. His holdings are worth more than $67 million at current market prices. Toga Parties In addition, Mr. Kahn, who has gone to company parties dressed as Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, is clearly one of the more flamboyant chief executives in Silicon Valley. He has often chided his competitors for being too greedy by charging prices higher than Borland's. McGraw-Hill canceled a planned merger with Borland two years ago after learning that Mr. Kahn was an illegal alien; he has since obtained a green card. Some outsiders think it is only a matter of time before the company's toga parties - and its seat-of-the-pants entrepreneurial atmosphere in general - become history. But Mr. Kahn dismisses such talk. ''Being seat-of-the-pants is one of the major qualities you can have in this industry; it doesn't preclude you from being professional,'' he said. Of his theatrics, he said he thought that most in the industry would take them in the right spirit. Besides, he added, ''The only thing people care about is how good our products are and how good our profits are.'' Mr. Posner said, ''The challenge is not to lose what made Borland great in the past while adding the structure we need to double the size of the company.'' Borland's product strategy is aimed most clearly at Lotus, which ironically was offered the Paradox program before Ansa was formed. Mr. Kahn said that Borland's Quattro spreadsheet program was compatible with Lotus 1-2-3, but was much faster and would be priced at $195; 1-2-3 lists for $495 and is typically discounted for about $325. 'A Superior Product' Noting Borland's success in programming languages, where it has captured a dominant market share from Microsoft, Mr. Kahn jauntily predicted that Borland would have no trouble taking on Lotus. ''Lotus is going to be in great jeopardy with Quattro,'' he said. ''We have a superior product.'' Others are less sure. ''Lotus has Release 3 of 1-2-3 on the way, and they have done as good a job of protecting market share as any,'' said David Wagman, co-chairman of Softsel Computer Products Inc., a major software distributor based in Inglewood, Calif. ''I would say Philippe has his hands full.'' In addition, Microsoft is about to release an International Business Machines PC version of Excel, the best-selling spreadsheet on the Apple Macintosh, and Seymour Rubenstein, founder of the Micropro International Corporation, is introducing a spreadsheet program called Surpass, which has received favorable initial reviews. ''I think Philippe has correctly understood the challenge of going head to head with Lotus, but maybe not of going up against everyone else,'' said Stewart Alsop, editor of the Personal Computer Letter. Investors Cautious Investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Ansa acquisition and Borland's strategic changes. The company's stock has been relatively flat in recent weeks on the London Unlisted Securities Market, where it closed at $3.44 yesterday. (So far Borland's shares are traded only in Britain, where the company went public in July 1986. One of the reasons it went public in Britain is that Mr. Kahn has ties with investment bankers there.) Borland's success or failure in integrating Ansa and cracking the applications-software market will undoubtedly determine whether the company soon goes public in the United States. Mr. Kahn is obviously interested in taking such a step. After earning a reputation on Wall Street for being aloof, Mr. Kahn, with Mr. Rosen's help, is now wooing analysts.

1157-> METRO DATELINES; 2 Factory Buildings Destroyed by Blaze
A fire destroyed two warehouse-factory buildings and damaged a third yesterday in the city's downtown area about eight blocks south of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the authorities said. More than 100 firefighters from four towns joined city firefighters in battling the three-alarm blaze, which broke out shortly after 3 A.M. in a six-story factory building, said Battalion Chief Louis Masters. The building housed several small businesses and storage space, he said. The fire was declared under control at 7:30 A.M., but not before flames had spread to a one-story warehouse and a seven-story factory-warehouse, Chief Masters said. The one-story building and the six-story building collapsed and the seven-story structure was heavily damaged, he said. No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire, which could be seen from the New York side of the Hudson River, was being investigated. ''We have no reason to believe at this time that it was arson,'' Chief Masters said.

1158-> Opera: 'Traviata' at the Met
ANNA TOMOWA-SINTOW'S is definitely the kind of soprano voice the Metropolitan Opera needs more often: big enough to sail out into the huge house without forced tone or loss of beauty. Several passages of sustained lyrical singing in her ''Traviata'' performance Saturday evening gave pleasure, especially the lamenting lines beginning ''Cosi alla misera'' in Act II. Violetta is not the soprano's best part: she does not seem to have the innate sympathy with the character that makes the role's memorable exponents so moving. And her singing lacked, in various degrees, clear focus and refinement of detail. But she earned gratitude for bringing with her the most basic asset, a voice appropriate to the role and house. Dano Raffanti was the Alfredo. He has an honest, unpretentious way with the music, and his voice is a light tenor of good Italian quality - warm, easily projected, poised on the words. He is not an exceptional stylist or actor, and the few high notes in the part did not make one wish there had been more, but in the right roles (this being one) it would be good to hear more of him. Perhaps under more inspiring conditions than this listlessly staged and poorly conducted revival, the two might have reached further into their roles and given exciting performances. Stimulating surroundings would surely have been a boon to Brian Shexnayder, who sang his first Germont pere at the house. His baritone is firm, well unified, good to the ears, but he blended all too well into the musically monochromatic and dramatically vague environment. Two secondary singers should be singled out for excellent work: Stanford Olsen as a lively Gastone and Margaret Jane Wray as a superbly clear-toned Annina.

1160-> Debt Policy in Transition
Under the plan to sell bonds to Mexico to help it reduce its debt burden, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d has effectively become a partner in debt relief with commercial banks and the Mexican Government. Through its role in the plan, the Treasury is acknowledging that some part of the more than $1 trillion in outstanding third-world loans will not be paid. This represents a major turn in strategy from the earlier ''Baker Plan,'' which maintained that the debt was repayable in full, as well as a concession that an important part of the earlier approach has not succeeded. Although the Treasury portrays its approach, which is expected to be applied later to other debtor governments, as an evolutionary development, many others see it as a break with past policy. Comment by Debt Experts ''For the first time the Treasury is participating directly in a debt-swapping transaction so that the U.S. Government is becoming a partner in debt restructuring at below par,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner in the investment firm of Lazard Freres. Robert D. Hormats added, ''Treasury bonds are the catalyst that makes this thing work, and from that point of view this is different from other solutions.'' Mr. Hormats is vice president, international, at Goldman, Sachs & Company, another investment firm. A Mexican Government official commented, ''The Treasury is sending a signal, and that is very important in terms of the future evolution of the debt strategy.'' A Zero-Coupon Approach In Washington, the Treasury said it would ''facilitate'' the debt exchange by coming up with its first ''zero-coupon bonds.'' For only $2 billion Mexico will buy $10 billion of the Treasury bonds, which mature in 20 years but sell at a heavy discount initially because they pay no interest over their lifetime. The plan is that Mexico would use the $10 billion in Treasury bonds to back $10 billion of its own new, marketable bonds. With Mexican debt selling in the open market at 50 cents on the dollar, Mexico would use its bonds to retire as much as $20 billion of its existing bank debt, or one-fifth of the total now outstanding. Banks would have to take a write-off on their loans to Mexico but would get the benefit of higher interest rates on the new Mexican securities, on which principal (but not interest) is guaranteed by the United States bonds. Twenty-six months ago, when Mr. Baker articulated his earlier policy at Seoul, South Korea, it rested on the conviction that such debt relief was unnecessary. The idea was that countries following the right market-oriented policies would ''grow'' their way out of the debt crisis by attracting enough public and private capital to expand economic activity and pay off their loans. Banks were importuned to make new loans so that debtors could service old debt. But the old strategy began breaking down under an ever heavier debt load. Borrowers were reluctant to add new loans to their already crushing burdens. Instead of making new loans, lenders began to write off old ones, taking large losses in the process. More important, economic growth was not materializing or was barely keeping pace with population growth in such countries as Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru. Latin America's continued economic slump proved to be bad news not only for the third-world countries involved but also for the United States, where export growth was urgently needed to redress trade imbalances and stop the fall of the dollar. The earlier Baker Plan of October 1985 called for greater lending by commercial and multilateral development banks to third-world debtor countries adopting economic reforms. Although the commercial banks have cut their lending, the World Bank and other development banks have increased the flow of resources to many debt-burdened countries. Mr. Baker announced last September that the Administration would ask Congress in the coming year to back a big rise in capital for the World Bank to support its expanded lending program. The old strategy called for overall debt to increase; under the new stategy, debt would decline. In a process that other governments of creditor and debtor nations alike are expected to join, Mexico -for the first time since the debt crisis began in 1982 - now has a chance to reduce its overall debt and apply any interest saved to spurring economic growth. ''This will push in the direction of more debt reduction,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Harvard economics professor. ''The Treasury will have to do more because other debtor countries will increasingly follow this route and bargain for specific conversions of their foreign claims. It's an uncharted path.'' So far the plan has been well received in Congress, where several members expressed general sympathy with the concept but disappointment over the lack of consultations between the Administration and banking committee members in developing it. The announcement is ''an acknowledgment that it's useless to keep lending money to third-world nations just so those nations can turn the money around to the banks in the form of interest payments,'' said Charles S. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. But Bruce A. Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat who is also on the House Banking Committee, said he had any number of questions. He predicted early committee hearings at which Mr. Baker would be called upon to testify. One of his questions, Mr. Morrison said, is the extent to which the United States would become obligated if Mexico fails to meet interest payments. Although the Treasury bonds guarantee the principal of the marketable Mexican securities, they do not guarantee the interest. House and Senate Democrats have their own debt relief plan - a call upon the Treasury to negotiate an international debt management facility with other governments - which is now part of the omnibus trade bill that has cleared both chambers. The multilateral facility would sell bonds and use the proceeds to buy up third-world debt at discounted prices. Several Democrats said the Treasury plan was simply an effort to head off Congressional and market pressures.

1161-> Nixon, Dixon and Hart
Richard Nixon and Gary Hart have always been poles apart. Indeed, Mr. Hart managed George McGovern's 1972 campaign against Mr. Nixon and said revulsion with the Nixon Administration motivated his 1974 run for the Senate. Now a friend of Mr. Nixon has released correspondence that reveals an aspect of fraternity between the two men. It is a fraternity of denial of responsibility, of inability to say mea culpa. Mr. Nixon, who resigned his Presidency in disgrace, wrote to Mr. Hart on May 11, three days after the former Colorado Senator withdrew as a Democratic Presidential candidate because of reports about his having spent time with a young woman not his wife. Mr. Hart had ''handled a very difficult situation uncommonly well,'' wrote the former President. ''What you said about the media needed to be said,'' he added. He referred to Mr. Hart's parting declaration that he was ''angry and defiant'' at a system that ''reduces the press of this nation to hunter and Presidential candidates to being hunted.'' It reminded many people of Mr. Nixon's famous ''last press conference'' in 1962, in which he told reporters, ''You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.'' ''They [ the press ] demand to ruthlessly question the ethics of anyone else,'' Mr. Nixon wrote in his letter. ''But when anyone else dares to question their ethics, they hide behind the shield of freedom of speech.'' In his reply, Mr. Hart still refused to acknowledge that he had done the primary wrong to himself. Instead he spoke of a need to ''focus national attention away from what is temporal, sensational, and irrelevant to the real challenges confronting our nation and our world.'' In other words, what's really important are the issues, but the media is focused on irrelevancies, like Gary's Hart veracity and character. By apt coincidence, on the same day this correspondence was disclosed William Dixon, Mr. Hart's campaign manager, broke his silence about the abrupt end of the campaign and was able to say what Mr. Hart could not. ''He made a classic error,'' Mr. Dixon said. ''He knew his marriage was an issue, and he knew that he had to keep his conduct above suspicion and above reproach. But he didn't, and he and his family are paying deeply for it.'' Mr. Hart pays, but apparently without understanding why. Reporters, who can be relentless and tactless, are easy for a politician to kick around, even when a more deserving target is considerably closer to his own foot.

1162-> Cabbie in East Harlem Shot Dead by Gunman
A cabdriver was fatally shot yesterday by one of two gunmen who accosted him as he drove on a service road near the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive at 111th Street, the police said. The driver's name was withheld, pending notification to his family. A police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, said one of the men fired a handgun through an open window of the taxicab, striking the driver in the head at 6:30 P.M. As the cab sped off, a second shot ricocheted off the trunk of the cab and shattered the rear window. At 108th Street, the cab stopped, and the driver attracted the attention of a security guard, who summoned the police and an ambulance. The driver was taken to Metropolitan Hospital, where he died at 7 o'clock.

1163-> CONSUMER RATES; Yields Mixed For Week
Yields on certificates of deposit, money market mutual funds and bank money market accounts were mixed for the week ended yesterday, with short-term rates ending 1987 about one and a half percentage points higher than they finished in 1986. Predicting the direction of interest rates for the coming year will not be any easier than it was this year. But several factors may give investors some insight into the direction of rates, including the budget deficit, trade deficit, the dollar's value against other major currencies, and the price of oil; lower prices mean reduced fears of inflation and lower interest rates. At the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday this week - the auction is usually an influence on what banks and savings institutions pay their money market account and C.D. customers - the average discount rate for a three-month bill fell nearly a quarter of a percentage point from the previous auction, to 5.73 percent, while the six-month bill declined 16 basis points, to 6.32 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Yields for C.D.'s with longer maturities varied. A one-year C.D. dropped one basis point, to 7.57 percent. Two-and-a-half-year and five-year C.D.'s were up one basis point, to 8.01 percent and 8.50 percent, respectively. The Bank Rate Monitor's national index for the week reported the average yield for six-month C.D.'s up two basis points, to 7.25 percent, while bank money market accounts, which compete with the money market mutual funds, remained unchanged at 5.82 percent. Elswhere in the funds market, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said the seven-day taxable, compounded average yield for a money-market mutual fund was up nine basis points, to 6.92 percent for the week, one basis point shy of the 1987 record set on Oct. 20. The 30-day compounded average, which lags somewhat, was up eight basis points, to 6.79 percent. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios fell by three days, to 36 days - the fewest days since Sept. 12, 1984. Assets of taxable money-market funds decreased by $1.87 billion, to a total $243.5 billion. Institutional assets declined by $825 million, to $62.1 billion, while consumer assets fell by $1.05 billion, to $181.3 billion. Assets of tax-free funds, Donoghue's said, were off $825 million, to a total $62.1 billion for the week.

1165-> WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Democratic Anger
Democratic professionals are irked at Gary Hart and Joseph R. Biden Jr., not so much because they self-destructed as Democratic Presidential contenders, but because they blew away a potentially effective issue for the Democrats. With a cloud hanging over two of the party's most prominent point men, the Democrats would probably have a tough time labeling the current Republican Administration a school for scandal. Some Democratic strategists had hoped to make an issue of the problems of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Michael Deaver, the former deputy chief of staff at the White House, plus any Administration officials who might be indicted in the Iran-contra affair. But it will now be a lot harder to make the tar and feathers stick.

1166-> New York Ambulances Are Fewer, And Are Slower Answering Calls
Plagued by a deteriorating and aging fleet of ambulances, New York City's Emergency Medical Services is under severe strain and on a few nights this summer has been able to use barely half the vehicles its guidelines call for, officials at the agency said yesterday. City ambulance crews, largely as a result of maintenance problems and the cancellation earlier this year of a contract for new vehicles, are taking an average of 33 percent longer to get to emergencies than they did a year ago, the officials said. This increase - more than three minutes per call - follows six years in which the agency improved its response times. The Target: 10-Minute Response The city has set a target time of 10 minutes or less for response to life-threatening emergencies, said Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the parent agency of E.M.S. In May 1986, the average response time to the emergencies was 9 minutes, 53 seconds; in May 1987, it was 13 minutes, 26 seconds. ''Clearly a 13:26 is not where we want to be,'' Dr. Boufford said. ''We have a serious problem.'' She said the agency was taking several steps to reduce the response time. While E.M.S. has set a target of 124 vehicles available across the city to handle the busiest shift of the day, 4 P.M. to midnight, ''there have been many nights when we have dipped into the 90's, 80's and 70's,'' said Donna Osso, a spokeswoman for the agency. Problem Most Acute in Bronx Among the five boroughs, the problem is at its worst in the Bronx, where the average response time is 15 minutes, 31 seconds. The slow service there was the subject of a stern letter to the hospital agency from the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, who met with Dr. Boufford and other officials of the hospitals agency in his office yesterday. In the letter, he said response times in the Bronx have been ''horrendous.'' The officials said they were working on a plan to improve the service and said they would designate the first six of the new ambulances for service in the Bronx. All calls for medical help to 911, and the vast majority of all emergency ambulance runs in New York City, are handled by E.M.S. There are several private companies offering ambulances, but they are too expensive for most New Yorkers, and many of them handle only nonemergency patient transfers. Stein Resigns From Panel In a separate development, City Council President Andrew Stein said last night he would resign in frustration from a task force appointed by Mayor Koch earlier this year to address the rising response times of E.M.S. ''I'm resigning because I don't think it's done anything,'' Mr. Stein said. ''Since the task force was formed, there has been no movement in any meaningful way to correct an extremely serious situation.'' Mr. Stein issued a report several months ago that was highly critical of E.M.S. and included figures from other major cities indicating that their ambulance response times were well below those of New York. Those averages included 4 1/2 minutes for Seattle and Dallas, 5 minutes for San Francisco and 7 minutes for Chicago. Only Detroit, at 10 minutes, was on a par with New York. Purchase Arranged The agency, after calling ambulance dealerships across the country, has arranged an immediate purchase of up to four dozen vehicles that have shorter warranties and less sophisticated equipment than the 117 ambulances that were to have been purchased under a $10.5 million contract that was canceled earlier this year after several city officials questioned whether the designated supplier had been improperly favored. The agency has since put out requests for bids on a new contract covering 100 custom-built vehicles -as opposed to the out-of-the-showroom ambulances it will be receving soon -and has received responses from three companies. But it will not receive the first of the ambulances under that contract until next January at the earliest. For the last several months, the purchase of new ambulances has been tied up because of an inquiry by the City Investigation Department into how the Health and Hospitals Corporation had contracted for ambulances since 1980. Last month, the department announced that it had found no evidence of criminality but that the agency's contracting methods had raised ''an array of legal, managerial and policy issues which warrant close scrutiny.'' Advertising Is Planned Among other emergency measures, the agency has been dispatching medical technicians in vans and station wagons and plans to begin an advertising campaign telling people to call E.M.S. only for serious injuries or illnesses. Mr. Ferrer said a supervising mechanic for E.M.S. had told his aides that the maintenance staff had sometimes been ordered to release vehicles that were unsafe and to defer or cancel preventive maintenance. Officials for the corporation denied that unsafe vehicles were being allowed on the streets. The Borough President said that at 11:30 P.M. last Friday, at least 37 Bronx emergencies were left waiting for long periods, with 18 of the people waiting 99 minutes or more. Among the cases were those of a person suffering internal bleeding who waited for 75 minutes, a woman in labor and a seizure victim - who each waited nearly two hours - and an auto accident victim who waited 42 minutes for help to arrive. Dr. Boufford said the agency was working to correct such problems but that cases such as the ones cited by Mr. Ferrer's staff were ''certainly not common.'' Miss Osso of E.M.S. said the problems in providing service have been exacerbated by several factors, including an increase in the number of calls: in May of this year, the latest month for which statistics are available, E.M.S. received 39,111 ''priority one,'' or life-threatening calls. In May 1986, the number was 34,525. Among other problems is an increase of nearly a minute in the average ''cycle,'' or time that a medical staff spends with a patients. E.M.S. officials attributed this increase to backlogs in hospital emergency rooms, which force the ambulance staff to remain longer with patients. The ambulances are stationed at hospitals and E.M.S. garages and are dispatched through a computer network. The ''life expectancy'' of the ambulances - which are routinely driven 3,000 miles a month or more - is generally five years and about 50 in the fleet are close to that age, Miss Osso said. The total number of the vehicles in the fleet is 168.

1167-> Debt Plan: 3-Way View
The plan to help Mexico reduce its foreign-debt burden depends on providing benefits to all of the parties involved. Mexico's view: To pay off its existing bank loans at less than face value, Mexico will issue new bonds paying a higher rate of interest than the old debt. If banks accept 50 cents on the dollar to retire the old debt, the country can retire $20 billion of old loans by issuing $10 billion of new bonds. And the United States Treasury bonds that are part of the plan will be sold to Mexico at a big discount to compensate for the fact that, unlike most bonds, they will pay no interest during the 20 years before they mature. (At maturity the principal will be paid.) Therefore, Mexico can buy these zero-coupon bonds with a face value of $10 billion for only $2 billion at this time. Banks' view: The new Mexican bonds will be much more acceptable than the present debt because they will be backed by a comparable amount of the United States Treasury bonds, reducing the banks' risk. If Mexico defaults on its own bonds, the banks can claim the Treasury bonds. Treasury's view: The transaction costs it nothing because Mexico buys the United States Treasury bonds being pledged as collateral. Since the bonds pay no interest, the Treasury's only payment is the principal due when the bonds mature after 20 years.

1169-> FUTURES/OPTIONS; Merc's Price Limit Plan Dismays Many Traders
In a move that surprised and dismayed many futures traders, board members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange voted late Wednesday to install daily price ranges on its widely used Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures contract. The Merc's decision, which must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, could be put into effect within a month, Leo Melamed, special counsel to the exchange, said in a telephone interview yesterday. The limits imposed by the Merc are broad - 12 points in either direction for the Standard & Poor's index, a move that would amount to about 94 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. Still, traders were unhappy about the decision, saying it would not only inject a new element of risk into the market, but could also drive up the price of trading big blocks. 'It Will Increase the Risk' Courtney Smith, director of futures trading at the Twenty-First Securities Corporation in New York, said: ''I don't like it. It will increase the risk in the stock market, because when the futures market goes to the limit, block traders or major institutions will not have the ability to hedge their risk.'' Market participants speculated yesterday that the Merc's action was taken to satisfy regulators and legislators who have grown increasingly agitated by the volatility that spills from the futures market to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. However, Mr. Melamed said that was not the case. ''There was no pressure from Washington to do this,'' he said, ''and it is not in response to volatility or to program trading. What this stems from is our own view of what happens in the pits and to the market, when it moves to an extreme point in one direction. At those times, there is a lack of bids and offers flowing to the market, which results in large price gaps.'' Mr. Melamed said the limits would be in place for about a year, to see if they have ''a positive effect.'' Limits Were Tried Before This is the second time the Merc has imposed price limits on its S & P 500 futures index contract. For several months after its introduction in 1982, the contract carried a five-point daily price limit. Rising competition from other stock index futures contracts, none of which traded with price limits, was among the reasons the Merc decided to lift the limit. The new limits voted by the Merc's board will be in effect for two consecutive trading days. ''If the limits are reached for two straight days, there will be no limit the third day,'' Mr. Melamed said. ''That would allow the cash market to catch up.'' Officials from rival exchanges expressed surprise at the Merc's decision, and said they had no plans to follow its lead by imposing price limits on their contracts.

1170-> U.S. Reports 18% Rise in '85 In White-Collar Convictions
The number of Federal convictions for white-collar crimes rose 18 percent in 1985, as against 1980, while the length of prison sentences for such offenders rose 20 percent in the same period, according to a Federal report. The report, issued Sunday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that 10,733 defendants were convicted of Federal white-collar crimes - such as fraud, embezzlement, forgery, counterfeiting and regulatory offenses - in 1985, up about 1,600 from 1980. Federal convictions of non-white-collar crimes rose 43 percent in 1985, compared with 1980, to about 30,000. The average length of a prison sentence for a white-collar criminal rose to 29 months in 1985, up 20 percent from 1980, the report said. The average length of a prison sentence for other types of Federal criminals was 50 months in 1985, about the same as it was in 1980. Over all, the bureau found that white-collar criminals were less likely than other types of criminals to be sentenced to prison. Incarceration Rate Constant Forty percent of convicted white-collar criminals were sentenced to prison in 1985, as against 54 percent of the non-white-collar criminals in the same year. The incarceration rate for white-collar criminals in 1985 was about the same as in 1980. Other types of Federal offenders were more than twice as likely as white-collar criminals to receive sentences of more than five years. Tax fraud convictions of organized crime figures and drug dealers contributed to the trend of somewhat longer sentences for white-collar criminals. The study cited an 86 percent increase in the average length of prison sentences given to those convicted of tax fraud from 1980 to 1985, up from 11 months to 21 months. Counterfeiters were the white-collar criminals most likely to be sentenced to prison - 59 percent in 1985 - and they received the longest average sentences among white-collar criminals, 40 months. Of the white-collar convictions two years ago, 55 percent were for fraud, 19 percent for forgery, 16 percent for embezzlement, 5 percent for counterfeiting and 5 percent for white-collar regulatory offenses. Nader Assails Report Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, said the report did not focus properly on white-collar crime. ''Although this report is a step forward in compiling white-collar crime statistics, the Justice Department has continued to ignore far more serious corporate crime - pollution, bank fraud, defense fraud,'' Mr. Nader said. He said the report touches on corporate crime only in listing regulatory offenses, which amount to 5 percent of the total number of Federal white-collar crimes. The number of regulatory offense convictions went down 19 percent, declining to 491 in 1985, from 609 in 1980, according to the study. The researchers concluded that financial losses due to white-collar crime dwarf the amounts lost through other types of crime. The report said in 1985, 140 people were charged with Federal white-collar crimes estimated to involve more than $1 million each and 64 others were charged with offenses involving more than $10 million each. Meanwhile, total bank robbery losses were less than $19 million and all robbery losses reported to the police amounted to slightly more than $300 million.

1171-> Roger L. Nichols Dies; Led a Boston Museum
Roger L. Nichols, president and director of the Boston Museum of Science since 1982, died of a heart attack Thursday morning. He was 61 years old. Dr. Nichols supervised a major expansion of the Museum of Science, opening a new wing in March that contains a $14 million Omnimax theater. Under his leadership, the museum began new educational programs, sponsored major exhibits on India and China and saw its attendance almost double, to 1.5 million annually. Before coming to the museum, Dr. Nichols was a professor of microbiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. He helped plan a new medical school in Saudi Arabia and a general hospital in Qatar. Dr. Nichols leaves his wife, Elinor, and three children: Quaife, a members of the Peace Corps in Swaziland; Kathleen, an attorney living in Izmir, Turkey, and Wendy, an instructor at Polytechnic Institute in Bahrain.

1173-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Ends Session Mixed; Gold Prices Broadly Lower
The dollar was mixed in quiet trading yesterday. Gold prices fell. The Republic National Bank of New York at 4 P.M. quoted gold at $483.40 an ounce, down $3.05 from late Tuesday. ''The fear has gone out of the dollar market - and it has stabilized,'' said Bob Bannon, an analyst at the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. But like other analysts, he warned, ''That isn't going to last very long.'' Mr. Bannon said the stability was ''only numerical'' because too many traders were out of the market because of the holidays. Once activity resumes in January, he said, the dollar will probably come under new pressure. In the last two sessions, the dollar was bolstered by some central bank intervention, analysts said. But it was ''not in large amounts,'' Mr. Bannon said. ''There's no firmness in what the central banks are doing,'' he added. In Japan, the dollar remained at Tuesday's 123.50-yen level. In London, the dollar was trading at 123.52 yen. Later in New York, the dollar stood at 123.32 yen, down from 123.45. A British pound cost $1.8565 in London late yesterday, nearly half a cent cheaper than late Tuesday's $1.8610. In New York, a pound cost $1.8582, compared with $1.8606 Tuesday. Other late New York rates for the dollar, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.5950 West German marks, up from 1.5940; 1.2905 Swiss francs, up from 1.2885; 5.3995 French francs, down from 5.4035; 1,176.50 Italian lire, down from 1,177.50, and 1.3020 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3053. Other late European rates for the dollar, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.5955 West German marks, unchanged; 1.2920 Swiss francs, up from 1.2885; 5.4125 French francs, up from 5.4025; 1,178.50 Italian lire, up from 1,176.00, and 1.3048 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3045. At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $482.70 a troy ounce, down $3.40 from Tuesday. Earlier in London, gold closed at $484 a troy ounce, down from $486, and at $484.50 in Zurich, down from $487.50. In Hong Kong, gold closed at $487.34, down from $488.84. DOLLAR SLIDES IN TOKYO TOKYO, Thursday, Dec. 31 (AP) -The dollar plunged in afternoon trading on the Tokyo foreign exchange market today, shattering the 122-yen level for the first time despite heavy central bank intervention. After opening at 123.30 yen, the dollar closed the morning trading session at 122.55 yen. By early afternoon the dollar plummetted to 121.85 yen, the lowest level in Tokyo since foreign exchange rates were set up in the late 1940s. Traders estimated that the Bank of Japan spent about $500 million today in its effort to support the dollar. Because of the New Year's holiday, today's session was the last until Monday.

1174-> CURRENTS; Design Pundits on the Highs and Lows of '87
ON the occasion of the final day of the year, some leading designers were invited to cogitate on the highs and lows, ups and downs of design in 1987. WALTER BERNARD,graphics designer, New York. The television show ''thirtysomething.'' It has an interesting visual approach. It's inventively filmed and brilliantly designed. The redesign of the 1988 Jaguar. It's changed so fast it's got a bad case of the bends. It ignores ineffable British elegance and refusal to respond to trendiness. RON REZEK, lighting designer, Los Angeles. The absence of outstanding trends impressed me. The only trend I really like is the growing awareness of the Sante Fe or Spanish style. The American consumer-product industry still lacks courage. We're still in the wood-grain era of the 1950's. I wish the American appliance business would take the kind of lead the Ford Company has taken with their automobiles. STANLEY TIGERMAN, architect, Chicago. The best thing about 1987 was that it was still a romantic time. There was a little modernism, a little post-modernism, deconstructivism, all of it showing an openness which doesn't exist in Europe. I find America's openness optimistic. The ''Palladian pasties'' on Philip Johnson's new building in Boston. They have nothing to do with original formal motifs of the design. ANDREE PUTMAN, interior and furniture designer, Paris. The new Institute of the Arab World in Paris is amazingly beautiful. It's the event of the year. I think this was the last year for nouvelle cuisine, thank God. It's not food; it's landscape, made to be framed, not eaten. MILTON GLASER, graphics designer, New York. The Musee d'Orsay by Gae Aulenti. The redesign of Dolly Parton. JAY SPECTRE, interior designer, New York. The sets for the Broadway musical ''Anything Goes.'' They were simple, direct, and created the right atmosphere for a 1930's show done in 1987. Also the sets, and especially Michael Douglas's office, in the movie ''Wall Street'' were nothing short of a marvel. The new women's clothes, which make it impossible to get a coat on or get in and out of automobiles. They're unrealistic and uncomfortable, the equivalent of overfringed, overchintzed interior design. MICHAEL VANDERBYL, graphics designer, San Francisco. The Taurus automobile by Ford. It's a winner to me as a designer because it shows that if something is truly design-driven, it can actually sell. It's a design that acknowledged that the public is a lot smarter than marketing executives give them credit for. The ''Made in U.S.A.'' promotional campaign. The logo looked like a stitched patch and didn't reflect the quality of design in the U.S. today. Also, the idea of using Don Johnson to promote this idea doesn't wash. All the guy does on his show is wear Gianni Versace. JOHN SALADINO, interior designer, New York. I was very impressed by the recent classical revival buildings designed by Quinlan Terry at Oxford University in England, edifices that draw their power from understatement. The Philippe Starck chair with the cone-shaped leg. It looks like a rhinoceros tusk. It's not inviting.

1175-> MEN'S STYLE; TO SEW A FINE SEAM
MY CONCEPT OF A major capital expenditure,'' Jack McDonald jokes, ''is a quill pen or used abacus.'' The president of Oxxford Clothes likes to boast that he makes his products in a similarly anachronistic fashion, that is, by hand, much as they were 20 years ago when he joined the company. ''About the only place in our suits that we use a machine,'' says Mr. McDonald with unconcealed pride, ''is in straight-line sewing - that's seams.'' Although such clothes makers as Oxxford, Alfred Dunhill and Norman Hilton have never altogether dispensed with hand-tailoring, others have more recently resurrected the craft. The Italian men's-wear designer Mila Schon's ready-made and made-to-order clothing feature sleeves, collars and trouser waists set in by hand. Detailing is also a hallmark of the Americans Alan Flusser, Garrick Anderson and Ralph Lauren, whose Made-By-Hand collection is just that - cut, stitched, shaped and fitted by individual artisans. This spring, Alexander Julian reinstated his hand-tailored line for the first time in a half-dozen years. Such developments have raised the spirits of at least one longtime style observer. ''It's wonderful,'' says Derrill Osborn, vice president and divisional merchandise manager of men's clothing for Neiman-Marcus, ''to hear our young designers say, 'Hey, something is missing; let's go back to more romantic times and put some of the quality back into our clothing.' '' This sort of enthusiasm is behind the store's decision to enter the field with its own hand-tailored collection, sold under the Marcus label. Like other purveyors of quality clothing, Neiman's has substantially increased its handmade business, from about 40 percent three years ago to 65 percent today. Paul Stuart, the Manhattan clothier, has been similarly alert to a stepped-up demand, nearly doubling inventory of its Stuart's Choice hand-tailored suits for fall. If hand-tailoring has not experienced a full-blown renaissance in recent years, it has nevertheless regained cachet, particularly in the eyes of younger men. Walter B. D. Hickey Jr., chairman of Hickey-Freeman, a maker of fine tailored clothing, calls them ''sophisticated consumers.'' ''When they go out to buy a BMW,'' he says, ''they are aware of such factors as cubic-inch displacement and tire size; we believe they bring a comparable expertise to the way they buy their clothes.'' For example, they have learned to look for evidence of handwork at a garment's stress points: around the collar, armholes, buttonholes and other locations that require hand-sewing's superior strength and flexibility. Handwork is ''meaningful,'' says Martin Greenfield, who makes suits for Mr. Julian and Mr. Flusser, at every point ''where you need movement and comfort.'' This is especially so at the juncture of collar and neck, at the gorge line (where collar and facing meet), at the shoulders, armholes and trouser waist. A hand-stitched chest piece allows the fabric to maintain its softness and resiliency. In addition, a suit may be hand-pressed with small irons to permit the meticulous shaping of armholes and other curves, and cut with shears to insure that plaids or stripes are matched at seams. The price of a handmade suit tends to run about 20 percent higher than its machine-sewn counterpart. Fashioned by specially trained craftsmen, whose numbers have diminshed over the years, its construction can take six weeks or more, compared with about six hours for the machine-made variety. Yet many clients readily pay a premium for a carefully tailored garment that is pliant enough to conform to their own body contours. If some subtle irregularities do arise, so be it. Stitches of a slightly uneven length or tension are not uncommon, and, to some minds, may even be desirable. ''Hand-tailoring is not perfect in every respect,'' admits Gary Gumingo, merchandise manager for Sims Ltd., an exclusive Minneapolis men's shop. ''But that is part of its charm.'' rrxh Top left: Summer-weight wool suit from Alfred Dunhill, $995, is hand-sewn at the stress points. At Alfred Dunhill, 620 Fifth Avenue.

1177-> Bribery Indictment Against Friedman and Two Others Is Reinstated
A grand jury in Manhattan has reinstated bribery and conspiracy charges against Stanley M. Friedman, the former Bronx political leader, and two other men in connection with a plan to sell computers to the New York National Guard, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said yesterday. The original indictment, issued in January, was dismissed last month after the trial judge found ''a multiplicity of defects'' in the presentation to the grand jury by the prosecutor. The new indictment, handed up last week but made public yesterday, names the same defendants and charges as the first one. In addition to Mr. Friedman it names Marvin B. Kaplan, the president of Citisource Inc., the company that was to manufacture the computers, and Bernard G. Ehrlich, a former major general of the Guard, who was charged with receiving the bribes. All three pleaded not guilty to the first indictment. They are to be arraigned on the new charges today in State Supreme Court in Mineola, L.I., before Acting Justice Marie G. Santagata. Inadmissable Testimony Justice Santagata, who is assigned to Nassau County and is on special assignment to serve on the case in Manhattan, said in her decision last month that the grand jurors had been given erroneous legal explanations by the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney John Moscow, and that a ''crucial'' witness in the first presentation had provided inadmissable testimony. Although the identity of that witness was not made public in the judge's decision, it was believed to be Geoffrey G. Lindenauer, a former New York City parking official whose cooperation with the authorities became pivotal in the municipal corruption investigations last year. Prosecutors, citing grand jury secrecy laws, declined to say specifically whether Mr. Lindenauer had appeared before the second panel, or to say whether Mr. Moscow presented any new witnesses. However, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, Bridget G. Brennan, said, ''The judge ruled that as a matter of law the testimony was not admissable, and we have re-presented in a manner which we believe comported with the judge's decision.'' Additional 'Overt Actions' The new indictment includes what the prosecutors call additional ''overt actions'' by the defendants, specifically meetings that were held with attorneys who were not named and the exchange of certain documents that were not mentioned in the first indictment. Mr. Friedman and Mr. Kaplan were among four men who were convicted last fall of Federal racketeering charges in a trial in New Haven stemming from the New York City corruption scandals. Mr. Friedman and Mr. Kaplan have been sentenced to prison and have filed appeals. Mr. Lindenauer, a former deputy director of the city's Parking Violations Bureau, pleaded guilty last year in a separate bribery case involving a contract to sell the same handheld computers to the parking bureau. According to Justice Santagata's decision, the contested testimony was not allowable because it did not address the central charges in the case.

1178-> VINEYARD AIM: OSPREY IN EVERY YARD
A few weeks before the laden station wagons of summer begin bumping on to Martha's Vineyard in earnest, the shoregrounds of the island are already filled with the keening cacophony of early arrivals. It is the voice of the osprey, seldom heard by Vineyarders over the centuries but now coming into its own here. The presence of the graceful, white-bellied hawk is largely due to an osprey program begun several years ago by Gus Ben David, director of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary on the island. Through his program, dozens of oceanside landowners have put up artificial nesting poles. ''Everyone and his uncle wants an osprey pole,'' said Alan Poole, an osprey researcher at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole across Vineyard Sound. Vineyarders contribute the cost of erecting a 30-to-40 foot pole on their property, then are rewarded when a pair of ospreys settle in. That can require patient waiting. The author John Hersey put up a pole two summers ago, and it is still vacant. But Mr. Hersey continues to wait, hoping, he says, to see close up ''that spectacular waiting in air for a fish, folding of wings, going down, and coming up with one.'' 'Very Friendly Birds' Joe and Mary Cressy, on the other hand, were so thrilled by how quickly their new pole attracted a breeding pair last summer that they rigged up an indoor mirror that permitted them to watch the ospreys without going out of the house. ''They're very friendly, very social birds,'' said Mary Cressy. ''I've never seen them harass anything, though seagulls and crows harass them.'' ''Wildlife depends on the private landowner,'' Mr. Ben David said in an interview. A bird lover and indefatigable naturalist, as well as a third-generation Vineyarder who knows every inch of the island, Mr. Ben David regards the co-habitation of man and nature as an all important challenge, especially on a 101-square-mile island that attracts 88,000 people in summer. Active nests are now atop all but a few of the program's 64 platform-topped poles on both private and preserved lands. Last year, 57 poles housed 38 pairs of ospreys and 71 of their young. Mr. Ben David, who takes an inventory in July when newborn chicks are big enough to be seen and counted, estimates the total Vineyard osprey population is growing at an annual rate of five to seven pairs. In the 1940's, 1,000 osprey pairs populated the coastline from New York City to Boston, Dr. Poole said, but the Vineyard's known osprey population has never amounted to more than three pairs at any one time. For Breeding or Housekeeping What was missing, Mr. Ben David said, was a necessary component of the osprey life cycle: The flat, wind-scourged island does not have the lofty treetops or peaks for breeding or ''housekeeping'' from March, when the birds fly north from Central and South America, to September. Mated pairs build their nests, establish their territory, and put off breeding until their return to the same nest another summer. The few ospreys the Vineyard attracted often made the mistake of nesting on power lines. ''The linesmen kept knocking down the nests, keeping the numbers at a low status quo,'' recalled Mr. Ben David, whose boyhood dream of running a wildlife farm came true in 1969 when he became the first director of Felix Neck, one of 17 sanctuaries of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. Late in 1970, a gale toppled a great pitch pine containing one of the island's two nests. ''That was the final straw,'' said Mr. Ben David, who began the osprey program the next year. Then came the ban of the destructive pesticide DDT, which Dr. Poole said had reduced the osprey population along the Manhattan to Boston shores to about 90 pairs. Rise to 348 Pairs Since the DDT ban, Dr. Poole estimates the osprey population in the region has grown 10 percent each year. Last summer, 348 pairs of ospreys were counted along the same coastline. Artificial nesting poles are not new; in earlier times, cart wheels atop poles were used. But Mr. Ben David said his pressure-treated version withstood hurricanes better than most. He says his program is aided by the Commonwealth Electric Company, which provides some of the poles and wood pieces used for the nesting platforms, and which sends a line truck to the rescue when a pole cannot be raised by hand. Because osprey pairs return to the same vicinity, often to the same nest summer after summer, the Vineyard's population should keep expanding - to what proportions, no one is quite sure. ''Some people wonder if I haven't created a monster,'' said Mr. Ben David. But because ospreys are keenly territorial, he thinks the population will find its own limits at around 100 pairs. Meanwhile, Mr. Ben David's aim is to keep the population growing, and this includes nightly patrols of the island's power lines in the spring to make sure transformers are not used for nests. At each trouble spot, Commonwealth Electric affixes what Mr. Ben David affixes what he calls a ''vertical deterrent,'' a piece of pipe that discourages future nesting attempts. Mr. Ben David shares his home on Felix Neck with two daughters, two sons, one bald eagle, one golden eagle and a variety of snakes, pigeons and hawks.

1179-> Jacob Heller, Lawyer For Garage Group, 82
Jacob R. Heller, an attorney who represented the Metropolitan Garage Owners Association for 40 years, died last Thursday at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Florida after a brief illness. He was 82 years old and lived in Rockville Centre, L.I., and in Royal Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Heller, who graduated in 1926 graduate from New York University Law School, started representing the garage owners in the 1940's. As general counsel and executive vice president he became chief management negotiator in contract negotiations between the garage workers and the association, known also as the Metropolitan Garage Board of Trade. The group represents the owners of about 650 parking garages and lots. Mr. Heller is survived by his wife, the former Lillian Frankfeldt; a son, Hugh, of South Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Stephanie Sorley of Westport, Conn., and five grandchildren.

1180-> Uncertainty on Horizon as Italians Vote Today
Italians will vote Sunday in a parliamentary election that many people predict will open a period of uncertainty and shifting coalitions after almost four years of stability under the Socialist-led Government of Bettino Craxi. As a desultory 40-day campaign wound up, Ciriaco De Mita, leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, said the elections could bring the Communist Party to power for the first time in Italy's postwar history. ''The stakes are very high,'' said Mr. De Mita, fearful that large abstentions could hurt his party. ''Never has the alternative of the left been as near as it is in these elections.'' Although an array of big and small parties are competing for the support of 45.6 million eligible voters, the election has become a highly personalized contest between Mr. De Mita and the more forceful Mr. Craxi, both of whom aspire to be the next prime minister. 'Never Say Never' To reach his goal, Mr. De Mita must at least equal or improve the 32.9 percent popular vote share won by the Christian Democrats in 1983, according to most politicians and commentators. The Christian Democrats have been the cornerstone of every Italian Government since the war. Mr. Craxi, who precipitated the elections by refusing to cede the prime minister's job to his Christian Democrat coalition partners, has remained ambiguous about his intentions, turning away queries as to whether he would entertain a coalition with the Communists with a Delphic ''never say never'' retort. He has repeatedly said he would not accept the Christian Democrats' ''hegemony'' over Italian politics. But his goal is thought to be to increase his Socialists' 11.4 percent of the vote from the last election in 1983 and to humiliate Mr. De Mita, forcing the Christian Democrats to replace him with a more malleable figure. In the midst of the campaign, the Foreign Minister, Giulio Andreotti, and 38 other Christian Democrats distanced themselves from Mr. De Mita by making public a manifesto that urged maintaining ''a dialogue with the lay and Socialist forces.'' The Economy Surged On the campaign trial, Mr. Craxi, a tall and imperious man, has reminded the voters that under his leadership Italy's voice was heard and heeded abroad and that the country's economy surged ahead of England's. This assertion is disputed by some economists. A period of instability would be unwelcome for the Italian economy, which has begun to slow down. It could also make the passage of the 1988 budget, which must be approved by December, a problematic exercise. The Communist Party, which won 29.9 percent of the vote in 1983, has openly demanded the formation of a leftist coalition in which it would be the largest component. Communist Party's Goal But the Communists' principal goal is to avoid an erosion of their support, which in the last two national elections has tumbled from a postwar high of 34.4 percent in 1976. To broaden its appeal, the party has included several independents on its lists, including businessmen, feminists, ecologists and homosexuals. The campaign has been devoid of overriding issues and has centered largely on the personalities of the party leaders. The election has become such dull news that for the last two weeks it has been relegated to the inside pages of most newspapers while Italians turned their attention to the gathering of industrial democracies in Venice, a 3-1 soccer triumph over Argentina and a Frank Sinatra concert in Palermo. A Seaside Government? Italy now has a caretaker Government headed by a 79-year-old Christian Democrat, Amintore Fanfani. Already, there are predictions that a confused outcome of this election could leave him presiding over what is called a ''governo balneare,'' or ''seaside government,'' while politicians squabble and Italians head off on vacation for the summer.

1181-> N.F.L.; Redskins Beat Cowboys, 24-20
The Washington Redskins, who struggled all year to win the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference, fulfilled the admonition of their coach, Joe Gibbs, to peak toward the end of the season and played one of their best games of the season today, defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20. The Cowboys, who fell out of playoff contention, saw their record fall to 5-8, which means that they will go through their second losing year in a row, the first time this has happened since 1963-64. This is no longer the squad that angered rivals by styling itself ''America's Team.'' The players are quarreling among themselves and the owner is expressing regret he bought the team. ''We had low times in the 1970's and we're down now,'' Coach Tom Landry said after the game when asked if the Cowboys had ever been lower. When he said he was looking toward a much improved team next year, Landry was asked whether he thought he would be back as the coach. ''I hope so,'' he answered. ''I intend to.'' Game Loses Glitter The Dallas game usually is the one that captures Washington's attention. But not this year. The Redskins, though 10-3 now, had been flat, and the Cowboys have played poorly. The Redskins' talkative defensive end, Dexter Manley, captured that mood when he said last week, only partly in jest, that he was annoyed at the attention everyone was paying to the meeting of President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. A Washington-Dallas game, he complained, ought to be regarded as more crucial than a mere summit of superpowers. The Redskins' quarterback, Jay Schroeder, began the game with the erratic passes that had led to his benching earlier in the season. Of his first four passes, three, all to Gary Clark, were overthrown. But Schroeder soon got another chance. After a punt, Herschel Walker, the Dallas running back, fumbled, and the Redskins took possession on the Dallas 25-yard line. Schroeder then threw a pass that Clark took to the 1-yard line. George Rogers carried it in from there. When Dallas next got the ball, it drove downfield but settled for a 22-yard field goal by Roger Ruzek. Eager to Boo Schroeder The full house of fans at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium seemed eager to boo Schroeder. In the second period, Schroeder overthrew Ricky Sanders. and the quarterback heard shouts of disapproval. He countered that on the next play, throwing a pass to Clark that was good for 46 yards and leading to a 31-yard field goal by Ali Haji-Sheikh that made the score 10-3. The Redskins increased their lead to 17-3 with a 56-yard touchdown pass from Schroeder to Clark. Clark had a very good day, with nine receptions for 187 yards, catching passes for 100 yards or more for the third game in a row and the fifth time in the 10 games he has played in this season. Like all other Redskins, Clark did not play in the three games during the strike. In the second half, Schroeder connected on a 47-yard pass to Sanders, and Rogers followed by running for another 1-yard touchdown to make it 24-3. Late in the third quarter, following a field goal, Dallas drew to within 11 points as the Cowboys' quarterback, Danny White, threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to his wide receiver, Mike Renfro. Summing Up the Frustration In the fourth quarter, a play occurred that practically summed up the season-long frustration of the Cowboys. White threw a pass that a Redskin defensive back, Barry Wilburn, seemed to have intercepted, but the officials on the field ruled it incomplete. After a long review, the officials who examine the television replay tapes ruled that Wilburn had caught the ball, and the Redskins were given possession. Landry, on the sidelines, wore a stunned expression on his face. Tex Schramm, the president of the team, who was seated in the press box, shook his head from side to side in frustration. With 2:49 remaining, the Cowboys drew to 4 points down on White's 5-yard touchdown pass to Rod Barksdale. For White, who has been struggling through a dismal season, it was the 154th touchdown pass of his career, surpassing the club record set by Roger Staubach, the quarterback of many of the Cowboys' glory years.

1182-> WEEK IN BUSINESS; Shearson-Hutton: The Deal Is Done
Shearson bought Hutton for $962 million in a deal that will, by some measures, create the securities industry's largest firm. For example, the combined sales forces will number 12,300, about 800 more than at Merrill Lynch, the industry leader. The Hutton brokers' jobs were believed to be largely secure but there will undoubtedly be layoffs elsewhere to eliminate duplication. Estimates of the number of jobs to be cut ranged as high as 6,000. It was unclear if the Hutton name would be retained. Hutton had put itself on the block Nov. 23 and several firms made inquiries. But Shearson quickly became the only real contender and worked out a deal with Peter V. Ueberroth, the baseball commissioner who is also a director of Hutton. Shearson's appetite for acquisitions apparently isn't satisfied. Company officials confirmed that Shearson was close to an agreement to buy the L.F. Rothschild securities firm. * Paine Webber took on a partner from Japan. Yasuda Mutual Life agreed to pay $300 million for an equity stake of up to 25 percent in the firm. The deal bolsters Paine Webber's capital base, improves its access to the Japanese market and will probably deter hostile takeover attempts. Yasuda, Japan's seventh-largest insurer, gets access to American investment expertise. * Contracts on the space station were awarded to Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, General Electric and Rockwell. The initial work will cost about $5 billion and could provide up to 12,000 jobs. The entire project is pegged as high as $14 billion, but some doubts were expressed about whether the Government would provide that much. Martin Marietta was the biggest loser in the competition on which contractors had spent millions. * The German central bank cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by a half-point, to 2.5 percent, a record low. The move came after weeks of American pressure but it also reflected growing concern in Bonn about the falling dollar, which threatens West Germany's crucial export industries. Other European central banks quickly made cuts of their own. On the currency markets, the dollar did strengthen after the announcment but not as much as many traders had hoped. * The words ''bear market'' were heard frequently as Wall Street seemed to give up any hope that the October plunge might have been some sort of aberration. Two days of hefty losses pushed the Dow back near its Black Monday low and other measures of the market went below their October troughs. Perhaps most discouraging was the reaction to such supposedly good news as the European interest-rate cuts - the Dow dropped more than 70 points that day. For the week the Dow Jones industial average lost 143.74 points, or 7.5 percent, to close at 1,766.74. The October low was 1,738.74. Bonds had small gains, benefiting from the flow of money out of the stock market. Gold, which had been flirting with the $500-an-ounce level, pulled back to about $480. * Pan Am and its pilots struck a deal that could stymie other unions' efforts to find a buyer for the company and depose management. The pilots agreed to $55 million a year in concessions in return for a stake in the company. The flight engineers later reached an agreement that also granted concessions. The settlements came as Pan Am's board pondered a takeover effort by Braniff, which had been working with a coalition of unions. The pilots were said to have broken with the coalition because they were worried about how they would fare under Braniff. * Housing sales and prices fell in October, the Government reported. The number of new homes sold fell 1.5 percent, to an annual rate of 657,000 units. The median price of a new home nationwide declined 5.5 percent, to $104,000. The price had peaked in September at $110,000. There were sharp regional variations, with the Northeast and South posting big declines while the Midwest showed strength. Disappointing November sales were reported by most big retailers. Sales at Sears, the industry giant, were only seven-tenths of 1 percent higher than in November of 1986. But Detroit bucked the trend, reporting a surprise 9.9 percent gain in vehicle sales in November's final 10 days. * The leading indicators fell two- tenths of 1 percent in October, dragged down by the stock market plunge. The production and employment factors continued to show strength, and six of the index's nine available components were positive. The September figure was revised from a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent to unchanged, so the index has not had an advance in two months. But analysts said that alone does not portend a slowdown. Better news came from the unemployment figures. The November jobless rate fell one-tenth of 1 percent, to 5.8 percent. * The Southland buyout plan was sweetened with stock-purchase warrants. The original financing foundered early last month when investors, made cautious by the stock market collapse, grew leery of junk bonds. In addition to junk bonds, the new package gives investors the right to buy common stock in Southland after five years. The bonds have yields in excess of 15 percent. * Miscellanea. The head of the United Nations said the organization will have to start borrowing in the financial markets next year to avoid insolvency . . . Gannett bought television stations in Greensboro, N.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., from Harte-Hanks for $155 million . . . Kraft Inc. put its Duracell battery business up for sale, and analysts estimated that the price would be $1 billion to $1.2 billion.

1184-> METS SETTING OUT TO OVERCOME THE ODDS
Act Two opens tonight in Shea Stadium, with Dwight Gooden pitching against Bill Gullickson of the Cincinnati Reds and with just 75 games left for the Mets to head off the great collapse of 1987. Even for a team that captivated the country by its power of revival in the playoff and World Series last year, the numbers are stark. One year ago, at the break for the All-Star Game, the Mets had a record of 59 victories and 25 losses, they were 13 games in front in the National League's East, they were rolling toward total success. But at the break this year, they have won 47 games and lost 40, and they are nine and a half games behind the surging St. Louis Cardinals. That is a swing of 22 1/2 games in the standings, and it is the measure of the hard times that struck the Mets in the first half of the season and of the hard challenges that face them in the second half. They must, Davey Johson warns, ''come out smoking'' to save themselves. To do that, the Mets must solve two problems. One is the Cardinals, who are opening their second half tonight in San Diego. Two weeks ago, the Mets took two of three games from them in New York, drew within five games of first place and seemed in hot pursuit. But, since then, the Cardinals have won 10 of 11 games and widened their lead to almost runaway lengths. If they win only half their remaining games, they will close with 94 victories. The Mets would have to play .627 ball just to catch them. Pitching Still Uncertain The other problem for the Mets is the Mets. Gooden is back after missing two months for drug therapy, and Ron Darling is back in form after pitching two and a half months without winning. But Bob Ojeda and Rick Aguilera are gone from the pitching rotation, Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell have lost much of their mastery in the bullpen and Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez have not yet unloaded on offense. Things are so far out of sync that the hottest pitcher on the team is Terry Leach, who pitched only six innings for the Mets last year but who is 8 and 0, with 5 of his victories coming as an emergency starter. The hottest hitters are Howard Johnson, the reserve third baseman last season, who has already hit 20 home runs; Tim Teufel, the platoon second baseman, who leads the team with a .346 average, and Rafael Santana, the shortstop and No. 8 hitter, who has improved by 120 points and four home runs. The management says one thing seems sure: The Mets will have to work out their destiny without massive help from outside. #3 Series Left With Cards ''Basically, we're going pretty much with the hand we were dealt,'' said Joe McIlvaine, vice president of the Mets for baseball operations. ''We still have a formidable team. We still play three series against the Cardinals, two in St. Louis. We can still seal our own fate. ''I think the controversial problems are past, at least the biggest ones. I think the players are all of one mind. And winning can cover a lot of problems.'' But how do you get them winning? ''My main guys have got to come through,'' Dave Johnson said. ''That means normal production from Hernandez and Carter in the middle of the lineup. And it means my pitchers have got to keep us close enough in games to give us a chance to win them.'' ''In a nutshell,'' McIlvaine said, ''we need to eliminate the mental mistakes that plagued us in the first half. We made more mistakes than in all of last year. ''We do need production from Hernandez and Carter, but that should take care of itself. They often have slow starts followed by strong second halves. If history proves anything, it's that 10-year veterans perform well in the second half. ''You can talk about the disabled pitching and all that, but it's settled down. Doc's back, and pitching well. Ron Darling had a long dry spell, but he seems to be coming back strong, and he may very well be the scourge of the league now. And we won't get Ojeda back, but we'll be fine if we get Aguilera and David Cone back in the rotation. ''But if you had to find the keys to the problem, they're probably McDowell and Orosco. We lost an awful lot of games in late innings in the first half. We had McDowell and Orosco cold at the same time, and you can't live that way.'' ''But,'' McIlvaine said, ''Randy Myers is emerging as a force in the bullpen, a strong guy who can carry you up to the close. And McDowell was having some problem with his delivery, but has worked to solve it.'' ''The signs,'' he concluded, ''are all there.'' So are the ultimate numbers: nine and a half games out with 75 to go.

1187-> THE WORLD; Parliament Acts To Bar Kahane
Rabbi Meir Kahane, the militant Israeli conservative who was born in the United States, has fought to keep his American citizenship while serving as a member of the Israeli Parliament. In 1985, the State Department deprived him of his American citizenship because of his membership in a foreign parliament, but a Federal Court gave him back his passport. Last week, the Parliament in Jerusalem moved to exclude him from its activities when he refused to accept a pledge of allegiance to Israel and his parliamentary duties. Meanwhile, an American professor was convicted in an Israeli military court for disturbing the peace by taking part in an unauthorized Arab demonstration on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Roger L. Heacock, a 45-year-old professor of European history at Bir Zeit University, in Ramallah, 15 miles north of Jerusalem, was given a two-month suspended sentence, fined $950 and put on probation for three years. He has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian nationalism at the univeristy. Also, after months of political quarreling between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Israel appeared to have decided on a new ambassador to the United States: Rumanian-born Moshe Arad, 52, who has been the envoy to Mexico.

1188-> THE NATION;
Voicing the same complaints that led to a strike six years ago, the nation's air traffic controllers voted overwhelmingly last week to form a new union. The controllers, who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, were the successors to the thousands who were fired by President Reagan when he broke the 1981 walkout and the original union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco. At first, the morale of the new recruits was high, despite the heavy workload. But in the last few years, complaints about stress, overtime and poor equipment have grown louder as the skies have become more crowded. According to a recent count, 13,665 controllers are employed today, compared with 16,375 before the strike. The vote last week was more than 2 to 1 to accept the National Air Traffic Controllers Association as the new union. Other union leaders hailed the formation of the association as a signal of labor's rebirth, just as the death of Patco was seen as a symbol of its decline. The controllers, however, promised never to strike. The same day the vote was announced, the F.A.A. unveiled some changes that might ease the controllers' burden. In an effort to increase safety margins during the busy summer season, flights to and from some crowded airports, including Newark, are being spread out. The officials acknowledged that the changes are causing delays.

1189-> Iran and Iraq Report Heavy Fighting in Gulf War
Iran and Iraq both reported heavy fighting today on the south-central front in the Persian Gulf war, but they differed sharply on the outcome. Teheran said its troops had killed or wounded at least 2,500 Iraqis in a thrust that began Saturday night and was continuing Monday on the northern edge of the Hawizeh marshlands. Iraq said it had suffered no more than 40 casualties over the 36-hour period, while Iran had lost more than 3,200 killed or wounded. The fighting was the first major probe by Iranian ground forces in months, but military analysts said it did not appear to be a long-awaited Iranian offensive for which both sides have been preparing. It was developing as foreign ministers of Gulf Arab states met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to prepare for a summit meeting starting next Saturday, at which the seven-year-old gulf war will be at the top of the agenda. Iran said it launched its latest attack along a river in the Fakkeh border area east of the Iraqi town of Misan, formerly known as Amara. A communique from Teheran said that Iranian troops, in a ''victorious blitz,'' retook 12 square miles of Iranian territory that had been occupied by Iraq since the start of the war in September 1980. It said five counterattacks were beaten back and at least 1,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed, wounded or drowned. The Teheran radio said some Iraqis were also killed fleeing through their own minefields. The Iranians did not give their own casualties. Iraq, denying the losses, said the Iranians had been trapped in a no-man's land between strong positions and minefields in front of them and an Iraqi artillery and tank bombardment that shot shells to their rear. An Iraqi military spokesman said ''the very light figure of Iraqi losses proves that our defensive positions are well prepared, impregnable and well protected by intensive fire of all types.'' Baghdad television showed on Sunday what it said were scores of Iranian corpses in the Zubeidat area several miles northwest of Fakkeh. U.S. Alters Rules of Engagement WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - The Pentagon has broadened its rules of engagement in the Persian Gulf to enable ships there to respond to requests for help from North Atlantic Treaty Organization warships that are under attack, Pentagon and State Department officials said today. The decision, which was made about a month ago, represents the first time that the United States has enlarged the Navy's military mandate in the Persian Gulf since last July, when it agreed to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the American flag last July. The Navy will not automatically come to the aid of a threatened NATO warship, but will respond if a NATO warship requests help, a senior Defense Department official said. ''If an allied naval vessel comes under attack and asks for our assistance, the on-scene commander has the right to respond,'' the official said. He called the decision ''a clarification'' of the rule of engagement. To date, no vessel of a NATO ally has come under attack or requested American naval protection, officials said. The decision caught lawmakers by surprise, even though senior State De=partment and Pentagon officials detailed the expanded rules of engagement in public and private testimony in the past month. Several key House and Senate legislators who follow events in the Persian Gulf closely, such as Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, complained that there had been a lack of proper consulation. An Administration official stressed today that the Navy would not expand its protection to commercial vessels flying the flags of NATO countries or to American-owned vessels flying under foreign ''flags of convenience.''

1190-> Pigs, Dogs and People: Clash in Jersey Special to The New York Times
For years, Clarence Sibert lived alone on a corner of farmland here, with the pigs he raised and the dogs he kept as pets. While growing up, Sharon Micinski knew the property, now part of a municipal park, as a good place to hunt pheasant and deer. She also became friends with Mr. Sibert, who the township allowed to live on the property to protect a historic brick house that stands there. Now Mr. Sibert, 83 years old, can see the manicured lawns of office parks through the bare treetops around his pigpen. And he has become the target of complaints and, most recently, of eviction proceedings from Lawrence Township. Miss Micinski, 27, is the township's animal-control officer, and a large part of her job lately has involved delivering summonses to Mr. Sibert. Out of Favor ''He's just different,'' she said, as Mr. Sibert stood in the pigpen, scratching the arched back of one of his 700-pound sows while piglets scampered by. ''He's used to a different life, one that was acceptable 20 years ago, but not now.'' The predicament is a byproduct of rapid development that has engulfed much of Mercer County. As New Jersey's corporate corridor has widened, leading to construction of homes and offices on what was open land, Mr. Sibert's way of life has fallen out of favor with most people living here. He prefers to let his dogs, who have numbered as many as 32, run loose, but the township has a law against that. He believes in feeding his pigs unadulterated food scraps that he collects from local restaurants, but the state has a law forbidding that. He keeps one side of his jaw filled with chewing tobacco, eats one meal a day, and wears a faded old Stauffer Chemicals cap. He once sold a piglet for $35 to a group of Princeton alumni, who made her the mascot of their annual ''P-rade.'' ''They put mascara around her eyes, lipstick on her mouth and painted her toenails,'' he said admiringly. ''I went over to Princeton to watch her march down the street.'' Until recently, township officials had encouraged Mr. Sibert to live on the park property rent-free, believing his presence would ward off potential vandalism at the historic house. At first, he lived in the house, said to have belonged to David Brearley, who was among the signers of the Constitution. Three years ago Mr. Sibert moved into a trailer the township rents. ''We were always in a nice, symbiotic relationship and everybody profited from it,'' said the township's health administrator, Daniel DeFrancesco. In the last year, however, criticism of Mr. Sibert's animals has intensified. The dogs first became a problem, Mr. DeFrancesco said, when executives of Lenox China, which has a pond with Canada geese on its nearby property, complained that the dogs were chasing their geese. Most of the dogs were destroyed after a woman who was bitten in a parking lot filed suit against the township and Mr. Sibert. He has been ordered to keep his five remaining dogs tied up, but has not done so. ''I hope when I pen those dogs up, somebody'll burn that place down,'' Mr. Sibert said, gesturing toward the historic house. Folk Hero Status Mr. DeFrancesco said he alerted the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to Mr. Sibert's pig-feeding style. The state advised Mr. Sibert to either feed his pigs grain or boil the restaurant scraps to rid them of impurities. Mr. Sibert, as is his custom, refused to change his ways. Last Tuesday, officials tacked a pink quarantine notice to the trunk of a locust tree near Mr. Sibert's trailer, to prevent him from selling his pigs. In the place on the notice reserved for Mr. Sibert's signature acknowledging the quarantine, an official wrote, ''Owner refused to sign.'' Perhaps most troublesome of all, Mr. DeFrancesco said, is the status Mr. Sibert is gaining. ''What upsets me is that he is getting a reputation as a folk hero, when he is posing a very serious health and safety problem to this township,'' he said. ''The man is a serious liability. One of these days, someone is going to get seriously hurt, either by the dogs, which are not chihuahuas, or with the food source this man is farming. He's the old dinosaur, and civilization is encroaching on him. But our responsibility is to the public.'' Mr. Sibert says he is searching for a new place to live. Wherever it is, it will have to be large enough to accommodate his pigs, which he calls ''Mommy'' or ''Hog.'' ''I'm going to put 'em in the kitchen with me,'' he said. ''They're better than people.''

1191-> Bruin Basketball Is Penalized
The National Collegiate Athletic Association censured the U.C.L.A. men's basketball program for recruiting violations and took away two scholarships for the 1988-89 season. The N.C.A.A. Infractions Committee report also said it may consider additional penalties if U.C.L.A. does not take appropriate action against an unnamed booster involved in one of the recruiting cases. The committee did not impose probation or other sanctions related to postseason play or television. ''The principal issues in this case,'' said the report, ''arose from two primary events: The provision of apartment rent during the spring of 1985 for a prospective student-athlete in men's basketball by a well-known representative of the university's athletics interests; and the recruitment of, signing of a national letter of intent by, and subsequent release from that letter of intent for an outstanding prospective student athlete in men's basketball.''

1192-> U.S. Split Over Computer Sale To a Soviet-Owned Company
An American export control blunder has let a Soviet-owned company in West Germany obtain a powerful computer that Defense Department officials insist is a risk to American security. Just how serious a mistake was made - or, indeed, whether any breach of national security occurred at all - is in dispute among Government experts on technology transfer, and it has provoked a battle within the Administration. The dispute centers on a disagreement between the Commerce Department, which administers export control laws, and the Defense Department over what policies govern the export of sensitive equipment to the 100 or so Soviet-owned companies in the West. An Interdepartmental Feud The dispute is the latest and perhaps the most bitter episode in the long-running feud between the Commerce and Defense Departments over export controls. It underscores differences in the way the United States and its allies treat exports to the Eastern bloc, and American officials fear it may undercut efforts by the United States to press its allies to adopt more stringent export control policies in the wake of the Toshiba scandal. The company caught in the middle of the bureaucratic tangle is the nation's largest computer maker, the International Business Machines Corporation. Originally I.B.M. had agreed to sell one of its mainframe computers to Transnautic, a company in West Germany. Sale of a Japanese Model But while the Commerce and Defense Departments argued over whether the sale should go through, the Commerce Department inadvertently allowed the shipment of a similar Japanese-made computer to the same Soviet-controlled company. It came under Commerce Department jurisdiction because the Japanese computer was shipped through a Silicon Valley company. Defense Department officials contend that sending the computer to Transnautic was tantamount to sending it directly to the Soviet Union. ''This is an egregious case, and the Defense Department discovered it almost accidentally,'' said Fred C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense. ''The computer that was shipped was several times more powerful than the type Cocom permits to be sold to the Soviet Union.'' Cocom, formally known as the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, is the international organization that tries to regulate sensitive technoloigy exports to the Eastern bloc. However, extensive interviews with industry officials both here and in Europe, including officials of Transnautic, cast serious doubt on the Pentagon's arguments that American security has been compromised. Transnautic, a Hamburg-based shipping company, is 51 percent owned by Sovfracht, a Soviet state-controlled company. Transnautic has legally purchased mainframe computers from I.B.M. for more than a decade, and there is no evidence that any of them have been diverted out of West Germany. The case began in September 1986 when IBM Germany, the American company's West German subsidiary, applied to the Commerce Department for a license to ship a Model 4381 mainframe. The machine represents five-year-old technology but is among the more powerful computers in I.B.M.'s line. The application listed Transnautic, which already owned a smaller version of the 4381, as the customer. Transnautic keeps track of the thousands of freight containers and other cargo passing through all German ports. It controls much of the traffic in Hamburg harbor and also handles some scheduling for Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. Transnautic officials said they viewed the computer transaction as a routine West-to-West sale. ''As long as I have worked at this company, 10 or 11 years, we have had computers from I.B.M., regularly replacing them with more modern or up-to-date ones,'' said Klaus Behrens, the company's managing director. The computers, he said, have never left West Germany, and were frequently serviced by I.B.M. technicians. ''There was never the least problem,'' he said. I.B.M. confirmed Mr. Behrens's account. But I.B.M.'s previous exports occurred before a change in Commerce Department rules. Under regulations adopted in early 1986, said Paul Freedenberg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade administration, ''we have a policy on Soviet-owned companies, which is to treat them as if they were actually in the Soviet Union.'' That policy, Mr. Freedenberg added, is unique among Western allies, who generally treat sales to Soviet-owned companies in Western countries the same way they treat similar sales to Western-owned companies. Under the new rules, I.B.M.'s application was sent to the Pentagon, which urged that the shipment be stopped. In February the Commerce Department sent I.B.M. a ''negative consideration'' letter, warning it that the application might be denied but not formally taking any action. Meanwhile, Transnautic was growing angry at the delay, warning IBM Germany that by refusing to deliver the 4381 the computer company was on the verge of violating West German law prohibiting discrimination against customers. ''It quickly became clear that we might have to answer in civil court,'' said Mark Holcomb, an I.B.M. spokesman in Washington, and there was a specter of criminal action against the company. Fearful of being caught in an international bind, I.B.M. appealed the Commerce Department's action. Again the Defense Deparment was consulted, and again it recommended denying the license. Pentagon officials say they assumed the matter was then closed. But during the appeal, Mr. Freedenberg said, the United States was approached by West German officials who argued that the sale was perfectly legal under German law. American denial of the license, the officials said, would put the Bonn Government in an untenable position. ''It amounted to the United States telling one German company, IBM Germany, that it could not sell to another German company, Transnautic,'' said a West German official in Washington who asked that his name not be used. ''German export control law does not have any prohibition on sales to a Soviet-controlled company in a third country,'' the official said. Mr. Freedenberg said that he then tried to work out a licensing arrangement that would satisfy American security concerns by requiring additional monitoring of the equipment by I.B.M. personnel and the West German Government. On June 10 the Commerce Department granted IBM Germany the license but without notifying the Pentagon. ''I acted unilaterally - I thought it was a reasonable deal,'' Mr. Freedenberg said, noting that Pentagon review of such licenses is a matter of discretion, not something required by law. I.B.M. officials were relieved to have the path finally cleared. But ''when we went back to Transautic, we discovered we had already lost the business,'' Mr. Holcomb said. In fact, Transnautic had ordered - and was preparing to install - an I.B.M.-compatible AS-8043 mainframe from National Advanced Systems, a subsidiary of the National Semiconductor Corporation. The $1.2 million machine, though sold under National's label, is made by the Hitachi Corporation, one of Japan's largest computer makers. In accordance with American law, National Advanced Systems had applied for a license to ship the computer while I.B.M.'s dispute with the Commerce Department was still pending. But Commerce officials say Transnautic was not described on the application as a Soviet-controlled company - and the license was approved with no questions asked. ''It's amazing to me that they could make a mistake like that,'' said Stephen D. Bryen, who heads the Pentagon's export control office and who is harshly critical of the Commerce Department's actions in the case. In a heated meeting at the White House last week, attended by officials from Commerce, Defense, the National Security Council, the intelligence agencies and the Customs Service, Mr. Freedenberg acknowledged that the Commerce Department had erred in failing to recognize Transnautic's ownership. The department, he said, has since tried to explain to the Pentagon that Commerce has customarily given extra scrutiny to licenses on technology being shipped to Soviet-controlled companies. However, an aide to Mr. Freedenberg, Cecil Hunt, wrote to I.B.M. in early July that the law ''does not require export to Transnautic in West Germany to be treated as an export to the Soviet Union.'' Mr. Freedenberg says the Commerce Department's position has now changed. ''I understand the Pentagon's concerns, and I am happy to accommodate them,'' Mr. Freedenberg said. ''But this is more a procedural dispute than a substantive one.'' At the Pentagon, however, Mr. Bryen have accused the Commerce Department of deliberate deception and have raised concerns that Commerce may have approved other licenses for sensitive technology to Soviet-controlled companies. The entire matter came to the Pentagon's attention two weeks ago when the Commerce Department sent over for review an application for yet another I.B.M. computer, a new 9370 minicomputer, for a Soviet-controlled company in Singapore. That application is still pending. To mollify the Pentagon, the Commerce Department is drawing up amendments to the export control regulations making clear that sales of technology to Soviet-controlled companies in the West will be treated as West-to-East transfers subject to more stringent requirements. Mr. Freedenberg said he had also assured the Pentagon that Defense Department officials would be permitted to review all applications of such technology sales.

1193-> MUSIC VIEW; IN SEARCH OF AUDIO HEAVEN
TECHNOLOGY, WITH GODLIKE inscrutability, both giveth and taketh away. Consider how strange it is that even as advances in sound reproduction now allow us to savor utter silence between the notes on a compact disk, strides in portable electronic amplification also make it possible for musicians in New York's subways to outbellow arriving and departing trains. Whether these manifestations of technology's power are equally desirable may be debated. Let me merely suggest that any device capable of increasing the decibel level in New York's subways cannot be automatically regarded as a blessing. And yet, who knows what doors may be opened, and for whom, by these underground competitions between amplified man and thundering machine. One can imagine the emergence of new legends with David and Goliath overtones, complete with folk songs celebrating the victory of one or the other. My own money, in this instance, happens to be on the other. However, the history of technology in this century warns us not to underrate its volatile potential for altering artistic sensibilities. Just the other day, while browsing through several specialized periodicals devoted to ''high end'' audio equipment, I was struck by the passionate, dithyrambic tone of some of the technical writing. Clearly, if the authors are expressing genuine feelings, they must experience something akin to mystical transport while listening to sounds produced by the most technically sophisticated and most expensive equipment. It lends poignancy to the writing in these journals, however, to know that many of the refinements they describe are measurable only by audio instruments and might be dismissed by most musicians as pointless. Pursuing perfection, they end up trying to measure moonbeams. Though by pragmatic standards such extramusical obsessions must rank rather low, it is arguable that the audio-equipment madman stands on the penultimate step to musical awareness. Unfortunately, he may never take that last step, preferring to worry forever over charts, measurements and specifications. Still, the possibility always exists. I myself belong to a generation whose understanding of musical history was profoundly altered by a technological breakthrough: the long-playing record. In just a few months, we will mark the 40th anniversary of that innovation, which overturned listening habits and took our consciousness of repertory, styles and performance practices to previously unimagined levels. It must be difficult for anyone who was not touched by that development in 1948 to grasp what it meant to pick up the first Schwann catalogue only a year later and find not only all the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms already represented on LP but three more or less complete Puccini operas and such comparative esoterica as Ravel's ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges.'' And all in such startling fidelity, as we purists called it in those days, firmly insisting that the term high fidelity was redundant, like highly pregnant. I hope I am not giving away generational secrets when I admit that it took some of us a while before we could hear, say, a Liszt piano concerto without oohing over the tinkling of a previously inaudible triangle. We listened to records insatiably and with a sense of pride in discovery, as if no one before us had ears. So, naturally I have not been surprised to note a similar tone of amazement by critics writings about recent advances in sound reproduction, such as the compact disk and the next candidate for revolutionary glory, digital audio tape. After all, these newly hatched fanatics are only recapitulating our own first encounter with musical technology. Something about their fervor struck me as familiar, however, and sent me back to the chapter in ''The Magic Mountain'' in which Thomas Mann's Hans Castorp discovers the electric phonograph while a patient in a tuberculosis sanitorium. The record collection packaged with the machine is laughably fragmentary by our modern standards -chunks of ''Faust,'' ''Figaro,'' ''Hoffmann,'' ''Aida'' and ''Carmen,'' a few complete short works such as Schubert's ''Lindenbaum'' -but it opens up a universe for Castorp, a naive soul who is described early on as ''a still unwritten page.'' As the first recording, an Offenbach overture, is played for him and other assembled patients, astonishment reigns: ''They could scarcely believe their ears at the purity and faithful reproduction of the color of the woodwind. A solo violin preluded whimsically; the bowing, the pizzicato, the sweet gliding from one position to another were all clearly audible. . .A human voice welled out from the casket, a masculine voice at once soft and powerful, with orchestral accompaniment. It was a famous Italian baritone; the marvelous organ swelled out to the full extent of its natural register, there could be no talk here of any diminution or veiling of the sound. If one sat in an adjoining room and did not see the instrument, it seemed not otherwise than as though the artist stood in the salon in his own person, notes in hand, and sang.'' And on and on Mann goes, rhapsodically describing this famous encounter between machinery and a susceptible sensibility. His was not the first generation to believe in the chimera of perfect musical reproduction, and hardly the last. Though ''The Magic Mountain'' was written 63 years ago, Hans Castorp's naive worship of sound and his excited sense of discovery are still alive. What seems missing today, however, is the eagerness of Hans, that high-fidelity pioneer, to go beyond mere admiration of magical gadgetry and explore the mystery of music itself. His Holy Grail was human, not mechanical, perfection.

1194-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
THE BAD WAR: An Oral History of the Vietnam War. By Kim Willenson with the correspondents of Newsweek. 451 pages. A Newsweek Book. New American Library. $19.95. IN Studs Terkel's pioneering oral history of World War II, '' 'The Good War,' '' the author placed quotation marks around the title. He explained in a prefatory note that he added them ''not as a matter of caprice or editorial comment, but simply because the adjective 'good' mated to the noun 'war' is so incongruous.'' By contrast, in ''The Bad War: An Oral History of the Vietnam War'' -written by Kim Willenson with the correspondents of Newsweek - no quotation marks are added to the title. The reason for omitting any such ironic qualifying touch is also not capricious. The dedication by Mr. Willenson, the book's editor, helps to explain why: ''To the names on the Wall and all the other names on all the other walls that it may not happen again.'' Looking back on the longest war in American history - longer than both World Wars combined - none of the contributors now see much light at the end of the tunnel. Nevertheless, ''The Bad War'' is a balanced work. More than 75 hawks and doves from that time, including former grunts in the jungles of Vietnam as well as survivors of the street battles in America, open up in this opinionated and, in some places, surprisingly eloquent book. ''The Bad War'' originated as a cover story in Newsweek on the 10th anniversary of the fall of Saigon in 1975, and is now expanded. A particular value of the book is that it emphasizes the relevance of Vietnam to American foreign and military policy today. The Vietnam syndrome - fear of getting bogged down in the Big Muddy of war again - occupies the attention of a number of the commentators here. Two military involvements during the Reagan Presidency - the invasion of the island of Grenada in the Caribbean, where American armed forces were directly engaged but American reporters were barred, and the covert war in support of the contras against the Nicaraguan Government, on the agenda of the recent Congressional hearings - are both mentioned a dozen times in ''The Bad War.'' J. William Fulbright, who practices law in Washington, was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when President Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the war in Southeast Asia. In an interview with Mr. Willenson last year, Mr. Fulbright said: ''Look, it's very unpleasant to even talk about this [ Vietnam ] . It has no significance any more. The country didn't learn a damn thing for it. They're doing right now as bad or worse in Nicaragua, intervening, throwing their weight around like the big bully they are.'' He adds: ''These people come in from Hollywood and think they can do anything, just like John Wayne.'' Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., retired, a Republican aspirant for President, who was President Nixon's last chief of staff and President Reagan's first Secretary of State, presents an opposite view that stresses the intentions of the Soviet Union and Cuba in the Caribbean: ''Why Central America has importance for us is not that it's a social and economic struggle, but that it's an external intervention which is dangerous to our vital interests.'' The head of President Ford's National Security Council, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, retired, comes somewhere down the middle: ''Let's just suppose for example that the President comes to the conclusion that the only way to settle the Central American situation is to go into Nicaragua. He might be able to go in but I don't think he could complete the job. My assessment is that anything we can do in three days or five days, before the opposition mobilized, we can do. But if we launched an engagement that would take as long as Nicaragua would take, I think he would absolutely be cut off at the knees. A Grenada we can do. Nicaragua would be a far different case.'' And in an interesting remark that runs counter to the traditional von Clausewitz theory of total war and may well represent current Pentagon thinking, General Scowcroft says: ''It is not fundamentally the role of the military to integrate diplomacy with the use of force. So in a sense you could say that the military have become the doves of our time.'' All the interviews in ''The Bad War'' were conducted in 1985 and 1986 by various Newsweek correspondents, before the Iran-contra hearings, but they still hold up. One of the Senators who has played an active role in the hearings, William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, echoes what he has been saying on television. He says that he believes that the country has learned something from Vietnam. ''Its lingering effect does not mean we won't send our sons to fight anywhere, but it does mean we won't send them to fight everywhere,'' Senator Cohen says. ''One of the reasons there are no troops in Central America is that we have learned a very serious lesson, which is not to commit troops to any region unless the country and the Congress are convinced that the reasons are good.'' This oral history records voices from Joan Baez to Gary Hart, from former Premier of South Vietnam Nguyen Cao Ky to Eugene McCarthy, from Caspar Weinberger to Maj. Gen. George S. Patton 3d, retired, son of the famed World War II general. General Patton criticizes the lack of strategic direction and national support during the war and bitterly declares: ''We were defeated by an eighth-rate power.'' But not even the military-minded General Patton, who says he cried at the final loss of Vietnam, finds much good in ''The Bad War.''

1195-> Politics; New York's Democrats Prepare to Choose Sides
Released from neutrality by Governor Cuomo last week, many Democratic public and party officials in New York are preparing to take sides in the Presidential contest, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois picking up most of the support. However, many of the New York Democrats are unenthusiastic about the party's six candidates and are starting to make choices only because they are confronted with January deadlines for the start of the process to qualify in the April 19 primary as delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The exceptions are prominent black politicians who, apparently without exception, are supporting Mr. Jackson. ''If you want to go to the convention, you have to commit to some candidate whether you like him or not, '' said Richard Weingarten, the Westchester County Democratic leader, adding, ''I haven't found a candidate I can support yet.'' Joseph F. Crangle, the long-time Erie County Democratic chairman, said, ''When I say there's some support for the candidates, I'm stretching it.'' Substantial Base for Cuomo Even those committed to candidates agreed that there is hardly a groundswell in the state for anyone except Mr. Cuomo, who has said he will not run. He had asked New York Democrats to remain neutral until after all six Democratic Presidential candidates appeared at a New York forum last week. However, the fence-sitting of most top New York Democrats, while more a function of a national vacuum than a Cuomo master plan, does provide a substantial base for any late Cuomo effort to run for President. ''That could be a byproduct,'' Mr. Crangle acknowledged. In contrast to past conventions, the 275 delegates for 1988 are not legally bound to vote for a candidate even if elected as a supporter of that candidate. ''If you put all the people who are sitting on the fence end to end, you'd have another Great Wall of China,'' said Joel Blumenthal, who heads the state campaign of Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona Governor. Mrs. Blumenthal is the widow of Albert H. Blumenthal, a former Assembly majority leader. Manhattan Leader for Jackson For most of the major state officials, the fence-sitting has been institutionalized through a new type of delegate who is officially unpledged. Among the 53 prominent officials who will go to the convention uncommitted will be Governor Cuomo, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Attorney General Robert Abrams, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, mayors of the state's big cities, most of the state's Democratic Representatives, the Democratic leaders of the State Legislature and 16 New York members of the Democratic National Committee. Of the major county leaders in the state, only Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, the Manhattan Democratic leader, has endorsed a candidate, Mr. Jackson. Another major county leader, Representative Thomas J. Manton of Queens, said his organization will endorse some candidate. ''We're not going to play games and be in every camp,'' Mr. Manton said. But most of his counterparts in other counties are backing delegates for more than one candidate. ''I want to get as many people as I can to that convention,'' said Assemblyman George Friedman, the Bronx County Democratic leader. Campaign aides to the Presidential candidates are working with many of the Party leaders in the state's 34 congressional districts, seeking agreement on delegate candidates. A total of 167 district delegates will be elected, four to six from each district. The more prominent a candidate, the more likely he or she is to be elected. Simon Appears Best Organized When campaign aides cannot reach such an agreement with party leaders, they will attempt to run their own delegate candidates. Each candidate needs 1,000 signatures of enrolled Democrats to qualify for the April 19 primary ballot. In addition, each Presidential candidate needs 10,000 signatures to qualify for the statewide primary vote that will determine the allocation of 55 delegates-at-large. There will, in effect, be two primaries: the statewide direct vote for Presidential candidates and the congressional district votes for delegates. Mr. Simon appears to be the best organized, with coordinators for each of the 34 congressional districts, according to Jeremy Karpatkin, a veteran of Mark Green's Senate campaign last year and head of the Simon operation here. However, Mr. Jackson is well ahead of the others in lining up support from prominent public officials and leads in organization at least in predominantly black districts. Among the leading supporters of Mr. Jackson are Borough President David Dinkins of Manhattan; Stanley Hill, president of the politically active District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Muncipal Employes; Representatives Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, Floyd H. Flake of Queens, Edolphus Towns and Major R. Owens, both of Brooklyn, and Robert Garcia of the Bronx. Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Hill are co-chairman of the Jackson campaign. Unions Back 2 Candidates In an unusual move that demonstrates the muddied Democratic Presidential picture, District Council 37 is also supporting Mr. Dukakis. ''We want to send as many union delegates as possible to the convention,'' said Vincent Montalbano, the union's political director. He said the affiliated Civil Service Employes Association was also supporting both candidates. Both unions have many black members. There is little visible support in New York, Democratic leaders agreed, for Senator Albert Gore Jr. and Representative Richard A. Gephardt. Representative Thomas J. Downey of Suffolk County is supporting Mr. Gore while Mr. Gephardt has the backing of the Seafarer's Union because of his advocacy of trade restrictions. His brother, Donald Gephardt, a resident of Nassau County, has contacted some political leaders but is currently in Iowa. Mrs. Blumenthal said the Babbitt forces would have delegate slates in all 34 districts, but these slates and those of other candidates might never be filed with Boards of Elections if a candidate's national campaign falters in Iowa, which holds delegate selection caucuses on Feb. 8 and New Hampshire, which has the nation's first Presidential primaries on Feb. 16. The deadline for Democrats to file as delegate candidates is Feb. 25. Supporters of such fallen candidates as Gary Hart and Senator Joseph A. Biden Jr. of Delaware are scattered among the remaining candidates or are uncommitted. ''I'm watching from the sidelines,'' said James Capalino, the former New York City Hall aide who headed the Hart campaign here. Joel Boyarsky, a major fund-raiser for Mr. Biden, said he has been discussing a possible role with Senators Gore and Simon.

1196-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Off in Late Trading As Gold Is Little Changed
The dollar drifted marginally lower yesterday against most key currencies in thin pre-holiday trading after rising overseas. Gold prices were little changed. The Republic National Bank in New York at 4 P.M. quoted bullion at $479.75 an ounce, unchanged from late Friday. Currency dealers said the dollar had been firmer for most of the session but started to slump in the waning hours mainly because of technical factors. ''Since we're in a down trend, the drift will be down,'' said Ron Sapiro, head trader for Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. Trading was described as lackluster almost everywhere. ''Our boys are playing cards or staring into the air,'' said one dealer at a bank in Frankfurt. Mr. Sapiro predicted the markets would probably remain quiet through the Christmas and New Year holidays unless the Group of Seven, representing the United States and six other industrialized nations, ''comes out with some earth-shattering'' statement about the dollar. In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar rose to 126.65 Japanese yen from Friday's 126.45. Later in London, the dollar traded at 126.93 yen, and it fell to 126.655 yen in New York, from 127.055 Friday. The dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.8275 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.8260 late Friday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.8400, up from $1.82525. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.6290 West German marks, down from 1.63435; 1.32225 Swiss francs, up from 1.32075; 1.3072 Canadian dollars, unchanged from 1.3072; 5.5300 French francs, down from 5.5305, and 1,195.50 Italian lire, down from 1,201.50. Late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.6307 West German marks, up from 1.6218; 1.3255 Swiss francs, up from 1.3230; 5.5145 French francs, down from 5.5150; 1,198.50 Italian lire, up from 1,197.50, and 1.3068 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3062. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell to $479.60 an ounce, from $479.80 Friday. Gold also slipped in Europe, closing at $479.50 a troy ounce in both London and Zurich. On Friday, gold closed at $480.20 an ounce in London and $480.50 an ounce in Zurich. In Hong Kong, gold was bid at $481.52, down from $481.76 Saturday.

1197-> MUSIC: BERLIOZ'S 'DEATH OF CLEOPATRA'
THE New York Philharmonic's concert on Thursday evening in Avery Fisher Hall had a United Nations look about it. Giuseppe Sinopoli, the Italian guest conductor, divided his program between French and German works, with Rosalind Plowright, a British soprano, as the night's soloist. Need it be added that the orchestra was American? There is nothing inherently wrong about a melting-pot approach to musical performance. In fact, a mixture of national styles and temperaments often produces fascinating results - witness Walter Gieseking's famous Debussy, for instance, or Sviatoslav Richter's Schubert. What is to be dreaded, however, is the increasingly common international style, which plays down subtle differences and homogenizes performances in search of a chimerical ideal of professional perfection. There was something of that homogenized feeling about Mr. Sinopoli's conducting on this occasion. Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin,'' consisting of the four pieces he drew from the piano suite of that name, was played carefully, with nice attention to detail and sensitivity to its delicate sonorities. But for all that, one missed something essential, a certain austere, relaxed dignity that underlies this genre of French music. Though pleasant enough to hear, it might as well have been a suite by Grieg. Berlioz's ''Death of Cleopatra,'' in which Miss Plowright took the title part, is a problematical piece that demands for its success a great singing actress with an innate feeling for the French dramatic and vocal style. Much of it is declamatory in the exalted manner that can be heard in pure form at the Comedie Francaise. It is a style that in the wrong mouth can turn intolerably artificial and false, which is why many singers find it safest to aim elsewhere. Miss Plowright did not try for the grand tone, not even in the recitative where Berlioz most urgently demands it. She adopted an urgent but generalized dramatic approach that might have transferred easily, in the modern international style, to Verdi or Wagner. In those terms, the performance might have succeeded quite well if the soprano's voice itself had been more palatable. Miss Plowright, who sings the spinto and dramatic repertories in major opera houses, could produce a big sound at times. However, unless she was out of sorts this time, hers is a hard-edged instrument with few shades of color or other nuances. Mr. Sinopoli seemed more at home in the German half of the program, where his instinct for drama and his care for detail were exploited in a pair of heavy-breathing Strauss works. ''Death and Transfiguration'' is a darkly moody, rather meandering tone poem in which the conductor must keep a firm grip on the structural outlines to maintain tension throughout. Mr. Sinopoli seemed to be concentrating on building up and releasing Strauss's intricately designed sonorities, which led to some passing moments of excitement but did not dissipate a general feeling of shapelessness in the reading. The Dance of the Seven Veils from ''Salome'' brought Mr. Sinopoli's talents into sharp focus. Here, he conjured up the operatic scene deftly with a marvelously sinuous performance that was not only rich in detail but skillfully voiced and registered so that even at its most corybantic the score did not lose its clarity.

1198-> SCIENCE WATCH; TREES OF INDUSTRIAL AGE
TREES are responding with surprising alacrity to the increase of carbon dioxide in the air, cutting back sharply on the microscopic pores that control the flow of water and gas in their leaves, a British botanist has found. The botanist, F. Ian Woodward of Cambridge University, compared the leaves of seven species of trees and one shrub in the midlands of England with specimens preserved at a university herbarium over the last 200 years. Although the density of pores varied considerably from species to species, Dr. Woodward found a steady decline in all cases, averaging 40 percent. Over the same period, the industrial era has brought a steady rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it traps heat. The increase is expected to raise the earth's temperature significantly in the next few decades. Dr. Woodward confirmed his findings by growing plants in greenhouses with different levels of carbon dioxide.The new research, reported in Nature, is part of a growing body of work by ecologists and climate specialists struggling to understand the complex interactions of the atmosphere's gases, the warming and cooling of the planet and the waxing and waning of different species. With fewer pores, which allow evaporation from inside the leaf, a plant becomes more efficient in its use of water in drawing energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide. By reacting quickly to the rising levels of carbon dioxide, some plants may be improving their ability to withstand drought as the earth grows warmer.

1199-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Farewell, Sweet Pitcher
A woman named Pam working in a restaurant on Second Avenue said recently that she loved Tom Seaver so much in the fifth grade that the kids called her Mrs. Seaver. A college student named John recalled the day he played hooky from high school to see Seaver in his 1984 return to the Mets, and how watching Seaver come out of the bullpen after pre-game warmups, and the sellout crowd at Shea screaming their heads off, would always be one of the biggest thrills of his life. And a writer recalled certain moments in the life of Seaver - that long, low-slung powerful pitching motion, those several comings and goings, that professionalism, that high, boyish giggle - but perhaps what is most quickly recalled is his reaction after the Mets, that ''Amazin'' eight-year-old team, won the 1969 World Series four games to one against the Orioles. Seaver was called ''The Franchise,'' and had won 25 games and lost only seven during the season, had struck out 208 batters and had a 2.21 earned run average and had won the Cy Young Award, his first of three. ''Remember,'' he said after the Series, ''I'm the only Met pitcher in history to have lost a World Series game.'' He also won one in that Series, but it was a nice touch, a gentlemanly touch, a touch, in fact, of humility. Just three weeks ago, Seaver, at age 42 and who apparently was retired but had made no announcement after the Red Sox had let him go at the end of last year, received a phone call during dinner at home in Greenwich, Conn. The caller was Frank Cashen, the general manager of the Mets. Would Seaver come out of retirement to help the team, which had just lost two starting pitchers because of injury, and had another coming back from drug rehabilitation. ''I'll give it a try,'' said Seaver. ''I don't know,'' Pam, who loved Seaver, said. ''He's a power pitcher, and they get their strength from their legs. And remember, he had a knee operation over the winter.'' Seaver tried during the last three weeks, pitching in the bullpen at Shea, pitching in an exhibition game for the Mets against Tidewater, pitching in a pair of simulated games with some second-string Mets facing him and other Mets in the field. ''It wasn't there,'' he said. ''I didn't have any good motion on the ball. The batters were hitting it out in front of the plate. And I felt discomfort in my arm, discomfort in my knee.'' He had made a decision. He could not meet his high standards. He had had enough. ''No,'' said Davey Johnson, the Mets' manager, ''give yourself more of a chance.'' But Bud Harrelson, the Mets' coach, former shortstop and roommate of Seaver knew that Seaver knew. ''He's not going to fool himself,'' said Harrelson, yesterday at Shea. ''And he's his toughest critic. I remember when he'd pitch a three-hitter, and still could be critical of his performance.'' Yesterday, Tom Seaver announced at a news conference that, after 20 years in the big leagues, he was retiring. When he walked into the room, with his wife, Nancy, the reporters and cameramen gathered there were quiet. ''Hey,'' he said, rather brightly, ''there's no funeral.'' He looked husky in his blue blazer and youthful with his hair brushed nearly flat against his forehead. Almost like the Tom Seaver one remembered when he first came up to the Mets in the summer of 1967, and recalled to a reporter how frightened he was in his first professional start in Jacksonville, Fla. While warming up in the bullpen, he stopped to stand for the national anthem, and became so nervous that he bent over and got sick. Then he resumed his warmups. ''This is a sad-happy time,'' said Seaver, with a slight reddening of the eyes. ''I've got a sense of mixed emotions. In one way this was a fairly easy decision for me to make - after evaluating my performance and the way I've been throwing.'' On the other hand, he said, ''I would like to have helped this team win the world championship, and I think they have the capabilities to do so.'' Oh, what a sweet way to have gone out, one thought. To have Tom Seaver, the living ghost of Tom Seaver, help pitch the Mets to another championship. He would be the cavalry, he would be the Marines, he would be the starting pitcher the Mets so desperately needed. ''I would love to have penciled his name in the lineup,'' said Davey Johnson. Instead, it ended not triumphantly on the mound, but triumphantly in a football locker room. He left with pride, he left with dignity, he left with emptier pockets. He had a contract for this season for $750,000, to be paid for the next three months - ''just tell us when you're ready to pitch,'' Frank Cashen told him. But after three weeks, Seaver in essence tore up the contract. ''There weren't any more competitive pitches left,'' he said. ''Got every ounce out of them I could. They were all used up.'' Used up in 4,782 innings, 13th on the all-time list. Used up in 647 starts, ninth on the all-time list. Used up in 311 victories, 13th on the all-time list. Used up in 61 shutouts, seventh on the all-time list. Used up with a 2.86 career earned run average., tied for fourth on the all-time list. Used up with 3,640 strikeouts, third on the all-time list. ''I guess it's time now to sit back and reflect on what I've done,'' he said. ''It's been a lovely 20 years. I couldn't have asked for more.'' To baseball fans, to Met fans, the feelings, Mr. Seaver, are mutual.

The United States has asked Taiwan to revalue its currency upward to help the Reagan Administration fight protectionist bills and reduce its large trade deficit, officials said today. If the Taiwan dollar rose against the American dollar, American goods would be cheaper for Taiwanese buyers, and Taiwanese goods would be more expensive for American consumers, helping redress the current trade imbalance.

1204-> RESEARCH IN SPACE FALLS FURTHER BEHIND, AND SCIENTISTS ARE ALARMED
WITH so many spacecraft grounded indefinitely by the Challenger disaster and support for future programs uncertain, American scientists are growing increasingly frustrated and angry over their diminishing prospects for space research and exploration. The destruction of the space shuttle in January 1986 is causing delays of at least two to five years in important science missions, cancellations of some flights and postponement of any major new projects. The plight of space science, in the view of many researchers in the field, is worse now than even the pessimists had predicted it would be in the year immediately after the shuttle accident. The new delays have compounded problems already besetting the space science program before the accident, when more and more scientific groups had found themselves competing for fewer and fewer flight opportunities. Many scientists thus believe the nation is in grave danger of forfeiting its long-held leadership in space science. They fear that more young scientists, discouraged and restless, will abandon the field and the best students will go into more promising specialties. The result could be an alarming decline in the number and quality of the next generation of space scientists. ''We're looking at a future that's bleak in the 90's in American space science,'' warned Thomas M. Donahue, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Michigan and head of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Marvin L. Goldberger, the outgoing president of the California Institute of Technology, said, ''Our space science program is in very serious trouble - and was even before the Challenger disaster,'' adding, ''Overemphasis on manned space flight, total reliance on the shuttle, the enormous cost of the space station and the absence of a clear commitment to science has threatened our pre-eminent position.'' In a recent report on space science, an advisory council of scientists told the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that the accident and subsequent policy turmoil ''transformed a program under severe stress to a program in crisis.'' Planetary exploration, the most conspicuous and once the most vigorous science program, has been especially hard hit. Nearly a decade has passed since the last planetary mission, the Pioneer probe to Venus in 1978, and it will be at least two and a half years before the next, the Galileo mission to explore Jupiter and its largest moons. Spending on planetary programs, adjusted for inflation, is now less than 25 percent of what it was in the early 1970's. At the same time, the Soviet Union, emboldened by successful expeditions last year to observe Halley's comet, is aggressively pursuing plans for a succession of ambitious unmanned missions to Mars, beginning next summer, and is enlisting many Western European participants who in previous years would probably have been associated with American projects. The huge Soviet Energia rocket, introduced last month, provides a greatly expanded capability to launch major planetary missions and larger Earth-orbiting space stations. In discussing the ''large and imaginative'' Soviet Mars program, Bruce C. Murray, professor of planetary science at Caltech, said, ''We must wake up and decide how and if we want to remain one of the leading powers in space or whether we will be satisfied to be a faded, former great.'' Officials of the space agency insist that space science missions will be given a high priority after the resumption of shuttle flights, now scheduled for no earlier than June 1988. Under consideration is a plan to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, the most eagerly awaited of the grounded science facilities, as early as the third shuttle flight. The large optical telescope, which had been set for shuttle deployment last year, is expected to give astronomers clear views toward the edge of the universe. ''We've got a couple of tough years ahead,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science. ''But I'm confident we can be healthy again in the early to mid-90's.'' The space agency has also announced its intention to procure conventional expendable rockets so that scientists and other users will not be dependent solely on the shuttles. Several NASA study groups are preparing recommendations for new initiatives, including a possible lunar base and a program of Mars exploration by unmanned and eventually manned expeditions. But political support for new ventures is by no means certain, and the embattled NASA has little money for anything other than restoring shuttle service and beginning development of an orbiting space station over the next decade. ''I share their concern,'' said Noel Hinners, director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., referring to the complaints of space scientists. Dr. Hinners, a geologist, has just been appointed to the new post of Associate Deputy Administrator of the agency, the No. 3 position. ''We've got to reinvigorate our science programs,'' he said. Tension between scientists and NASA management is nothing new. Scientists have long complained that their programs were shortchanged because of the emphasis on expensive manned projects like the shuttle. And they have had to compete with one another - life scientists versus astrophysicists versus earth scientists versus planetary scientists - for a share of the science budget, which has never accounted for more than a quarter of NASA spending. Unmanned science programs now draw about 18 percent of the annual $9 billion budget. But scientists of all disciplines are unified over what they consider the most pressing issue: the need for assured access to space. They are seeking a commitment from NASA to make available expendable rockets for science missions and not require that the shuttles be used in all cases. The vicissitudes of the Galileo Project are a case in point. If the Galileo spacecraft had been permitted to be launched by a Titan expendable rocket, scientists said, the mission to Jupiter would in all likelihood have been completed years ago. Development of the Galileo craft was begun by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in 1977, and it was supposed to have been launched from a shuttle in 1982. But the mission has been postponed four times because of delays in inaugurating shuttle flight and because of one problem after another with propulsion systems for boosting a shuttle-deployed craft from low orbit to its more distant objective. Then came the Challenger accident and Galileo's fifth postponement. It had been set for a shuttle launching four months later. According to a report by NASA's Space and Earth Science Advisory Committee, the delay from 1982 to the planned 1986 deployment increased the Galileo costs from $379 million to $843 million. Now the project is expected to exceed $1 billion. Such costly delays, the committee observed, not only postpone useful scientific work but ''represent a diversion of resources that might otherwise allow additional projects to be carried out and provide new flight or other research opportunities.'' Now Galileo has been rescheduled for a getaway in October or November of 1989 - if the shuttles have been flying long enough to work through the accumulating backlog of military missions. It will be competing for an early launching opportunity with other major missions, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Magellan mission to orbit and map Venus. If Galileo does not make it in 1989, it will have to wait almost two years, until Jupiter and Earth are again in favorable positions. ''There's going to be such a traffic jam in 1989,'' Dr. Donahue said, ''and I'm not optimistic at all that we'll get any of these missions off.'' Although one small scientific satellite, Cosmic Background Explorer, is already being modified for launching by a Delta rocket instead of the shuttle, this option will not be widely available for several years. As part of its previous shuttle-only policy, NASA had phased out production of expendable rockets; even now it has not yet asked for the money to order others. The Senate Commerce Commerce Committee recently added $100 million to the NASA budget as a modest beginning for a program of rocket procurement. ''There's no disagreement over the need for a mixed fleet of shuttles and expendables,'' Dr. Hinners said. But Dr. Donahue, noting the lack of strong White House backing for NASA's purchase of rockets, said, ''It's not clear to me that we've turned the corner on this issue.'' Alex Roland, a Duke University historian of technology and former NASA aide, was even more skeptical, saying that NASA managers may be only ''paying lip service'' to the mixed-fleet policy. ''They don't really want expendables,'' Dr. Roland said. ''When the shuttles start flying again, they will be more expensive than ever, and if expendables are available, NASA fears that Congress and everybody else will put the heat on to use expendables for just about everything.'' An internal NASA study shows that under the best circumstances the shuttles will not be able to fulfill all the agency's launching needs through 1995. According to the study, prepared late last year by NASA's Office of Space Flight, the agency's pared-down launching requirements call for 130 shuttle flights or their equivalent in expendable rockets over seven years. If the shuttles are ready in 1988 and can reach an annual flight rate of 16, this would take care of 101 of the missions, leaving a shortage of 29 that must go on expendable rockets or not at all. But the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, recently estimated that the shuttle launching rate was not likely to exceed 12 a year. In that case, the NASA study found, there would be a need for at least 47 launchings by expendable rockets from 1988 to 1995. Scientists are less united in their attitude toward NASA's newest undertaking, the space station. Many argue that the orbiting facility would be of marginal value in scientific research and fear that the cost would divert money from other projects. The station, originally estimated to cost $8 billion and planned for operation in 1992, is now projected to cost $14 billion to $20 billion and be in orbit no earlier than 1995, according to new NASA calculations. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the total cost may reach $30 billion by the year 2000. Space agency officials say the scientists' fears are based on a false assumption of past spending patterns. Over the last two decades, they note, the share of the NASA budget for science remained steady, even in years of peak spending for the Apollo moon program and the shuttle development. Some other scientists, particularly those in life sciences and materials processing, complain that the space station will not be in operation soon enough. Peter M. Banks, who formerly headed a group of scientists advising NASA on the space station, is calling for a ''reformulation of plans'' to get the facility in orbit before 1995. His proposal is to develop a more modest version and put its components into orbit with new jumbo expendable rockets, instead of the shuttles. His group told NASA that it could thus have a working station in three launchings, instead of 10 or 11 launchings by shuttle. Dr. Banks, who is director of Stanford University's space, telecommunications and radio science laboratory, also called for restoration of some Spacelab missions that were canceled. Spacelab, a manned laboratory placed in the shuttle cargo bay, was a means to test the types of instruments and experiments that would be important to space station operations. Of the 37 Spacelab missions that were on the schedule before the Challenger accident, only five are still planned. In the Challenger aftermath, Dr. Hinners of NASA said, space scientists have become concerned about the trend toward fewer but more expensive and complex science missions, such as Galileo and the Hubble Space Telescope. They worry that, by staking so much on such missions, they risk losing everything in a single failure.

1205-> BIG-CITY MAYORS URGING CHANGES FOR NEXT CENSUS
The Mayors of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Kansas City, Mo., yesterday urged the head of the Federal Census Bureau to use statistical adjustments in the 1990 Census to avoid undercounting black and Hispanic citizens. Meeting at Gracie Mansion, the mayors said that minority residents of the nation's large cities were disproportionately overlooked in the 1980 Census. They maintained, as they have before, that the undercount cost the cities representatives in Congress and state legislatures, because reapportionment is determined by the Census count. The mayors said the problem had cost the cities hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal and state aid, distributed on the basis of population. New York City will lose between $250 million and $500 million in the 1980's because up to 500,000 residents were not included in the Census, they said. ''What happened in 1980 was simply unacceptable,'' the mayors said in a joint statement. ''Cities are still paying the price for Undercount One in 1980. We do not plan to stand by and permit Undercount Two in 1990.'' Motivating City Residents The statement was read by Mayor Koch, who was host of the meeting. Attending were Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago and Mayor Richard L. Berkley of Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Berkley is president of the United States Conference of Mayors. The meeting was initiated by John G. Keane, the director of the Census Bureau, who was seeking the mayors' aid in motivating city residents to participate in the 1990 Census. The Census Bureau estimates that 11.2 percent of the black residents of major American cities were not counted in 1980, nor were 10.3 percent of Hispanic residents. Several mayors suggested that if the Census Bureau were able to use statistical techniques to estimate the undercount, it could also use sophisticated surveys to improve the accuracy of the 1990 Census. Theoretically Possible Mr. Keane said that such an adjustment was possible theoretically, but that there was no way to guarantee that it could be done ''operationally.'' He said that many of the 300,000 part-time workers hired for the 1990 Census would have to be involved if the Bureau were to meet the mayors' objectives. The Census director said he would not commit himself to a statistical adjustment until he was certain that the agency could carry out the needed sampling to assure accuracy. Peter L. Zimroth, the Corporation Counsel for New York City, said the city would ask Congress to order a statistical adjustment if the Census Bureau declined the mayors' request. He also said the city might consider a legal challenge. The city filed suit after the 1980 Census, challenging its accuracy. The case is pending in Federal District Court.

1206-> WORKING WOMEN: A DESIGNER'S FOCUS
Some designers flash across the fashion world, creating sparks with their first collections. Not Mary Ann Restivo. She proceeded at a modest pace as she learned her trade and defined for herself the kind of clothes she wanted to make. Her name became known among the group she set her sights on: working women. ''I heard of her from a friend who works in advertising,'' said Linda Meyer, a producer of ''Good Morning America.'' ''I went looking for her clothes and I found they worked for me, too. The fabrics are soft and comfortable. You can push up the sleeves if you have to, and you can wear the clothes all day - and then feel great when you wear them out to dinner.'' ''She understands the executive woman's needs,'' said Ellin Saltzman, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. ''Her prices aren't out of sight, and the clothes sell.'' With her sales volume running at about $15 million a year, Miss Restivo tries to walk the tightrope between clothes that are subdued and those that attract attention. ''A businesswoman should be able to walk into any high-level meeting and feel good about herself,'' Miss Restivo said. ''That is what I always keep in mind.'' She is also a fanatic about fit. ''I am always concerned with giving a woman enough room in the waistline so she doesn't feel encased like a sausage, and in camouflaging the hips,'' she said. ''Though we have, of course, professional models, I'm always checking the fit. I try the clothes on myself, and I try them on girls in the office to make sure they work on different shapes.'' Miss Restivo is 5 feet 4 inches tall and wears a size 8. The most popular sizes she makes are 6, 8 and 10. A byproduct of her concern over the way her clothes fit is that many women find they can wear a size smaller in a Restivo dress. A dark-haired, soft-spoken woman who is calm but determined, Miss Restivo has known she wanted to be a designer since she made clothes for her dolls. Her father ran a clothing shop in South Orange, N.J. ''I grew up with clothes all around me,'' she said. After two years at the College of St. Elizabeth, she decided that designing was what she wanted to do and switched to the Fashion Institute of Technology. Her first jobs were in the junior sportswear field. That was in the 1960's, when Mary Quant was creating a fashion revolution and Miss Restivo was one of the ''enthusiastic unknown kids bent on change,'' she said. ''The 60's were fun,'' she recalled. ''You could do whatever you felt like and you could have long lunches and go on vacation for five weeks.'' The 70's were a more serious time. Ten years ago she met the man who would become her husband, Saul Rosen, associate director of education and politics for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. For six years she designed blouses carrying the Christian Dior label for Cisco Casuals and, in 1980, decided she was ready to go into her own business. ''Women were going to work and rising in the business and professional worlds,'' she recalled. ''They needed clothes that were not too avant-garde and that looked right in a corporate setting.'' Among the women who wear her clothes are Gloria Steinem, Matilda Cuomo and Susan Dey, an actress who plays in ''L.A. Law,'' the hot television series. Marshall Field in Chicago, I.Magnin in San Francisco and Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York are among the stores that carry her designs. She focuses on fabrics, using wool jersey in every collection because, she said, ''it travels well and you can wear it day or night.'' She varies it with gabardine. Wool crepe is third in her list of staples, which, for fall, are almost all in black, beige and brown - colors that can be worn every day, she said. Short skirts are outselling long three to one, she said, though she is offering stores a choice. ''They've been accepted more quickly than shoulder pads were 10 years ago,'' she said. Next spring she will open a new division devoted to dresses. They also do well in a corporate setting.

1208-> CURRENCY MARKETS
DOLLAR TOPS 150 YEN FOR 2D DAY Buoyed by strong demand from Japanese investors, the dollar closed above 150 yen yesterday for the second consecutive day. But profit taking and rumors of central bank intervention kept trading in a narrow range and pushed the dollar down against the German mark. The dollar breached the 150-yen mark on Tuesday for the first time since March 23. Japanese investors have been encouraged by statements that the Bank of Japan saw no reason to intervene to stop the dollar's rise from a low of about 138 yen in April. The dollar's appeal to Japanese investors has increased with weaker prices for Japanese stocks and bonds and rising oil prices. In trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 150.49 yen, from 150.25 at the close Tuesday. Rumors of Bank Intervention Rumors of Bundesbank intervention yesterday morning in Europe helped push the dollar down against the mark. It ended the day at 1.8405, down from 1.8432 Tuesday. The dollar was mixed against other currencies, rising against the Canadian dollar but falling against the Swiss franc, French franc and Italian lira. Some participants said yesterday's trading marked a continuation of the relative stability that has characterized the foreign exchange markets in recent months, reflecting in part the belief that the leading currencies were roughly within the target zones agreed to last fall by central bankers and finance ministers. ''Going back to February, the market has been the most stable I have seen in 15 years,'' said David Buchen, a partner in the currency trading firm of Buchen, Kurz & Company. ''It has trended upward more strongly against the yen than the mark in recent months because it fell more last year.'' Continued Strength Seen There was widespread sentiment in the market that the dollar would continue to strengthen in the short term, but that the impetus for the movement was weak. ''The foreign exchange markets tried to sell the dollar below 140 yen and couldn't keep it there, so they started to buy it,'' said Robert K. Ryan, manager of foreign exchange for the Irving Trust Company. ''Stability and the evidence that the trade deficit is turning around generated a lot of optimism, but it could very quickly reverse itself if next week's May trade figures are disappointing.'' The dollar's movement against the yen may be a reflection of more fundamental changes related to oil prices, according to some economists. ''There has been a real deterioration in the outlook for Japanese financial assets,'' said David Hale, the chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, citing sharp declines in Japanese stock and bond prices. Japanese investors have been rushing to move assets overseas in anticipation of further declines and the negative impact of higher oil prices on Japan. 'An Anglo-Saxon Rally' ''You are looking at an Anglo-Saxon currency rally,'' Mr. Hale added, noting that British sterling, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar had all performed strongly against the yen and European currencies in recent weeks. However, Mr. Hale said, the upward pressure on the dollar could be restrained by reduced Japanese and European investment liquidity as higher oil prices take hold. With oil at $20 a barrel, those countries will be spending billions of dollars that had gone into international investments. ---- GOLD PRICES RISE By The Associated Press Gold prices increased yesterday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a closing bid for gold bullion of $444.75 an ounce, up $1 from Tuesday's late bid. Gold bullion for current delivery closed at $446.80 on the New York Commodity Exchange, up $3 from Tuesday's close. In London, gold traded at a late bid price of $445.50 an ounce, up $3.50 from late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose $2.50 to close at a bid of $446.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold traded at a bid of $443, down from $446.26.

1209-> COMPANY NEWS; Sun Introduces Work Stations
Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced a line of computer work stations yesterday that offers performance comparable to a minicomputer for one-tenth the price. Analysts said the work stations, which are intended for such elaborate computations as computer-aided engineering and design, would give Sun a leg up on its competitors. Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., shares leadership in the $2.5 billion work station market with Apollo Computer Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass. Sun's new work stations employ a new architecture based on what is called reduced-instruction-set-computer technology, or R.I.S.C. In a move intended to establish its work stations as an industry standard, Sun announced that it planned to license its R.I.S.C. design to three chip makers, Fujitsu Microelectronics Inc., the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and Bipolar Integrated Technology Inc. Sun Microsystem's shares closed yesterday at $36.875, up $1.75, in national over-the counter trading. On Tuesday, the company's stock plunged $5.25, to $35.125.

1211-> DARLING ADJUSTS AND WINS
Ron Darling did not need to be told that the hurdle he passed Tuesday night was vitally important. He had gone 76 days and nights without winning, a span of 15 pitching assignments, 6 losses, 8 games without a decision and untold misery for himself and the Mets. Then, finally, a victory. ''The team needs me,'' Darling said in a clubhouse that was nearly empty of players and celebration following a doubleheader sweep of the Atlanta Braves. ''My starts are not any more important than anyone else's on this team, but last year at this time I had nine wins and this year I have three. One of our strengths last season was the ability of the starting pitchers to win ball games, and we just haven't done it this season.'' Darling's streak had been, he said, ''a big monkey on my back.'' Each game only added to the pressure of pitching the next time. But Tuesday, in the second game against the Braves, he struggled through two difficult innings, gave up one run and almost surrendered another, then retired nine batters in a row and found a rhythm. He came out for a pinch-hitter in the seventh after the Mets had taken a 2-1 lead. They eventually won, 5-1. ''He made an adjustment in the game that helped,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. ''Early, he was trying to throw the ball by everybody, and he had already thrown 52 pitches after two innings. In the third, I told him to cut down on his pitches, and he made the adjustment. He got people to hit the ball, and when he saw that it worked, he stayed with it.'' Darling won 15 games for the Mets last season and was counted on for more after winning a one-year salary of $1,050,000 in arbitration. Then, after Dwight Gooden was sent to a drug rehabilitation center and Bob Ojeda was disabled in late May because of bone chips in his elbow, Darling became even more important to his team. But rather than relieve the pressure on the pitching staff, Darling added to it. Psychologically, he said, he could not evaluate the difficulty of pitching without winning. ''I'm not a psychologist,'' Darling said, ''so I don't know. But it's tough when you don't win just as it's tough if you're a hitter and you're 0 for 40.'' ''When something like this happens,'' said Darling, ''it's hard on my teammates because they start trying too hard.'' ''It was a big win for us and a monstrous win for him,'' said Stottlemyre. ''I'm just glad it's over,'' said Darling.

1214-> Sailor Finishes Global Course in Growing Up
At the time, the choice seemed simple. Eighteen-year-old Tania Aebi was a rebellious teen-ager, a high-school graduate with no plans for the future who was working as a bicycle messenger in Manhattan. Her father gave her an unusual option: he would send her to college or he would buy a small boat for her to sail around the world. On May 28, 1985, she set sail from New York alone on Varuna, a new 26-foot sloop. Today, 21-year-old Tania Aebi received her equivalent of a college diploma as she finished a 27,000-mile solo voyage around the world. This afternoon, Miss Aebi (pronounced AB-bey) was sailing offshore about 50 miles southeast of New York Harbor when her father, Ernst, and a group of well-wishers met her at the end of the final, 3,200-mile leg from Gibraltar. The lone sailor waved and shouted, ecstatic that her long voyage was over. She called to her father for a towline, but 30-knot winds and building eight-foot seas prevented any assistance until this evening, when the Coast Guard at Sandy Hook sent a vessel out to get her. ''The result of this trip is infinitely better than my wildest dreams,'' said Mr. Aebi, a New York artist. ''In lieu of college, she got so much more. ''She always used to procrastinate. But on a boat, when something goes wrong, you have to fix it. You can't procrastinate.'' Miss Aebi, who was born, reared and educated in New York City, did not take much of a sailing background on her voyage. In 1984, she and her father sailed across the Atlantic, but they did so as novices. She then took a correspondence course in navigation. Still, she came close to setting an official record for being the youngest person to sail around the world alone, and the first American woman to do so. But last July, when she gave a ride to an acquaintance from American Samoa to another South Pacific island, she unwittingly compromised the voyage's status. The good-will gesture - a trip of less than 80 miles - caused her to lose her place in the record books, so the tow here today did not undermine such an achievement. Olivier Berner, whom she met at Vanuatu, northeast of Australia, was on hand to meet her here today. He said Miss Aebi had thought nothing of the ride she gave the acquaintance, since covering 80 miles in the South Pacific is like crossing the Upper Bay in Manhattan. Mr. Berner, a Swiss solo sailor, accompanied Miss Aebi in his 31-foot boat from the South Pacific to Malta, in the Mediterranean. He left her there, and she sailed on to Gibraltar. She left Gibraltar on Sept. 16 for home. Near the end of the final leg today, her father, perched precariously on the stern of a powerboat, tossed Miss Aebi a bag of food - fresh fruit, including raspberries and cream - and clothing. Mr. Aebi had missed several attempts at getting a line to her. She called back, ''Daddy, you never could throw a line.'' When asked how she felt, Miss Aebi sighed, grinned and said, ''Tired.'' She had promised her father that, as part of the experience, she would write about the trip. Her accounts have been printed in Cruising World magazine. The trip was not easy. Her mother, Sabine, died from cancer midway through the voyage, and Miss Aebi flew back to New York for a week. Last July, she collided with a freighter as she maneuvered her boat through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean. And later, the boat capsized in a storm in the Mediterranean. It righted itself, but Miss Aebi lost some gear, and most of her electronic equipment. Her father flew to Gibraltar with new equipment. Now that she is home, she must choose whether to sell the boat to pay back her father. She owes him $25,000 of the $40,000 the boat cost; the rest he considers the equivalent of a college tuition. Miss Aebi's 19-year-old sister, Nina, and her 18-year-old brother, Tony, were expected to arrive home from college tonight to meet her when she arrives at South Street Seaport after spending the night at Sandy Hook. Her youngest sister, 17-year-old Jade, planned to be one of the greeters today, but she has a perfect attendance record at the Bronx High School of Science, and didn't want to miss school, not even for a round-the-world sailor.

1215-> Hart Sees a Sympathy Vote
Gary Hart says there is a sympathetic response to his political fall that has convinced him a backlash vote exists, one he describes as ''the victim's vote.'' For the first time in his life, ''black people come up to me on the street and want to shake hands with me,'' he told Hunter S. Thompson in an interview published in The San Francisco Examiner today. Mr. Hart also said he felt that the field for the Democratic Presidential nomination was wide open. ''There may be more entries,'' he said. ''Any handicapping right now is going to be folly.'' Mr. Thompson said the interview took place while Mr. Hart was preparing for a speech to be given later this week and for an hourlong appearance Tuesday night on the ABC News program ''Nightline,'' scheduled to begin at 11:30 P.M. The article described the television appearance as one in which Mr. Hart ''will have to make a major statement about whether or not he would get back into the Presidential race.''

1216-> Credit Card Interest, Unmasked
These days, creditworthy corporations pay 10 or 11 percent to borrow from banks. How come some banks charge credit card customers, even those who never miss a payment, 22 or 23 percent? Some of the additional interest covers the cost of processing small loans. But some banks take advantage of consumers who don't have the time or initiative to shop around. That's the reason to support the sensible bill by Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn that requires full disclosure on credit card solicitations - and to oppose an alternative proposal to cap credit card interest. Banks aren't fooling when they complain that it costs a lot to serve credit card customers. According to the Federal Reserve, the average profit margin on credit card loans is considerably lower than on commercial credit balances. Yet there's plenty of profit in large loans to customers who pay promptly and rarely question bills. Representative Frank Annunzio of Chicago would limit profits by capping credit card interest at 8 percent above the prime rate, or 17 percent today. What's wrong with that? The cap would discourage banks from issuing cards to marginal credit risks, like young wage earners. It would also reduce incentives to provide extra services - long interest-free grace periods, mileage points for airlines' frequent flyer clubs. And it would almost certainly lead to higher annual fees. Disclosure would make it easier to find low-interest credit cards and would not choke competition. Representative Schumer and the American Bankers Association would require companies soliciting credit card customers to state in plain language the interest rate, annual fee and length of the grace period. Banks would still be free to charge whatever the traffic would bear. But the traffic would know just how much it was bearing. The House is to vote on Mr. Schumer's bill this week. The only serious obstacle is a last-ditch effort to substitute the Annunzio interest rate cap. Disclosure is the better way.

1217-> GOLDMAN BAND IN PACT WITH ITS MUSICIANS
Two weeks after the scheduled beginning of its 70th anniversary season, the Goldman Memorial Band reached a settlement with its players and immediately started rehearsing for a concert last night at the Damrosch Park band shell. The one-year agreement, ratified by a vote of 19 to 15 yesterday afternoon, entails concessions from the players on wages and the number of concerts to be played. But provisions that led to the rejection of a similar contract last week were either deleted or modified. The basic shape of the settlement had already been agreed to and reported. It calls for wages of $65 for each concert (down from $75), for 20 concerts over the course of the summer (down from 30) and for a reshaping of the band's governing board. To the three members of the existing board will be added two chosen by the players from among themselves and two more chosen by the Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, who assisted in mediating the dispute, which had threatened the band's continuation. The sticking point last week had come over some clarifications of detail drafted by the band's president and conductor, Ainslee Cox. The union contends the band still owes its players $43,000 in wages from the 1986 season, and the paragraph of clarification offered last week had specified that funds granted or solicited for the 1987 season could not be applied to the old debt unless the donors so specified in writing. The agreement adopted yesterday instead calls on the yet-to-be-named board to examine the terms of such grants and solicitations in order to determine whether any formal restriction on their use exists, according to Leonard Liebowitz, the attorney for Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. The contract further provides that donors may give permission orally for their grants to be applied to the debt. Also deleted was a provision barring the members of the Goldman Band from using the band's name in organizing concerts under their own auspices. That provision was aimed at a labor dispute tactic used by the Goldman players two weeks ago when they performed as ''members of the Goldman Band.'' The deletion preserves this option, which is occasionally adopted by striking orchestras, for possible future use.

1218-> Sports of The Times; THE MCHECTOR BACKFIELD
IN this strike-snarled season, the real Jets had not won a game in seven weeks, not since they stunned the New England Patriots for a 2-0 start. But in their 30-14 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Monday night after that dreary display against the Indianapolis Colts, the real Jets reappeared. And when they returned to their locker room, Joe Walton addressed them. ''Now you're my team again,'' the coach said. Now the Jets share first place in the American Conference East with all four of their divisional rivals, the first five-way tie at 4-4 in National Football League history. For all five teams, a seven-game season will begin Sunday with the Jets in Kansas City where Walton hopes to continue to use Freeman McNeil and Johnny Hector in the same backfield. Not since John Riggins and Emerson Boozer and, earlier, Boozer and Matt Snell, have two such explosive running backs lined up together for the Jets. One potential problem: neither McNeil nor Hector is the blocker that Boozer and Snell were for the Super Bowl III champions, or Riggins later on. That will jeopardize Ken O'Brien against blitzing linebackers. The rookie fullback, Roger Vick, hasn't performed as effectively as the Jets hoped he would and, as a result, Walton wants to see what the McHector backfield can do. When they're together, the 200-pound Hector is the fullback, the 214-pound McNeil the halfback. ''We've wanted to do this in the past,'' Walton said. ''But whenever we thought about it, one of 'em got hurt.'' One of 'em also got hurt late in Monday night's game. Hector hobbled to the sideline on a sprained right ankle and a bruised knee after having spun and darted for 63 yards in 20 carries, including a 1-yard leap for the clinching touchdown. ''We don't know yet,'' Walton said yesterday, ''if Johnny will be able to play Sunday.'' McNeil rushed for 42 yards and caught three passes for 34 yards, including an ad-libbed short flea-flicker from O'Brien for 26 yards. That play preceded the go-ahead touchdown on O'Brien's 4-yard pass to Billy Griggs late in the third quarter after the Seahawks had snatched a 14-13 lead. As the game developed, McNeil and Hector often lined up together but Hector had started at halfback instead of the Jets' career-rushing leader. McNEIL had been benched by Walton, who thereby put the other Jets on notice that anybody else could be benched. McNeil had rushed for only 151 yards in four previous games. Even one of the Jet imposters, the now departed Eddie Hunter, had rushed for 161 in the three games during the strike. And before last Tuesday's trade deadline, the Jets had talked about shipping McNeil to the Los Angeles Rams for LeRoy Irvin, an all-Pro cornerback. ''Getting benched happens,'' McNeil said, ''but you've got to be positive about it.'' McNeil was embarrassed by his benching, but he didn't make things worse for himself and for the team by griping or sulking as some celebrated running backs might. When he was inserted in Monday night's game, he responded the way a real pro does. And after the Jets appeared in danger of turning what had been a 14-0 lead into another dreary loss, maybe his attitude helped his teammates respond so well in the final 20 minutes. ''We had to sit down and realize that you can't win as individuals,'' Walton said of the Jets' comeback from the loss to the Colts. ''This isn't a 9-to-5 job. It's spirit, emotion, and playing together.'' For whatever reason, the Seahawks were as dismal as the Jets had been the week before. The Seahawks arrived with a 5-2 record, a Super Bowl XXII candidate expected to overtake the San Diego Chargers in the A.F.C. West. But the Seahawks returned to Seattle wondering what happened while the Monday night television audience was left wondering how Brian Bosworth, the noisy rookie linebacker, ever convinced the Seahawks he was worth $11 million over 10 years. Boz wasn't worth 11 cents Monday night. WITH all five of its teams at 4-4, meanwhile, the A.F.C. East has produced the N.F.L.'s ultimate parity, or parody. If the Jets are to win the divisional title, they might need to create a cushion before finishing the season at Giants Stadium against the Philadelphia Eagles and the Giants. But the Jets' chances will primarily depend on their three remaining games with divisional rivals. They oppose the Buffalo Bills at Giants Stadium a week from Sunday, go to Miami for a Monday night game on Dec. 7 and to New England on Dec. 13. By a quirk of the schedule, none of the A.F.C. East teams was listed to play a divisional rival in the third week of the season. Those were the games that won't be made up because of the strike. Technically then, there won't be any gaps in the intradivisional games. But the strike already has created an imbalance in the standings. During the three weeks of the imposter games, the Colts and the Patriots each were 2-1, while the Jets, Dolphins and Bills each were 1-2. In the end, those games could make a difference in the final A.F.C. East standings. Injuries, of course, will make the big difference, as they always do. And the Jets are hurting. They've lost Wesley Walker, their 32-year-old longtime wide receiver, for at least four games with a separated right shoulder and Mickey Shuler, their Pro Bowl tight end, for at least Sunday's game with a severely sprained ankle. The Jets are Joe Walton's team again. But even with Freeman McNeil and Johnny Hector in the same backfied, all the real Jets aren't available.

1219-> Mets Counting on Pitchers, Ready or Not
Even Dwight Gooden admitted it yesterday before the Mets flew to San Francisco for their most dangerous trip of the season: When you restore three pitchers to your five-man rotation with only five weeks to go, there is no room for error. ''I came back in June, when there was time to adjust,'' Gooden said. ''These three guys are coming back late in August, when there's no time to adjust or to get heated up. And they're all coming back off injuries. ''I was ready mentally, but not as strong physically, and it took me a couple of starts to get things together. I had a lot of pressure, but I also had a lot of time. Now we're putting three guys back into the rotation, and there's no time. We've got to win right now.'' It was, Dave Johnson agreed, a neat trick. In a four-day span in the last week, the Mets reclaimed Sid Fernandez, Rick Aguilera and David Cone, three of their five starting pitchers, three graduates of the disabled list. In one way, it was cause for rejoicing; in another way, cause for concern. As Gooden said, there was no time left for prolonged comebacks. 35 Games to Go The Mets took their reclamation project to California for nine games in three cities, four and a half games behind the St. Louis Cardinals with 35 left to play. Six of the 35 games are against the Cardinals, and three of those are in St. Louis on the final weekend. Ready or not, Johnson said, now's the time to pitch. ''Who knows, you might even see Bobby Ojeda starting one of those final three games in St. Louis,'' the manager of the Mets said. ''I still don't have him back. But in September, there's no place to send him to pitch. There won't be any Tidewater team for him to join for rehab, if those guys are in their own playoffs. He would have to do it right here with the Mets.'' Meanwhile, two of the three pitchers who returned to the staff were beaten in their first starts. Fernandez, who missed 25 days with a sore left shoulder, was mauled by the San Diego Padres when he returned last Saturday night. Aguilera, disabled for three months with a sore right elbow, beat the Los Angeles Dodgers with seven sizzling innings when he returned Monday night. Cone, also disabled for three months with a fractured finger, worked well but was outpitched by Fernando Valenzuela the next night. The two other starters are Gooden, who missed April and May while undergoing therapy for drug abuse, and Ron Darling, who went 14 straight games without winning but who has won 9 of his last 11. He pitched another beauty Wednesday night when the Mets defeated the Dodgers, 3-2. Finally there is Ojeda, the best pitcher on the staff last year, but just now starting to throw again, three months after surgery on his left elbow. What are the chances that Fernandez, Aguilera and Cone will pitch at their best after missing a combined total of seven months' work? New Experience ''I've never played or managed on a team that lost six pitchers,'' Johnson said, ''or that tried to win with three who got back into the rotation late in the season. You're talking about one-sixth of the season to go. ''The Cardinals finally got John Tudor back after three and a half months, and Danny Cox after one month. Now they're at full strength, but those guys needed time to adjust. Jimmy Frey won the division with the Chicago Cubs in 1984, then lost all of his pitchers with injuries in 1985 and the year after that got fired. And when I was playing for Baltimore, we won the World Series in 1966 and then lost Jim Palmer and two other pitchers the next year and finished sixth. ''When I was managing Jackson for the Mets in Double-A ball, they were always raiding the team for Triple-A when they needed help. And when I was managing Tidewater, the Mets one year took Walt Terrell, Ron Darling and Darryl Strawberry. Half my team went. We went from the team with the most power to a team on a 13-game losing streak.'' He laughed, and said: ''We just qualified for the playoff, and I told the Mets that I needed help. I had to have that kid pitching in the Carolina League: Dwight Gooden. I got him for the playoff, and we won the championship.'' When the Mets open the trip in Candlestick Park tonight, Johnson will have his man on the mound again when Gooden opens the series against the Giants. Then the Mets will trot out their three-man reclamation project, and hold their collective breath. Magadan Makes the Trip Dave Magadan, whose wife has chicken pox, was cleared to travel with the team by the Mets' doctors, who said there was a ''very slight chance'' he could come down with the disease. The team, however, will try to limit his contact with Jesse Orosco and Barry Lyons, who have not had the disease.

1220-> Brokerage Stocks Fall; Large Losses Rumored
The stock price of nearly every major brokerage house tumbled yesterday, as rumors circulated that a number of the firms, including E.F. Hutton Group Inc., Bear Stearns Companies and Morgan Stanley & Co., had sustained big trading losses over the last few days. Most of the firms denied that they were in trouble. Hutton issued a statement denying rumors that it faced bankruptcy. Merrill Lynch declared that its capital position had not been damaged, and said that with its stock at current levels it intended to purchase up to 5 million shares as conditions warranted. But a number of analysts said that some firms had been damaged. ''There has been a reduction in their excess net capital,'' said Perrin H. Long, an analyst who follows brokerage firms for Lipper Analytical Securities. ''And there is reason to think that if equity prices do not pick up from these levels, that profitability could be impaired in 1988.'' Higher stock prices mean bigger commissions for brokers. And while yesterday's 102.27-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average was a welcome respite from the carnage of the past week, few experts expect the market to turn on a dime and head straight up again. Those and other thoughts were on the minds of investors, who in some cases pushed brokerage stock prices so low that they fell below book value for the firms. The First Boston Corporation was one example. Yesterday the stock fell by $6.875, to a close of $26.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. ''The fact that a lot of these stocks are trading under book value tells you how much worry there is,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. Other firms were also hit hard. Hutton, which announced higher quarterly earnings yesterday, saw its stock slide by $6.375, to $16.75. Morgan Stanley, one of the nation's most prestigious investment banks, saw its stock fall by $9 a share, to $55.50. In spite of the huge move in equity prices, a number of Wall Street executives said bond trading losses sustained during April and May, when interest rates suddendly turned upward, were greater than what has happened over the last few days. Nevertheless, some firms acknowledged that risk arbitrage and over-the-counter losses were sustained, and that margin calls were up. ''When a market drops this precipitously you have to lose some money,'' said Robert E. Linton, chairman of Drexel, Burnham Lambert. ''We have had a profitable nine months, and we were profitable in October until this occurred. We just gave some of that back.'' John H. Gutfruend, chairman and chief executive of Salomon Inc., said: ''we made money in stock trading and lost it in the value of the inventory we were carrying. And there is no question that the arbitrage community was brutalized in this market.''

1222-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Hits 5-Year Low Against British Pound
The dollar closed mixed in domestic trading yesterday after aggressive selling in Europe pushed the currency to recent lows against several major foreign currencies. Gold prices moved higher. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $476.25 late in the day, up $3 from Friday's late bid. In European trading, the dollar fell to a five-year low against the British pound amid speculation that international efforts to stabilize the currency were faltering. But traders in New York said the downward momentum seemed to dissipate in domestic trading. The dollar closed up against the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar and was heading higher against the West German mark after a sharp plunge in Friday's session. Focus Still on Stock Markets Attention continued to center on stock markets throughout the world, where share prices receded across the boards. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 156.83 points, to 1,793.93, its second worst point loss ever. Trading was relatively quiet. ''Traders were mystified at the lack of activity in foreign exchange market compared to the significant moves we're seeing in stock and bond markets,'' said James Vice, a vice president and senior corporate trader at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Traders said the dollar edged up from its lows for the day amid fears of central bank intervention. The Bank of England was believed to have stepped in to buy an undetermined number of dollars. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 141.85, down from 144.15 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 141.95 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 142.34 yen, up from 141.80 on Friday. Pound Closes Higher In London, the pound rose to a five-year high of $1.6880, up from $1.6570 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.6870 to buy a pound, more than the $1.6830 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in New York included: 1.7763 West German marks, down from 1.7782; 1.4625 Swiss francs, down from 1.4713; 5.9455 French francs, down from 5.9555; 1,283.75 Italian lire, down from 1,285.00, and 1.3158 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3128. Other late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.7730 West German marks, down from 1.7880; 1.4625 Swiss francs, down from 1.4963; 5.9385 French francs, down from 6.0335; 1.9950 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0325; 1,282.75 Italian lire, down from 1,301.25, and 1.3135 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3157. Gold prices rose sharply in volatile trading, but participants were cautiously awaiting further developments in the world's stock markets, bullion dealers said. Gold closed at $476.20 an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange, up from $473.40 late Friday. In London, the metal jumped to a late bid price of $476 an ounce, up from $472 late Friday. In Zurich, it rose to $476.50 from $473.50 late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $475.27, down from $475.83.

1224-> KOCH AND PUBLIC OPINION: GETTING THE HOMELESS OFF THE STREETS
With his new plan to remove more mentally ill homeless people from New York City's streets, Mayor Koch has again demonstrated his acute sense of popular opinion and political timing. The Mayor has positioned himself at the fore of growing public sentiment to do something about the pathetic street dwellers who have become symbols of urban misery in the 1980's. Mr. Koch received a warm reception when he outlined the plan at a meeting of the American Psychological Association last week. His plan also won praise in samplings of opinion ranging from man-in-the-street newspaper interviews to radio talk-show callers. Similar proposals have been made by Mr. Koch in years past, but they always met resistance from civil-rights leaders, mental health officials and advocates for the homeless as well as from within his own administration. 'In Our Corner' Now, the Mayor said, he is pressing the plan more strongly because the public mood has changed. ''Common sense has taken over the city,'' he said. ''The public is in our corner. What I think is what most people think.'' Even Mr. Koch's critics agree with his assessment. Robert M. Hayes, the leader of the Coalition for the Homeless, said, ''The Mayor is the best barometer of public opinion because unfortunately he responds to public pressure, not to human need.'' For years, the city has hospitalized those disturbed people who presented ''imminent'' danger to themselves or others. Last year, 125 such people were picked up. Under the latest plan, city teams of psychiatrists, nurses and social workers will be directed to hospitalize homeless people who clearly cannot care for themselves. The plan evolves from earlier efforts. The Mayor dispatched midnight vans to Grand Central Terminal and other unsanctioned refuges to invite the homeless to city shelters. He ordered that in freezing weather the police take homeless people to hospitals or shelters against their will. A Return Tour While those efforts aided the cause, they did not solve the problem. It was on a return tour with caseworkers for the homeless in May - when Mr. Koch found some of the same troubled people on the street, beyond the grasp of the existing programs - that he decided on his new initiative. After the tour, aides described the Mayor as upset, even furious. ''He feels the frustration acutely,'' said First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff. Some officials are now concerned that with all the attention over the Mayor's plan, which is to begin next month, some people may not understand how limited its goals are. ''If, in overemphasizing this issue, people are under the impression that we're going to sweep the streets clean, that they'll get up the morning of Oct. 1 and all the homeless are going to be gone, well, that's not going to happen,'' said Martin S. Begun, the chairman of the Community Services Board, which advises the city's Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services. Mr. Koch is focusing only on the most severely disturbed of the homeless. The Mayor has emphasized that they are a small, albeit highly visible, percentage of the city's homeless people. He estimates this group at 500, while the total number of homeless on the streets runs into the thousands. 'Public-Relations Bonanza' Advocates for the homeless, even those with reservations about the Mayor's plan, are glad that it has raised expectations. ''The Mayor reaped a public-relations bonanza that may come back to haunt him,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''A fairly modest program got trumpeted into more than it was. I say, thank God, because it's going to increase the pressure on him to produce more housing and more psychiatric hospital beds.'' To Mr. Hayes and other critics, the Mayor has a sorry record on the homeless and is simply protecting his flanks on a potentially serious election issue, especially now that he is having 11 shelters placed, to the dismay of many, in neighborhoods across the city. ''He's had trouble with this issue for years, clearly has a negative rating on it, and here we are going into another winter,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Conversion of Hotels Some of the Mayor's critics accuse him of contributing to the general problem of the homeless by not providing enough additional housing. They also say his pro-development policies encouraged the conversion of thousands of units in single-room-occupancy hotels into luxury cooperative apartments, forcing to the streets many former mental patients who had managed a marginal existence in the hotels. They blame the Mayor as well for the overflowing psychiatric wards in city hospitals. And they condemn the shelters the city has provided for the homeless as foreboding institutions with a record of robberies, assaults, rapes and murder, sometimes even committed by shelter security guards. Mr. Koch says that while the city's efforts are far from perfect, New York is doing more for the homeless than any other city in the nation. Political Arm-Wrestling Although state officials talk of working ''hand in hand'' with the city, the maneuvers last week more resembled political arm-wrestling. The Mayor chided the state for adding to homelessness by releasing people from mental institutions without follow-up care and for refusing hundreds of patients whom the city tried to transfer from its hospitals to long-term state facilities. ''The real issue surrounding the homeless, mentally ill or not, is the lack of low-income housing needed to place people in,'' said Robert M. Spoor, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health. Mr. Koch is quick to point out that the Federal Government has cut back housing funds. ''City Hall blames Albany, Albany blames City Hall, and both blame Washington,'' Mr. Hayes, the coalition leader, said. ''The problem is that they're all right.''

1225-> INQUIRY WIDENS IN THE MURDERS OF 3 IN BROOKLYN
Investigators said yesterday that they had uncovered no connection between the gangland-style murder of a drug suspect in Brooklyn early Sunday and the similar slaying of two underworld figures in the same neighborhood three days earlier. Only the methods - the victims were all gunned down on the street by assailants who left no weapons or obvious clues - appeared to link the deaths of 42-year-old Santo Curatolo on Sunday, and those of Carmine Varriale, 31, and Frank Santora, 51, last Thursday. There were no breakthroughs in the cases, and the police said they had no suspects and were still trying to learn why the men had been slain. The police said no one had come forward who had seen the killing of Mr. Curatolo, at 74th Street and 20th Avenue in the Bensonhurst section or the murders 20 blocks away at Bath Avenue and Bay 10th Street in the Bath Beach area. Wanted on Drug Charges Detectives tapped underworld sources, interviewed relatives and acquaintances of the victims, canvassed the locales of the shootings for clues and witnesses and examined the victims' criminal records and other intelligence files in a widening search for the killers. Mr. Curatolo, whose last known address was the basement of a bar at 125 Avenue U in Bensonhurst, was wanted on drug charges by the New York police and by Federal authorities for extradition to Italy. There were no indications that he was a major figure in the narcotics trade. Nor, investigators said, was there any indication that he was a member or associate of any organized-crime group. However, detectives said they had learned that Mr. Curatolo was ''on the fringes,'' that is, acquainted with associates, of the Gambino family, the largest organized-crime group in the city. Sprawled on a Corner Mr. Curatolo, a native of Sicily who came here 24 years ago, had a record that included convictions for sodomy in 1964, assault in 1977 and possession of drugs last year. He was shot three times in the chest and twice in the head about 2:10 A.M. Residents who heard the shots called the police, who found the body sprawled on a street corner. The victim had $18 in his pockets, four gold chains and other jewelry and a .22-caliber gun in a leg holster. The police said he was divorced. Blue Car Speeding Away Both victims in the shootings Thursday, according to the police, had ties to organized-crime groups. Mr. Varriale, of 18 Allen Court in Port Richmond, Staten Island, was described as a rising member of the Lucchese crime family, and Mr. Santora, of 2134 79th Street in Bensonhurst, was said to be associated with the Gambino and Bonanno organzations. Although there were no known witnesses to the Bath Beach shootings, residents said they saw a blue car speed away afterward. Mr. Varriale was the fifth member of his family to be slain on the streets of Brooklyn since 1975. Mr. Santora was paroled from Federal prison last year, after serving about six years in a multimillion-dollar fraud case.

1226-> Bristol-Myers's Net Up 15.1%
The Bristol-Myers Company said yesterday that earnings had increased by 15.1 percent in the third quarter, to a record $200.2 million, or 70 cents a share, from $173.9 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Bristol-Myers, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter remedies and health- and beauty-care products, also reported record sales for the quarter of $1.4 billion, up 7.1 percent from 1.3 billion in the 1986 period. The company said its domestic sales, accounting for about three-fourths of total sales, rose 7 percent in the quarter. International sales increased 13 percent. Currency fluctuations so far this year have increased sales of $4 billion by about 1 percent.

1227-> Stark Hesseltine Dies; Was Theatrical Agent
Stark Hesseltine, a theatrical agent who represented some well-known actors and actresses in his career, died of an AIDS-related illness last Wednesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 58 years old and a resident of Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I. According to associates in the theater, Mr. Hesseltine's gift as an agent was finding new talent, and they credited him with the discovery of Robert Redford and Christopher Reeve, among others. Alone or with others he also represented Elizabeth Ashley, Christopher Hewett, Sam Waterson, Barbara Bel Geddes, Dina Merrill, Linda Lavin, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. Born in Massachusetts, he was graduated from Harvard University in 1952. He began his career in New York in the early 1950's as casting director for the Phoenix Theater. While there he was co-producer of the successsful revue ''Phoenix 55.'' He was an actor's agent at the Music Corporation of America from 1955 to 1962, when he joined two colleagues, Leo Bookman and Richard Seff, to form HBS Ltd., which represented many actors and actresses. The HBS partnership was absorbed in 1969 by Creative Management Associates, at which time Mr. Hesseltine joined C.M.A. as vice president of its legitimate talent department. In 1975 he joined Robert Baker to form Hesseltine, Baker Associates Ltd., from which he retired in 1984 at the age of 55. There are no immediate survivors.

1228-> Aquino Declares Start Of Strong, Direct Rule
Addressing doubts about her forcefulness and effectiveness, President Corazon C. Aquino declared today that she was inaugurating a period of strong, direct presidential leadership. Asserting that ''the coup bubble is burst,'' she urged an audience of businesmen to get the economy moving and said she would take care of threats to peace and order. ''Henceforth, I shall rule directly as President,'' she said. ''To the ad hoc committees and commissions created to inform me on their special areas, I now add one more: an action committee with a single member - me.'' Mrs. Aquino ordered a series of showpiece actions including the cleaning up of garbage and filling of potholes in Manila, a halt to projected power-rate increases, quicker responses by the telephone company to complaints and an inquiry on electric-power failures. On more substantive issues, she said that she had ordered the military to pursue Communist insurgents ''with absolute vigor'' and that she would take a hard line to curb strikes. She also said she had instructed the National Bureau of Investigation to pursue allegations of corruption in Government and to give priority to charges against senior officials.

1229-> Space Weapon Is Disparaged by Missile Lab
An orbiting weapon meant to destroy enemy missiles by smashing into them will fail to shield the United States from new Soviet missiles planned for the next decade, according to a report by a Federal laboratory working on President Reagan's antimissile plan. The weapon, which would collide with missiles at high speed, destroying them by force of impact rather than a chemical explosion, is at the heart of a rudimentary antimissile system that the Administration is considering for deployment in the 1990's. Later in the development of the ''Star Wars'' antimissile plan, defensive systems more sophisticated than these kinetic kill weapons are envisioned that might use such exotic weapons as high-power lasers and nuclear particle beams. ''We are very skeptical of relying on the first generation of kinetic kill vehicles to provide any real protection against future threats,'' said Christopher T. Cunningham, the head of strategic defense systems studies at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which sponsored of the study. Livermore, a Federal facility of some 8,000 people, is a leading center for work on the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. ''This shows that it wouldn't work against the emerging Soviet missile threat, and that analysis doesn't even include direct attacks on the antimissile system,'' said Dr. Sidney D. Drell, a physicist and co-director of the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University. Future Soviet Missiles Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has said a rudimentary but effective antimissile system could be deployed by 1994 using the kinetic space weapons. But the Livermore report, a summary of which appears in the July issue of the laboratory's Energy and Technology Review magazine said the system would be effective only against Soviet missiles now in use and would be quickly defeated by those being planned. The report was first obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle, which published a story about it yesterday. The laboratory's report says it would take ''a few thousand'' kinetic kill weapons in orbit to knock out a sizable fraction of the current Soviet arsenal of SS-18 and SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missiles. But it says newer SS-24 and SS-25 missiles, which the Pentagon expects the Soviet Union to install in the next decade, will be much harder to destroy because their boosters will burn faster and make it much harder for the space-based weapon to knock them out before they release their warheads. The study found that destroying 90 percent of the projected threat would take an orbiting arsenal of about 100,000 kinetic kill vehicles. The report suggested that military planners pay more attention to enhancements of the Soviet arsenal and the possible challenge these could pose to any space-based weapon. The report took its description of future Soviet rocketry from the book Soviet Military Power, published by the Pentagon.

1230-> Film: 'La Vie Est Belle'
''LA VIE EST BELLE'' is a genial musical comedy film from Zaire, and there are two striking things about it: how very African it is, and how very African it is not. In the former category, there is a plot about a rich man who visits a witch doctor to cure his impotency problems, and about the annoyance of his wife (Landu Nzunzimbu) when he marries a second woman who is much more beautiful than she. There is also the presence of Papa Wemba, a celebrated singing star in his native land, and the vibrantly colored native fabrics that the film's leading actresses wear. Their hairdos are astonishing as well, and vary greatly from scene to scene. Less indigenously African is the sight of the rich man, Nvouandou (Kanku Kasongo), tooling through the streets of Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, in his showy Mercedes, or the decor of Nvouandou's lavish home, which looks a lot like a run-down, 50's-modern American motel. ''La Vie Est Belle,'' which was co-directed by a Zairian (Ngangura Mweze) and a Belgian (Benoit Lamy), takes an easy and humorous look at these seeming contrasts, and also presents the affable personality of Mr. Wemba, who if not superstellar is certainly a pleasant, unaffected actor and a disarming musician. Mr. Wemba plays a ragged, humble rural fellow who dreams of becoming a singing star, and who catches the eye of Kabibi (Krubwa Bibi), a poor girl who happens to be a ravishing beauty. If you didn't know Mr. Wemba was the singing sensation of Zaire you might wonder what Kabibi sees in Kourou, the character he plays, since she is also being relentlessly pursued by Nvouandou. Credibility, however, counts for very little in a film mostly given over to street singing, mild comedy and local atmosphere. With its sizable cast of supporting characters (including a smiling dwarf who peddles kebabs at the market and always seems to be singing the title song), ''La Vie Est Belle'' offers a good look at Zaire's nightlife. The film, which opens today at Film Forum 1, has a lot more technical polish than its plot suggests, and it has been handsomely photographed by Michel Baudour, with bright, flat tones that suit the sunny scenery. Dites-Moi Pourquoi LA VIE EST BELLE, directed by Benoit Lamy and Ngangura Mweze; written (French with English subtitles) by Mr. Mweze, Maryse Leon and Mr. Lamy; director of photography, Michel Baudour; edited by Martine Giordano; music by Papa Wemba, Tshala Muana, Zaiko Langa Langa and Klody; produced by Mr. Lamy and Vera Belmont; released by Lamy Films.

1231-> HIGH-FASHION MALL ATTRACTS TOP DESIGNERS
Hermes, Valentino, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton. These names don't normally appear on signs in shopping malls in this part of the country. But those names - and more - can be found at the Americana in Manhasset, L.I. The shopping center has been called the Madison Avenue of the North Shore. It has been compared to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. While it has boutiques in common with both those shopping areas, it has a character all its own. And that character has been enhanced by the recent appearance of three high-fashion boutiques: Hermes, which opened July 23, Armani and Valentino, both of which are opening today. The Americana is not one of the new breed of multilevel covered malls but a string of 63 one-story shops with tasteful storefronts, trees and flower plantings, which face Northern Boulevard. Its customers, many of whom are 40 years old and under, arrive in Jaguars, Mercedeses, BMW's and the latest chic wheels: Jeeps. Their dress is casual, in keeping with Long Island's everyday style, but the button-down shirt is from Brooks Brothers, the cashmere sweater from Ralph Lauren, the handbag from Vuitton and the scarf from Hermes. ''We've got lots of Yuppies, and they all have to have something from Hermes,'' said Charlotte Pickman-Gertz, who opened the Hermes boutique. The shop is a miniature version of the Hermes shops on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore in Paris and on East 57th Street in New York. Like the other Hermes boutiques, it was designed by Rena Dumas, wife of Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes, chairman of the company, with cherrywood vitrines and frosted light fixtures. It carries clothing, china, table linens, beach towels, neckties, leather goods and, of course, scarfs. Mrs. Pickman-Gertz carved the long, narrow space out of the Saint Laurent Rive Gauche boutique she opened 10 years ago. ''When we first opened,'' she recalled, ''we had to teach Saint Laurent to Long Island.'' Now, in addition to Saint Laurent, she also sells Karl Lagerfeld, Armani's less expensive White Label collection and Missoni's new Dona line. The First to Move In Hirshleifer's, whose main store is in Forest Hills, Queens, was the first high-fashion boutique in the Americana when it opened 30 years ago. The shopping center at that time consisted of supermarkets and such retailers as J. J. Newberry and Lerner's, said Frank Castagna, president of Fifth Avenue of Long Island Realty Associates, owners and operators of the shopping center. ''If we had tried to go the high-fashion route back in the 1950's,'' Mr. Castagna said in a recent interview, ''we'd have gone bankrupt. The time wasn't right. As times changed, we made an effort to get high-fashion stores, and a momentum developed. Now, except for Waldbaum's at one end, the mall is all fashion. It's as complete a clothing statement as we can make.'' Actually, it's not all fashion. In addition to Ann Taylor, Benetton, Brooks Brothers, Sonia Rykiel, Laura Ashley, the Miss Maud division of Maud Frizon shoes, the Gap and Banana Republic, the mall has Record World, B. Dalton, Meyrowitz Optical, Lazar's Chocolates and two restaurants. And more are coming. Burberry's and Williams-Sonoma, the California purveyor of expensive cookware, are scheduled to open in October, a Coach store in January and a new Liz Claiborne retail venture, as yet unnamed, sometime next year. Meanwhile, shoppers can explore the two newest boutiques: Armani and Valentino. A free-standing shop for each of them is being opened by Hirshleifer's, whose shops in the mall already stock clothes by such designers as Ferre, Versace, Basile, Chanel, Ungaro, Missoni, Blass, Galanos, Carolyne Roehm, Carolina Herrera and Fabrice. ''We've been selling Valentino about 12 years,'' said Paul Hirshleifer, president of the company. ''We were interested in selling Armani, but they weren't interested in selling in boutiques other than their own.'' Freestanding Boutiques Then Hirshleifer's presented the idea of a freestanding boutique to each of the designers, and each said yes. The boutiques, which were designed by the architect Peter Marino, are adjacent to the main Hirshleifer's store. ''Statistically,'' Mr. Hirshleifer said, ''this area of the North Shore, which includes Oyster Bay, Locust Valley, Kings Point and Great Neck, has the highest per capita spendable income in the country. It's also a young area. The average age of our customer is under 40.'' ''It took years to get these people to come into a shopping mall,'' he continued. ''The revolution happened within the last 10 or 12 years. But they're here now.'' And so are the shops to cater to them.

1232-> THE NATION; Campaign '88 Is Boring Most of the People All of the Time
IS ''Jake and the Fatman'' destined to become the symbol of the 1987 portion of the 1988 campaign? Among evening television shows, CBS's ''Jake and the Fatman,'' about a salty district attorney, ranked 44th in the late November ratings; but it had a larger audience last week than the NBC program that brought together all 12 Presidential candidates from both parties. At one point in the debate, Vice President Bush himself said he'd rather be watching ''Jake.'' What does that say about the 1988 campaign? Perhaps not much. Most of the time, most Americans are not very interested in Presidential politics. Generally, they prefer to enrich their private and family lives and to work in their own communities if they want to express their concern for the common weal. Given that only a little over 50 percent of eligible voters have gone to the polls in recent Presidential elections, how can one expect very many people to be interested in a debate held 11 months before Election Day? Perhaps the fact that the debate drew even 15 percent of those watching television - an estimated 7.5 million people - is actually a show of national civic strength. Still, to many Americans, there does seem to be something arid about the 1988 campaign, something less than satisfying about the choices it offers and about the way issues are being discussed. One thing turning people off is the simple fact that press and television coverage has begun so early. In the past, would-be Presidents could traipse around Iowa and New Hampshire relatively free of scrutiny. They could try out themes, and if they failed, they could try others with confidence, since the only people watching were small groups in living rooms or American Legion halls. The trial-and-error method is no longer possible, given the pervasive coverage. Candidates' gaffes in living rooms two years before the election can now come back to haunt them. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. found that out when a C-SPAN videotape of what he said at a New Hampshire coffee-klatch last April emerged this fall as the final blow to his campaign. The long march of coverage also makes it harder for candidates to emerge ''suddenly'' after long groundwork to build their stature. In 1975, a little-known Governor named Jimmy Carter campaigned practically house to house, farm to farm, for months. It was not until late October that the fruits of this labor were first noticed - and many skeptics were not convinced until Mr. Carter ''won'' the Iowa caucuses the next year (even though he actually ran second to ''uncommitted.'') Now, the proliferation of public opinion polls has created a sort of political futures market, in which virtually any showing by any candidate anywhere can be discounted. Take the case of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who wanted to use the Jimmy Carter ''slow build'' strategy to run second to Gary Hart in the Iowa caucuses. Toward this end, he spent more time in Iowa than any other candidate. After Mr. Hart dropped out of the race, he leaped to the top of the polls in Iowa. Now, he has fallen back to third place. So without a vote's being cast, Mr. Gephardt finds himself being described as a ''failing'' candidate. Some politicians blame the nature of the coverage. ''The campaign has become a grinding cattle show in which all the incentives are to play for short-term advantage,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said last week in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ''If the focus were not on who's ahead in surveys, endorsements, money and Iowa trips, attention would have to be paid to what the candidates are saying - not about each other, not about the process - but about principles, problems and possible solutions.'' Others see the candidates themselves as sharing responsibility for the blandness. They seem wary of bold moves. Kirk O'Donnell, the president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic-oriented research organization here, recalled that the Democrats posted major gains in last year's Congressional elections after cautious campaigns that, in the main, did not seek to confront President Reagan's policies. In 1988, he said, Democrats may be thinking that caution will work again. Speaking of Issues . . . Moreover, he said, the Reagan Administration itself has chosen not to join many issues. He added, ''When the Administration did go confrontational, on the Bork nomination, it lost.'' Some candidates are trying harder than others to put issues on the table. Representative Jack Kemp of New York and former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware, as conservative underdogs, have been specific on all manner of questions, and they keep trying to draw the Republican front-runners, Vice President Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, into arguments. On the Democratic side, Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona, tries to press his Democratic adversaries to say clearly what they will do about the budget deficit. Mr. Babbitt, with little to lose, says he is for a tax increase. But there are severe costs even to the most modest forms of specificity, as Senator Paul Simon of Illinois has found out. Mr. Simon, now a leader in the Democratic contest, says he is for both new spending programs and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget. In the debate last week, Mr. Gephardt said this was nonsense. ''Simonomics is Reaganomics with a bow tie,'' Mr. Gephardt declared. Nonetheless, Americans can take heart in the fact that when election year really begins, issues will have to be joined, reporters will be busy covering real campaign events and the polls will be replaced by real voting. And one thing, at least, seems certain: When the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee get around to debating each other next fall, their audience will exceed that of ''Jake and the Fatman.''

1233-> THE SUMMIT; Hopes Grows for Progress on Long-Range Arms Pact
As President Reagan made final preparations for his summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, several of the President's senior advisers expressed optimism today that the two leaders could make significant progress next week toward a further agreement reducing the level of long-range nuclear weapons deployed by each side. The United States and the Soviet Union are to sign an agreement Tuesday eliminating all medium- and shorter-range missiles, as opposed to an agreement on long-range missiles. H. Allen Holmes, Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, told a pre-summit briefing that ''the chances are good'' that the leaders would agree on a set of instructions to their negotiators in Geneva ''to complete a treaty and ready it for signature in the spring.'' Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, added that recent comments by Soviet officials on the subject of strategic weapons were encouraging to the Administration. In particular, he cited Mr. Gorbachev's admission in a televised interview earlier this week that the Russians were working on a space-based anti-missile defense system, similar to Mr. Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative. Statements Being Drafted ''It does seem clear they're sending signals that they're willing to talk,'' the spokesman said in an interview. ''But we don't know what it means yet.'' Mr. Fitzwater said that the President is spending the weekend at the White House, drafting the statements and arguments he will use during five face-to-face meetings with the Soviet leader, which begin on Tuesday. The President's working document is a large briefing book compiled late Friday that summarizes all the meetings Mr. Reagan has had during the week with his chief advisers. Mr. Reagan's task this weekend is to go over the book and make notes about ''what he wants to say, and what words he wants to use,'' the spokesman said. Mr. Reagan, who likes to be carefully prepared for even the most casual meeting, is at the point of deciding what metaphors and jokes he will use in his conversations with Mr. Gorbachev. The President collects jokes that poke fun at the Soviet system, and he has told aides that he would like to tell his guest a few. Pattern for Meetings Mr. Fitzwater said that each of the meetings between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev would begin the same way: just the two leaders in the Oval Office, accompanied by two note-takers and one interpreter for each side. The group could be expanded it any time to include other experts and advisers, who will be assembled in the Cabinet Room, a few steps from the President's office. ''All the meetings are pretty much open,'' the spokesman said. ''It's up to the President and Gorbachev how they want to style them.'' While expressing optimism about the possible achievements of next week's summit in the arms control area, Administration officials today admitted a sense of disappointment that the meeting will be restricted to the Washington area, and a small corner of Washington at that. Mr. Reagan has often expressed the hope that he could give Mr. Gorbachev a tour of the United States and show him how ordinary Americans live, but the Soviet leader is going to spend all of his time at the White House and at the Soviet Embassy a few blocks away. Summit 'Isn't Broad Enough' As Rozanne Ridgway, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, put it: ''One original set of hopes, that somehow we might more broadly introduce our country to the General Secretary, is not going to be realized.'' This summit, she admitted, ''isn't broad enough'' to tell Mr. Gorbachev much about the country. ''Washington is not the United States,'' Ms. Ridgway added. In his radio address today, Mr. Reagan touched on what the Soviet leader might learn from his journey. ''It's one of my deepest hopes,'' the President said, ''that during this, his first visit to America, Mr. Gorbachev will have an opportunity to sense something of the dignity and power of human liberty.'' As he has many times, the President said he would not limit the agenda next week to arms control, but would also press Mr. Gorbachev on human rights, bilateral relations between the two countries, and regional conflicts such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua. Arms Control the Centerpiece However, arms control remains the centerpiece of the summit meeting, and American officials are eagerly trying to interpret the often sketchy and confusing comments of Soviet officials. They are encouraged by Mr. Gorbachev's admission that the Russians are building an anti-missile defense system, because they think the discussions on the subject will now go more smoothly. In the past, the Soviets have seen the American system as an insuperable obstacle to progress on strategic missile talks. Mr. Holmes called Mr. Gorbachev's admission ''noteworthy'' and added: ''So that makes us even. We have a program. They have a program.'' American officials have also been intrigued by the comments of Gennadi I. Gerasimov, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, who has indicated some flexibility on how the existing anti-ballistic missile treaty might be applied to research efforts on the anti-missile system, known as ''Star Wars.'' Signing on Tuesday ''This would seem to open the door to more productive discussions,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. The first order of business Tuesday will be the signing of a treaty banning all intermediate-range, land-based weapons. Conservative allies of Mr. Reagan have been highly criticial of the treaty, calling it a sell-out of American interests, but in his radio address, the President defended the pact as a ''good bargain, one that completely meets the long-standing goals of the United States and our allies, and advances the interests of peace.'' Earlier in the week, Mr. Reagan derided critics of the treaty, saying they were so suspicious of the Soviet Union that they believed ''war is inevitable'' between the superpowers. The treaty has become a contentious political issue in the Republican Party and a particular burden for Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader and a candidate for President. Mr. Dole has tried to walk a very thin line, supporting the President while mollifying conservatives who oppose the treaty, and today he criticized some right-wingers for making ''ridiculous personal attacks'' against the President. On Conventional Arms Senator Robert C. Byrd, the Democratic leader, also discussed the medium-range missile treaty in his party's response to the President. Mr. Byrd said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' about the treaty's chances for success, but he warned that ''the Senate will not rush the process of advice and consent.'' Mr. Byrd said many Senators want the President to give ''top priority,'' once the pact is signed, to pursuing a reduction of conventional arms in Europe, where the Russians hold a strong advantage. He also urged the President to seek a swift withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. ''I believe,'' Mr. Byrd said, ''some Senators will find it difficult to vote for the treaty if there is not real progress toward pulling Soviet troops out of Afghanistan.''

1234-> U.S. SEES RUSSIANS LAGGING ON PACT
Reagan Administration officials said today that they were concerned that Soviet negotiators were not forthcoming enough in talks aimed at wrapping up the treaty banning medium- and shorter-range arms. ''There is serious concern about Soviet behavior in Geneva,'' an official said. The treaty is to be signed at the meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month. A big problem, the officials said, was the exchange of information about each side's missile force. They said Soviet negotiators had provided general information about how many medium- and shorter-range missiles they have, but not a detailed accounting of how many of each type they have and how many are deployed. Administration officials said it was difficult to determine whether the Russians were moving slowly as a negotiating tactic or were having problems in preparing their data. The chief American negotiator, Max M. Kampelman, is to meet next week in Geneva with Yuli A. Voronstov, the top Soviet negotiator. This may provide an opportunity to make progress. Congressional Objections on Tests In another arms-control matter, Congressional opponents of nuclear testing raised objections today to a compromise worked out last week between Congressional leaders and the White House. The compromise temporarily resolved disputes over adherence to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the second strategic arms treaty of 1979, which was never approved by the Senate. The compromise also extended a ban on tests of antisatellite weapons against a target in space, but Congress dropped its demand for a ban on all but the smallest nuclear tests. Congressional opponents of testing are reported to have asked that Congressional leaders try to secure additional, minor concessions. For example, the opponents want the Administration to commission an independent report from the National Academy of Sciences on whether it is possible to keep existing nuclear weapons reliable without nuclear testing. Some Congressional aides said they expect the compromise will still be made formal. Its most important feature is a provision that would bar the Administration from preparing in fiscal 1988 for tests of the space defense system that would violate the traditional, restrictive interpretation of the ABM treaty. It would also require the Administration to dismantle an old Poseidon submarine. But the Administration would not be required to stay within the limits of the 1979 treaty.

1235-> THE NATION: UPRISINGS END; Cubans Give Up in Return for a Long Shot
FOR Federal prison officials, it was an unprecedented situation: Inmates rioting not because of overcrowded cells or poor food, but because they did not want to be deported. Cubans who had come to the United States in the Mariel boatlift of 1980, and who in some cases had been confined ever since, ended their takeovers at two Federal prisons last week after winning one more shot at staying in this country. Hostages were released unharmed by the 1,100 prisoners who left the Federal penitentiary here on Friday, after an 11-day siege, and by the 1,000 whose shorter uprising at a Federal detention center in Oakdale, La., ended a week ago today. The agreements that ended both sieges were essentially the same: Both promised that no ''arbitrary'' changes would be made in the status of any detainee who had been approved for parole when the uprisings began. Some prisoners' rights advocates asserted that the agreements were too ambiguous to give the detainees much help. And Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said Friday that the case reviews would be done by administrative personnel, not by judges, who the inmates thought would give them a fairer hearing. The rioting was triggered by an immigration agreement that meant thousands of boatlift Cubans who had wound up in American prisons would be returned to Cuba. A Federal appeals court had ruled that since the refugees never legally entered the United States, they could not seek relief in American courts; about 3,600 are in prison despite having completed sentences for their crimes. Until the pact was announced, many thought they would be freed in time; about 500 here had just been approved for parole. The 85-year-old prison on a ridge southeast of downtown Atlanta had been one of the nation's most violent for years, not only in terms of inmates assaulting one another and inmates assaulting guards, but also in terms of inmates harming themselves: There were more than 6,000 cases of self-mutilation from 1981 to 1986, according to a House subcommittee report. To the extent that they won another round of case reviews, the Cuban inmates got a bit of what they had sought. Mr. Meese maintained that the Government had also achieved its objectives in the negotiations. And the hostages got something too - overtime pay.

1236-> Eating Out With Martina Navratilova; Pasta and Fruit: A Lunch of Champions
AFTER winning the United States Open tennis championship this year in New York, Martina Navratilova declined numerous invitations to celebrate at the city's swanky restaurants. Instead, she returned to her hotel room where a friend catered a private dinner party. ''It was all Czech food,'' she said. ''Roasted duck with caraway seeds, dumplings, cabbage and sauerkraut.'' This nostalgic - and, as she recalls, heavy - feast is a luxury the diet-conscious Miss Navratilova allows herself only after tournament wins. As perhaps the greatest female tennis player in the world, with four United States Open single titles in five years and eight Wimbledon singles wins (the last six in a row, a record), she is not exactly deprived of her native dishes. Miss Navratilova attributes part of her career success to an exacting dietary regimen, developed in consultation with Dr. Harold C. Whitcomb Jr., an internist based in Aspen, Colo., who specializes in chemical imbalances in the body. At the Virginia Slims championships in Madison Square Garden this week, Miss Navratilova is expected to have a crucial showdown with Steffi Graf, the 18-year-old West German dynamo. Miss Graf is ranked No. 1 in the world according to a computerized point system, even though she lost to Miss Navratilova, top-ranked for five years, at Wimbledon and the Open this year. During a recent vacation to the city, Miss Navratilova discussed her ideas about food over lunch in the Ambassador Grill at the United Nations Plaza Hotel, where she was staying. Whether from diet or her rigorous training, the 30-year-old tennis champion radiates good health. Tanned and without eyeglasses, her flaxen hair, longer than usual, brushed back from her forehead, she appeared less formidable than on the tennis court. Wearing blue jeans, a stylish black and white sweater with leather patches, and heart-shaped diamond earrings, she could be just another camera-toting tourist in the United Nations neighborhood. Once seated she ordered a cranberry-and-Perrier cocktail as the conversation turned to her regimen. ''When I came to this country I used to eat all the wrong things: bread and butter, steaks and all kinds of meats with lots of mayonnaise, hamburgers, all that stuff,'' she recalled. ''I've learned a lot from Dr. Whitcomb in Aspen, who has found which foods my body reacts to best and which tend to slow me down,'' she EATING OUT With Martina Navratilova said. ''I have found that the nightshade vegetables - red peppers, tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes -affect me in negative ways.'' She also minimizes her intake of red meat and refined sugar, while consuming large quantities of complex carbohydrates. Pasta is her passion. We opened the Ambassador Grill's lunch menu and saw a special of the day called spaghetti Martina. ''What is spaghetti Martina?'' the eponymous diner asked the captain. This dish was on the menu in her honor for the week. ''The sauce is made with tomato, cream, chicken and mushrooms,'' he replied, beaming. ''Tomatoes . . . hmmmm,'' she murmured. ''Can I have something a little different, maybe without the tomatoes and chicken, and light on the cream?'' ''Of course,'' replied the captain, slightly crestfallen. Later, when the modified spaghetti Martina arrived, she rated it ''very good,'' as was the appetizer of wild-squab salad with port wine vinaigrette. For dessert, she asked for fresh raspberries along with a glass of milk. ''You're going to think I'm crazy,'' Miss Navratilova said as she poured the milk over the bowl of raspberries, sprinkled on some sugar and began mashing the mixture with a fork. ''This is how I always eat fresh berries.'' She enjoys dining out in the city, especially at Italian restaurants, and this week she may investigate several new places, including Remi at 323 East 79th Street and Arqua at 281 Church Street. Chinese and Japanese food are also favorites. ''Fu's is terrific,'' she said, referring to the Chinese restaurant on Second Avenue near 72d Street. When she is not in the mood to go out she orders carryout sushi. Occasionally, she stops by one of the Czechoslovak restaurants in town, Vasata at 339 East 75th Street. An old favorite was the Ruc (now closed) on East 72d Street. ''They're pretty good,'' she said. ''Not as good as my mother, but not bad considering they're in America.'' The vacation week in New York does not exclude workouts. Later this afternoon, she will spend several hours at the Vertical Club with her full-time trainer, Joseph Breedlove, then meet her occasional training consultant, Dr. Renee Richards. Also on the schedule are Broadway shows - ''Les Miserables,'' ''Starlight Express'' - and shopping. On the infrequent occasions when she spends time at her Art Deco home in Fort Worth, Miss Navratilova enjoys puttering around in the kitchen. ''Last week I had an afternoon off at home,'' she said. ''It was so nice to go into the kitchen and cook for a change.'' A friend in Chicago had sent her some Czechoslovak-style smoked pork, which she prepared with dumplings and cabbage. On the road, Miss Navratilova always has a kitchen in her hotel room so that she can prepare her own breakfast. ''I work out so much that I have to eat a lot,'' she said. ''I make either oatmeal or muesli, maybe a bagel with a little butter, lots of carrot juice, then some pasta, with pesto sauce or sesame sauce.'' She usually brings her own selection of sandwiches to matches, she said, ''otherwise you have to depend on the tournament dining hall.'' Dining out can always be nettlesome when you are an internationally known celebrity, though no one bothered her at the Ambassador Grill. ''New Yorkers are pretty good about it,'' she said. ''They wave on the street and say hello in restaurants but don't really bother me.'' She recalled with a laugh, however, a recent incident when she wanted to be recognized but wasn't. ''I went to the Plaza Hotel with some friends on Marathon Sunday, and of course it was packed,'' she recalled. ''I asked the maitre d' when breakfast was served.'' ''No breakfast today, only brunch,'' he replied curtly. ''O.K., when is brunch served?'' Miss Navratilova asked. ''It's $29.95 per person,'' he said, looking at the casually attired tourist as if she could ill afford such a luxury. ''Once again, when is brunch served?'' she persisted. As the maitre d'hotel silently perused his reservation book, Miss Navratilova and her friends stalked out. ''On the street I passed a bum who was lying there half asleep,'' she said. ''As I walked by he sat up, waved and shouted, 'Hey, Martina! How's it goin'?' ''

1237-> Nations' Steel Total Up
Steel production in 30 major non-Communist countries rose 8.3 percent in August, to 33.7 million metric tons, from 31.2 million tons a year earlier, mainly because of a 29.3 percent rise in American output, the International Iron and Steel Institute reported today. The USX Corporation was idle because of a strike in August 1986.

1238-> AFTER 8-YEAR WAIT, SOVIET PIANIST FLIES WEST
Vladimir O. Feltsman, the Soviet pianist whose soaring musical star was abruptly stalled eight years ago when he applied to emigrate, finally came out today, certain that the long delay had only made his music better. ''I'm awfully tired, so much has happened in the last days,'' he said in English after arriving from Moscow. ''I deeply believe the motherland is the motherland. But I was born a Jew, and for any Jew we're a little bit a homeless people, and I believe that my real motherland - and the real motherland for any artist, if you've got a gift from God - my real motherland would be a concert hall. ''Of course I will miss my country very much, but there was no other way. I had to leave. I'm very sorry, but I had to leave.'' After a few days in Vienna, Mr. Feltsman, along with his wife, Anna, and their 4-year-old son, Daniel, are to travel to France to stay with Arthur A. Hartman, the former United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Mr. Hartman has been an active supporter of the Feltsmans and held two recitals at his official Moscow residence. Mr. Feltsman said he plans to settle in New York and begin a new life. He had no specific plans, he said, but his options included an invitation to teach at the State University of New York at New Paltz. He hopes to make his American debut at Carnegie Hall. ''These eight years cost me a lot,'' the 35-year-old pianist said. ''I lost a lot. But I learned a lot, too. If I can say this about myself, I understand life better, I understand people better, I understand myself better, and that means I understand music better, so I'm absolutely sure I play the piano better than I did eight years ago. I only hope people will like it, too.'' When Mr. Feltsman applied in 1979 to emigrate, he was on his way up in the Soviet musical firmament - the son of a popular songwriter, Oskar B. Feltsman, and laureate of prestigious international competitions who had traveled through Eastern and Western Europe and also to Japan. His request was denied without explanation, though the prominence of his father probably played a role. His career came to an abrupt halt. Moscow and Leningrad were effectively closed to him and his records disappeared from shops. But friends and Jewish organizations abroad kept up pressure, most notably Mr. Hartman and his wife, Donna. One of the concerts at the Ambassador's residence was made into a record in New York. Finally, with the rise to power of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the greater openness in emigration policies, Mr. Feltsman was allowed to leave. He talked today about Mr. Gorbachev and the greater openness he was introducing to the Soviet Union. ''Glasnost is really taking place, and in my view there's no doubt about it,'' he said. ''It's another question how deep and how long it will continue.'' Mr. Feltsman said he had personally tested glasnost. About two months ago, he said, he met with a Deputy Minister of Culture and had proposed revoking his application of emigrate if he could be allowed to give concerts abroad. ''He called and said he's sorry to say it will never take place, and forget about it. If I wanted to leave, there was no objection. ''So my case shows that in spite of all the good things which are happening in this country, the leadership is not ready to accept a new way of thinking, and for me this is the main point.''

1239-> Mullin Getting Treatment
During his junior and senior years at St. John's, Chris Mullin, one of the most popular basketball players to come out of New York City, was known as a fun-loving type who enjoyed a beer or two after a game. News yesterday that Mullin is battling a drinking problem and had checked into a treatment program at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calif., surprised some but not others who know him. Mullin, who is in his third season with the Golden State Warriors, was suspended by Coach George Karl from Friday's game against the Atlanta Hawks in Oakland, Calif., and fined after missing practice a day earlier. The team announced Saturday night that he had been admitted to Centinela. Mullin also missed a practice Nov. 16. ''I'm shocked,'' Lou Carnesecca said yesterday. He coached Mullin for four seasons at St. John's and knew him from the time he was a sophomore at Xaverian High School in Brooklyn. ''I never knew he had a problem,'' Carnesecca said. ''I would see him take a beer or so at a social function, but it was no big deal. I'm just glad that he had the good judgment to take care of himself, and thank God it's a disease that can be cured.'' To at least one teammate, the announcement was not a surprise. ''There were indications, that's all I can say,'' said Joe Barry Carroll, the Warrior center who was traded Saturday to the Houston Rockets. ''As players, we live together. It's difficult to conceal something like that.'' Rod Higgins, a Warrior forward, said the announcement was unexpected. ''I don't know as far as the team goes, but it was a surprise to me,'' he said. Bill Wennington, one of Mullin's teammates at St. John's and a reserve center for the Dallas Mavericks, said he was aware of Mullin's drinking. ''I know he had a problem earlier and went through this,'' Wennington said. ''I thought the last year, year and a half, he was O.K.'' Mullin won the John Wooden Award as the country's top college basketball player in 1985 and was the career leading scorer at St. John's. He was a member of the gold medal-winning United States Olympic basketball team in 1984 and started 30 games after being drafted first by the Warriors in 1985. This season, Mullin has averaged 17.6 points, 35.1 minutes, 4.6 assists, 3.4 rebounds a game and was shooting 47.5 percent, 90.7 percent from the free-throw line. In an interview yesterday, Don Nelson, the Warriors' executive vice president said: ''He has consumed beer for a long time. It's become an alcohol problem and he's decided to take care of it. ''There's no reason to think it's anything else besides alcohol.'' At a news conference yesterday in Oakland, to discuss the Warriors' acquisition of Ralph Sampson, Nelson said he knew of Mullin's problem. ''I had heard Chris was a big beer drinker, and I'd heard he had problems with consumption of beer,'' Nelson said. ''The first day I came in here I confronted him with that. Like most people with problems, he didn't feel he had one. He was hiding his problem.'' Nelson, the former Milwaukee Bucks coach, became the Warriors' executive vice president this year. He said Mullin told him he'd try to go without a beer for six months. ''He couldn't do it,'' Nelson said. ''I think it is good for Chris,'' Karl said of the hospital's program. ''I like Chris as a person. He has a lot of positives off the court and on. Hopefully, he'll get the problem in hand.'' He said Mullin seemed upbeat. ''He knows what he has to do,'' Karl said. Mullin was placed on the injured reserve list and will continue to collect his $600,000 salary while undergoing treatment. Karl said Mullin's agent, Bill Pollak, recommended the hospital. Pollak represented Bernard King of the Washington Bullets when King was admitted there for alcohol rehabilitation while playing for the Utah Jazz during the 1979-80 season. Dr. Jerry Rozansky, the medical director of the Life Start program at Centinela, will determine the date of Mullin's return to the team, the Warriors said. According to National Basketball Association officials, Mullin's treatment will not count against him under the N.B.A.'s rules regarding drug abuse. ''Our counselors will get reports on his treatment, but alcoholism is not part of our drug testing agreement,'' said Russ Granik, the executive vice president of the N.B.A. Under the N.B.A. plan, a player who tests postive for drug abuse is to be suspended with pay and may enter a treatment program at the league's expense. The second time he tests positive, the league pays for the treatment but the player is suspended without pay. After the third offense, the player is expelled for two years.

CHATTERTON. By Peter Ackroyd. 234 pages. Grove. $17.95. WAS Thomas Chatterton a forger or were the ''medieval'' works he ''discovered'' authentic? Did he kill himself at the age of 18 or live on to write great poems under the names of great poets? The questions may not seem of particular moment, but they have provided Peter Ackroyd, a British writer, with a pretext for an evocative and humorous novel. As we are informed or reminded in an introductory note, Chatterton, who lived from 1752 to 1770, gained youthful celebrity in Bristol by producing poems supposedly written by a 15th-century monk named Thomas Rowley. At the age of 17, he went to London in search of fame, not finding which he swallowed arsenic in his small attic room on Brooke Street. Plainly, the young fellow to whom Keats would dedicate ''Endymion'' was the very model of the romantic poet, going unappreciated to a youthful death. Mr. Ackroyd, a novelist as well as a biographer of T. S. Eliot, has used the few known facts of Chatterton's short life as a springboard into a vision of the Romantic poet of three eras, beginning with our own. The 20th-century version is Charles Wychwood, a dying poet with a habit of eating books and a writer's block the size of London. He believes he has discovered material that proves Chatterton lived on long after his supposed suicide and became ''the greatest poet in history.'' The largely accidental process of discovery is incidental to the characters Charles comes up against in his pursuit: Dickensian figures who run old curiosity shops and up-to-date art galleries, not to forget the unscrupulous Harriet Scrope, a gin-sipping novelist who owes her own success to a bit of plagiarism. She enjoys a pun: ''I'm not really crying, dear,'' she whispers at a cremation. ''It's rheum. Rheum at the top.'' The drollest character is Cumberland, a sharp-tongued, sharp-trading art dealer. He observes of his aging junior partner: ''Poor thing. Did you see the thinning hair? I could read a copy of Art News through it.'' He cracks that ''a brown suit looks so calculating on a man, don't you think? One always supects that he must have knitted it himself.'' Mr. Ackroyd specializes in catty talk. An old bookseller says of his male lover: ''Miss Health and Beauty of 1929, she is. Last night she had yogurt all over her face and cucumber slices on her eyes. I could have cut off her head and sold it as health food.'' The casual plot becomes an occasion for the dextrous Mr. Ackroyd to combine the chatter of Chelsea and the battiness of Bloomsbury with the ghostly presences of languishing artists and lovelorn women. In Part 2, he returns to the 19th century, to make a melancholy little romance around the wife of George Meredith, the poet and novelist who sat or swooned for a portrait of Chatterton done by Henry Wallis in 1856. As Meredith comments, the painting will always be remembered as the true death of Chatterton, rather as Chatterton's forgeries had come to represent the Middle Ages. Just about every painting or piece of writing that shows up in these pages turns out to be, to some degree, faked, and the comments on art as a variety of forgery call to mind William Gaddis's ''Recognitions.'' Meredith puts this thought to the painter Wallis: ''So the greatest realism is also the greatest fakery?'' The point is made coming and going: ''The truest Plagiarism is the truest Poetry.'' Our author himself shows he can imitate a 19th-century Romantic sensibility, as Willis reflects on his almost completed painting: ''Here, at the still point of the composition, the rich glow of the poet's clothes and the brightness of his hair would be the emblem of a soul that had not yet left the body; that had not yet fled, through the open window of the garret into the cool distance of the painted sky.'' In the elegiac Part 3, we get close to Chatterton himself, ''a young man with bright red hair'' whose image has been hovering throughout, bringing courage to the major figures. All the seeming secrets are revealed, yet there remains the final secret, how the spirits of the poets - Charles, Meredith, Chatterton - survive in each other. At the touching conclusion, Charles's grieving little son sees in the painting of Meredith pretending to be Chatterton the face of his own father, and is comforted. ''The poet is never completely lost,'' Charles assures his wife as he is dying. ''He has the secret of his childhood safe with him, like some secret cave in which he can kneel. And when we read his poetry, we can join him there.'' A romantic image that, credit the allure of Mr. Ackroyd's imagination, does not seem at all fake, even in our skeptical age.

1241-> Tips for Pet Owners as Winter Arrives
To the Editor: With winter coming, the Humane Society of the United States warns: * Caustic chemicals used to melt snow and ice can irritate and burn the pads of an animal's feet. Do not allow your pet to lick its feet - the chemicals burn the mouth and can cause serious problems if ingested. * A warm engine in a parked car often attracts cats who are left outside on cold nights. On a cold morning, be sure to bang on the hood before starting the engine to scare off unsuspecting felines. * Antifreeze can be deadly. Its sweet taste attracts animals, and even a small puddle of antifreeze can kill or seriously injure a cat or dog. * While no dog should be left outdoors when the temperature drops sharply, dogs who often stay outside require a draft-free, watertight shelter. A doghouse should be no more than 12 inches longer or 3 inches higher than the dog, because the animal's body heat cannot warm a doghouse that is too large. The floor should be raised a few inches off the ground and covered with cedar shavings, which control parasites as well as help retain the pet's skin oil. Dry, shredded newspaper is also acceptable, but it must be checked often. * Dogs who spend time outdoors may need more food in the winter, since keeping warm depletes energy. * If you feed birds, they depend on this food every day especially in the winter. Check the outdoor water supply frequently to make sure it hasn't frozen. NINA AUSTENBERG Director, Humane Society Mid-Atlantic Regional Office Convent Station, N.J., Dec. 5, 1987

1242-> Metro Matters; Howard Beach: Verdict of Jurors Only a Beginning
The 11 words in gold along the bottom of Eugene Savage's mosaic mural at the courthouse on Queens Boulevard chronicle an idealized vision of crime and punishment: ''Truth, Error, Transgression, Plea, Inquiry, Evidence, Correction, Exoneration, Rehabilitation, Faith, Security.'' According to that chronology, the jury deliberations that have been going on there since Thursday represent the end of only one phase in the Howard Beach murder case, which began when a group of white teen-agers, the authorities say, chased a black man, Michael Griffith, to his death on the Belt Parkway 51 weeks ago. Rehabilitation, faith and security may prove more elusive. ''I don't think you're going to see significant changes attitudinally until we can look back a year after the case has been decided,'' said Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Democrat and an ordained minister whose district includes Howard Beach. ''Only then will people move on and begin rebuilding lives and rebuilding relationships.'' For all the workshops on race relations convened since last December, Mr. Flake said, what happened in Howard Beach reflected the most extreme manifestation of enduring tensions that might have erupted anywhere. ''I think it could happen again,'' he said, ''in almost any area of the city.'' For all the denials by defense lawyers, an underlying element of this case was race. Perhaps it was also about teen-agers protecting their turf and demonstrating their manhood. But it strains credibility to suggest that had Mr. Griffith and his companions been white, the teen-agers would have substituted ethnic epithets for racial slurs and then carried on the assault with as much vigor. Minutes might have made a profound difference that night. If only the police officers who initially responded to the pizzeria where the confrontation was to occur had lingered longer. If only Mr. Griffith had managed to dart across the parkway without being struck. But if moments might have prevented this particular madness, years seemed to have set the stage for it. Six months after the attack, two women from Howard Beach were asked what had been learned. ''There's no change, nothing,'' said one, an Italian language major at Queens College, who gave her name only as Lorraine. ''I think everything got blown out of proportion,'' said her friend Pamela, who was studying linguistics at the State University at Stony Brook. ''If I got killed in Harlem, you wouldn't hear about it,'' Lorraine said. ''It wasn't racial. First of all, they had no business being here. They were looking for trouble.'' ''Why did they pick this pizza place?'' asked Pamela. ''And why make the whole neighborhood look like we're racist slobs?'' asked Lorraine. ''They made us all out to be animals. Anyway, I don't think it can happen again. Nobody's going to take a chance on having a scandal.'' The death of Mr. Griffith was a tragedy. So are the wounds suffered by his companion, Cedric Sandiford. So, too, are the shattered lives of their accused assailants and their families - of those who never returned to school, of the father who lost his job because of the case and of another who fears he will be fired. But the scandal, as the special prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, said in his summation, was the notion that three black men whose car broke down in a deserted stretch of Queens needed ''a passport to get into Howard Beach.'' Mr. Hynes's handling of the case already has helped restore the black community's faith in the prosecution and, perhaps, even in the process - particularly if he succeeded in persuading the jurors that they have enough evidence to make the legal leap from a case of assault to one of manslaughter or murder. ''It's in the Lord's hands,'' the dead man's mother, Jean Griffith, said the other day. ''Whatever happens, there is a reason. And if they are not convicted, then they still must answer to Him.'' ''There will not be a feeling of unfairness in the process,'' Mr. Flake predicted. ''There may be a feeling of unfairness in the result.'' The result, of course, will also help determine the outlook for rehabilitation and security - along with faith, the final words in the courthouse mural. Yesterday, as he sat with Mrs. Griffith in an almost empty courtroom, Mr. Sandiford was asked whether nearly a year after the attack he would feel more or less secure about walking through Howard Beach again. ''I think,'' he replied, ''that you will have to wait for the verdict before you can say that.''

Tennis U.S. Sweeps Singles: The United States swept both singles matches against France yesterday to move into the quarterfinals of the Federation Cup tournament in Vancouver, British Columbia. Pam Shriver, playing singles because of an injury to top-ranked Martina Navratilova -her doubles partner - defeated Isabelle Demongeot, 6-0, 7-6. Chris Evert, who expects to play doubles in Navratilova's absence, easily downed Mathalie Tauziat, 6-1, 6-0. Czechoslovakia, which won three straight Federation Cups before being dethroned by the Americans last year in Prague, also advanced by sweeping its singles matches against Yugoslavia. Helena Sukova beat Karmen Skulj, 6-2, 6-3, and Hana Mandlikova downed Sabrina Goles, 6-4, 6-3.(AP) Lendl and Becker Win: Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker both advanced to the third round of the $232,000 D.C. Tennis Classic yesterday by struggling to straight-set victories over unseeded foes. Lendl, the world's No. 1 player, overcame a shaky start to record a 7-6, 6-3 victory over Brad Pearce, and Becker, the tournament's second-seeded player, had a surprisingly tough time eliminating Richard Matuszewski, 6-4, 7-5. In other second-round matches, fourth-seeded Brad Gilbert won the final five games of his match against a fellow-Californian, Chip Hooper, in a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory, and eighth-seeded Jay Berger stopped Jay Lapidus, 6-2, 6-3.(AP) Harness Racing Demmler Captures Driving Title: Ted Demmler of Australia turned in a consistent performance in the final two races of the series to win the world harness drivers' championship last night at Solvalla Race Track in Stockholm. Demmler won the first race behind Timba F.S. and then finished fourth in the finale behind Miss Armanbo to overtake the point leader, Ulf Thoresen of Norway. Thoresen, a four-time world driving champion, was only seventh and eighth. Demmler finished with 189 points, 2 points ahead of Thoresen. Joe Marsh of the United States was sixth with 134 points.(AP) Swimming Wharton Breaks Medley Mark: Dave Wharton broke his American record in the men's 400-meter individual medley yesterday in a preliminary heat at the United States long-course championships in Fresno, Calif. Wharton was clocked in 4 minutes 18.45 seconds, beating the mark he set last year by 32-hundredths of a second. Canada's Alex Baumann set the world record of 4:17.41 at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Janet Evans set a world record in the women's 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:22.44.(AP) Diving Neyer Takes Gold Medal: Megan Neyer edged the defending champion, Kim Fugett, to take the gold medal in the women's one-meter springboard competition yesterday, the first title of the 1987 United States outdoor championships at Bartlesville, Okla. Neyer's 438.84 total barely edged Fugett, of Cincinnati, who had 433.89 for her 10 dives. Mary Fischbach of Fort Dodge, Iowa, and the University of Michigan, was third with 432.21. Earlier, Greg Louganis held off Bruce Kimball's closing flurry to post the top qualifying score in the men's 10-meter platform competition.

1245-> COMPANY NEWS;
The Higbee Company, a 127-year-old department-store chain in Cleveland, is being acquired by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and Dillard Department Stores Inc. for about $165 million in cash. The seller is Brierly Investments Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, which purchased Higbee in 1984 and also has a substantial holding in D. H. Holmes, a New Orleans department store. The DeBartolo Corporation, based in Youngstown, Ohio, is the nation's largest shopping-center developer. Dillard, based in Little Rock, Ark., is an expanding retail chain that has acquired several regional retailers in recent years. For DeBartolo, which bid to acquire the Allied Stores Corporation late last year and then later dropped its offer, the Higbee venture is believed to be its first retailing investment, although the company owns hotels and motels. Higbee, a subsidiary of IEPL Holdings Inc., will retain its name, the company said yesterday in announcing the transaction. Most of Dillard's acquisitions have adopted the new owner's name. ''I guess we're a little different than the other acquisitions,'' Robert R. Broadbent, Higbee's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''Unlike those when they were acquired, we are a very healthy business, and we have a dominant name in northern Ohio. It makes sense that we retain our name.'' Mr. Broadbent said he would remain Higbee's chief executive. Higbee, which owns the real estate in 7 of its 14 stores and one warehouse, expects to end the year with sales of $312 million, against about $300 million in 1986, Mr. Broadbent said. He declined to be specific on earnings except to say, ''They will be moderately up this year.'' In a statement, Edward J. DeBartolo, the chairman of the DeBartolo Corporation, said the venture continued a 20-year relationship with Dillard. William Dillard, the chairman and chief executive of Dillard, said the venture would increase Higbee's growth and expand his company's geographic reach.

1246-> Skin Color
To the Editor: In reference to Stephanie Griffith's article ''Encounters of Another Color'' (Travel, April 12): exactly the opposite happened to me! My gloves are sometimes black, my skin is not - but on one of my jaunts to East Africa when I visited an out-of-the-way village, the local people looked at me the same way that Ms. Griffith reported - and what is more, some were curious to see the skin under my gloves. They looked at my teeth, at my hair, at my clothes, which were all nondescript. My friends and I were also immediate celebrities. And when we were asked where in the world we came from, and we said New York, they had never heard of it. And, by the way, I also learned in Africa what it means to be a second-class person, as I waited at the end of the line, demurely, while the more important local people were pushing me aside. MARY S.

To the Editor: In his review (May 3) of my book, ''The National Debt,'' Alfred Balk implies that I have belatedly come to what he regards as a confession of guilt.

1249-> North Korea Reported To Watch Carefully
The civil unrest here has not significantly affected North Korean military movements, Gen. William J. Livsey, the senior American military commander in South Korea, said today. Asked if the South Korean crisis had produced a change on the other side of the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, General Livsey replied: ''Not much. But there has been a perking up of ears, a heightened awareness of what is going on here.'' North Korea, he said, is ''watching very, very carefully,'' but he added that the overall pattern remained ''about the same.'' General Livsey, who spoke with foreign reporters, is scheduled to retire Thursday after 35 years in the Army. He is to be succeeded by Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, who had been commander of the Fifth Army at Fort Sam Houston, Tex.

1250-> Shaking Up Sloan-Kettering
Philip M. Boffey's article ''Dr. Marks' Crusade'' (April 26) describes the shaking up of Sloan-Kettering in terms worthy of turn-around experts such as Lee Iacocca. However, Sloan-Kettering is a nonprofit research organization, not a Fortune 500 corporation. It relies solely on private donations and Government and privately financed grants for its survival. Ironically, the majority of those so-called ''mediocre'' scientists dismissed by Dr. Marks were recipients of such grants, having been judged for their excellence by a tough peer-review system during a period of particularly scarce funds. Although Dr. Marks has erected new buildings and laboratories and offered research money, generous salaries and apartments, in nearly seven years of effort, he has largely failed in enticing eminent molecular biologists to replace those removed.

1251-> Baker Uneasy About Trade
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d suggested today that recent reports showing an increased United States trade deficit would make it harder for the Reagan Administration to head off Congressional passage of tough trade restraints. ''It won't make it any easier for us to avoid protectionism if the numbers do not improve on a nominal basis as well as on a volume basis,'' Mr. Baker told the Institute of International Economics. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's merchandise trade deficit in July had widened to a record $16.5 billion, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Mr. Baker warned of ''trade wars that nobody wanted but trade wars that nobody could avoid'' if Congress passed trade legislation similar to that now before a House-Senate conference committee. Both the House and the Senate bills would restrict the President's ability to act in trade cases and would offer protection for specific United States industries. The Treasury Secretary predicted a ''full-fledged and productive'' session later this month when finance ministers and central bank chairmen from the world's seven major democracies meet for the first time since the Venice economic summit meeting in June.

1253-> Jury Selection Ordered Open In Deaver Case
A Federal appeals court today ordered the judge in the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver to conduct the jury selection in public. The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel overturned a process set up by the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court, to question potential jurors in secret and release edited transcripts to reporters. The judge said he was attempting to protect the privacy of the jurors in the trial of the former deputy White House chief of staff. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia came after a challenge to the procedure by news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and the three major commercial television networkers, along with the Cable News Network. They had argued that Judge Jackson's plan was a violation of First Amendment rights. According to The Associated Press, at a hearing after the appeals court's decision, Judge Jackson called the opinion ''a virtual total abrogation of the way I have conducted'' the interview process so far. He said he was inclined to dismiss the pool of more than 100 prospective jurors and begin a new selection process. Hearing Set for Today He scheduled a hearing Thursday morning to consider how to proceed. Only five of 31 prospective jurors have been questioned in open court. The others had been questioned in a room away from reporters under Judge Jackson's screening procedure. Jury selection in criminal trials is almost always open to the public. Mr. Deaver, who left the White House to form a lobbying concern, is charged with lying under oath to Congress and to a Federal grand jury investigating his lobbying activities. The prospective jurors are being questioned about their experiences with drugs and alcohol. According to friends of Mr. Deaver, he may argue that he gave inaccurate testimony to Congress and the grand jury because he was afflicted with alcoholism. The appeals court said today that Judge Jackson's procedure violated the standards for public jury selection set by the Supreme Court under a 1984 case, Press-Enterprise Company v. Superior Court of California. The Court ruled that jury selection can be closed to the public only when a prospective juror makes an ''affirmative request'' for privacy. ''The district court, in our view, stood this requirement on its head,'' the appeals court said, by permitting prospective jurors to elect to be questioned in secrecy ''simply by remaining mute.'' ''The Press Enterprise court made it abundantly clear that the process of juror selection in a criminal trial is of vital importance not only to the accused but more broadly to the criminal system and the public,'' the panel said. The court also criticized Judge Jackson for failing to determine ''alternatives that might minimize the degree of closure.'' The court said the judge could have conducted questioning in open court, ''responding to individual expressions of specific concern over particular questions'' by permitting questioning in private, ''where warranted under prevailing law.' George Freeman, a senior attorney for The New York Times, said: ''We're very pleased that the court of appeals followed the Supreme Court's ruling in deciding that jury selection, which is an important part of a trial, is open to the public. It's particularly important that all phases of a trial which the public is deeply interested in, such as the Deaver case, be open so that the public can scrutinize and have confidence in our judicial system.'' At the hearing today, one of the three appeals court judges, Laurence Silberman, also took issue with Whitney North Seymour Jr., the special prosecutor in the case, who had defended Judge Jackson's decision, saying that news organizations had no case for ''watching the jurors squirm'' in open court. Judge Silberman asked, ''You don't think the First Amendment includes watching the jurors squirm?''

1254-> Blacks in Brooklyn Plan Rally to Protest Beatings
In a high-spirited gathering in a Brooklyn church late yesterday evening that was a defiant political rally and a heart-warming commemoration, several ministers, leaders of social service organizations and prominent black lawyers called for a march Saturday morning in Brooklyn to protest the beating of two black men this week by a group of white youths. About 500 people at the House of the Lord Pentacostal church at 415 Atlantic Avenue filled the main sanctuary, balcony and watched on closed circuit television in the auditorium as nearly half a dozen speakers criticized Mayor Koch for his remarks this week in which he accused a black Roman Catholic priest of making anti-semitic remarks, and, along with several political allies, of worsening racial tensions in the city. The Mayor was referring to the Rev. Lawrence Lucas, pastor of the Resurrection Roman Catholic Church in Harlem, who spoke Monday at a rally in Brooklyn in support of a black educator, Adelaide L. Sanford, who seeking appointment as city schools chancelor. Mrs. Sanford, a member of the state Board of Regents, was not among the finalists for the post. Her supporters however, continue to press for her appointment. Last evening's gathering was also a tribute to Jean Griffith, mother of Michael Griffith, the black man who was killed by an automoblie after an attack by a gang of white teen-agers in Howard Beach, Queens, and to Cedric Sandiford, another black who with Mr. Griffith was beaten by the whites. Koch and Ward Criticized But one of the purposes of the rally last night was to galvanize support for the march to the Bensonhurst section on Saturday. It is to organize in front of the House of the Lord Pentacostal Church at 10 A.M., the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the church, said. Details of the route were unavailable late last night. The audience applauded two black men, Steven Lamont, 31 years old, and his brother, Sylvester, who were invited guests. The two men were beaten by a gang of whites in the Bath Beach section last week as they collected empty cans, and the incident became another painful reminder to many blacks that they are unwelcome in parts of the city. Mayor Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, however, received most of the attention last night from speakers as the majority of speakers said the Mayor was guilty of exacerbating racial tensions, and they added that last week's protest, in which subway trains and bridges were blocked and immobilized by protesters, causing massive traffic snarls, was just a dry run for larger protests. Among the goals articulated were greater control over an education system whose students are predominantly from minority groups, a greater participation in government and the political process and what several speakers called a need for justice in the courts. Support for Priest ''We are not asking you, we are telling you, we will close the schools down,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the organizers of the demonstrations last week. ''We found out that we have power. We can turn this city on, or off when we get ready.'' Moreover, the speakers emphasized that the Mayor's recent remarks fueled the anger of black citizens toward his administration and steeled their resolve to defeat him in the next election, even if it meant massive boycotts in months to come. ''The only thing that Koch is doing is giving us an honor roll,'' said Alton H. Maddox Jr., a prominent civil-rights lawyer who, with the lawyer C. Vernon Mason, has traded accusations with the Mayor many times before. ''We want to endorse Father Lucas,'' Mr. Maddox, said. ''I tell you one thing, you better not lay a hand on this man. I want to tell you that African people are behind Father Lucas.'' 'Pathological Liar' As Mr. Maddox spoke, the gathering, which reflected a broad spectrum of blacks from religious affiliations and political beliefs, applauded enthusiastically, stamped their feet and shouted encouragement. Father Lucas and Mrs. Sanford, who gave a rousing speech at the church last night about black pride and accomplishment, received standing ovations at the beginning of the rally. Father Lucas took issue with the Mayor in a telephone interview last night. He called Mr. Koch ''a pathological liar'' and accused the Mayor and the news media of quoting him out of context. Father Lucas's remarks were videotaped by WNYW-TV (Channel 5) and broadcast on its 10 PM news show on Monday. Mr. Koch viewed a copy of the videotape on Tuesday, and his press office made it available to City Hall reporters. Father Lucas, who did not return several telephone messages seeking comment on Tuesday, responded to the messages last night. A complete reading of his remarks, he said, would show that he was making several broad statements about racial violence and about the city's schools. Press Coverage Allowed He said he was concerned that Catholic leaders had not spoken out more against racism and against racially motivated attacks on black New Yorkers. ''I say to Governor Cuomo, and to Koch, you've got two choices,'' Mr. Maddox said. ''You can have chaos or you can have community.''

1255-> Judge Rules Against 'Tilted Arc' Sculptor in Suit
A Federal judge ruled against Richard Serra Tuesday in a portion of a suit in which the artist contends that his reputation and career have been harmed by efforts to remove his sculpture ''Tilted Arc'' from a plaza in downtown Manhattan. In the suit, which seeks $30 million in damages, Mr. Serra had charged that William J. Diamond, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration, and Dwight Ink, who had been acting administrator of the agency, had deprived him of his constitutional rights to free speech and due process of law. The sculpture - a 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long steel wall - bisects the plaza in front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building at 26 Federal Plaza. In March 1985, a five-member panel named by Mr. Diamond heard testimony in a public hearing on the sculpture, at which many local office workers and art professionals testified. The panel ultimately recommended that the work be removed. Tuesday's decision, by Judge Milton Pollack of Federal District Court in Manhattan, declared that the artist ''has alleged extremely abstract violations of constitutional rights.'' ''The G.S.A. bought and paid for Serra's sculpture and displayed it in the plaza,'' Judge Pollack wrote in the decision. ''This did not clearly establish the plaza as a public forum such that Serra has a constitutional right to prevent the G.S.A. from now altering the plaza by removing 'Tilted Arc.' '' Artist Reportedly to Appeal In a telephone interview yesterday, Gustave Harrow, Mr. Serra's attorney, objected to the decision. ''They are treating this as if it were a desk in someone's office. This is an expression that is protected by the First Amendment,'' he said. Mr. Serra's suit also charges the General Services Administration with breach of contract, copyright infringement and other violations of artists' rights. Tuesday's decision, while dismissing the complaints against Mr. Diamond and Mr. Ink individually, did not address the claims against the agency, which are not yet decided. Mr. Serra had charged that Mr. Diamond, in convening the five-member panel to hear public testimony, had chosen individuals whom he knew to be opposed to the work. In addition, Mr. Serra said that Mr. Diamond had prejudiced the public against the work by actively organizing individuals who favored the sculpture's removal. ''I am deeply grateful that the District Court has found that I acted in a reasonable manner in all of my actions regarding the 'Tilted Arc' matter,'' Mr. Diamond said yesterday. He added that he would shortly submit to the National Endowment for the Arts a list of possible alternative sites for the sculpture. The arts organization has been asked to find a relocation site and to determine whether the work can be moved at all without destroying its integrity. Mr. Harrow said Mr. Serra would appeal the decision, once the entire suit had been decided.

The beautiful dynamic of the game of baseball, moving the runner from base to base, and finally scoring, is utterly destroyed by the cheap home run. Four or five home runs in a game plus the use of the designated hitter means that strategy is no longer a part of baseball. The most thrilling action is the extra-base hit - the double, triple, the occasional inside-the-park homer. There is no excitement in watching a player dog-trot around the bases. Raise the fences in every park by 10 feet. Then you will see exciting baseball. BRYAN O'HARA Glen Head, L.I.

1257-> Peremptory Jury Challenges Face New Tests
Peremptory challenges - which permit a lawyer to eliminate a prospective juror without having to state a reason - have been a feature of the American jury system for nearly 200 years. But in the last two decades there has increasingly been debate over whether lawyers have been abusing these challenges to exclude members of particular groups in an attempt to obtain, not a fair and impartial jury, but one that is tilted in their favor. Amid this debate, state and Federal courts have become particularly aware of the issue of race as a sole basis for excluding prospective jurors. ''The reality of practice,'' Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote last year in the landmark Supreme Court case, Batson v. Kentucky, is that peremptories ''are used to discriminate against black jurors.'' The practice, added Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall in a concurring opinion, ''has become both common and flagrant.'' But the decision left open whether defense lawyers could be held accountable for the same conduct. In the Howard Beach murder case yesterday, Justice Thomas A. Demakos found that defense lawyers had used their peremptory challenges to exclude blacks. In the Batson case, the defense had questioned a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude all four blacks on a jury panel in a burglary case with a black defendant. The High Court decided, 7 to 2, that this denied the defendants rights under the equal-protection clause of the Constitution. Room for Stereotype Ideas By using peremptories to weed out potential jurors they think will be unfavorable to them, lawyers have traditionally been free to follow certain stereotypical notions of why, for instance, women or blacks, or widows or men in pinstriped suits would be good or bad. Until the Batson case, there was little inclination to tamper with peremptory challenges. Each side has a fixed number, depending on the type of case. In New York, the highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals, last addressed the question squarely in 1982 in People v. McCray. That case also involved a challenge to the manner in which a prosecutor used peremptories. The court, relying upon a 1965 United States Supreme Court decision, held that it was not enough to say that a prosecutor was excluding blacks in one particular case. The majority ruled, 4 to 3, that the defense must show that the prosecution had excluded members of a particular race or class from juries over a long period of time. But that reasoning was specifically overturned by the Batson decision. Even before the Batson decision, however, some courts had decided that neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers could use peremptories to bar jurors because of race: the California Supreme Court in 1978, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1979 and the Florida Supreme Court in 1984. Each court relied upon its state's constitutional requirements that juries be drawn from a fair and representative cross section of the community. After yesterday's ruling in the Howard Beach case, the issue is likely to be addressed once again by New York's appellate courts.

1258-> By Design; Caring for Cashmere
Cashmere is currently a favorite luxury. All sorts of garments - especially sweaters - knitted of this soft, sybaritic yarn are decking out lucky men, women, teen-agers and even children. (It's a wonder that there are enough nimble longhaired Tibetan mountain goats out there to supply the stuff that makes the yarn.) Part of cashmere's appeal is its longevity. Properly cared for, a cashmere article should last at least 10 years. The catch is in the caring. Cashmere garments can be dry-cleaned, but experts advise otherwise. Washing by hand is best. The water should be tepid, and the garment should soak 15 minutes in a mild liquid soap or detergent. Then rinse it under a running tap about 5 minutes, in cold water for the last few minutes. It's O.K. to squeeze gently during all of this, but no wringing or twisting. Roll the garment in a dry towel, then spread it on another dry towel on a flat surface. Block it into shape and let it dry out of the sun's view. What the suds solution should be is a matter of debate. At the boutique Cashmere Cashmere on Madison Avenue, sales clerks feel that Woolite is too harsh. They recommend Lavant, based on a formula textile experts use in museum conservation. First offered last year, Lavant is now sold in some antiques stores, a few Manhattan boutiques and expensive lingerie shops, Marshall Field in Chicago, all 22 Neiman-Marcus stores and Bergdorf Goodman. Such gentle cleaning is not without its price. Lavant costs about $15 a bottle, enough for about 50 washings. According to a Lavant spokeswoman, Bergdorf Goodman recently sold 90 bottles to the heiress Doris Duke. Miss Duke must own lots of cashmere.

1261-> There Is No Innate Human Propensity to Kill; No More Insanity Pleas
To the Editor: Jane Doe's Op-Ed article portrays not a mentally ill person, in my judgment, but a criminal. My colleague Thomas Szasz makes this point. I would go even further, and point out that all the notorious defendants found ''not guilty by reason of insanity'' are criminals, despite manifestations or protestations of ''mental illness.'' Our society is living in terror - terror of crime in the streets, in one's own home, while traveling abroad. Much needs to be done, of course, in the way of appropriate preventive methods, treatment and rehabilitation. But the first order of business is to punish the perpetrators of violence. Any person who commits a crime should suffer the consequences according to the law. Criminals should be treated as criminals. The insanity plea should be eliminated entirely, while we go about the business of changing the madness of our society. MAX SIEGEL Boca Raton, Fla., May 26, 1987 The writer, professor emeritus at Brooklyn College, is former president of the American Psychological Association.

1262-> Lacking Parts, Armed Forces Cannibalize Costly Warplanes
Despite the vast military spending by the Reagan Administration over the last six years, the armed forces today are so short of spare parts that they must cannibalize some airplanes to keep others flying. While the practice is not new, it has more serious consequences than in the past because it disables multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware like the B-1 bomber instead of smaller, less advanced items like jeeps. The practice, officials say, erodes military readiness as aircraft are taken out of service, some only for hours but others for days or weeks. Criticized as Waste of Effort In addition, critics say, the practice of cannibalizing is a waste of energy, time and money. At Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene, Tex., three new B-1 bombers, which each cost $200 million, stand idle because parts have been removed from them and installed in several of the 26 other B-1 bombers based there. Air Force officers here say that the practice is common throughout the bomber, fighter and transport wings of their service. ''On any Air Force base on any given day,'' said one officer, ''the chances are that you're going to have an airplane cannibalized.'' Similarly, Navy officers say that most aircraft carriers at sea, plus air units like anti-submarine squadrons that are based ashore, regularly have aircraft that have been cannibalized for parts. ''It's a maintenance management tool,'' one officer said. In pushing Congress to provide more money for the military services over the last six years, Reagan Administration officials indicated that the practice of cannibalizing would be curtailed or eliminated as a part of the Administration's program to improve combat readiness. In recent years the situation has improved somewhat, according to military officers. But in its military buildup the Administration has emphasized the purchase of new arms, such as the MX nuclear missile and ships for the Navy, over the stockpiling of spare parts. Consequently, the officers expect cannibalizing to increase as tighter military budgets slow the purchase of spare parts. Differences in the Budgets Since 1982, when the Administration's military buildup began to take hold, spending on new weapons has soared 52.3 percent, to $85 billion a year. But the operations and maintenance budget, which pays for spare parts, has gone up only 18.5 percent, to $81.6 billion annually. Many members of Congress have agreed with the Administration's emphasis on high-cost weapons because they bring more jobs to their districts and home states. Components of the B-1 bomber, for instance, have been made in more than 40 states. Officers say cannibalizing is usually considered as a last resort, but it is also a costly one because of the time and personnel required to remove a part from one airplane, put it in another and then replace it later. The need to cannibalize aircraft appears to reflect what critics have contended has been an imbalance in the Administration's program to improve the armed forces. In addition to slighting spare parts, the Pentagon has been criticized as being slow to build stockpiles of ammunition and other wartime supplies, to improve combat medical care and to provide enough sea and air transportation to support forces abroad. Parts Becoming Available ''I can see that in some circumstances it would have to be done,'' said Representative Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ''It's done in combat all the time. But in peacetime, it represents a lot of waste of manpower.'' ''What we ought to do is see to it that we have enough spare parts and use them,'' Mr. Bennett said. The use of cannibalized equipment to repair other pieces of machinery became necessary shortly after the Vietnam War when the military supply pipeline began to dry up. The Air Force and Navy officers say that maintenance people at bases or aboard carriers cannibalize less today than five years ago because spare parts ordered in 1983 and 1984, when military budgets were rising, are now becoming available. But they also note that the practice is likely to increase in several years because growth in the military budget has stopped. In most cases, it takes 36 to 48 months from the time the money is appropriated for the parts to become available. Difficulty of Recordkeeping For new aircraft like the B-1 bomber, there are two reasons for the shortage of spare parts. First, to keep the cost of the 100 bombers within the $20.5 billion limit set by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, the initial purchase of spare parts has been limited. Second, Air Force officers say that only by flying the airplane and establishing a track record will officials determine how fast parts wear out and how many spares should be ordered. ''You really can't tell until you get it into the air,'' said one officer. ''But,'' said another, ''it's extremely difficult even on an airplane that's been around for awhile to predict with certainty when a part is going to fail.'' A naval aviator said that providing spare parts for older aircraft was also difficult, citing the F-14 Tomcat, the Navy's premier fighter that was put into operation in October 1972. Of the 240,000 parts in that complicated machine, 40,000 are carried in the Navy and Defense Department supply lines. But an aircraft carrier has room to stock only 8,000 parts. Thus, he said, there is no alternative but to cannibalize one F-14 to keep others flying. Compounding the problem, Navy officers said, is that the F-14 has undergone 115 changes over the last 15 years. New technology has made radar, radios, controls and other components more effective and reliable but has also made stocking spare parts more difficult. Still another hindrance, said the Air Force and Navy officers, has been a frequent lack of reliability by contractors who fail to deliver parts on time or who themselves have been hampered by a labor strike or inadequate quality controls.

1264-> Lawsuits Triple in Federal Courts
The number of lawsuits filed in Federal courts has nearly tripled since 1970, according to a recent report. Civil case filings rose from 87,300 in 1970, to 254,800 last year, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said Sunday. By comparison, it added that criminal cases increased just 4 percent, from 40,000 cases to 41,500, in that time. Meanwhile, the number of district judges increased by 43 percent, to 575. Courtroom backlogs and bottlenecks stem largely from the complexity of a small number of cases such as toxic waste lawsuits with ''multiple claims and multiple defendants,'' said Carol Kaplan, chief of the Federal statistics branch at the bureau, an agency of the Justice Department. Less than 5 percent of the civil cases reached trial in 1986. Nearly half were settled with no court action, and 47 percent more were settled before trial. The United States Government was a party in 36 percent of the Federal civil cases filed last year. A detailed breakdown as to the type of lawsuit is available only as of 1980. It shows that the increase in civil filings since then has stemmed mainly from contract disputes, personal injuries and complaints from Federal prisoners. The number of contract disputes involving the Government doubled in the last seven years, to 48,200. Contract disputes between private parties have risen by 16,000 since 1980, to slightly more than 40,000.

1265-> TALKING: CONDOS; Greenery Sprouts Sales
THE brilliance of azaleas in blossom, the contours of a shade tree and the lush green of a well-tended lawn are among the outdoor amenities that can add significantly to the market appeal of a suburban condominium development. Yet brokers and managing agents find that condominium boards often fail to budget money for such improvements. ''Most people fall into the trap of thinking that all that is necessary is maintaining the status quo,'' said Douglas Kleine, director of research for the Community Associations Institute, the national network of condominium directors with headquarters in Alexandria, Va. Yet many condominiums start out with minimal grounds treatments provided by their developers, and with the passage of time, the contrast between units surrounded by dried-out patches of scrubby grass and those improved with landscaping can have a substantial impact upon values and saleability. For example, values began to climb dramatically last year at the Cricket Club, a 78-unit condominium in Manhasset, L.I., after a brick veneer was installed over concrete paths, a new sign was posted at the entrance and shrubbery was planted throughout the grounds, said John Hatgis, president of CMS Management of Commack, L.I., which manages the Cricket Club. Other condominiums have installed playgrounds for young families or benches in open areas for old people. How, then, should condominium directors approach the planning and financing of outdoor improvements? Mr. Kleine, who has looked into methods used around the country, said the best way to start is by appointing a grounds-improvement committee. Members of the committee should include proven leaders of volunteer groups - executive members of a Rotary club or a P.T.A. -because it will be difficult, he said, to achieve a consensus, and these people are usually experienced in doing that. ''Everyone's going to have a different view,'' Mr. Kleine noted. ''The young couples may want a playground or a basketball court, while someone older may prefer more ornamental trees.'' If the condominium is lucky enough to have a landscape architect among its resident-owners, he or she surely should be recruited for the committee. If not, such a person should be hired to provide a design. And a real-estate agent could be called in to discuss the outdoor amenities that have the strongest market appeal. Rock formations, ponds, waterfalls and streams are hot items with contemporary buyers, said William Becker, a marketing consultant to condominum developers in Hackensack, N.J. ''And none of these are very costly to maintain,'' he added. He also recommended jogging trails, if the condominium has open space, as well as par courses, which put exercise stations along jogging trails. Paddle-tennis courts are preferable to regular tennis courts, he said, because they are less costly to maintain and can be used over a longer period. Martin Filler, president of Island Condo Management of Staten Island, recommended against posting signs throughout the grounds prohibiting parking, littering, ball playing or noise. ''It offends the pastoral setting,'' he noted, ''and you can keep better control by imposing fines.'' Sprinkler systems are a good investment, say managers, because they are a reasonable way to keep lawns healthy through a summer season. The cost ranges from $2,000 for a 800-square-foot of lawn to $80,000 for 20 acres, according to Les Giese, president of the Condo Management Maintenance Corporation of Clinton, N.J. The capital costs of outdoor improvements are more easily accepted and absorbed if they are spread over several seasons, directors say. Often, this will allow a board to cover the costs within the amount the bylaws permit it to spend without going to the full membership for approval of a larger sum. THIS was one of the reasons the board of section one of the Oaks at La Tourette, a 112-unit condominium complex on Staten Island, chose last year to spread its improvement program over three years, said Francis A. Philipp Jr., the president. At the time, railroad ties that protected the bases of trees needed replacement. So did some dead shrubs and a few trees. This and other work brought the costs of improvements to $75,000, which was too much, the directors decided, to cram into one year. Spreading out the work also allows residents to pay for the improvements in installments - an important factor if the program is to be paid for by a special assessment charged to each resident. If the residents are impatient to see results, however, part of the amount could be financed, said Mr. Kleine, or the reserve fund could be tapped. Sometimes the residents may prefer to have the whole project done at once, especially if they feel the improvements would have an immediate impact on values. For example, owners at the Fairways, a 48-unit condominium in Manhasset, L.I., agreed to be assessed $15,000 each to meet the cost of immediately replacing virtually all the original shrubbery, installing an upgraded sprinkler system and enhancing the entrance, said Mr. Hatgis, the manager. The market values of their units had risen from around $300,000 to $700,000 in three years, and the owners were anxious to solidify their position in the market, Mr. Hatgis said. Residents who do not have the cash to pay a substantial assessment usually can get an equity loan. Donations also are possible. Not long ago, Mr. Filler said, a unit owner in a Staten Island condominium approached board members to see if a tree could be planted in the grounds in memory of his mother. He also wanted a plaque on the tree. The condominium agreed. A flowering dogwood was selected and the man paid $325 for the tree and the small plaque. ''Everyone was so grateful they thanked him in the newsletter,'' Mr. Filler said. Further information on ground improvements is contained in a new booklet published by the Community Associations Institute called ''Enhancing Outdoor Spaces for Community Associations.'' It costs $9.50 including postage. Write C.A.I., 1423 Powhatan Street, Suite 7, Alexandria, Va, 22314.

1267-> Our Invaluable Grand Juries
The grand jury, an institution some would abolish, has again proved itself a powerful instrument of social reform. A Manhattan grand jury that recently investigated the death of an 18-year-old woman at a Manhattan hospital did not find enough evidence to return an indictment. But it did find that serious problems in the way the hospital delivered health care may well have contributed to the young woman's death. This, in turn, led the grand jury to recommend drastic changes in the way interns and residents are trained and supervised, including a limitation on the exhausting 36-hour shifts they are required to work, as well as new standards regulating the use of physical restraints and the prescribing of drugs. At the recommendation of a panel of prominent physicians, the grand jury's ideas then became a central part of sweeping changes in hospital regulations proposed by the New York State health commissioner. This grand jury was hardly an aberration. Grand juries have traditionally aroused the public to rally around significant causes. For centuries, the grand jury in England was authorized to issue ''presentments'' - reports of nonindictable or objectionable misconduct. And in colonial America, grand juries also undertook the task of protecting citizens from the tyranny of royal rulers. The most prominent example was the case of Peter Zenger, a New York newspaper publisher who printed a personal attack on the English Governor. In 1734, the Governor twice sought to have Zenger indicted by a grand jury for criminal libel and twice Zenger's fellow citizens refused to charge him. It was only through executive fiat that Zenger was brought to trial. Ultimately, his fellow citizens acquitted him. In the very first draft of the Bill of Rights, James Madison included a provision requiring criminal cases to be prosecuted by grand jury and authorized the grand jury to return ''presentments'' concerning social problems that went beyond the question of simple criminal liability. This provision was incorporated into the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. New York State's Constitution codified the right of citizens to be charged with committing a felony only by indictment by a grand jury of their peers. Under the state's Constitution, grand juries also continued the practice of investigating public corruption. In 1872, a grand jury probing New York City corruption helped end the reign of Boss William Marcy Tweed and his associates. In the 1930's, grand juries did much to assure the prosecution of racketeering and political corruption. In 1938, the Constitution was amended so that a grand jury's power to inquire into the willful misconduct of public officers ''shall never be suspended or impaired by law.'' Again in the 1950's, grand juries in New York investigating crimes and official misconduct routinely issued reports dealing with such topics as organized crime's involvement with the waterfront, gambling and police corruption. In 1961, however, New York State's highest court sought to end the practice of releasing grand jury reports that called attention to official misconduct and recommended reforms - even though that practice had long been recognized as one of the grand jury's most valuable functions. There was an immediate public outcry, and in time the Legislature restored the grand jury's power to make ''presentments'' and even broadened the scope of the reports. The Legislature also included safeguards to protect from unfounded charges those persons whose conduct was described in the reports. In this age of widespread public and private corruption and the mistrust it engenders, grand juries continue to be a vital means not only for leveling criminal accusations but also for identifying and remedying social problems. A grand jury system that can trigger sweeping changes in the system of medical care that affects millions of people must itself be a healthy one.

Olvey is also medical director of the Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit, on which Guerrero competes.

1269-> Koch Offers 10 Buildings for Drug Programs
To accommodate as many as 5,000 more patients in drug treatment programs run by New York State, Mayor Koch has offered 10 city-owned buildings and space in municipal hospitals and clinics. Mr. Koch said he made the offer after he was told by Julio A. Martinez, the director of the State Division of Substance Abuse Services, that the state had the money to treat more patients but not the buildings it needed. ''I said you got 'em,'' Mr. Koch said. The buildings in question have been taken over by the city for nonpayment of real-estate taxes. Mr. Koch and Mr. Martinez said they would start with 10 buildings, but the Mayor added that ''we're prepared to give them as many as they can use.'' Mr. Martinez said he would propose spending $20 million on construction work to rehabilitate the buildings. He declined to say where they were. Mr. Koch also offered to extend hours at centers operated by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation and at Health Department clinics. The state would provide the money to staff and run the centers. Mr. Koch made his proposals, reported in yesterday's issue of The Daily News, in a recent letter to Governor Cuomo. Mr. Martinez said he was preparing a formal response. 'It Makes Sense' ''Some of the stuff the Mayor has put on the table is reasonable and it makes sense and we should definitely consider it,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''The problem is a lot of it is costly to the state.'' The state already treats about 46,000 addicts, 36,000 of whom live in New York City. Mr. Koch said that 1,000 addicts were waiting to enroll in methadone programs and that many more did not bother to put their names on waiting lists. Providing drug treatment at the city-operated clinics would not be subject to the city land-use review process because it would be considered a medical service. ''The communities will be upset,'' Mr. Koch said. ''But I am prepared to take the heat by making our hospitals available. Many of them shut down at 4 o'clock, making them available for drug treatment in the evening.''

1270-> Argentina Debt Stance
Argentina told creditor banks that it would continue to pursue a negotiated solution to its debt problems and observe agreements already in place, United States bankers said yesterday. Citibank, head of the bank committee for Argentina, said it had sent messages from Argentina's Treasury Secretary, Mario Brodersohn, to Argentina's 300 creditor banks worldwide. The Government's message is meant to reassure Argentine debtors, owed some $54 billion, after President Raul Alfonsin last week said his country intended to campaign for a freezing of interest rates on its debts. In addition, a recent election win for the opposition Peronists has sparked speculation Argentina might turn tougher on foreign debt. The Peronists, in their election campaign, said they would seek a moratorium on the country's debt. Their victory in national elections Sept. 6 deprived the Alfonsin Government of a majority in the lower house of Congress. On Aug. 21, Argentina and its bank creditors signed a $34 billion financing agreement including $30 billion of restructurings and $1.95 billion in new loans.

1271-> Art: 'The Tables,' At the Modern
ANY day when it's not actually raining, you will find an interested and inquisitive crowd of people taking stock of an installation by Tom Otterness called ''The Tables'' that can be seen in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art. First seen earlier this season at the Brooke Alexander Gallery in SoHo, ''The Tables'' deserved a larger space, a larger and more general public and an open-air location. This is a transfer that justified the museum's ''Projects'' series many times over. Everything is done to make it easy for us. We sit on comfortable benches that are an integral part of the installation. Eyeball-contact both with the work and with our fellow-visitors would be virtually impossible to avoid. We are part of a planned environment. Not only are we in it, but we complete it. We sit, as if on a metropolitan deck, and everything that happens is at eye level, like a deviant Fourth of July parade, complete with floats, tableaux vivants and unheard but ever-imminent brass bands. Visitors come in halfway through the parade. They look. They decipher. They speculate. Before them is a miniature world, but it is not a world of tin toy soldiers, or of porcelain parrots in a porcelain forest. This is a narrative sculpture about a world in trouble, in which the action is momentarily frozen. A great many things, some of them unpleasant, are happening to the quasi- or semi-human figures that bustle back and forth. Most of them are dwarfish, even if we made some adjustments for scale, but an important part is also played by a giantess who stands erect, sickle in outstretched hand, where all about her are in confusion. Over the whole scene there hangs a cracked and crevassed globe that bodes no good. This visitor noticed a bronze figure that sat quite still, bent over a bronze book, but the general atmosphere is one of panic and probable diaster. A six-legged spider as big as Madison Square Garden stumbles forward at one end of the threefold scene. At the other, humanoid figures in a variant of Oriental dress re-enact Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, baggage and all, and clearly find it heavy going. Elsewhere, a delicate inhabited structure is being toppled by an ingenious and lethal system of ropes and pulleys. Not far away, a cake in the likeness of a United States penny (and clearly inscribed as such) is being sawn into slices by four figures who obviously believe that everyone should have ''an equal slice of the pie.'' Quite clearly, ''The Tables'' cannot be faulted for monotony. Even the United States penny plays many parts - now turning a large box into a pauper's Fort Knox, now blown up to an enormous size and being wheeled along by a gang of diminutive figures, now conspicuous under water, as if in a Roman fountain (possibly as a result of audience participation). On closer examination, we may decide that in their manic activity the hominoid figures are closer to the little tomb-figures that were dug up in China not long ago than to anything in Western art. (The animal-headed sculptures of India may also be relevant.) According to Linda Shearer, the curator at the Modern Museum who decided to bring the installation uptown, cartoon versions of ''Gulliver's Travels'' and a liking for comic strips in general were important to Mr. Otterness when he was preparing the piece. She also has a helpful sentence in the flyer - that ''the work's storybook cosmogony offers itself in a three-ring circus of allusion, association and allegory.'' (We are the readier to believe this, in that Ms. Shearer herself comes from a circus-owning family.) Almost everyone in sight is having a bad time in one way or another. If they put to sea in a boat, a storm blows up on the instant. If they take shelter behind a stockade, other people come busting in. Even if they are big enough to look after themselves, they may come to grief, like the outsize but now fragmentary figure who is reduced to a head, an arm, a leg, a foot and a genital area with its support system. No sooner do they get clear in the open than snakes with hats on come after them. These are people, or rather not-quite-people, for whom life is truly poor, nasty and brutish and quite possibly short. They live a spaceless, unstructured, non-linear existence, much taken up with arduous and apparently pointless labor, and with catastrophe never far away. Yet ''The Tables'' has almost a carnival atmosphere, thanks to the often beguiling and sometimes irrepressible bearing of the people portrayed. Sitting so close to them, we feel almost as if we would be glad to take them home if they were available for adoption. For that reason, this visitor does not quite go along with the apocalyptic interpretation of ''The Tables'' that has a wide currency. There is in the art of Tom Otterness an element of James Thurber, as well as of Franz Kafka. More often than not, it is Thurber who wins out. Nor do the Kafkaesque overtones have the terrible concision of which Kafka was so great a master. This is not to doubt or deride the three-part scheme that Ms. Shearer defines as ''Urban Reality,'' in the center, flanked by ''Nature'' and ''Industry.'' It is rather to say that particular concept was realized once and for all in a definitive way by William Blake close on 200 years ago. Inner cities, the post-industrial era, environmental pollution and the nuclear threat notwithstanding, Blake does not yet call for much revision. What is peculiar to Mr. Otterness is, rather, a roomy, commodious, all-embracing fancy. As in Far Eastern scroll painting, we never know what will turn up next. ''The Tables'' is not so much a political tract as the equivalent of a picaresque novel. As such, it offers adventure, surprise, a wild humor and an occasional frisson of pure terror.

Dagmar Schauberger Amsterdam Gallery New York Public Library at Lincoln Center Through Sept. 12 The costume designs and original costumes by Dagmar Schauberger that can be seen at the Amsterdam Gallery date from 1972 onward and were made primarily for productions in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Based not only on the great European classical repertory but also on more recent plays by Hugo Panizza and others, they display a radical and not seldom wry and undeceived approach. The question asked is not so much ''Will this look nice?'' as ''Will this bring a great but overly familiar play back to life?'' The drawing has, moreover, an edgy, biting quality that makes it clear that the theater is a very serious business. In the original costumes, there is, once again, a determination to go beyond the traditionally spectacular. The question asked is, ''To what extent do certain colors relate to centers of energy in the human body?'', and the answers are intuitive, not doctrinaire. It is relevant to the show that Ms. Schauberger is not so much a mainline stage designer as someone who aims to be in command of every single aspect of performance - location, design, direction, sound, acting, dance, lighting and text. One such production, ''The Illusion of Liberty,'' was given in an unused prison in Amsterdam in 1981. The audience - limited to a maximum of 90 - was startled to find how important a role was played by the sound of their own feet as they successively trod gravel, sand, bathroom tiles, carpet and metal stairs. A very large number of loud speakers, secreted in the prison walls, made all-enveloping and quite unexpected noises at the right moment, and there were hallucinatory changes of scene that are still talked about. Another large-scale production - ''What Have You Done on Earth?'' - was to have been done, again in Amsterdam, with the collaboration of the Dutch radio choir and the Dutch National Ballet Company, only to have been halted last year when a potential sponsor took the title too personally. None of this comes out in the show, but don't let that stop you from going.

1272-> Harold Washington Deserved Better
To the Editor: One would expect the obituary of the first black mayor of Chicago to include a chronicle of his political career as well as personal history. However, segments of yours (front page, Nov. 26) were offensive, if not irrelevant, particularly the three paragraphs beginning, ''Harold Washington's rise to power in Chicago was not without controversy.'' Mr. Washington's troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and the Illinois Supreme Court were nearly 20 years old, had long been resolved and did not prevent him from being elected mayor twice. The description of his domestic habits, fashion sense and personal style, partly attributed to a 1985 profile in The Chicago Tribune, had no bearing on his accomplishments. Harold Washington earned a special place in United States history, and he deserves to be remembered with dignity. He was an astute political leader and a dedicated public servant who, in the words of Representative William H. Gray, ''virtually worked himself to death for the City of Chicago.''

1273-> NETHERLANDS COMPANY AT MET
THE Netherlands Dance Theater returned to the Metropolitan Opera House last night for the first time since 1982 with four works choreographed by its artistic director, Jiri Kylian. The good news first: ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges,'' the well-known musical theater piece by Maurice Ravel and Colette, choreographed at its 1925 world premiere by George Balanchine, emerges unscathed in Mr. Kylian's straightforward new staging and boasts superb performances by Marly Knoben as the little boy antihero and his singing counterpart in the pit, Evelyn Petros. One of the delights of this little opera, whose title is usually translated as ''The Spellbound Child,'' is the way the furniture and china around the child come to life. It does so again thanks to the fanciful animated props designed by John Macfarlane and the lighting illusions of Jennifer Tipton. The other three United States premieres that Mr. Kylian ladles out, however, make for a suprisingly thin soup. The Czechoslovak-born choreographer has stirred us in the past with his passionate ensemble pieces - and he has had a special ear for hearing the unrevealed textures in the music of composers of Slavic descent. By his own account, he is now exploring new directions - and this is obvious onstage. In ''Heart's Labyrinth,'' he seems to be shedding the Expressionist formulas that have made him so successful, although he deals with a subject that requires them most. The work was inspired by the suicide of a dancer in the company after she retired from performing. In ''Six Dances,'' to Mozart's Six German Dances, Mr. Kylian has returned to comic ballet, a genre that is alien to him, and in ''Silent Cries,'' a solo dedicated to and danced by his wife, Sabine Kupferberg, he makes an interesting attempt to work against the associations of a familiar score - Debussy's ''Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune.'' In each case, the work is danced by a fine company - one that has had a large turnover in personnel and which, except for a few veterans like Miss Knoben, does not quite have the raw power of the past. Just the fact that Mr. Kylian was attracted by ''L'Enfant et les Sortileges'' is testimony to his new interest. His version lacks the magic and poetry of Balanchine and Ravel (Balanchine staged four versions) or the vibrancy of the recent John Dexter-David Hockney production presented on the Metropolitan Opera's ''Parade'' bill. But the earthiness that surges so often in Mr. Kylian's duets is used with direct didactic effect. There is nothing delicate or pastoral about the shepherd and shepherdess here -these are less storybook characters (Miss Kupferberg and Lionel Hoche) than the peasants close to the earth who surface in some of Mr. Kylian's communal rounds. This is a very real little boy who torments his pets, and he lives amid rather worn furniture - each item has a singing counterpart and Miss Knoben throws marvelous tantrums. His redemption comes, of course, when he bandages a squirrel's paw -Ms. Kupferberg in an ingenious beehive cage that is the frame for a giant tea cozy. That tea cozy in fact is the boy's ''mother,'' and when he climbs up her huge skirt as his vocal counterpart sings out ''Mama,'' Mr. Kylian does indeed touch the heart. All the singing performances,under the direction of the company's superb conductor, David Porcelijn, are excellent. Joke Zijlstra as the princess, carried off by a surprisingly evil prince, stood out amid choreography that was conventional but suitable. The Chinoiserie of the teacup-teapot duet, danced by Karin Heijninck and Patrick Delcroix, was a relative highpoint. Mr. Kylian seems unduly limited in his vocabulary on this program. ''Silent Cries,'' to the Debussy score, works to the extent that Miss Kupferberg is a fine dancer. An essay in self-discovery, this solo has her finger-painting against a glass paint-smeared with white, chinning herself from its rim and unfortunately moving to every beat and note. The Mozart ''Six Dances'' has its dancers in 18th-century corsets, petticoats moving to the beat while figures in 20th-century clothes observe them for no reason. The piece is laughable rather than comic. There is nothing to laugh about in the deeply felt ''Heart's Labyrinth,'' which begins with a woman walking down a long flight of steps, coming out of a door with a funhouse mirror and recoiling at her distorted reflection. The succeeding images are of a woman (danced by several dancers) who lives, suffers and is loved. At the end, she leaves. That is, she dies. Except for two duets - for Miss Zijlstra and Nacho Duato, and for Teresina Mosco and Gerald Tibbs -the choreography is trite. Private grief is not always translated into a public idiom. The musical selections are by Schoenberg, Webern and Dvorak.

1274-> RARE BIRD'S REMAINS TO BE STUDIED
Researchers at the University of Georgia have obtained the remains of the last pure dusky sparrow and intend to use them for a genetics study, according to Professor John Avise of the school's Department of Genetics. He said he hoped to duplicate the bird's DNA in order to learn more about other types of sparrows still living. The bird's heart and other tissues were delivered to the Athens campus last week. The Smithsonian Institution and other universities have expressed interest in other parts of the bird's remains, he said. The bird, a 12-year-old dusky sparrow named Orange Band, died last week at Walt Disney World's Discovery Island near Orlando, Fla., apparently of old age. The pure dusky sparrow is not found anywhere else in the world. ''Our primary interest is to compare the DNA of the now-extinct bird with that of existing seaside sparrows,'' Dr. Avise said. At one time, the brown 6-inch birds were common in a 10-mile stretch of Florida's eastern coastal region. The intrusion of the space program on Cape Canaveral, pesticides, and road construction in the bird's small habitat are cited as factors in the species' extinction.

1275-> Crable Suggests Jet Trouble-Shooter
It's not a new idea for the Jets. But today marked the first time a player publicly suggested that the team needs front-office help to combat its cold-weather blahs. The advice came from one of the Jets' veteran linebackers, Bob Crable, in the wake of a third straight December loss that removed them from the playoff picture. All that remains is the season finale next Sunday against the Giants, a game that had once appeared so attractive, perhaps even deciding the teams' playoff futures. A year ago, the Jets also lost their first three games in December. In Coach Joe Walton's five-year regime, the Jets are 4-11 in that month compared with his 37-26 mark before the chill sets in. When asked about those late-season collapses, Crable replied: ''I don't know, but I think Joe ought to get somebody from the outside to come in and look at the situation. There's got to be a reason for it.'' Should the neutral observer look at the coaching as well? 'Could Be a Bonus' ''All aspects,'' Crable said. ''There could be a bonus for the organization. It's just a question of whether they want to do it or not - somebody removed from the day-to-day operations, who can at least give options, somebody who could say, 'We did it this way in Seattle,' or 'We did it this way in Buffalo.' That's just one man's opinion.'' Crable's statement apparently followed a conversation with one of the assistant coaches, who said he knew of teams that use just such a trouble-shooter. When asked about Crable's suggestion, Jim Kensil, the club's president, replied, ''If Bob wants to raise that with anybody in the organization -preferably Joe - I wouldn't object.'' But Kensil wouldn't specifically address Crable's suggestion. ''That comes under the heading of what we'll assess when the season's over,'' Kensil said, ''and I don't want to get into specifics.'' Unusual Structure Periodically, whenever the Jets get into trouble, finger-pointing often winds up in the direction of management, which has an unusual structure for a National Football League team. There is no central football figure at the helm - no one with the title of general manager, or director of football operations. Rather, the operation is divided among a financial manager, Steve Gutman, who signs the higher-priced talent and is a close link to the owner, Leon Hess; Kensil, the president, responsible for the club's day-to-day operations and coordinating the business and athletic sides; Mike Hickey, who directs the college draft; Jim Royer, who is in charge of acquiring free agents and waived players, and, of course, Walton. The group had been part of a relatively successful organization, one which has made the playoffs in the previous two seasons and in four of the previous six. Now, the Jets are a 6-8 club, with players who suddenly seem old. ''I tend to be a realist,'' said Kurt Sohn, the wide receiver, when asked whether the 6-8 record was a true reflection of the talent. ''Whatever our record is, that's what our team is,'' Sohn said. ''If you're a 5-6 team - and I'm not including the strike games - then you've got a mediocre-to-bad team. If you're a mediocre-to-bad team, then other clubs are playing better than you are and coaches are coaching better and management is providing players better than you are. When we were winning, everyone shared in the credit, and when we're losing, everyone should share part of the blame.'' No Reasons Offered But Sohn, and several other players interviewed, said they could not come up with specific reasons for those collapses that have hounded the team -indeed, almost defined it as a club that doesn't win under pressure. Crable's first season was 1982, a strike year under Coach Walt Michaels, with the club losing two of its last three regular-season games. It recovered with two consecutive playoff victories on the road, only to lose the conference championship at Miami. In 1983, Walton's first season as head coach, the second-half mark was 4-4. Then it was 1-7 after a 6-2 start. In 1985 the Jets were 5-3 after a 6-2 first half. Last season they were 3-5 after a 7-1 beginning. Kensil has characterized Walton as ''a good coach.'' When asked today how he reacted to that opinion, Walton replied, ''I think I'm a good coach, too.'' Walton would not answer any questions on personnel, saying only that the matter would be looked into after the Giants' game. In that game, with nothing on the line, he said he plans to start his regulars. ''It's a game you want to play well in,'' he said. ''I want to try to win.'' Fields Likes Center Joe Fields, who was switched over to guard after playing center since 1975, said he wants to return next season. Would he like to go back to center? ''Oh, yeah. Center's my position.'' . . . Freeman McNeil will miss the Giants game with a hamstring injury.

1276-> Pan Am Drug Issue Widens
A day after six athletes were disqualified for testing positive for the use of banned substances in the Pan American Games, three other athletes were said to have used a substance that could hide the use of steroids. In announcing the finding today, Mario Vazquez Rana, the president of the Pan American Sports Organization, said that the athletes in question - he declined to identify them -would not be sanctioned because the masking substance, probenecid, is not among the 3,700 substances banned by the International Olympic Committee. However, he said that he would urge the I.O.C. to consider adding the drug to the list. A source familiar with the findings, which are based on the athletes' urine samples, said that two of them were gold-medal winners in track and field from the United States. The source would not name them, however. The United States won 13 of 20 gold medals in men's events and 13 of 18 in women's events although recent evidence indicated that only men were using the substance. Dr. Don H. Catlin, the director of the Olympic laboratory at U.C.L.A., which conducts drug testing for the United States Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, said that it was most likely that athletes in strength events would use the drug rather than those in events that do not require speed or endurance. Vazquez Rana also said that those who showed evidence of probenecid were not among the six previously identified, a group that included Bill Green of the United States, the silver medalist in the hammer throw. Drug Used for Gout Probenecid, a semisynthetic form of penicillin, is often used to combat gout and venereal diseases. It is also known to inhibit the discharge of fluids, which means evidence of steroid use may be absent from a urine sample given at the conclusion of an athlete's competition. In an interview from Los Angeles, Dr. Catlin said that he has been ''hearing rumors'' for several weeks about athletes using probenecid to mask steroids. As a result, his laboratory began looking for it as an indication that the sample may also contain steroids. Probenecid showed up ''at least a half a dozen times,'' he said. ''It's not likely an athlete would take probenecid for medical purposes,'' he said, adding that its presence serves as a ''red flag'' for steroid use. Dr. Catlin said that to his knowledge, no studies have been made to determine the effectiveness of probenecid as a steroid masker, and he doubted that it would conceal large dosages of steroids. ''If the amount of steroids is small,'' he said, ''it's conceivable it could cover it. I think that's what they're after, but I know of no proof that it works.'' In a related matter, Vazquez Rana amended a statement he made Monday, that as far as he knew, all individual medal winners were being tested for banned substances. That explanation contradicted the contention of Dr. Eduardo Henrique DeRose, the chief medical officer, that approximately 70 percent of the medal winners were being tested. Today, Vazquez Rana said that about 2 percent of the medal winners were not tested. ''I don't want to be accused of a glitch,'' he said. Vazquez Rana blamed the discrepancy on a ''misunderstanding'' in the flow of information, although he did not elaborate. Even with Vazquez Rana's correction, most indications are that Dr. DeRose's estimate remains closer to the reality. All swimmers and shooters tested, for example, were selected at random, and some athletes, like Cindy Greiner of the United States, the gold medalist in the heptathlon, have said they were not tested. Vazquez Rana touched on several other issues during a hourlong briefing with reporters. One of them involved another contradiction. Leaders of the Cuban delegation here have expressed disappointment over the organizing committee's selection of the Miami Sound Machine as the band to play at the closing ceremonies Sunday. Some members of the band are Cuban-Americans from Miami, which has a large community of Cuban-Americans opposed to the government of Fidel Castro. Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, one of the Cuban leaders here, said to reporters that Cuba would participate in the ceremonies only if a different band played. However, earlier, at a meeting with officials from the organizing committee, the Cubans left the question open. Conrado Martinez Corona, the chief of their delegation, said Cuba's participation would depend upon security measures and the amount of provocation by demonstrators between now and the conclusion of competition Sunday. Selection of Band an Issue Vazquez Rana said he thought the organizers hired the band in good faith and predicted that the Cubans would attend the ceremonies ''and admit they are wrong.'' In another matter, Vazquez Rana said that the U.S.O.C. would ''have to be sanctioned'' because the State Department would not allow a member of Chile's shooting team into the country, even though he has been identified as a former member of the Chilean intelligence agency with involvement in a series of murders and tortures. Two officials from the State Department met with Vazquez Rana and other members of the P.A.S.O. executive committee, explaining why the shooter, Francisco Zuniga, was kept out. Vazquez Rana said they provided ''highly confidential'' information - oral, not written - about Zuniga, and he thanked them. He also acknowledged that United States immigration laws conflict with the I.O.C. charter, which provides that all accredited athletes should be allowed into other countries. ''The U.S. laws are right,'' he said. ''But we have our regulations, and we received a very strong protest'' from Chile's Olympic committee over the visa denial. For that reason, he said, a sanction of some sort is likely. The form of sanction, he added, would be determined at a later date.

1277-> Photo of Sue Chin Lim, a teaching assistant, instructing high school students in a remedial math class at Boston University. (NYT/Rick Friedman) Job + Classes - Anti-Dropout Plan
Children from impoverished homes can lose as much reading skill over a summer as they gain in a whole school year, according to educators here who are adding remedial instruction to a Federal program that gives summer jobs to poor teen-agers. That is why 15-year-old Maurice Williams is not visiting his grandparents in rural North Carolina this year, but spending much of his summer on the Boston University campus, solving math problems posed by a computer and brushing up on reading. ''I had nothing else to do,'' Maurice said today as he calculated the least common denominator for 2/3, 4/7 and 1/2. ''I like the surroundings; it has a lot of opportunity and stuff,'' said Maurice. Dressed in a red-and-white Boston University T-shirt, he said he would consider applying there after high school. ''It's better than not doing nothing,'' said his partner at the computer, Jermaine Ellis, 16, also entering the 10th grade and absorbed in finding the answer to the math problem (42). The Pupils Are Paid for Their Time Also better than nothing is the money: the teen-agers get the minimum wage, $3.65, for the 98 hours they spend in the classroom over eight weeks as well as for 80 or more hours at their part-time jobs. The program, started in 1985, is an experiment so far, involving 300 students here and 1,200 more in four other cities. But its sponsor, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit group called Public/Private Ventures, says it already shows that such efforts can help keep poor children from falling behind. ''Advantaged children continue to learn in the summer, but disadvantaged children decline,'' said Gordon Berlin of the Ford Foundation, which is helping to finance the project, at a breakfast meeting Tuesday. ''The key to raising the academic average is helping these kids at the bottom.'' The secret of Japan's academic success, he said, is having ''the best bottom 50 percent in the world.'' Here in Massachusetts, where the unemployment rate is only 2.5 percent and many jobs are unfilled, Boston's high school dropout rate of 43 percent is a serious problem for the labor market as well as for the individual youths. And declining birth rates in the middle class mean that a far larger proportion of young people - half, by some estimates -spend some part of their childhoods in poverty. Officials fear that the dropout problem and labor shortage could get worse. Mayor Raymond Flynn, speaking at the meeting yesterday, commented on the disparity between the booming Boston economy, bolstered by the financial services sector, and the declining economic prospects of low-income families. ''Behind the shadow of these great engines of the economy, there are a number of people who are realy not benefiting,'' he said. 'It's Really Not That Boring' The project here - called STEP, for Summer Training and Education Program - seeks to bridge that gap by giving poor teen-agers some extra help before 9th and 10th grades. Maurice and Jermaine were among 25 students in a classroom with two teachers and three teachers' aides, a ratio far more favorable than in the Boston public schools. Another was Jane Hayes, 15, who said she was getting a head start on ''the stuff we'll be getting in the 10th grade.'' She added, ''The kids I hang with think it's stupid, but it's really not that boring.'' Northeastern, Harvard and Boston Universities, and the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts, donated space and facilities, and most of the part-time jobs are campus clerical work. The campus location is an advantage for the students, according to those who operate the program. ''They pick up some of the good feelings which accrue as a consequence of being in a place where they can look up to things, and have a sense of the future,'' said Michael Bailin, the president of Public/Private Ventures. The program tries to instill the idea of planning for the future with its ''Life Skills and Opportunities'' course, which stresses avoiding teen-age pregnancy and drug use. A Boston University junior who works as an aide in the project said some of the pupils showed great curiosity about being a college student. ''They ask me what the dorms are like, if I'm doing a lot of work all the time,'' said Amy Specktor, a psychology major. But for others, she said, ''This is the last glimmer of hope.'' The effectiveness of the program - also operating in San Diego and Fresno, Calif., Portland, Ore., and Seattle - is still under study. The first group of teen-agers enrolled are still too young to have graduated. But they have been found to be 22 percent less likely to be held back. The remedial instruction has been found to reduce the summer loss of reading skill and to improve math scores. The program costs about $1,600 a student over two summers, according to Mr. Bailin. While many of the students here expressed at least limited enthusiasm for the program, Mr. Bailin says summer school has an unshakeable reputation. ''Most of them,'' he said, ''are envious of the kids across the street who just do the work part''

1278-> New York Officials Shifting Blame In Struggle to Combat Corruption
As corruption cases mount throughout New York State, officials are unable to agree on what needs to be done about dishonesty in government and are caught up in a scramble to blame one another for the problem. The United States Attorney for New York's Southern District blames the State Legislature, saying it has blocked the tougher laws that are necessary. Legislators blame district attorneys, saying current laws are sufficient but unenforced. The district attorneys maintain the laws are not sufficient. Governor Cuomo wants stricter laws but also blames the times, saying New York's corruption is part of a nationwide breakdown in values. Citizen watchdog groups are outraged, demanding to know how 44 municipal officials could have accepted, according to the F.B.I., 105 out of 106 bribes offered. Aftermath of Arrests A host of questions are being bandied about among government leaders in the aftermath of those officials' arrests last week, only the latest in a series of corruption cases that include the New York City scandals, the indictment of a former Syracuse mayor and investigations into possible payroll abuses by half a dozen state legislators: Just how pervasive is corruption in the state? Is New York State more corrupt than other areas? Are tougher laws the answer? Why is most of the New York corruption being exposed by the Federal Government and not state and local authorities? ''There is a mound of evidence that something is terribly wrong with the political system in New York,'' said the United States Attorney for the Southern District, Rudolph W. Giuliani. An Intensive Campaign In interviews with more than two dozen elected officials, academics and leaders of watchdog groups, these points emerged: * Half a dozen district attorneys said local officials they believe to be corrupt have gone unprosecuted because New York laws make it too difficult - more difficult than in most other states - to bring corruption cases. * Governor Cuomo, Attorney General Robert Abrams and others said that when the Legislature reconvened in January, they would undertake an intensive campaign to win passage of laws aimed at making it easier to obtain corruption convictions. But some lawmakers and civil-rights groups said they would campaign to block such laws, arguing that the laws would make it too easy for prosecutors to convict innocent people. * Several academics and law-enforcement officials outside New York State said they did not believe New York was more corrupt than other areas. They said the types of cases being uncovered were common around the country and showed no widespread organized machine or network of corruption. And they argued that the very cases drawing a public outcry were proof that the system worked, that corruption in New York was being uncovered and prosecuted. * Discussion and handling of the corruption issue is clouded by allegations about the political motivations of an array of officials. Legislators assert, for example, that Mr. Giuliani is grandstanding, making the problem appear worse than it is, to build up his reputation in preparation for a race for the Senate or the New York City mayoralty - a motive Mr. Giuliani vigorously denies. The United States Attorney does not produce figures to prove that corruption is more rampant in New York than elsewhere. And New York officials adamantly contend it is not. 'Whispers Become Shouts' ''You want to go to Cicero, Illinois, to California,'' Governor Cuomo said, referring to areas where recent corruption cases have been brought. ''In Washington, you've got the guys at the very top stealing money. It's not just New York. But everything we do is gigantic because of the media exposure. Everything we do, our whispers become shouts.'' Although Mr. Giuliani acknowledges that it is impossible to say which state is more corrupt because much corruption goes unexposed, he argues that New York has made itself more attractive to corruption than many other states. He lays the blame squarely with the Legislature. The United States Attorney says legislators sent the wrong signal around the state in their battle over an ethics code, which ''they had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to enact.'' He said lawmakers filled the code with loopholes. For example, financial disclosure is really not disclosure, Mr. Giuliani said, since a legislative commission can block the release of any data. He pointed out that lawmakers could not be prosecuted by a district attorney for filing a false disclosure form unless the commission first voted to recommend prosecution. ''What sort of signal is that to other officials in the state?'' he asked. Immunity From Prosecution In addition, he said the state's laws should be changed to conform to those of the Federal Government and most other states. Currently, a witness before a state grand jury is automatically granted immunity from prosecution and cannot be prosecuted for anything he testifies about before the grand jury. Mr. Giuliani said that hindered corruption cases. An official thought to be honest who testifies before a grand jury may be found later to have been corrupt. He cannot be prosecuted, however, because he is protected by the immunity. Under the Federal system - which Mr. Giuliani, Governor Cuomo and Attorney General Abrams believe should be adopted by New York - a grand jury witness can be prosecuted for something he testified about as long as the evidence was obtained independently of statements the witness made before the grand jury. Under the current state system, a defendant cannot be convicted solely on the basis of testimony by an accomplice. The testimony must be corroborated by other evidence, such as a witness or physicial evidence. The Federal Government allows convictions based solely on an accomplice's testimony, and Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Abrams want the state to do the same. In interviews, half a dozen state prosecutors, including District Attorneys Carl A. Vergari of Westchester County and Kenneth Gribetz of Rockland County, said they had to drop cases against local officials because the only evidence they had was the testimony of an accomplice - either someone who offered a bribe or received one. 'The Liberal View' The changes in the state law have been blocked over the last decade by the Legislature. Mr. Giuliani said he did not think lawmakers were ''venal,'' adding that they had acted mostly out of ''philosophical reasons, the liberal view of criminal justice.'' ''I don't think they mean to protect crooked politicians,'' he said. ''But the end result is that they do it.'' He added, however, that some lawmakers were also practicing defense attorneys and that ''making the system unwieldy so that it doesn't work very well is of benefit to them.'' Lawmakers express outrage over his comments. They point out that the changes in the state criminal code have been debated for decades, with such groups as the New York Civil Liberties Union opposed to them. ''I'll tell you what upsets me,'' said State Senator Emanuel R. Gold, a Queens Democrat. ''I applaud Giuliani's work. I applaud the F.B.I. Get the bribe takers. But don't look for a scapegoat everytime you do it. The unnecessary gratuitous reference to it in some way being the fault of the Legislature - bribery has been a crime in New York for 200 years. To suggest the Legislature condones bribery is childish and absurd.'' Potential for Abuse The Speaker of the State Assembly, Mel Miller, and others argue that the changes in law sought by Mr. Giuliani, the Governor and the Attorney General - all of which are supported by district attorneys - have too much potential for abuse. ''We have strengthened the laws in some areas,'' Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said. ''But in other areas,'' he added, apparently referring to the changes Mr. Giuliani wants, ''we thought the present law was better.'' Legislators say that an accomplice is by definition a criminal and that to convict someone based solely on an accomplice's testimony is to rely on the word of a witness whose honor is tarnished. They say an unscrupulous district attorney could strike a deal with the accomplice, agreeing to reduce other charges against him in return for giving false testimony. They also say an unscrupulous district attorney could abuse the proposed change in witness immunity. The district attorney might say the witness is being convicted on the basis of idependently obtained evidence, but who really knows if the evidence was obtained independently? The legislators say that simply because the Federal Government and other states have adopted the changes and indicate that they are pleased with them does not mean they are not being abused. There may be all kinds of abuses, the legislators say, that no one has a way of knowing about. Opposed by Police Groups The lawmakers say police groups, among the most powerful lobbying influences in Albany, are among the leading opponents to changing the grand-jury immunity. Police officers like the current system, the lawmakers say, because once they testify against a defendant, they have immunity from prosecution. If a later charge is made against the officer - say, for police brutality in the officer's handling of the case - the officer cannot be prosecuted. In conversations among themselves, some lawmakers are contemptuous of Mr. Giuliani and mock some of the cases he has brought, particularly the ones announced last week against the 44 municipal officials. They were arrested on charges that they accepted bribes and kickbacks from an undercover F.B.I. agent who posed as a vendor of steel products. Some lawmakers, reflecting a concern by others about so-called sting operations, contend that the officials were entrapped. All that is not to say that legislators are opposed to changes in the law. State Senator Nick Spano, a Yonkers Republican, called last week for legislation requiring competitive bidding by municipalities for contracts worth more than $300. Currently, a construction contract must be worth at least $7,000 and a purchase contract at least $5,000 before competitive bidding is necessary. Legislators also maintain that municipalities need to increase their salaries for officials, arguing that a public-works supervisor earning $17,000 a year and overseeing $2 million in contracts is vulnerable to bribes. Abuses Overlooked But the lawmakers are especially critical of district attorneys, saying they need to be more aggressive in the pursuit of corruption and suggesting that some district attorneys are too close to the local political operation and too willing to overlook abuses. The district attorneys, for their part, say the Legislature has not given them the tools they need, especially the changes in the state laws that Mr. Giuliani and others recommend. But even if the laws were passed, they say they will not necessarily have the resources to expose corruption. That takes money - for the setting up of bogus corporations for a sting operation, for example, and manpower - that they say they do not have. The district attorneys also argue that Mr. Giuliani's success is not their failure, that the system is working, that corruption is being uncovered and that it does not matter whether it is by them or him. Not Easy to Change Paul H. Elisha, the executive director of New York Common Cause, a citizen group, endorses many of the changes proposed by the Governor, Mr. Giuliani and legislators. But he says much of the problem comes from factors not easy to change. Much of the corruption, he says, is in localities dominated by one political party - be it Democrats in New York City or Republicans upstate. A way needs to be found to provide internal monitoring in those localities that fills the void left by the lack of normal Republican-Democratic checks on each other. In the end, Mr. Elisha has no proposal for dealing with what he sees as the root of corruption. ''You can pass laws that will hopefully be a deterrent,'' he said. ''But you can't pass a law making an honest man out of someone who is dishonest.''

1279-> Steel Output Rises 1.2%
Steel production rose to 1.787 million tons in the week ended Saturday, up 1.2 percent from the previous week's 1.766 million tons, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported yesterday. The industry's production amounted to 83.5 percent of capacity during the week, compared with 82.6 percent in the previous week. Estimated figures for the year to date showed production at 63.451 million net tons, an increase of 3.2 percent from the 61.464 million net tons in the previous year. Production so far this year used 76.9 percent of capacity, compared with 64.9 percent a year earlier.

1280-> Old-Movie Houses Dwindle And the Die-Hard Buffs Worry
Old-movie buffs count the casualties. The Thalia is closed and the Metro has gone first-run. Cross off the New Yorker, too. Also the Carnegie Hall, Bleecker Street and Hollywood Twin Cinemas. And don't forget the old Elgin. It is a widespread syndrome, laments Justin Freed of the Coolidge Corner in Brookline, Mass. ''The heyday of revival is over,'' he said. But the Regency on Manhattan's Upper West Side says business is very good, and downtown Theater 80 St. Marks says it's fine. Other downtown revival houses - Cinema Village, Thalia SoHo and Film Forum 2 - seem to be doing all right. And in Somerville, Mass., the Somerville Theater says attendance is growing steadily. ''The audience is still there,'' said Michael Silverman of Kino International, the film classics distributor. But it has shrunk, others in the business contend. There is no doubt that across the country, many revival or repertory houses have closed or switched to first-run since the revival peak of the mid-1970's through the early 80's. Only a Quarter Left According to Dennis Doph of Columbia Pictures, there are only a quarter as many revival theaters as there were then. Doug Lemza of Films Inc. estimates the nationwide decline at more than 50 percent in the last 18 months. Some of the theaters succumbed to real estate development or rising rents; others, it seems, to cable television and video cassettes. ''You are now able to enjoy 'Casablanca' or 'Harold and Maude' sitting home in your underwear and eating potato salad,'' as one theater owner put it. Some detect other changes. ''One core of our audience has been the college generation,'' said Mr. Freed, whose Coolidge Corner Movie House in Brookline will soon end its vintage programming, devoting both screens instead of one chiefly to first-run art films. ''In the past there was an old-movie sensibility on the part of students,'' he said. ''It was the thing to do, certainly in the late 60's to the early 80's. That has drastically changed.'' A Brighter View But some people say the decline of revival houses is exaggerated. ''A lot of these closings were just theaters that hopped on a bandwagon,'' said Howard Otway, owner of the 15-year-old Theater 80 St. Marks. He knows, he said, because he got phone calls from a lot of them. ''If someone said to you, 'I'm going to write an article, how do you do it?' you'd have a pretty good idea that they're not going to be successful, right?'' he said. As Bruce Goldstein, another longtime revivalist and a programmer for Film Forum 2, saw it, you had better love the business if you get into it because ''it's not a way to make money.'' In contrast to first-run theaters, whose advertising and overhead for a movie typically are paid by the distributor, who then takes perhaps 90 percent of the gross, he said, ''We have to pay all advertising and expenses and pay the distributors a guarantee'' as well as some percentage of the gross. There is the aggravation of finding good prints, he said. ''And we have to publish the calendar, which is a crucial part of this business.'' Big Screen vs. Little Screen Calendars typically find their way to the refrigerator doors of old-movie buffs, who circle this or that double-feature - a pair of Bogart or Jimmy Stewart films, Capra or Fellini -mouthwatering throwbacks from the silents to the 1930's or 40's or later -even 80's films are sometimes billed. Some buffs are worried. After ''four hours spent in absolute bliss'' watching John Ford's ''Mogambo'' and ''King Solomon's Mines'' at Theater 80 St. Marks recently, Marlene Swartz, who is co-director of the SoHo Rep stage, said: ''I'm terrified that the rising rents that are destroying other small arts activities in New York will have the same effect on revival houses. It just scares me that Howard Otway will have a heart attack and my life will be destroyed.'' Some think cable and the video cassette will help revival's cause by whetting appetites for old films as they were intended to be seen. True aficionados, they reason, are not satisfied seeing classics on little television screens. ''I saw Buster Keaton's 'General' on videotape and it was a joke,'' said Ms. Swartz, unable to observe up close ''all the wonderful things Keaton does with his face.'' And video versions of widescreen movies notoriously reduce dancing trios to couples. A Mix Seems to Help George Monsour, who owns Images Cinema, a revival house in Williamstown, Mass., and who books films for 30 theaters of one kind or another, says the key to survival is mixing the old with first-run art films, that is, with foreign or American independent or offbeat pictures. The successful Landmark Theater chain has done that in 9 of its 34 movie houses in the West and Midwest. Some theaters, like the Brattle in Cambridge, are even mixing revival with live theater and music. The Somerville, which intermingles revival with concerts and some first-run art films, also avoided real estate problems by getting a long lease before the neighborhood gentrified. Another real estate help is owning your own theater, as Mr. Otway does with 80 St. Marks. Even doomsayers do not seem to expect revival houses to disappear altogether, especially from major cities like New York. And optimists note that some first- or second-run theaters show old movies some of the time, and that there remain places like the Museum of Modern Art and the Public Theater to treasure classics. But predictions vary. As Mr. Monsour puts it, ''There are bright spots in a generally gloomy outlook.'' Or as Mike Schlesinger of MGM/UA Classics saw it, ''It's like a bad cold, not emphysema.''

'Anglo Raj' Furniture for a Country Look LAST November Ian Harrington and his wife, Charsi, went to London looking for original pine furniture they could import into the United States and sell. For the past few years decorating with stripped pine furniture has been an easy way to achieve the popular country look. Fresh and pristine, pine tables, chests and armoires have been synonymous with the informal decor in weekend houses. ''But this time around all we saw were reproductions,'' Mrs. Harrington recalled. ''It was very difficult to find good old pieces, and we felt that maybe the market for pine was saturated over here.'' While the couple were abroad they decided to travel to Sri Lanka at the suggestion of Rodney Weston, a friend who was building a house there. ''We agreed, not only to escape from the English winter but to look for a new kind of furniture venture as well,'' Mr. Harrington said. They soon found what they were looking for: chairs, chaises, tables and beds in what they described as the ''plantation or English colonial or Anglo Raj'' style. ''We saw this kind of furniture as the next step after pine,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''And we thought it would be appropriate for Long Island beach houses as well as New York apartments.'' It was, they said, both comfortable and elegant. ''The pieces were in houses all over the island,'' Mr. Weston said. ''It was just a matter of searching them out.'' They found them in the plantation houses that had belonged to British planters in Sri Lanka. The houses were intact but closed up, and the furniture, most of it dating from the 1840's to the 1880's, was for sale. Some pieces needed restoration, which was done by Sri Lankan craftsmen. After accumulating about 155 pieces the Harringtons and Mr. Weston, who decided to establish an informal partnership, had the furniture shipped to the Harringtons' house in Southampton, L.I. Conveying to potential customers the style of the furniture was a problem. They tried relating it to movies. ''We would say think of 'Passage to India,' '' Mr. Harrington recalled. '' 'Haven't seen it,' most people would reply. Then we would say what about 'Out of Africa'? Only then did we get a glimmer of recognition.'' Graceful low-backed chaises, large round tables, brass-trimmed linen chests, beds and Dutch-influenced side chairs made of mahogany, teak and nadoun wood and cane are in the collection. The appeal of the designs is more in their romantic look than in their pedigree. But last weekend, Mrs. Harrington said, Calvin Klein and his wife, Kelly, bought a few pieces for the house they are building nearby. One of the most striking pieces is a version of the planter's chair, a traditional colonial design with swing-out arms that the master of the house could rest his legs on to have his boots removed. Now the arms are used for drinks and snacks. The furniture is on display in the Harringtons' house on Shinnecock Bay in Southampton. Prices range from $120 for a small side table to $2,600 for a four-poster bed. A round dining table 60 inches in diameter is $1,850, and a chaise is $1,840. The more formal pieces have been displayed in the Harrington's living room and foyer, while part of the ground floor has been converted into a showroom for the rest. The collection can be seen at 298 East Montauk Highway, Southampton, by appointment (telephone 516-728-0449).

1285-> BankAmerica Offers Shares
The BankAmerica Corporation, the nation's second-largest banking company, said yesterday that it was offering to sell up to 10 million common shares to its current stockholders at a 5 percent discount in an effort to raise equity capital. The plan, approved by BankAmerica's directors at their May meeting and announced in a prospectus being mailed to stockholders, is separate from a $1 billion capital-raising plan. Based on yesterday's closing price of $11.625 a share, the sale of 10 million shares would bring the bank more than $100 million. In Tokyo, meanwhile, senior officials of Japan's big commercial banks met yesterday to consider helping BankAmerica build its reserves. But many remained noncommital about whether they would buy the San Francisco company's notes, banking sources said. Details of the discussions were not known, but they concerned the request by BankAmerica that Japanese banks buy $250 million in notes it plans to issue, the sources said. The notes are part of BankAmerica's plan to raise $1 billion. The company also hopes to sell $100 million worth of convertible preferred stock to Japanese financial concerns.

The Chrysler Corporation is considering building a stamping plant for its St. Louis mini-van assembly operations, the trade journal Metalworking News reported in this week's issue. The journal said the stamping plant would cost between $100 million and $150 million, and would ease the burden on Chrysler's stamping plants in Warren and Sterling Heights, Mich., and in Twinsburg, Ohio. Stamping plants press metal parts from sheets of steel. The St. Louis plant would make roofs, fenders, doors, body sides and other steel panels for the mini-vans.

1288-> Pentagon After Weinberger: Cuts and Restraints
Caspar W. Weinberger's legacy to the military, after seven years in which the Pentagon spent a total of $2 trillion, appears to be a future in which budgets will expand slowly or not at all. And the spending restraints, it appears, will mean not only fewer research projects, more gradual purchasing of weapons and constraints on routine operations, but also a modest reversal in the growth of military forces. Mr. Weinberger formally resigned as Defense Secretary today, insisting that the Federal deficit should not be lowered at the Pentagon's expense, but senior Pentagon officials who are staying on the job are predicting reductions in military forces. Congress is in the midst of negotiations aimed at reducing proposed military spending to about $289 billion, or perhaps less, this year. And senior Pentagon and Congressional officials agreed in interviews that next year's budget was likely to be cut by at least $30 billion from the Pentagon's request for $332 billion. Pentagon Controller's View ''That is not an inconsequential adjustment to the program,'' said Robert Helm, the Pentagon's controller. ''Force structure adjustments, while they would not be preferred, I don't think can be ruled out.'' As the Pentagon's senior financial officer, Mr. Helm is trying to work out a way of dealing with the potential reductions in spending that could be imposed Nov. 20 under the deficit-reducing laws unless a budget compromise is reached by Congress and the Reagan Administration. He said the Pentagon's decision to exempt military personnel from those automatic cuts did not necessarily mean manpower would not be reduced in the future. Under Mr. Weinberger, the number of people in the military did not increase dramatically, but the size of the forces grew markedly. The Navy grew by 90 ships to a total of almost 600, including an increase in the number of attack submarines to 101 from 79. The Army added two divisions and 4,000 tanks. The Air Force, though it had to scale down its plans for additional tactical fighter squadrons, received hundreds of additional, more modern aircraft, and saw the introduction of a new strategic bomber, the B-1, and a potent new nuclear missile, the MX. Weinberger Fears Erosion Today Mr. Weinberger warned against allowing budget cuts ''to wash those all away and let those be eroded because of some fears about a deficit that could be cured easily if the domestic expenditures were cut.'' He scoffed at the idea of military spending as a root cause of the Federal deficit or of the current disruption in the financial markets. ''If you have to choose between deficit reduction and too low a defense budget, I would always come down in favor of worrying much more about the nation's security than whether or not there's some bookkeeping transactions that seem to involve deficits,'' he said. Members of Congress and Pentagon officials alike expect Frank C. Carlucci, who has been named to succeed Mr. Weinberger as Secretary of Defense, to adopt a more flexible approach to the current budget problems. Tney say they expect Mr. Carlucci to tell Congress early next year that he will accept a far lower figure for military spending than is currently planned, and in next year's budget hearings they expect him to assist Congress in deciding which programs to reduce. This week members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees are meeting to resolve differences between spending bills passed earlier this year. Preliminary reports suggest that major purchases of weapons are being most severely cut. The cuts are falling especially hard on new programs like the Army's LHX light helicopter and the Navy's new Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Quality of Personnel Cited Congressional committees are seeking to avoid cutting deeply into funds for operation and maintenance of military forces and funds for the pay and benefits for military personnel. Mr. Weinberger said today that his main achievement in office was to improve conditions for military personnel, and most military experts agreed that there had been improvements. ''Today, as a result of Mr. Weinberger's efforts, the quality of the officers and noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel, is probably higher than it has been in the history of the military,'' said Gen. Edward C. Myers of the Army, retired, who, as Chief of Staff in the early 1980's had called his organization a ''hollow army.'' General Myers also credited the Reagan buildup with supplying new equipment to the military services. But he said that ''as the resources became less available, without clear priorities, the services suffered'' because overly ambitious requests were sent to Congress, which made cuts indiscriminately. ''As you go into a budget freeze or a budget decrease,'' General Myers said, ''the services immediately start feeding on each other like a pack of piranhas. What you need is, One, a Secretary of Defense who is willing to put his foot down and prioritize and get the most out of the resources we have; and, Two, a Secretary who is willing to work with Congress and not stonewall consistently as Cap did.'' Congress Chiefs Seek Talks The chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, and Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, are jointly drafting a letter to the office of the Defense Secretary seeking consultations on next year's budget cuts, Mr. Aspin said. He said he would urge Mr. Carlucci to ''be more forthcoming than Cap'' in seeking mutually acceptable reductions. Both Mr. Aspin and Mr. Nunn say budgets should be based on strategic policies, but the new budgets may force second thoughts about the strategies left behind by Mr. Weinberger. He is best known for his avid pursuit of a space-based defense against missiles, a sharp departure from the decades-old policies of using offensive nuclear weapons as a deterrent to nuclear war while prohibiting such defenses by treaty. Changes in Strategies Less noticed but just as striking have been changes in the strategies of the Army, Navy and Air Force over the past decade, changes that guided the development of many new weapons. The Navy adopted an aggressive maritime strategy calling for deploying ships close to the home waters of potential adversaries rather than seeking control of ocean shipping lanes. The Army and Air Force joined in formulating a new tactical doctrine calling for strikes deep in enemy territory with highly advanced weapons. The military also paid increasing attention to sporadic small-scale wars. One military expert said the current budget situation ''calls for absolutely major fundamental changes,'' adding, ''You really have to start fiddling around with the policies.'' That could be done in several ways, he said. ''It could be giving up objectives, which is not likely; by accepting higher risk, which is more likely; or by stretching programs and delaying, which is most likely.''

1289-> CITY GARDENER; A CORNER WITH NEW COLOR
IT'S not a mirage: the southwest corner of 14th Street and Union Square is really enveloped in pastel-hued perennials and pink roses. This sunny oasis lights up the edge of one of Manhattan's busiest thoroughfares, and one of its newly restored parks. The plants, with their varied leaf textures and silvery tones, are set in ''interlocking drifts, like pieces of a puzzle,'' said Tim Steinhoff, a Brooklyn landscape designer who planned several of the park's floral designs three years ago. His goal for this corner, he said, was ''ease of care and a long season of flowers that are tall enough to catch the eye of motorists as well as pedestrians.'' Now filling the triangular space, which is 70 feet in its longest dimension and 40 feet wide, are several hundred mature perennials including lavender, Achillea, Santolina, Stachys and Thalyctrum. The dazzling variety is a backdrop not only for a statue of Mohandas K. Gandhi, but for 30 Betty Prior roses, an exuberant floribunda that never seems to be without a bloom. Mr. Steinhoff used annuals, too. This year he added nicotiana and snapdragons supplied by Chris Reimals, one of the regulars among the farmers at the park's Greenmarket. Mr. Steinhoff's design was done at the request of the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit coalition of businesses and residents. According to Norman Cohen, the group's executive director, more than $35,000 was donated by the Louis and Anne Abrons Foundation and the Greenacre Foundation. The money covered the plan, plantings, fertilizers and tools - including the rented rototiller that was needed to loosen the compacted soil. Union Square's renaissance, Mr. Cohen explained, is the result of a partnership between the community and the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, which has spent $3.6 million on the project so far. A Parks Department gardener, Steven Ninemire, continues to be responsible for the daily welfare of the plantings. This kaleidoscope of living plants is a key part of the plan to reclaim Union Square Park, Mr. Cohen said. ''We hope that for those who only remember the drug dealers, the flowers are a signal that it's not what it used to be here,'' he said.

1294-> Asylum Plan Is Under Attack
A Reagan Administration proposal to have the Justice Department rather than the courts rule on applications for political asylum is being opposed by lawyers and others working with immigrants. Today is the deadline for comment on proposed regulations under which an immigration official would decide which illegal aliens are allowed to stay in the United States because of fear of torture, murder or persecution in their homeland. The Immigration and Naturalization Service says the proposal is intended to make the system more efficient. Opponents say that the asylum process is already politicized and that the proposed regulations would make it worse. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, half of all Soviet citizens and 40 percent of all Nicaraguans seeking asylum from 1983 to 1986 were successful, as against only 1 percent of applicants from Guatemala and 1.8 percent from Haiti. Amnesty International, the international human rights organization, argues that having an immigration official rule on asylum cases would be like having the police or prosecutors serve as judges in criminal cases. Once today's deadline passes, the Justice Department will review the comments. It could be months before a decision is made on whether to impose the rules, said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the immigration service. Even then, Congress could overrule the new regulations.

''What we're trying to do here is make a more efficient system,'' Mr. Austin said. ''The immigration judges clearly have calendars loaded with other matters. We would like to create a corps of officers who will focus their attention only on political asylum cases.'' The proposed regulations would sharply limit the information that the new ''asylum officer'' could consider. A ''country report'' supplied by the State Department would be the principal basis for deciding. If an asylum request were denied, Mr. Austin said, immigrants could raise issues of persecution before the judicial Board of Immigration Appeals in a deportation hearing.

Today, when all National Football League teams had to get down to the regular-season limit of 45, the Giants took 12 players off the roster. They kept six running backs, including Galbreath, at age 33 the oldest running back in the league. Galbreath seemed about to be cut because George Adams apparently was taking over his job as a third-down shotgun receiver out of the backfield. But in Saturday night's preseason victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Adams tore a muscle in his left forearm on the opening kickoff. Galbreath played his familiar shotgun role, and his running and receiving helped the Giants score the touchdown that won the game, 26-20, with 13 seconds remaining. 'Substantial Loss' Last year, Williams did not miss a down. Though Williams played against the Steelers, Coach Bill Parcells said the fourth-year cornerback had recurring problems from a pinched nerve in the neck. Williams was placed on injured reserve, which meant he must miss at least the first six games. Those six games are against the Chicago Bears, the Dallas Cowboys, the Miami Dolphins, the San Francisco 49ers, the Washington Redskins and the Buffalo Bills. Parcells called Williams's unavailability ''a substantial loss.'' His absence leaves the Giants with only two full-time cornerbacks -Elvis Patterson and Mark Collins. The backup will be Herb Welch, a safety who has filled in at cornerback. Of the two rookie free-agent cornerbacks on the roster, Wayne Haddix was placed on injured reserve with a strained knee ligament and Perry M. Williams was waived. In all, the Giants placed four players on injured reserve. They were Perry L. Williams, Haddix, Jeff Hostetler, the third-string quarterback who has a bruised kidney, and Odessa Turner, a rookie wide receiver drafted on the fourth round who has hamstring and shoulder problems. Eight others were waived. One (Solomon Miller, a wide receiver) played for the Giants in Super Bowl XXI. Two (Curtis McGriff, a defensive end, and David Jordan, a center) were on injured reserve all last season. Two (Rod Jones, a tight end, and Chuck Faucette, an inside linebacker) were draft choices this year. Three (Perry M. Williams; Jim Crocicchia, a quarterback, and Ron Hadley, an inside linebacker) were rookie free agents. Six New Players The roster shuffling means that this year's Giants have six new players - three draft choices (Mark Ingram, Stephen Baker and Doug Riesenberg) and three who finished last season on injured reserve (Terry Kinard, George Adams and John Washington). The six players they replace are Bobby Johnson and Jerome Sally (traded), Miller (waived), Karl Nelson and Perry L. Williams (injured reserve) and Gary Reasons (unsigned). The 45 players on the roster now are not necessarily the 45 who will open the season next Monday night against the Bears in Chicago. Players may be added and subtracted this week. Parcells said nothing was imminent. Galbreath said he had no doubt that he belonged on the team, and though he seemed happy to be on it he spoke almost grimly. ''I'm not scared to be waived,'' he said, ''but I like it here. I wish they had a little more faith in me. I had the idea that I was not going to stay. Nobody said nothing. ''Today, you come in to the locker room and you see some guys leaving. They had been working hard. That's a lot of hopes and a lot of dreams to fall down. I'm sure it would have been the same for me if I had been in their shoes. ''I'm sorry I was in this position. They look at numbers and ages. If George Adams didn't get hurt, I definitely would be gone. Now I have to get back in the game and hope I don't have to go through this again this year.'' As far as Galbreath is concerned, he is the best Giant at what he does. ''I don't think anyone had beaten me for my job,'' he said. ''I'd be willing to let it go if someone had taken it from me, but no one did. I'm hurt, but I've got to get over that hurt. ''The biggest thrill for me was that a lot of teammates were on my side. I thank God for having players like that. A lot of people worry just about themselves.'' Giants' Roster Offense Wide receivers Stacy Robinson, Lionel Manuel, Phil McConkey, Mark Ingram, Stephen Baker. Linemen Brad Benson, William Roberts, Doug Riesenberg, Billy Ard, Chris Godfrey, Damian Johnson, Bart Oates, Brian Johnston. Tight ends Mark Bavaro, Zeke Mowatt.

1296-> Changes Not on N.F.L. Owners' Agenda
The owners of the 28 National Football League teams are not expected to enact any changes in the playoff system or the tiebreaker procedures when they meet here for a day, or possibly two, starting Tuesday. In fact, the issue of altering the season to offset the loss of one weekend of games and the use of replacement players for three others during the recent 24-day strike by players is not even on the agenda. ''I doubt that the subject will come up,'' a league spokesman, Joe Browne, said from New York. ''At least it won't from the commissioner's office. That's not to say one of the clubs won't bring it up. But I doubt it.'' In the wake of the strike, several ideas have been floated about, all designed to minimize the contribution of the so-called replacement teams and place a heavier emphasis on games played by the regulars, who walked out after the second week of the season and returned Sunday. The suggestions have included increasing the number of teams in the playoffs and splitting the season, with champions of each half advancing into the Super Bowl tournament. But opponents of such ideas argue that reducing the significance of the interim games would be tantamount to admitting they were little more than exhibitions, staged merely to keep pressure on the union during the strike. Assessing the Strike Despite the unlikelihood of change, most reports at the owners' first meeting in five months are expected to focus on the strike and its effect on the league. Jack Donlan, executive director of the Management Council, is scheduled to review his negotiations with the union, what little they achieved and the suit filed by the union the day the strike ended, charging the league with various antitrust violations. In the action, filed in a Federal District Court in Minneapolis, the union has asked that the N.F.L.'s system of player movement - first-refusal rights, compensation, the college draft and the individual player contracts - be declared illegal and the union be awarded treble damages as compensation. In negotiations, the union had been attempting to replace the existing system with a form of unrestricted free agency. Despite the ominous possibilities of the lawsuit for the owners and the limited progress of negotiations, one member of the Management Council's executive committee, Dan Rooney, said he doubted a majority of the owners would favor the league softening its bargaining position. ''I wouldn't expect there to be much change,'' said Rooney, the president of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He added that under no circumstances would the owners be willing to entertain the idea of unrestricted free agency. Tiebreaking Status Quo The competition committee, which had been asked during the strike to develop a formula for tiebreaking procedures in a 15-game season, is expected to recommend that the usual 16-game criteria be applied, inasmuch as ties in division and conference records are based on percentage, not the actual victories and defeats. However, the committee is expected to recommend that starting with games Nov. 8, through the end of the regular season, teams should be allowed to carry a maximum of five players on an inactive list, creating a pool of 50 from which 45 would be active for any game. Last week, teams were allowed to select their 45 from a pool of 85. This week, they are allowed a pool of 55. The owners will also learn from the broadcasting committee how much the strike may cost the owners in television revenues. So far, according to Browne, the league has reimbursed the three major networks - ABC-TV, CBS-TV and NBC-TV - a total of $15 million, with more to come. Browne said that the league and the networks had not yet agreed upon the final amount of reimbursements. ''We're still waiting to see what they ask for,'' he said. The league is currently in the first year of a three-year contract with the networks worth an overall $1.2 billion to the league or about $14.3 million per club per year.

1298-> BRONX WOMAN SHOOTS AT JUDGE
A Bronx woman, in a frenzy to recover less than $200 tied up in an estate, entered a Bronx judge's offices yesterday, told him, ''We're going to settle this here and now,'' and fired two shots at him. The gun misfired, however, and the judge was not hurt. The woman then ran into the judge's private office and hit one of his aides on the head with the pistol before surrendering to court officers. ''Thank God I'm alive,'' said the judge, Abraham D. Levy, who is 82 years old and is the Public Administrator for the Bronx. ''She was so full of fight and belligerence.'' ''I was terrified,'' said a secretary in the judge's office, Barbara Bader. ''I've never been in the middle of all this before.'' Money Tied Up in Estate The woman, Louise Byron, 42 years old, of 3396 Third Avenue between 166th and 167th Streets in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, was charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and possession of drugs. The police said she was carrying 131 vials of crack, pills and an unknown sum of money. Judge Levy said Ms. Byron first arrived at his office at 10:30 A.M. and demanded two welfare checks of $94 each tied up in the estate of her landlord so she could fix leaky faucets and make other repairs in her apartment. But the judge, a retired State Supreme Court justice, said the estate would not be settled until later in the summer because relatives of the landlord, Simeon Simmons, who died in January, live outside the United States. ''She got belligerent and started shouting'' said Judge Levy, who called security officers. When they arrived, they found Ms. Byron had left. Took Pistol From Handbag When she returned less than an hour later, Judge Levy said he stepped up to the counter that separates a public anteroom from his inner offices to assist her. Ms. Byron then took a .32-caliber automatic pistol from her handbag and fired from less than two feet away. One bullet flew over his head, he said, and another rolled under a nearby table. The police said the gun had misfired. According to Capt. Anthony Vastola, Commander of the 44th Precinct, there ''could have been as many as four clicks of the weapon.'' Ms. Byron then turned and ran through a side security door - open yesterday while electricians wired the offices for computers - where three of Judge Levy's associates were sitting. Unused Metal Detector While they tried to calm Ms. Byron, she hit Michael Lippman, an attorney assisting the judge, on the head with the pistol, said Harry Amer, an associate counsel to the Judge. However, when security guards arrived and pointed guns at her from the public anteroom, she voluntarily left Judge Levy's office, leaving her gun on a desk. According to a police department spokesman, Officer James Coleman, a preliminary check by the police showed that Ms. Byron was convicted in 1973 of petty larceny. While the Bronx County Courthouse at 851 Grand Concourse at 161st Street has a metal detector, it is not ordinarily used because of a lack of manpower, court authorities said. Yesterday afternoon, while television crews and reporters went in and out of Judge Levy's office, the judge himself tried to settle back down to work. ''It's all in a day's work,'' Judge Levy said as he shuffled papers on his desk. ''It's a very interesting job.''

1300-> BIAGGI'S LAWYER MAY BE REMOVED BY JUDGE
A Federal judge in Brooklyn told a defense attorney in the upcoming bribery trial of Representative Mario Biaggi that he might be removed from the case and called as a witness because of a public statement the lawyer made about Mr. Biaggi. The warning came after a prosecutor argued at a pretrial hearing that the attorney, Barry I. Slotnick, had engaged in a public relations campaign. Mr. Slotnick's statement was a fabrication and should be used to help prove that Mr. Biaggi, a Bronx Democrat, knew he was guilty of wrongdoing, said the prosecutor, Edward A. McDonald, the head of the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force. In an interview with WNBC-TV in January, two months before Mr. Biaggi and Meade Esposito of Brooklyn were indicted, Mr. Slotnick said that Mr. Biaggi, and not Mr. Esposito, had paid for a vacation trip in December 1985. The indictment charges that Mr. Biaggi, a 10-term Bronx Democrat, accepted paid Florida vacation trips in December 1984 and December 1985 in return for helping a client of Mr. Esposito's insurance company. Slotnick's Statement ''Was that payment an accident?'' Mr. Slotnick was asked in the television interview. ''Absolutely not,'' he responded. ''The payment was purposely done because of the fact that he knew what his obligations were as a Congressman.'' Yesterday, Judge Jack B. Weinstein told Mr. Slotnick that by making a statement as a ''public relations specialist'' rather than as an attorney, he would ''cause grevious harm'' to himself and his client. ''You understand that whatever he said to you and you to him does not come under the client-attorney privilege,'' Judge Weinstein said. Mr. Slotnik then said he was acting as a lawyer who was concerned and ''frustrated'' about anonymous and damaging leaks to the press from the Government concerning his client. ''No attorney acts that way,'' Judge Weinstein replied. Calling Mr. Slotnik a fine lawyer, Judge Weinstein told him that nevertheless he might be called as a witness, be removed from the case and the statement admitted as evidence. Denying an observation by Mr. Slotnick that he was being punished, Judge Weinstein said if he was trying to do that ''I'd know how to do it. I'd bring charges against you or have you disciplined.'' Judge Weinstein, before scheduling a hearing July 16 to listen to more arguments, said he would consider a move by Mr. Esposito's attorney, Edward Brodsky, to sever his trial from Mr. Biaggi's if Mr. Slotnick is removed. The judge added that if Mr. Biaggi is forced to seek a new lawyer, the trial is unlikely to begin as planned in August. Judge Weinstein is to rule today on motions to exclude the press from arguments on whether certain Government wiretaps will be allowed as evidence.

1301-> BASEBALL; Youmans's 1-Hitter Defeats Astros, 1-0
Floyd Youmans held the Houston Astros hitless until Kevin Bass's leadoff single in the eighth inning and finished with his second career one-hitter tonight as the Montreal Expos won, 1-0. Youmans (6-3) retired the first 15 batters and won his fifth straight decision. Bass broke up Youmans's no-hit bid when he pulled his first pitch off the top of the right-field wall, a ball hit so hard that Bass was held to a single. Youmans, who pitched a one-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 8, 1986, struck out three and walked two in outdueling Nolan Ryan. Ryan (4-10) lost his fifth straight decision despite allowing just four hits in seven innings. Cardinals 6, Dodgers 3 Cardinals 8, Dodgers 7 ST. LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis swept a doubleheader from Los Angeles for a second consecutive night as Terry Pendleton drove in the winning run in the 10th. The Cardinals, who have won seven straight, lead the National League East by nine games. Jack Clark hit a three-run homer and Willie McGee followed with a homer in the fifth inning of the opener against Fernando Valenzuela (7-7). Orel Hershiser (10-8) made a rare relief appearance in the second game. He faced five men in the 10th: Jose Oquendo singled, Tony Pena popped out, Ozzie Smith singled, Vince Coleman walked and Pendleton singled under the glove of the first baseman, Mickey Hatcher to score Oquendo. Cubs 12, Padres 8 CHICAGO (AP) - Jim Sundberg, a pinch-hitter, hit a grand slam in the eighth to highlight an eight-run rally that gave the Cubs a sweep of the three-game series. Sundberg then hit the homer, his fourth of the season, off Lance McCullers (4-6). There were no incidents stemming from Tuesday's beaning of Andre Dawson, the Cubs' outfielder, which resulted in the ejection of seven Cubs. Phillies 7, Reds 2 CINCINNATI (AP) - Glenn Wilson hit a two-run homer and Von Hayes had three hits to lead the Phillies to a three-game sweep. Philadelphia scored 26 runs on 43 hits with 6 homers in the series. Eric Davis hit his 26th homer of the season and eighth against the Phillies. Giants 8, Pirates 4 PITTSBURGH (AP) - Bob Melvin, who had only two hits in his previous 41 times at bat, broke a 14th-inning tie with a run-scoring single, and Chili Davis followed with a three-run homer. Jeff Robinson (6-6) pitched four and a third scoreless innings of one-hit relief. Including Monday's twilight-night doubleheader and the Pirates' 12-inning victory Tuesday, the two teams played 44 innings in three nights. Tigers 9, Athletics 5 OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Darrell Evans hit two home runs to lead the Tigers. Jeff Robinson (6-4), who allowed seven hits in seven and two-thirds innings, struck out six, including Reggie Jackson three times. Mark Thurmond pitched one and one-third innings for his fifth save. Mark McGwire, who leads the major leagues in home runs, hit his 31st. Orioles 6, White Sox 5 BALTIMORE (AP) - Eddie Murray hit his 18th homer with two outs in the 10th inning to pace the Orioles. Murray connected on a 3-0 pitch from Jim Winn (4-5) as the Orioles won for the seventh time in 38 games. Blue Jays 5, Rangers 2 TORONTO (AP) - Jeff Russell, a relief pitcher, walked in the tying run on four pitches to the first batter he faced, and Tony Fernandez drove in the go-ahead run with a groundout in the seventh inning as the Blue Jays completed a sweep of the three-game series.

1304-> An Imposter, Unmasked, Stands Tall
THERE is a Mount Everest of the mind. A rugged monolith with snow-covered slopes, its ridges climb steeply to a single sharp peak towering over the surrounding range of Himalayan mountains. That Everest is sometimes not the real Everest but actually a nearby summit known as Makalu. The two mountains are often confused, as happened in the Oct. 20 issue of Science Times. A picture accompanying an article on Mount Everest and labeled years ago as Mount Everest was in fact Makalu. Mountaineers who spotted the mistake said that for years pictures of Makalu labeled as Everest have been published in newspapers and magazines. Bradford Washburn, retired director of the Boston Museum of Science and a specialist in mapping mountains, said, ''I suppose, as you look at Makalu, it's a very satisfying thing to be called the highest peak on earth.'' From most angles the profile of Makalu suggests a greater vertical sharpness, especially toward the apex, than Everest - not that Everest isn't steep. Makalu is the world's fifth highest mountain, rising 27,790 feet from the Nepal-China border and 12 miles southeast of Everest. Kanchenjunga on the Nepal-Sikkim border, at 28,208 feet, and Lhotse on the Nepal-China border, at 27,890 feet, are the third and fourth highest mountains. New measurements by an Italian expedition have confirmed that Everest is the tops, at 29,108 feet above sea level, which is 840 feet higher than its closest rival, K-2, in an area of the Himalayas controlled by Pakistan.

Pepsico Inc. said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 25.2 percent, to $189.9 million, or 72 cents a share, from $151.7 million, or 58 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., said sales rose 26.7 percent, to $2.94 billion, from $2.32 billion. Soft-drink earnings rose 16 percent on a 9 percent sales increase, reflecting improved foreign operating margins and higher domestic profits. Snack food earnings were up 23 percent on a 7 percent rise in sales as profit margins improved and volume rose sharply at the Frito-Lay unit. Restaurant earnings jumped 73 percent as sales climbed 82 percent, mainly because the latest results include Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was acquired in October 1986. Pepsico also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants. Excluding Kentucky Fried Chicken, restaurant earnings were up 23 percent on a 19 percent sales gain.

1307-> COMPANY NEWS; G.E. EARNINGS ROSE 15.9% IN 2D QUARTER
The General Electric Company announced yesterday that earnings in the second quarter rose 15.9 percent on a 22.7 percent rise in revenues. G.E., a manufacturer of diversified high-technology, electrical and related products based in Fairfield Conn., said that net income in the latest three months rose to $720 million, or 79 cents a share, from $621 million, or 68 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Per-share earnings were adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split earlier this year. Revenues rose to $9.56 billion from $7.79 billion. Strong Revenue Growth Cited John F. Welch Jr., chairman of G.E., said that the company benefited from strong revenue growth, particularly in its financial services, aircraft engine, plastics and medical services operations. ''Throughout the company, we are realizing the positive effects of streamlining, reducing cost structure, and emphasizing product and service quality,'' Mr. Welch said. G.E.'s 1986 second quarter included the results of the RCA Corporation for June only. RCA was acquired June 9, 1986. In breaking down the results for the latest period, G.E. said that financial services earnings were substantially ahead of the second quarter of 1986, with much higher earnings from the G.E. Credit Corporation and the Employers Reinsurance Corporation; materials businesses had substantially higher operating profit on good revenue increases led by plastics, and major appliances had a much higher operating profit on very strong revenue increases in all product lines. Medical Systems Strong In other areas, G.E. said the technical products operating profit and revenues were buoyed by a strong medical systems performance; aerospace profits were well ahead of a year ago on much higher revenues, with the 1987 results reflecting the impact of a full quarter of RCA's aerospace and defense businesses, and consumer products had good revenue and operating profit increases, principally from the inclusion of RCA's consumer electronics business. Aircraft engine revenues and operating profit were strong; power systems revenues and operating profit were about even with a year ago; industrial revenues were down slightly, and overall profitability of the industrial sector was down considerably.

1310-> Sound: Plus Ca Change. . .
PEOPLE CONVINCED that there can't be too much of a good thing prefer their music nonstop, and technology has caught up with them at last. It isn't just that the playing time of records has increased steadily over the years, growing from 4 1/2 minutes a side in the days of 78-rpm disks to about 30 minutes in the LP era and reaching an uninterrupted 70 minutes or thereabouts on CD's. These days, a whole order of magnitude has been added with the appearance of CD changers. They play up to 10 CD's in a row, delivering a musical marathon of more than 11 1/2 hours' duration. Granted, that may be a bit much at a single sitting. Even in ''Gotterdammerung'' - the most rigorous endurance test in the standard repertory -Richard Wagner assumed a musical attention span merely half as long. Yet with a determined stretch of the imagination, it is possible to think of some uses for these formidable music machines. Let's say, for the sake of argument, you want to listen to a whole opera without intermission. In that case, a CD changer lets you segue from one act to the next without having to slip another disk into the player. Or you can plan a daylong program in advance and let it unfold without having to pay any attention to the gadgetry. Should you change your mind in midstream about what you want to hear next, there's always the remote control. With a single touch, you can alter the musical proceedings or put a stop to them altogether if you've had enough. Record changers, per se, are venerable devices with a long history. Back in the 78-rpm days, they kept listeners from having to jump up at frequent intervals in the middle of the music to flip the record. But they were erratic contraptions that occasionally chewed up records, and after the advent of long-playing records, they gradually fell from favor. By about 1960, they had become nearly extinct among discerning audiophiles. In their present comeback, changers have been cured of their bad habits. They no longer nibble the records to death. As in other CD players, nothing but weightless laser light ever touches the playing surface of the disks, assuring their unblemished longevity. And while changing from one disk to another still involves a bit of automated pushing and shoving of the disks, the mechanism has been gentled by computer control to perform these tasks more gingerly and without risk to the records. The changing of the disks is done by one of two methods. In most changers, the disks are loaded into a magazine, rather like ammunition in automatic weapons. Depending on the particular model, the magazine holds anywhere from 5 to 10 CD's that can be programmed in any desired order. It is possible to skip about not merely between different disks or different tracks on the same disk, but also between different selections on different records. Whenever the preselected program calls for a particular track, the appropriate disk glides to the turntable and is spun in front of a laser in the usual way. The other type of changer mechanism uses a kind of carousel that transports any of several CD's to the laser turntable in the chosen sequence. This type generally holds fewer disks, as is the case with Sony's CDP-C5F ($450), which holds only five records but takes only two to three seconds to change from one to the other. The current maximum storage capacity is reached by Sanyo's CPM-1000 ($480), which boasts two separate disk-holding devices. One is a magazine holding 10 CD's for playing in any sequence, while the other is a single-disk drawer that functions like an ordinary CD player. It is handy if you want to play just one disk at a time and slip it in quickly without taking the trouble to load it into the magazine. The same approach of combining a multidisk storage bay with a single-disk player has been taken in Pioneer's PD-M90X ($800), whose magazine holds six records. It is possible to program up to 32 different tracks on these six disks in any order or to play them one after the other with their original track sequence. What's more, up to eight different program sequences may be stored in advance; and if you push the repeat button, any of them will be continuously reiterated. Up to eight different magazines of six disks each may be inserted, one at a time, with a preselected program for each held in the memory. Most of these changers also permit a kind of programming known as shuffle play. In this mode, the built-in computer creates a constantly changing helter-skelter sequence of different tracks from different disks. The idea seems to be that if you don't know what you'd like to hear, maybe the machine does. Basically similar models of this kind are now available from such companies as Sharp, Technics, Hitachi, Onkyo, Mitsubishi and JVC. Each is capable of delivering faithfully reproduced music in massive overdose.

The movie ''Star Wars'' was a smash hit, and now some imitators in military circles are hoping that some of the success will rub off on their production, which is entitled somewhat less snappily, ''S.D.I.: A Prospect for Peace.'' The 30-minute work is a documentary about the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, which is known familiarly as ''Star Wars.'' That old movie hand President Reagan saw a sneak preview of the new production at Camp David last week and was said to be ''very enthusiastic.'' The $250,000 film, financed and produced by the American Defense Preparedness Association, a private group based in Washington, was made by Smith & Harroff Inc. It includes interviews with 25 proponents and opponents of the program, including Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and Senator Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana, on the pro side and Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, and John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists on the con side. A showing is planned next Monday for Congressional leaders, White House aides, foreign ambassadors and journalists at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel. Later a local television station has agreed to show the film. Watch out, Hollywood!

1312-> MONTREUIL JOURNAL; LET THEM EAT GLASTNOST, FRENCH COMMUNISTS SAY
In this crumbling bastion of the French Communist Party, where Marx's prophecies are being confounded, the only real hope for Communist comrades is a movement of renewal begun by Mikhail S. Gorbachev in distant Moscow. Once the dominant force on the French left, the Communist Party today hopes that it will not soon shrink into an insignificant political sect. A party that has been handicapped over the years by obedient responses to Moscow's wishes now lavishes praise on innovations in the Soviet Union that it has never undertaken itself. The collapse of the Communist Party, the biggest party in France at the end of World War II, has reshaped national politics as the country heads into a highly fluid campaign for the presidency. It has permitted President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists to position themselves near the center and made their erstwhile Communist allies their fiercest foes. ''We made a mistake,'' said Andre Lajoinie, the party's vigorous presidential candidate, recalling the Communists' alliance with the Socialists that brought his party into government from 1981 to 1984. ''We favored accords at the summit that masked the differences between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.'' A 'Cruel Experience' ''It was a hard and even cruel experience,'' continued Mr. Lajoinie, a fast-talking, folksy politician whose twang evokes his rural origins in southern Correze. ''And the first reaction was one of withdrawal and despair. Some quit. Some abstained.'' In an interview, Mr. Lajoinie sought to impose the message that these dark days of despair were now over. But here in Montreuil, a 40-minute subway ride from the Communist Party's modernistic Paris headquarters where he spoke, it was not hard to discover why the organization remains on the defensive. A fifth of Montreuil's 100,000 residents are foreigners, most of them from the impoverished Saharan nation of Mali, and they live in barrackslike slums. In Marxist terms, they are clearly members of the proletariat, but in parliamentary terms they do not vote and, as elsewhere in France, their presence has provoked resentment and fear. Two years ago, Jean-Pierre Brard, the city's Communist Mayor, joined other citizens in occupying a construction site and preventing the Ministry of Social Affairs from erecting another immigrants' residence. ''The racists,'' the 39-year-old Mayor insisted, ''are those who build and perpetuate these ghettoes and make life impossible for others.'' Housing Plan Feared With 16 percent of the city's work force jobless, Mayor Brard says he fears that other plans being hatched in Paris will further erode the Communists' blue-collar base - notably schemes for the construction of middle-class housing that would accelerate the evolution of Montreuil into a bedroom suburb of the capital. In the meantime, Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front is making electoral inroads into the Communist following here, blaming the immigrants for rising crime and unemployment. In parliamentary elections last year, the National Front scored an impressive 15 percent of the popular vote in ''red'' Montreuil while the Communists tumbled to 22 percent. ''It is likely that in the next municipal elections Montreuil will fall to the right, and it will be thanks to the National Front,'' predicted Jean-Michel Dubois, who heads the National Front here. ''Psychologically, that will be the end of the Communist Party.'' To stave off the loss of Montreuil and other strongholds in the fading ''red belt'' around Paris, Mr. Lajoinie denounces the National Front but at the same time expresses understanding for blue-collar voters who he says have ''suffered brutally'' from the twin shocks of unemployment and immigrants in their neighborhoods. Georges Marchais, head of the Communists in France and the party's standard bearer in previous Presidential elections, decided not to run last year after the party's vote base continued to slide. National Share of Vote at 9.7% The Communist Party, in fact, has watched its share of the national vote fall from 20 percent less than a decade ago to a humbling 9.7 percent in last year's parliamentary balloting. Pollsters say that Mr. Lajoinie will do well to match that score, but, in addition to Mr. Le Pen on the right, the Communist standard-bearer faces a fellow leftist, Pierre Juquin. A tiny man with an almost priestly manner, Mr. Juquin was expelled last month from the Communist Party after announcing his independent candidacy. He has gathered a loose coalition of like-minded Communist dissidents, Trotsykites and left-wing student leaders and could drain off the votes of Communist-oriented intellectuals, teachers and students. In an interview, Mr. Juquin praised Mr. Gorbachev, ''If five years ago someone in the French Communist Party had said what Gorbachev is saying he would have been expelled. Even now there is renovation in Moscow - and regression in Paris.'' Gorbachev Course Embraced The Gorbachev phenomenon at first startled the French Communists, who in the late 1970's flirted with the audacious notions of ''Eurocommunism'' - primarily the idea that Communist Parties could develop outside Moscow's orbit - before abandoning them as excessively anti-Soviet. But now the Communists have warmly embraced Mr. Gorbachev's course, hoping that it will reverse an anti-Communist mood. Analyzing his party's poor electoral showing, Mr. Lajoinie cited ''the campaign against the Communists on the subject of human rights'' as one of the principal causes, acknowledging diplomatically that ''the attitude and situation in the Communist countries lent a flame to this campaign.'' ''But now,'' he said brightly, ''as Victor Hugo said, 'Hope is changing camps.' '' Others disagree. Philippe Robrieux, a historian and former Communist, said the party was turning into ''a religious sect'' and predicted that the next round of municipal elections would strip the party of many of its remaining bastions like Montreuil. ''If you have Le Pen on one side taking away the working class vote and Juquin on the other taking away the intellectuals, what do you have?'' asked Mr. Robrieux rhetorically. ''Five percent of the electorate.'' In Montreuil, Mayor Brard was worried. ''You know, the idea of a bastion is very dangerous, because you can fall asleep in it. And you should always sleep with one eye open.''

1315-> Guarantees At Newmont
The Newmont Mining Corporation, the latest target of the investor T. Boone Pickens, disclosed today that its board had recently approved employment contracts for 25 executives in an apparent move to discourage a takeover. Ivanhoe Partners, a group led by Mr. Pickens and his Mesa Limited Partnership, recently acquired 9.95 percent of Newmont Mining's shares and has said it might seek control of the company. James Hill, a spokesman for Newmont in New York, said the employment contracts were not ''golden parachutes,'' the severance guarantees that come into play after a company is taken over. But one analyst who asked not to be named said: ''This is a pre-emptive trigger. ''I would think that technically it's not a golden parachute, but it does appear that if someone were to acquire it, these would be in place anyway.''

1320-> Air Travel Needs Peak-Hour Premium Rates; Try Satellite Radar
To the Editor: Your Sept. 4 story on air traffic control of over-ocean flights (front page) states that no radar monitoring is available, ''because of the limited 200-mile-plus range of conventional radar.'' Two hundred miles is simply the distance from a plane 5 miles over the ocean to a point on the horizon. Since the radar beam cannot bend over the horizon, only planes within 200 miles can be sighted. However, this conventional radar, which performs under line-of-sight constraints, does not have difficulty reaching communications satellites 22,000 miles above the earth's surface. Satellite-based radar could easily provide air traffic controllers with a full report on over-ocean flights. At a time when fantastic schemes to monitor thousands of airborne missiles are being seriously discussed, why don't we invest in proved technology to insure safety of transoceanic flights? EDWARD A.

1321-> 2 CHINESE DEPART IN ESPIONAGE CASE
Two Chinese diplomats left the United States last week after they were detained on suspicion of espionage, Reagan Administration officials said today. The officials said one of the diplomats was taken into custody on Dec. 21 in a restaurant in Washington's Chinatown after accepting what he believed were classified National Security Agency documents. Apprehension of the diplomats came after a nearly yearlong inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation involving the use of a double agent, officials said. 'Incompatible' Activities The State Department, which announced the diplomats' departure, said the two men had engaged in ''activities incompatible with their diplomatic status,'' a phrase used in the past for espionage. The Chinese Embassy in Washington would not discuss the espionage accusations, which were first detailed today in The Washington Times. A spokesman for the embassy identified the diplomats as Hou Desheng, an assistant military attache, and Zhang Weichu, a consul at the Chinese Consulate General in Chicago, and said they left for China ''after finishing their tenures in the United States.'' Apprehension of the Chinese diplomats came only days after the United States expelled a Soviet diplomat assigned to the United Nations, charging he was a spy. Concern About Publicity The State Department provided few details today about the Chinese case, apparently fearing that publicity might prompt retaliation against American diplomats serving in China. It appeared that the department was also concerned about new strains in Chinese-American relations, which were harmed in recent months by a series of disputes, including American protests over reports that China continued to sell Silkworm antiship missiles to Iran. Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said at a news conference that on Dec. 22 the United States asked the Chinese Embassy to order the two diplomats to leave the country. The Chinese, she said, agreed immediately. Asked to characterize relations between the two countries as a result of the incident, Mrs. Oakley replied: ''The same as they were. There is no change in the relationship.'' ''I'm not going to speculate on any possible retaliation by the Government of China,'' she said. ''I would add, however, that there would be no justification for retaliation.'' 'The Highest Sensitivity' Another Administration official with knowledge of the case said it was being treated with ''the highest sensitivity,'' and stressed that the United States had not formally expelled the diplomats. ''We asked them to leave, and they left, and we hope that's that,'' he said. Administration officials said the two diplomats had tried to obtain secret N.S.A. documents from someone they believed to be a traitorous American. The American was instead working with the F.B.I., the officials said, refusing to describe the double agent further. On Dec. 21, one official said, supposedly secret documents were passed to one of the two diplomats at a Chinese restaurant not far from F.B.I. headquarters in downtown Washington. After the diplomat accepted the documents, the official said, undercover F.B.I. agents took him into custody. The diplomat was not arrested or charged with any crime because of the protections of diplomatic immunity. It was unclear when or where the other diplomat was apprehended. American officials said it was the first time the United States had requested the departure of a Chinese diplomat since relations between the two countries were normalized nine years ago.

1323-> FITNESS; Back From an Injury: Joy Amid Wariness
FOR the serious recreational athlete, one of life's little pleasures is the first day back after a frustrating period of idleness caused by an injury. As you awake at dawn with the first morning light creeping in the window, there is a feeling that perhaps today the leg injury - the runner's classic shinsplint -might be healed. The pain has been a steady ache, suggesting that the muscles around the shin, or perhaps the membrane that surrounds the shin, have become inflamed. If the pain had been sharper and more acute, it might have signaled a stress fracture. Rising, there is a by now familiar routine of testing the leg, anxiously awaiting the first stab of pain, warning that it is too soon. When the pain doesn't appear, the mind quickens with anticipation. The warmup of light calisthenics and stretching is cautious. Now is when the pain could come surging back. Ice and bandages can sometimes help relieve the worst of the pain. In some cases, doctors advise elevation of the leg. Sometimes analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed. But the most common treatment is to stop running and to resist the temptation to resume until the pain is past. If the shinsplint is a muscle problem, a week or two is often sufficient. A stress fracture could require several months of rest. The most important advice that sports medicine doctors stress is to never try to ''work through'' such pain. They advise that the return to running should be gradual and careful once the pain is gone. You must make a pact with yourself and vow to be tough about adhering to it: run slowly and carefully and no more than a mile. Stop completely at the first return of the pain and walk home. No exceptions. Outside, the glow of dawn is stronger, but the street lights are still on. It is not as cold as it looked from the window, but the air is sharp and the wind cuts through the layers of clothes. Broken low clouds are overhead. The first day of winter is near, and were there more moisture in the air and the temperature a few degrees colder, there might be snow flurries. Except for two or three other runners and a few people walking their dogs, the streets are deserted. The dawn and a healing body have brought the perfect morning for a late autumn run. The first steps are hesitant, anticipating the pain. When it doesn't appear, there is a wave of elation, followed by another internal lecture about caution and adhering to the pact. One block passes. Two blocks. Still no pain. Now elation gives way to dismay. How quickly the body loses its conditioning. A few more blocks and the labored breathing is further testimony to lost conditioning. The road back to the old level of fitness, even after only two weeks, is longer than one previously realized. Meanwhile, the pain has not reappeared, and the familiar thrill of a good run is returning. It is the same pleasure that draws cross-country skiers into the woods or serious swimmers into the pool. And it is the same feeling that sends cyclists out on the 50-mile ride or aerobic dancers into the studio for another hourlong workout. When serious recreational athletes are pressed to define the internal force that pulls them again and again to their activities, they invariably turn to the words of addiction - ''fix'' or ''high.'' Exercise is known to increase the levels of a group of brain chemicals known as endorphins. There is a widespread belief among doctors and neurobiologists that the endorphins affect the brain in the same way that a narcotic such as heroin does. Less certain, from a scientific standpoint, is whether addiction to endorphins generated by regular exercise is a real phenomenon. Addiction implies both a high and withdrawal symptoms when the brain is deprived. If research is lacking, sports doctors say they have ample empirical evidence from their practices and their own recreational experiences to suggest that endorphin addiction and withdrawal are real. Perhaps endorphin withdrawal explains, in part, the longing that grips the sidelined recreational athlete. But the human is such a complex organism that there must be other explanations, too. For some, wanting to hold back the clock is a driving force. For others, the fear of gaining weight or other body image concerns drive them. Whatever the explanation, the satisfaction of being active again at the end of a period of injury grows deeper as the workout nears its conclusion. The runner's path leads through the park, up the hill past the war memorial and then twice along the path around the pond. There are more joggers now, and three elderly women appear to begin their brisk dawn walk around the pond. The run ends at the corner deli. With a hot cup of coffee in a Styrofoam cup and a newspaper under the arm, the one-block walk home is another part of the ritual to be savored. The pain of the shinsplint has not reappeared. A few more days of light workouts and the injury should be a thing of the past.

1324-> Ailing Woman From Yonkers Gives $100 to Neediest Cases
Elsie M. Garten of Yonkers lives on a modest fixed income and is recovering from two recent hospitalizations that ''have taxed her valiant spirit,'' according to her sister. Nevertheless, Miss Garten, who has contributed to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund for more than 30 years, is continuing the tradition. She sent a gift of $100. ''Elsie is thankful that she is blessed with loving, care-giving family and friends,'' her sister, who wished to be identified only as M. K. G., wrote. ''She hopes her gift will help someone in need of loving concern and caring.'' Dealing With Hard Times For some donors, facing difficult times makes them even more conscious of those who are less fortunate. ''This year I wanted to give an amount that would make me have to sacrifice going out to restaurants or a few movies,'' wrote Lewis Creech of Manhattan, who contributed $200, rather than his usual $25. ''To go without a few luxuries is nothing compared to people who go without necessities every day.'' Mr. Creech explained that he knows what it means to go without something, ''especially this year.'' He wrote that recently he ''came out of the closet as a gay person'' and was told by his family in North Carolina not to come home for the holidays because it was a problem for some relatives. Vanessa V. McKinsey of Arlington, Tex., wrote: ''This has been a difficult year for our family; one of substantial setbacks. Yet as the year draws to a close, I realize we are so much more fortunate than many others.'' She sent a gift of $50. Helen Terzian of Forest Hills, Queens, sent $5, noting that it was ''all I can afford in my circumstances just now, but sent with good wishes for your fine endeavor.''

1326-> A GARDENER'S WORLD; Preserving the Past, Studying the Future
OF all the months in the year, especially in the colder parts of the country, January has the least horticultural interest. Except for a few heaths, which I admire greatly for their habit of blooming now to lend touches of pink and white to the winter landscape, everything in the garden has gone to sleep. But in its symbolism, January has a profound lesson to teach about gardening. It takes its name from Janus, the Roman god of portals and of beginnings and endings, who is generally depicted as having two faces. One face looks back, the other forward. Janus, although no longer worshiped, still deserves respect from gardeners, because we, too, if we're faithful to the task, must orient ourselves toward both past and future. Our obligations to the past concern preservation of its treasures by continuing to grow, on a small scale at least, the plants our ancestors knew and loved. Newer is not synonymous with better. Many gardeners have acquired a passion for the old roses of the 19th and early centuries, which A GARDENER'S WORLD remain unsurpassed for their opulence and heady fragrance. I know some gardeners who specialize entirely in such heirloom or antique plants. One friend in Virginia seeks out varieties of apples grown in Colonial times and in the early days of the Republic. He has collected the bud wood from well over 900 kinds, which he has grafted onto dwarf trees in his orchard. His backyard is a living encyclopedia of the historic apple. Another friend specializes in ornamental perennials in existence prior to 1900, which he has rescued from the gardens of abandoned farmhouses, graveyards and demolished houses. He grows the plants in his own garden and keeps track of them and their histories with a computer. His collecion is impressive, to put it mildly. The last time I checked, he had 49 dianthuses, some dating to the early 18th century, and 104 forms of ivy. Then there are the members of the Seed Savers Exchange, with headquarters in Decorah, Iowa. These amateur gardeners, who live in every part of the country, keep heirloom varieties of vegetables in existence by raising them from seed and saving the seed to pass on to others. What they do is more than a hobby: it amounts to preserving germ plasm that may be useful in future breeding projects. They contribute to genetic diversity in a world where powerful forces, such as agribusiness, work in the opposite direction. But we followers of Janus also need to look forward, to study the 1988 nursery catalogues to see what new wonders they contain. One variety that many gardeners will want to plant for many years to come is a group of achilleas hybridized in West Germany and introduced to the United States by several nurseries. I can think of no plant as rich in human associations as the achillea. Its scientific name goes back to Homer and to the legend that the centaur Chiron taught Achilles its medicinal value in cleansing the wounds of his soldiers during the Trojan War. A decoction made from its pungent leaves was in use for similar purposes on Civil War battlefields. The British herbalist John Gerard claimed in the 17th century that chewing its leaves was an infallible remedy for toothaches. European folk medicine held that a tea made from its flowers would banish depression and prevent baldness. Linnaeus recommended the leaves as a fine substitute for hops in brewing beer. The achillea has acquired a plethora of common names. The most common is yarrow, but it has also been known as bastard pellitory, calico border plant, carpenter's grass, devil's plaything, nosebleed, old man's pepper, sweet maudlin and woundwort. In America, various species of achilleas, but especially A. millefolium, have become roadside weeds. Brought from Europe by the earliest settlers, they escaped from gardens and now grow almost everywhere in the country, their ferny foliage and their clusters of off-white or pale-rose flowers lending a pleasant note to the summer landscape. As garden plants, however, the achilleas have, with one exception, been poor choices. Most of them spread and sprawl, giving an air of untidiness to the perennial border. The exception, a cultivar called Coronation Gold, is, however, genuinely splendid. It makes a sturdy clump of gray-green, deeply dissected foliage, eventually reaching three feet high and four feet across, with many long-lasting flower clusters that can be dried for winter arrangements. Coronation Gold now has lots of company. In his nursery near the West German industrial city of Kassel, Heinze Klose has developed a new set of hybrids, which combine sturdiness with glowing colors. One, called Hope, is a soft and creamy yellow. The others - Fanal, Paprika, Salmon Beauty, Weser River Sandstone - occupy the pale-pink to ruby-red portion of the spectrum. Several American nurserymen, who have in recent years paid closer and closer attention to Continental European as well as British horticulture, have seized on Mr. Klose's achievements with the plant Chiron gave Achilles three millenniums ago. The result will be a joy for those of us who look forward as well as backward with old Janus.

1327-> Ailey Dancer Living His Dream
Leonard Meek is one of the first dancers the audience sees when the curtain rises on ''The Magic of Katherine Dunham,'' the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's new salute to the noted choreographer. Tall, slender and elegant, Mr. Meek moves at the ballet barre as one who wears an inherited mantle but wears it with unassuming grace. In a sense that is what the Dunham program, which will be performed on Friday evening and on Saturday afternoon and evening, is all about, for it suggests the black American dancer is heir not only to the traditions of Afro-Caribbean folk dance but also to the arts of ballet and modern dance. Mr. Meek is conscious of that heritage and refers to himself proudly as a black dancer. But it is all much simpler for him. There is one motivating force in his life and work. ''I love to dance,'' he said in a recent conversation. ''Anything I dance is special, whether I like the ballet or not. And there are so many of us who are out there and love to dance and can't do it.'' Born in Harlem and one of seven children, Mr. Meek grew up knowing he loved dancing but not realizing it was possible to dance as a profession. His widowed mother, a nurse's aide, was not enthusiastic about her son's interest, though she has supported his decision and frequently sees him perform. And Mr. Meek himself is suprised still by ''all of this,'' as he refers to his career as a dancer. When a small modern dance company composed of students from Intermediate School 136 performed at his elementary school, Mr. Meek decided to follow the dancers. He enrolled at the school and came under the wing of Elaine C. Smith, an influential dance teacher there. ''She coaxed me to audition for Performing Arts,'' Mr. Meek said, referring to the High School of Performing Arts. 'Just Wanted to Dance' He was accepted at the school and fell similarly into his first job with a major dance company directly after graduation, when Gerry Houlihan, a teacher at the school, suggested he audition for the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company. ''Just go and try this,'' Ms. Houlihan said to the young dancer. ''I didn't want to go to college,'' Mr. Meek said. ''I just wanted to dance. So I went to the audition.'' He performed with the Lubovitch company for five years. ''Lar kind of left me on my own,'' Mr. Meek recalled. ''And that helped. He let me experiment. He left me a lot of space. That helped me to feed off other dancers. It helped me to find who I was as a dancer. And I'm still looking.'' He joined Mr. Ailey's company last year. ''I felt he was a genius,'' Mr. Meek said. ''He has something to offer black dancers. It's the major black dance company in the world. I've got a lot to learn. And there will be a lot I can pass on in the future.'' Mr. Meek also directs the Mafata Dance Company, a small modern dance troupe founded by Lorna Mafata and based in the Bronx that performs about 15 times a year in New York and at colleges around the country. ''It started just as a small workshop in the Bronx,'' Mr. Meek said. ''I'd just go up there to dance whenever I had time.'' There are 10 to 12 dancers in the company, which is multiracial. ''There are no barriers there, Mr. Meek said. ''Good dancers are good dancers.'' He has choreographed a piece, ''Echos and Shadows,'' for Mafata, but he grimaces wryly when asked if he is interested in choreographing as a career. ''I realize how hard it is and how tedious it can be,'' he said. ''If you can create a ballet and have it liked by an audience - or anyone - you've accomplished something.'' 'A Black Pioneer' He talks wonderingly of all that Miss Dunham has accomplished in her 50-year career, during which she introduced black dance and dancers in vividly theatrical revues, drawn from Afro-Caribbean dance forms, religious ceremonies and legends, to audiences throughout the world. ''I look at her as a black pioneer,'' Mr. Meek said. ''She was the first black to emerge who wasn't afraid to dig in and show black ethnic roots and let them be seen. I can identify with her. I'm black. ''It was incredible to be in the same room working with her. It's something I'd never dreamed I'd do. She was just someone I'd heard of. And here was this lady sitting in front of me offering me information I can use and pass on.'' Mr. Meek and the other Ailey dancers dance a variety of roles and styles in the revivals of her dances that are presented in ''The Magic of Katherine Dunham.'' He appears in the first act overview of the Dunham technique, then in a dance for five men in ''Nanigo'' and finally zips through a mean Charleston in the closing, Americana section. Among his other favorites are Mr. Ailey's signature ''Revelations'' and his ''Night Creature,'' an evocation of the music and moods of Duke Ellington that Mr. Meek loves for its interesting patterns and musicality, and for the sense of community he feels with the other dancers in that ballet. ''You work hard, but it's not killing,'' he said. ''And we have fun.'' He is slow to make distinctions between his lead and chorus roles. ''Whatever I get to do, I try to kill it,'' he said with a grin. ''You try to do the best you can and make everything special. That's what people remember.''

1328-> About New York; Ah, Such Tastes: A Chef's Spirit Is Triumphant
Elizabeth Terry telephoned from the late James Beard's kitchen the other day. Mr. Beard, the chef and cookbook writer, once said that if he were forced to practice cannibalism, ''I might manage if there were enough tarragon around.'' Mrs. Terry, a fine Savannah chef, said it was ''definitely intimidating'' cooking at Mr. Beard's. ''You know how it is,'' she said. ''You drive to the airport, through the Spanish moss. We had three huge Styrofoam coolers full of trout and the other food. The people at the airline were great; they wished us luck. And Fred McLeod, one of our cooks, said, 'Break a ladle.' But then all of a sudden you're here, in New York, and everybody has a purpose. It's not, well, let's sit down and have a cup of tea and think about this a while. ''We got a cab and came straight here, where we were met by Percy, James Beard's dog. Brett - the sous-chef, Brett Johnson -and I were in a state of shock. We thought, 'Oh, dear, this is absolutely the place of someone who's left.' We had to see whether the ghosts were friendly. But we're O.K. now. It smells of shrimp and sherry in here. We're cooking.'' James Beard died nearly three years ago and most of his possessions were sold at auction. Since his death, a group of his food world friends organized the James Beard Foundation, bought his brownstone on West 12th Street and set about setting up something of a nonprofit culinary classroom, headquarters and place to get a decent bite to eat. The foundation is celebrating its first anniversary this week. It has been a year of once or twice-a-month dinners prepared by the best-known chefs in America ($65 per meal for members; $85 for guests) and now for the second year they have inaugurated a series of meals cooked by ''rising stars'' (Elizabeth Terry, at the knockdown price of $50 for members; $65 for guests). Though Mrs. Terry, who runs Elizabeth on 37th in Savannah, Ga., with her husband, Michael, has had her share of national press, the way her card turned up, according to the foundation, was its network of scouts. With close to 700 members in the country, all of them trying to find the best sustenance around, word travels fast. ''If somebody sneezes in San Francisco,'' said Judith Segal, a food writer, ''four chefs in New York say gesundheit.'' ''Food people are a bunch of generous, loving, caring people,'' said Anna Teresa Callen, the foundation's program director. ''We generate a lot of enthusiasm.'' ''We are food lovers - not food snobs,'' said Ms. Segal, going on to ask where else in New York could you get a seven-course meal ''with appropriate wines lavishly poured'' for $50, including tax and tip, ''and, as a single woman, the promise that you will be seated with congenial company?'' The man she was talking to, a stranger, thought of suggesting his own modest lodgings, but let it slide. And so the sun went down and 50 or 60 congenial souls were greeted at the door by Clayton Triplette, Mr. Beard's manservant for 26 years, and Percy, the English pug. Many of these people were old friends of the departed host, and conversation ran along the lines of ''if these walls could only talk.'' In the bright stainless-steel kitchen, Mrs. Terry, assisted by a brigade from Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, was producing aromas to quit your job and move to Georgia for. Next, the guests drank champagne, Mrs. Terry took an aspirin, and the meal began. At one table, Zack Hanle, New York editor of Bon Appetit, who had had a particularly trying day (interviewing a prospective secretary, she had gotten negative answers when she asked the woman whether she liked to cook or, if not that, eat, and she had exploded, ''Where the hell do you think you are?'' and sent the candidate packing) noticed that the centerpiece flowers were ''a little sad'' and that the linens were damp. Her tablemates decided the candle was too close and had saddened the flowers, and the linen would have cost a fortune if done professionally - ''no doubt Clay Triplette just gave them a quick iron.'' All criticism pretty much ended there. Mrs. Terry was generally thought to have triumphed with her oyster stew with collard greens and red onion, warm quail salad with black-eyed peas, sea trout (caught by her husband the day before) with benne seeds and guinea squash, and Savannah cream cake. ''I feel a little far away, a little isolated in Savannah,'' she said. ''I don't get to do a lot of food talk, shop talk. This is a great honor. Everybody likes to be recognized.'' In every corner, the food talk ran on. ''And what do you do with food?'' one woman asked of another. ''I put my money in it,'' came the reply. ''My son is opening a restaurant in Newport.''

1329-> WASHINGTON TALK: CAPITAL WIT; On the Differences of Species
How to tell Democrats from Republicans? Some clues are offered in a new work, ''The Dorsey Dictionary of American Government and Politics,'' by Jay M. Shafritz, a professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Shafritz says the clues were compiled by ''an anonymous wit'' and placed in the Congressional Record by Craig Hosmer, then a Republican Congressman from California. The differences include: Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. Democrats give their worn-out clothes to those less fortunate. Republicans wear theirs. Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry Republican girls but feel they're entitled to a little fun first. Republicans employ exterminators. Democrats step on the bugs. Democrats name their children for currently popular sports figures, politicians and entertainers. Republican children are named for their parents or grandparents, depending on where the most money is. Democrats keep trying to cut down on smoking but are not successful. Neither are Republicans. Republicans tend to keep their shades drawn, although there is seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to but don't. Republicans study the financial pages of the newspapers. Democrats put them in the bottom of the bird cage. Republicans raise dahlias, Dalmatians and eyebrows. Democrats raise Airedales, kids and taxes. Democrats eat the fish they catch. Republicans hang them on the wall. Democrats make up plans and then do something else. Republicans follow the plans their grandfathers made. Republicans sleep in twin beds, some even in separate rooms. That is why there are more Democrats.

1331-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ex-Head of Lotus Forms a Company
A year after he left his post as chairman of the Lotus Development Corporation, where he helped to revolutionize the software industry, Mitchell D. Kapor says he is still nagged by the unnecessary complexity of current computers. ''Despite some striking successes, PC's are still very limited and hard to use,'' Mr. Kapor said yesterday. ''My mother still doesn't have a reason to use one. And too many people spend half an hour trying to find a file they wrote two weeks ago. It's obvious computers don't work the way people think.'' So yesterday Mr. Kapor, a figure who approaches cult status in the software world, said he was heading back to where he was in 1981: Starting a software company. His newest venture, only a diskette's throw from Lotus's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., is ON Technology Inc., an unusual sort of software house. Mr. Kapor, who is 37 years old, and his partner, Peter Miller, formerly Lotus's director of advanced technology, plan to develop what they call a new layer of software, one that runs in addition to a computer's operating system - which acts as the basic traffic cop of data. This new layer would allow all applications programs, from word processors to data base programs, to monitor what the computer user does and to create short-cuts. Mr. Kapor's program would use software technologies that have never been translated to commercial products. For example, it would create an ''agent,'' something like a computerized equivalent of a secretary or assistant, that would learn how the user stored files and make it easier to retrieve them by categories and subject matter. The similarities between the early days of Lotus and the start of ON Technology seem scarce. When PC software houses were nearly nonexistent, Lotus started on a shoestring; this time Mr. Kapor has infused ON with his own capital ''in the low seven figures.'' And even with only three employees, the company has a different feel. ''Once you grow out of being a teenager you can never recapture the innocence,'' Mr. Kapor said. ''It is the same thing here. I feel a lot calmer, but there is still the same excitement.'' Mr. Kapor, who resides outside the Boston area, is married and has a son.

On the outside of the document was the legend: ''Officially Sealed.'' Upon breaking the seal, however, the recipient felt a severe sense of letdown. The secret of the document? It was the ''1988 Campaign Battle Plan'' of the Dole for President Campaign combined with a request for a campaign contribution. What next from the fevered imaginations of the direct-mail advertising folks?

1333-> Phillies' Bedrosian Cy Young Winner
In the closest voting in the history of the National League Cy Young Award, Steve Bedrosian of the Philadelphia Phillies won the 1987 honor yesterday and in the process became the 59th player to earn $1 million or more this year. Bedrosian, only the third relief pitcher to win the National League award, edged Rick Sutcliffe of the Chicago Cubs by 2 points and Rick Reuschel of the San Francisco Giants by 3. Bedrosian, who led the league with 40 saves, received 57 points, Sutcliffe 55 and Reuschel 54 from the 24-man panel of the Baseball Writers Association of America. The previous closest finish in the National League voting occurred in 1981, the strike-shortened season, when Fernando Valenzuela defeated Tom Seaver by 3 points, 70-67. Earns $100,000 Bonus By winning the award yesterday, Bedrosian gained a $100,000 bonus from the Phillies, giving him a 1987 income of $1,050,000. He had an $825,000 salary and previously had earned two other bonuses - $25,000 for being on the National League All-Star team and $100,000 for winning the Rolaids award as the league's No. 1 relief pitcher. When the American League Cy Young results are announced today, Roger Clemens of Boston also will benefit financially. Clemens is expected to win the award or, at worst, finish second. He will receive a $150,000 bonus for winning and $125,000 for finishing second, and the amount he wins will also be added to his salary next year. None of the other seven pitchers who placed in the National League voting earned bonuses. Nolan Ryan of Houston would have received $200,000 had he won, but he tied for fifth with Dwight Gooden with 12 points. Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles was fourth with 14 points, Mike Scott of Houston seventh with 9 and Bob Welch of Los Angeles eighth with 3. No pitcher was named on all 24 ballots, and Shane Rawley of Philadelphia, who won 17 games, second to Sutcliffe's league high of 18, was named on none. Bedrosian, who set a major-league record during the season by registering saves in 13 consecutive appearances, was named on 17 ballots, four fewer than Sutcliffe. Two writers vote from each National League city, with points achieved on the basis of 5 for first, 3 for second and 1 for third. Lack of Strong Candidates The voting indicated the lack of strong candidates in the league. Sutcliffe had a 15-4 record July 28 but gained only three victories the rest of the season. He finished 18-10. Rawley had a 17-6 record Aug. 31 but lost his last five decisions. He finished with a 17-11 record and a 4.39 earned run average. Reuschel apparently gained support in the voting because he led the league in e.r.a. much of the season (he finished at 3.09) and because of the five victories he gained in his first six starts after the Giants acquired him from Pittsburgh. Reuschel received 8 first-place votes, only 1 fewer less than Bedrosian, but he was listed on only six other ballots, receiving four seconds and two thirds. Bedrosian, who picked up his 40 saves in 45 save opportunities, had two seconds and six thirds to go with his 9 first-place votes. Sutcliffe had four firsts, nine seconds and eight thirds. Hershiser had 2 first-place votes and Gooden one. Previously, the only relief pitchers to win the National League award were Mike Marshall of Los Angeles in 1974 and Bruce Sutter of the Cubs in 1979. Sparky Lyle, Rollie Fingers and Willie Hernandez have won the award in the American League as relievers. Bedrosian's award also marks the fourth time in the last eight years a Phillies' pitcher has won it. Steve Carlton won in 1980 and 1982, and John Denny in 1983.

1334-> Assessing Skills of Medical Students
HOW well is the medical student doing? Is he learning the appropriate skills and will he be a good doctor? Those questions have always been troubling to medical schools. Recent research looked at the evaluations of how well the students performed physical examinations and found that faculty members often did a poor job of assessing student performance. Faculty members were wrong in their assessment of the students' performance 32 percent of the time. In particular, they found that when the students were doing head, neck and abdominal examinations, the faculty evaluators were often mistaken; they said a procedure had been correctly performed when it had not, or vice versa. The research, by Diane L. Elliot and David H. Hickam of the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, found that lay people the students were examining could be nearly as good as professionals in judging the students - and probably could get even better with more training. They published their findings in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association Dr. Elliott and Dr. Hickam used trained lay people who were taught to evaluate medical exams and who agreed to be examined by the students. Not surprisingly, the lay people were particularly effective in reporting on whether the trainee was causing them discomfort. The study ''gives us insight into what we need to be doing,'' said Dr. David Hickam of the University of Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. Greater use of trained lay people, the scientists said in the report, ''may lead to improvement'' in the assessment of physical-examination skills.

1335-> And Why Not Call Off All Our Cold Wars?
To the Editor: In ''Kicking the Cold War Habit'' (editorial, Aug. 10), you urge that the United States (by which you must mean the majority of our citizens) cease reacting with revulsion, indignation and condemnation to habitual Communist behavior - spitting insults, as you put it. For peace and other common interests, we should all ignore Soviet actions. Although you concede that ''hostility won't evaporate, of course,'' we can address our concerns more ''constructively.'' Are you prepared to broaden this to pacify relations between groups of our citizens (to be sure, not all) and other countries against whom those groups wage cold war? Will you entreat them to ignore apartheid and lay off South Africa? Disenthrall themselves from fear and mistrust of police states like Pinochet's Chile? Muffle their indignation at repression in South Korea? Be indifferent to death squads in El Salvador? Or is it only ''socialist'' regimes at whom we should stop spitting insults?

1336-> Korean Official Warns Against Leftist Unrest
Prime Minister Kim Chung Yul warned today that leftist forces were trying to use labor unrest to stage a violent revolution and said any attempt to disrupt national stability would be crushed. The Government warning came as hundreds of strikers battled riot policemen firing tear gas in at least two cities today, and opposition forces called for nationwide anti-Government protests Friday to mourn the death of a striker. The Government said more than 60 people, including leftist agitators disguised as workers, have been arrested since Aug. 20. The police announced today that 12 more reported leftist agitators were arrested and efforts were under way to round up others. Mr. Kim, in a major Government statement issued after a month of strikes and labor disputes, said leftist forces were trying to use the unrest to overthrow the political and social order and create a revolutionary society. The Government has ordered a major crackdown on leftists, Mr. Kim said. ''The Government is firmly determined to root out impure leftist forces from our society with all the law-enforcing power we can mobilize from now on to maintain law and order,'' Mr. Kim said in a televised speech to the nation after a special Cabinet meeting on the unrest.

1337-> The Wrong Response to Holtzman
Not content to clear Judge Irving W. Levine of the New York State Supreme Court of charges that he participated in the humiliation of an alleged rape victim, the Chief Administrative Judge, Albert M. Rosenblatt, has filed countercharges against the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman. Her alleged offense: making false accusations against a judge. Judge Rosenblatt, hiding behind the Lawyers' Code of Professional Responsibility, claims, ''I have taken these actions because I am legally and ethically bound to do so.'' This is not true. He is under no legal or ethical obligation to file countercharges. He has made a calculated discretionary decision, and a dangerous and bad one. His message to the legal community is clear: You criticize our judges at great risk. If you turn out to be wrong - or not as right as you thought you were - your professional career may be on the line. Where does the First Amendment's freedom of speech figure into this? If other citizens - the press, politicians, ordinary Joes - take shots at officials and turn out to be wrong, the Constitution will come to their aid. So long as the error was not malicious or done with reckless disregard for the truth, it is constitutionally protected speech. The First Amendment is not limited to the right to be right; it also enshrines the right to be wrong. Some judges would apply a double standard when the judiciary is criticized, especially when criticism comes from lawyers, who are often in the best position to expose judicial problems. Indeed, the Code of Professional Responsibility contains special rules for lawyers who criticize judges. It forbids lawyers to ''knowingly'' make false accusations against judges. Such a rule may be sound and constitutional so long as ''knowingly'' is defined as ''maliciously'' or with ''reckless disregard for the truth.'' But Judge Rosenblatt cites another rule that mandates that before a lawyer may criticize a judge, ''He should be certain of the merit of his complaint.'' No one claims Ms. Holtzman's accusations were ''knowingly'' false when she leveled them. She relied on memorandums written by an assistant who had tried the case. She believed Judge Levine had asked the complaining witness to re-enact the rape in a degrading manner. A reading of the transcript suggests it was the alleged rapist's defense attorney who had asked ''the court's permission'' to require the alleged rape victim to get ''down on all fours.'' It is still not clear precisely what happened at that point. The complaining witness herself gave two directly contradictory sworn statements about the event, and she too may now be the subject of a criminal investigation. The alleged rapist was acquitted of sexual misconduct charges. At worst, it seems as if Ms. Holtzman may have made an honest mistake in a good faith attempt to protect the dignity of an alleged rape victim and to protest sexist practices in court. She may have shot from the hip before conducting a sufficiently thorough investigation. When she issued her criticism, she said she had learned of other allegations involving the same judge. To require a lawyer to act at personal peril unless ''certain'' of the merit of a complaint is to mandate silence even in the face of substantial evidence of judicial misconduct. It is almost impossible to be ''certain'' about events that involve subtle factors like humiliation or degradation. Even if a lawyer is certain, another judge may later disagree. Too few lawyers will criticize judges, even when judges behave outrageously. They are - correctly -afraid of retaliation against them and against their clients: Many judges do retaliate in subtle and overt ways. If Ms. Holtzman is disciplined for her public criticism of Judge Levine -even if it turns out to have been unwarranted - other lawyers surely will get the intended message and take the safe course of silence in the face of possible judicial misconduct. The issue transcends Elizabeth Holtzman and even the bar. Judges have enormous power over citizens' lives. They serve for long terms or for life. They must be held to account for their conduct. It is far better to tolerate the occasional error of overcriticism of a judge than to discourage valid criticism of the least accountable branch of our government.

1339-> Reagan Wants Dollar to Halt Fall, But U.S. Doesn't Take Any Action
President Reagan said today that he did not ''want a further decline'' of the dollar, but beyond the President's remarks the Administration did nothing in the markets to stabilize it. Mr. Reagan's comments followed three weeks of a steadily declining dollar after the Administration decided to shift policy and allow the dollar's value to drop, along with interest rates. The President's remarks seemed aimed at averting a rout of the dollar while the leading industrial countries begin preparations for a meeting to consider what to do about it. Rise Is Not Sustained Following Mr. Reagan's comments, the value of the dollar rose against the West German mark, the Japanese yen and other currencies in foreign-exchange trading. But as the day progressed, traders said, the markets began discounting the President's remarks and the dollar settled back to its very low levels of Monday. [ Page D11. ] [ Worries about the dollar and Washington's difficulty in reducing the budget deficit contributed to unusually steep losses in overseas stock markets Tuesday. Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks fell 3.0 percent. Page D1. ] Mr. Reagan's remarks interrupted an early morning decline that Wall Street currency traders attributed to comments of Administration officials reported in The New York Times this morning and to delays in the deficit-reduction negotiations with Congress. The officials, who spoke on condition that they would not be identified, are involved in economic policy making. The article quoted one as saying the dollar should ''drift'' and another as saying the Government was not trying to halt the decline. The latter official said today that the Administration's newest remarks and those of Monday reflect differences of emphasis within the Administration, not of policy. The White House disavowed the earlier remarks in a 10 A.M. statement that White House officials said was worked out by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d; Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff; Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman. ''The unnamed White House and Administration officials quoted in today's New York Times article on the dollar were not speaking for the Administration,'' the statement said. The United States, it added, ''continues to cooperate closely'' with the six other leading industrial countries in the Group of Seven ''to promote exchange-rate stability.'' The six are Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Reagan's Answer on Dollar About 30 minutes later, while having his picture taken with Israel's President, Chaim Herzog, President Reagan was asked what he sought for the dollar. ''I don't look for a further decline,'' he said. ''I don't want a further decline.'' He also said, ''We're not doing anything to bring it down.'' It was not clear how carefully the President had framed his answer. ''I do not look to the President's off-the-cuff remarks as a true formulation of economic policy,'' said Richard Witten, vice president of Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''I don't think the Administration has any problems with the dollar at this level or at a lower level, but it probably worries about the speed of decline and the impact on other markets.'' Even if the Administration wants a stable dollar, other analysts said, it would be unable to fight market pressures to keep it stable for very long. ''President Reagan can say what he wants,'' said Yani Budiman, a vice president of the Chemical Bank. ''Unless his statements are backed up by budget-deficit cuts, the dollar will continue to trade lower.'' It seems clear that the Administration accepts the decline of the dollar so far and that the Federal Reserve is not selling or buying dollars in sufficient quantity to force the value up or down. That means the Administration is leaving the pressure on the dollar to the marketplace, where the desire to sell has exceeded interest in buying. The decline has permitted the Administration and the Federal Reserve to allow a decline in interest rates, which in turn could help forestall a recession. Absence of Fed Action One sign of the policy has been the absence of action by the Federal Reserve, which could try to stabilize the dollar by buying it and selling other currencies. But few Wall Street traders said they found evidence today that the Federal Reserve was buying dollars, which could stall a decline and demonstrate a desire for a stable dollar. They said some traders reported telephone calls from the Federal Reserve inquiring about currency rates but little or no actual intervention. ''The Fed has not been around,'' said James Scalfaro, a foreign-exchange trader at the Bank of Montreal branch in New York. ''Until such time as our Federal Reserve is more forceful with its invervention, the market will continue to test the lower levels,'' said Varick Martin, vice president at the New York officie of the Union Bank of Switzerland. Traders said the Bank of Japan had been intervening aggressively, buying dollars to try to support it, and that the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, had been doing so in smaller volumes. They said the Federal Reserve showed some concern for the dollar in its calls to brokers today and that it might intervene later in the week. The Federal Reserve would be unlikely to disclose the purpose for its intervention - whether it was seeking to establish a new floor for the dollar, to prevent a rout, or to stabilize the markets ahead of a Group of Seven meeting. Today another senior official reinforced the view that the Administration would not stand in the way of a declining dollar. Hours after the President's comments, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. spoke at a lunch at the National Press Club. After his speech, in reply to questions, Mr. Verity said, ''In the end, it is the marketplace that will determine how far the dollar will fall, and I happen to be a believer in markets.'' Mr. Verity, however, does not have a role in matters concerning the dollar, which is the nearly exclusive purview of Treasury Secretary Baker. The Dollar's Decline In New York late today, the dollar was worth 1.664 West German marks and 134.6 Japanese yen. Since the dollar's decline began last month, it has fallen about 8 percent in relation to the mark and 6 percent in relation to the yen. With periodic Administration encouragement, the dollar has lost about half its value against those currencies from its peak of early 1985. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve sought a cheaper dollar on the assumption that it would lead to a reduction in the huge American trade deficits and would deflect calls for protectionist laws in Congress to keep out imported goods. But other economic phenomena intruded to prevent much improvement in the trade deficit, and many members of the Administration, like many economists, maintain that a Group of Seven agreement last February to stabilize the dollar was a mistake because it contributed to rises in world interest rates in an unsuccessful effort to support the dollar. Analysts said the most compelling reason for the market nervousness was not periodic remarks by public officials but the talks on reducing Federal budget deficits. Some say the deficits have contributed to large distortions in the world economy, including higher than usual interest rates, and that these distortions partly explain the failure of the American trade deficit to shrink despite the decline of the dollar. The markets are also skittish, they said, because of apprehension surrounding the trade figures for September that the Commerce Department will issue Thursday. The slight narrowing of the deficit reported last month for August was one of the sparks in the plunge of the Dow Jones industrial average, many analysts have asserted.

1340-> Jaffna Journal; Fight Is Over for Tigers, and the Dream Recedes
The downtown street bazaars here are teeming nowadays with crowds of shoppers, and the air rings constantly with loud bangs. For the first time in years, nobody jumps at the noise. The loud hammering and pounding come not from bombs or mortars, but from road and building repairs. They are the sounds of a city that is crawling cautiously back to life, after four years of devastation by war, even as people wonder whether the peace can be kept or whether it was obtained at the right price. ''At last we have peace, and isn't it wonderful?'' said Yogaranee Ramanathan, an English teacher. ''But you know there is still some sadness. Our boys have not all been released from prison. The mothers are still crying in the night for their children. There are certain things we cannot forget.'' In May and June, intense shelling and aerial bombardment from the Sri Lankan military rocked this city with explosions that killed uncounted numbers of people and forced thousands to flee. Block after block of this coastal trading center, which lies in the shadows of a 300-year-old Dutch fort abutting the sea, are now rubble and shattered buildings. Death Toll of 6,000 The Government's attack on Jaffna and other parts of the northern Jaffna Peninsula was the culminating phase of Colombo's drive to crush the guerrilla insurgency waged by ethnic Tamils in the north and east. Some 6,000 people are estimated to have died since during the rebellion. Tamils, who are a minority, are mostly Hindu, while the majority Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists. Then a month ago, when the prospects for peace seemed to many the most bleak that they had ever been, President J. R. Jayewardene shifted tactics abruptly and signed a peace accord with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India. India sent in 7,000 soldiers as a peace-keeping force, and the guerrillas began surrendering their arms. To most people of this war-wracked region, the terms of the Indian-Sri Lankan accord remain unclear. They question whether the promise of greater autonomy for Tamil areas will ever be fulfilled, for example. Underlying everything is the widespread concern that the guerrillas' hopes for an independent country for Tamils, or even the lesser dream of an independent Tamil ''homeland'' in Sri Lanka, have slipped out of Tamil hands forever. 'Dark Cloud Has Lifted' ''It's like a dark cloud has lifted,'' said Anton Francis, a political science student at Jaffna University, sitting with friends under some trees. ''We all feel a sense of freedom and relief. But politically, we are not certain of our future. We don't know if our rights will be respected.'' A few miles away, however, any nagging doubt seemed submerged in a frenzy of joy as thousands of people thronged the city's biggest annual Hindu festival to celebrate one of the holiest days of the year. Children snacked on peanuts, popcorn and sugar cane while worshipers shattered coconuts in a bonfire as a sacred offering. Then a group of young men in the traditional white sarongs of Sri Lanka hauled a huge chariot around the temple bearing a likeness of the god Murugah. A Booth for Flower Pots Also at the festival were indications of the semi-official status of the largest guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The Tigers were running a concession booth where people could buy soft drinks, brooms, flower pots and other products manufactured and sold to advance the cause of an independent ''Eelam'' for Tamils. But the police and traffic enforcement provided by the Tigers at the height of their control here has been suspended. The Sri Lankan Government law enforcement is hated and remains withdrawn, with the result that the whole area has no real police force. Robberies and other crimes have reportedly spurted up, creating another headache to be addressed by an interim Tamil administration. No one knows when it will be selected. Elsewhere, the war scars are visible, especially among the common fishermen and farmers whose lives have been disrupted. #2,500 New Shelters This week, the Norwegian Red Cross arrived to build 2,500 new shelters for families now living in refugee camps. Jaffna Hospital is overflowing with more patients than beds. Farmers said that for the first time in years, they could plant onions, chiles, tobacco and eggplant in hopes of sending large quantities by truck to Colombo and other areas of the south. Roads used to be blocked, and farming itself came to a halt in May. At a fishing village, the fishermen said their boats had been destroyed but that at least they could now fish 8 to 10 miles offshore without being taken into custody and beaten by the Sri Lankan Navy. To most people, of course, the greatest anomaly here is the presence of the Indian troops, whose trucks rumble down the roads even as soldiers themselves maintain a low profile. The Indian soldiers have their own headaches. They had to break up a fight between Tamils and Sinhalese in the eastern port of Trincomalee, and then had to squelch a rumor that two Sinhalese youths had been shot by soldiers. Another problem is the continuing hazard of mines. At a civilian grievance center at Indian army headquarters at Palaly Airport, where a sign overhead said ''Peace to All Those Who Enter,'' Indian soldiers were this week trying to cope with citizens' problems.

1343-> Danny O'Neil Is Dead; Channel 31 Producer
Danny O'Neil, a consulting producer and a former acting program manager at Channel 31, died Thursday at Doctors Hospital of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, according to his family. He was 45 years old. As a producer, Mr. O'Neil won praise from critics for bringing audiences high-quality shows put together on shoestring budgets. Among them were his television version of A. J. Gurney's ''Scenes From an American Life''; ''New York Screening Room,'' a 13-part series of documentary and dramatic films selected from those shown at New York cultural institutions, and the 1984 series ''Mothers by Daughters'' - co-produced with Barbara M. Van Dyke - in which Estelle Parsons discussed with women in the arts their relationships with their mothers. At his death, Mr. O'Neil was preparing a series of 30- to 60-second ''spots'' with new poets reading from their works, to be used during station breaks. For this project, he received a grant from the Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry. Born in Brasher Falls, N. Y., Mr. O'Neil studied drama at Catholic University in Washington. He is survived by two sisters, Nancy of New York City and JoAnn Coria of Syracuse, and a niece, Micaela Coria. A memorial serivce will be held in the spring.

1345-> Dance: Ailey Troupe in 'Divining' and 'Memoria'
THE accent was on strong and resonant performing when the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater presented a program of four dances on Saturday night at City Center, 131 West 55th Street. It is not surprising that Judith Jamison, the powerhouse former Ailey star, should have created a dance with a strong role for a woman in ''Divining,'' a 1984 piece set to drum music by Kimati Dinizulu and Monti Ellison. And Renee Robinson seized the opportunity, in a performance of reverberating intensity and sureness. ''Divining'' is a ritualistic dance, and the jagged, unfamiliar thrusting of Ms. Robinson's body in ''Seeking,'' the dance's opening section, approximated the religious experience of speaking in tongues. The ''speaking'' subsides into a slow, spellbound solo, ''Resting,'' that is informed by a throbbing stillness. The mood is almost lyrical in the closing section, ''Moving On,'' with a curved, slicing look to Ms. Robinson's moves into space and into the group of dancers that has joined her. The curtain descends on the moving dancers, with Ms. Robinson at the front. This is an ongoing ritual, Ms. Jamison seems to be saying in this flowing dance. It isn't clear what that ritual may be, and that diminishes the dance a little. ''Divining'' may refer to a few moments' evolutionary process. It brought out a newly abandoned sensuousness in Donna Wood, for whom the dance was created. And it extends Ms. Robinson's range, giving her a deserved place center stage. The other dancers provide a shifting frame and ground for the diviner. The supporting cast was led by Leonard Meek, Neisha Folkes, Ruthlyn Salomons and Andre Tyson. Tania Leon conducted the score for the piece, which had costumes designed by Masazumi Chaya, a former Ailey dancer. ''Treading,'' a 1979 piece choreographed by Elisa Monte, is danced to a pulsating, regenerative score by Steve Reich. In a sense, the dance and music are one, for this duet is sensuous but for the most part not ordinarily romantic. With the exception of a few nestling moments at the close, ''Treading'' establishes its dancers as pulsating bodies joining together in an inseparable whole. And Stephen Smith and Elizabeth Roxas were impressive, suggesting that final drawing-together from the start in their opening solos. Interestingly, Ms. Roxas had the weightier, more earthy attack. Mr. Smith, a beautifully buoyant and open dancer, seemed about to float upward with each lightly blossoming extension of his leg. Ulysses Dove takes on a larger world in his ''Night Shade,'' a 1982 piece danced to drum music by Mr. Reich. And he is that rare choreographer who manages to work against the repetitive quality of the Reich-Philip Glass music that is so much in vogue in modern dance today, rather than letting the dance be carried along in the reiterative, gridlike pulse of the rhythms. In part, this is because Mr. Dove has chosen to tell a story. But that story is unclear. Is the setting - a space enclosed by a big silvered wall and boxes, with candles in glass globes placed along the floor and a massive fountain-basin - a mausoleum haunted by vampires? A biting kiss at the start suggests it may be, and that the four women who are at the heart of the piece, once kissed, do in another mortal. It would be interesting to see the piece performed without its wall, boxes, candles, basin, water and the gravel that gets thrown at the end. Repeated viewings reveal more clearly the strong floor patterns and suggest that under that scenic and scenaristic load there is a powerful ritualistic dance to be seen. The work peters out at the end, but up to that point ''Night Shade'' unleashes some potent dancing for its seething handmaidens and the grave men who attend them. The very good cast included Marilyn Banks, Marey Griffith, Deborah Manning, Ms. Folkes, Carl Bailey, Kevin Brown, David St. Charles and Rodney Nugent. Mr. Ailey's ''Memoria,'' which completed the program, is more a loving and living tribute to his friend, the late Joyce Trisler, than a formal work of dance. But the piece, created in 1979 and set to music by Keith Jarrett, does evoke obliquely some of the pain and difficulties of the life of that dancer and choreographer, as it refers to her the dances she created. And its final burst of joy when youngsters from the Ailey school and second company surge onto the stage to join the senior dancers, suggests Ms. Trisler's humor and her gift for instilling a sense of professionalism in the young dancers she taught. April Berry, who is well on her way to becoming a star in the Jamison mold, performed the dance's central role with a gracious, building impact, with Gary DeLoatch and Mr. Brown as her gentle cavaliers.

1346-> COMPANY NEWS; PIZZA INN GETS TAKEOVER OFFER
Pizza Inn Inc. said that it had received an unsolicited takeover offer from Concept Development Inc. for a combination of stock and cash valued at $13.85 a share, or a total of about $45 million. Under the proposal, Concept Development, a St. Louis-based operator of 125 Panterra's pizza restaurants, would offer Pizza Inn shareholders $3 a share and 1.4 shares in Concept Development stock for each Pizza Inn share. Concept Development, which is traded over the counter, closed at $7.75 a share yesterday, up 25 cents. Pizza Inn's board has already approved a takeover by a management-led group. But the bid appears to have failed because of inadequate financing. The group, the Pizza Inn Acquiring Corporation, said it was continuing in its efforts to arrange financing.

1347-> Punta Arenas Journal; Bishop and General in a Contest for Allende's Soul
For 14 years now, the issue has arisen every September, and time has not diminished the emotion surrounding it. The question is whether the collective Christian heart of Punta Arenas is large enough to pray for the soul of Salvador Allende Gossens as well as for the departed members of the military that deposed him as President on Sept. 11, 1973. This year, it produced days of verbal bloodletting between Bishop Tomas Gonzalez and Maj. Gen. Claudio Lopez, the two men who personify Chile's deep political divisions in this isolated city where South America comes to an end. Bishop Gonzalez, who came here from Santiago 14 years ago and has done battle with a succession of military governors, said the latest, General Lopez, is ''a very authoritarian, violent man who has an irrational attitude toward the church.'' Dispute Over a Service The general did not agree to an interview, but other public figures, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, agreed that he was one of the most difficult military governors they had had. They added that the Bishop did little, if anything, to avoid confrontation. This time, the tempers flared when the Governor's office asked the church for permission for chaplains to conduct an open-air mass in the Plaza Munoz Gamero, the main square, on Sept. 11 to pray for members of the military and the police who died in the line of duty. The Bishop refused, saying this was tantamount to setting up a parallel church with military chaplains. He said it would have constituted ''a political mass because they would pray only for the military dead.'' The church went ahead with its regular daily mass on Sept. 11 in the cathedral and the Bishop said that the parish priest prayed for all who had died on that date. As always, the Bishop said, there was a request for prayers for Dr. Allende, and the priest obliged. General Lopez charged that homage was paid to Dr. Allende, which the Bishop denied. Dr. Allende, a Marxist, was found dead in the bombed and burned presidential palace in Santiago the day of the coup. A presidential physician said he saw the President shoot himself, but Allende followers outside of Chile maintain that he was killed by the military. Device, or Devices, Thrown At the end of the mass, someone threw at least one incendiary device that landed outside the church, causing no injuries. The Governor's office said there had been four, all thrown from the interior patio of the church and directed at the police on duty in the plaza. The Bishop said there was only one and that he did not know whether it came from church property or from outside. The issue did not end there. Exactly a week after the anniversary of the coup comes the anniversary of Chile's independence from Spain, when, by long tradition, bishops offer Te Deum masses in honor of the nation and invite public authorities. A few days after the 11th, General Lopez announced that he would not attend the Bishop's Te Deum mass because the invitation had arrived late. The Bishop said that his office had, in fact, tried to consult the Governor's office in advance about a convenient time for the mass and had not received a response. So when the 18th came, the Bishop held his mass in the cathedral, and the armed forces held their mass on a military installation. The Tone Is Milder While the tone of the political encounter in Punta Arenas seems to match that in the capital between the Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and the political opposition, in practice things are generally milder here. Two people were killed by security forces in Punta Arenas and the surrounding province of Magallanes in late 1973 as part of the crackdown on leftists after the coup; hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed elsewhere. Since then, people have occasionally been jailed for political reasons, but their detention has usually been short. The intelligence police, which is responsible for operations against guerrilla groups and other extreme leftist opponents of the regime in the Santiago area, also has a presence here, but it is not clear what it does. ''I guess they are busy putting together files on us,'' said Estanislao Karelovic, publisher of La Prensa Austral, the area's 8,000-circulation daily newspaper. Has the Promise Failed? Mr. Karelovic worries about what he sees as the failed promise of Punta Arenas. It is apparent, he says, in the fact that there are more people in the cemetery than alive here, which he thinks is unusual for a town born only in 1849. There are about 120,000 living people in Punta Arenas. Europeans first came in pursuit of food and other basic necessities, then fortunes. The cemetery's grandiose monuments with inscriptions in many tongues are eloquent proof that they came from many lands and that some made fortunes. The money was made in immense cattle and sheep spreads, seal hunting, navigation, and the trade that supported those activities. The glory days of Punta Arenas were linked to the Strait of Magellan, the channel between the Atlantic and Pacific. Much of the world's trade once moved through here. Another waterway, the Panama Canal, ended all of that when it opened early in this century. The national petroleum company is now the largest employer in the region, with more than 2,000 workers. Part of its production comes from wells on Tierra del Fuego. The rest is pumped up out of the Strait of Magellan, proof that the waterway still has rewards for those who brave its churning waters.

1350-> IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; Where Clothes Make the Man
What should the well-dressed witness wear to a Congressional investigation? Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North made both a fashion statement and a political statement by showing up in the Senate Caucus Room each morning in his Marine Corps uniform. The rows of medals and ribbons, the tie smartly tucked into the shirt all conveyed to the viewing public a sense of history, duty, service and sacrifice. Today, however, John M. Poindexter showed up in a bureacratic blue suit and striped tie -despite the fact that he holds the rank of rear admiral in the Navy. Arthur L. Liman, majority counsel for the Senate committee, implicitly commented on the comparison by noting that had the admiral been wearing his uniform, it, too, would have been bedecked with decorations, including the Legion of Merit and the National Defense Service Medal. ''I know some people wonder why I am not wearing my uniform,'' Mr. Poindexter replied. ''And I'd like to make that point clear in the beginning. I'm very proud of my uniform and I'm proud of the United States Navy. But this issue is not a Navy issue.'' He said, ''I chose to appear here in civilian clothes, which I think is entirely appropriate given the nature of the matters under consideration.''

1351-> 2 Boats of Haitian Refugees Are Stopped Near Bahamas
Two boats carrying Haitian refugees were intercepted by the Royal Bahamian Defense Force today near the Bahamian island of Great Inagua, about 450 miles southeast of Miami. The two boats were stopped a day after another boat carrying 138 Haitians had been returned to Haiti by the United States Coast Guard cutter Alert. The 210-foot cutter was sent out again today and was expected to reach the boats this afternoon, a Coast Guard spokesman, Lou Parris, said. The Haitian boats measured only 25 to 30 feet, but one was carrying 105 refugees. An officer with the Immigration and Naturalization Service aboard the cutter will interview the Haitians to determine whether any have United States visas or are political refugees who will be brought to this country.

1356-> IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; Poindexter, a Professorial Air and Detachment
Once it was a President who said ''the buck stops here.'' Today it was a 50-year-old rear admiral, a man who at least until now could have walked down any street in America without being recognized. Speaking of one of the most crucial foreign policy decisions of the Reagan Presidency, he told Congressional investigators in a matter-of-fact manner: ''On this whole issue, you know, the buck stops here with me.'' No, John M. Poindexter told the House and Senate panels investigating the Iran-contra affair, he had never informed President Reagan that the profits from the Iran arms sales were being diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. ''I made the decision,'' he said. He was not making policy,'' he added; it was simply a ''matter of implementation'' of the President's clearly stated policy of supporting the contras. In tones as bland as the testimony of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North was electric, the former national security adviser began his long-awaited account today. Flat, Almost Conversational Tones On the surface, the committees' two star witnesses could not have been more different. Colonel North, radiating energy and command, his chest covered with medals, used the hearing room as a pulpit for his vision of the world and of his role as a defender of democracy. Admiral Poindexter, wearing a blue business suit, puffed on a pipe as he answered questions in flat, almost conversational tones. If Colonel North transformed the hearing into theater, Admiral Poindexter, who has a doctorate in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology, appeared to regard the proceeding as a seminar for a not particularly bright group of graduate students who were always on the verge of straining the professor's patience. ''The way you keep a secret is you don't tell anybody,'' he explained during a discussion of covert activities. Colonel North took the committees, and apparently the American public as well, on an emotional roller coaster, alternating misty-eyed pleas for understanding with mischievous grins and stern tongue lashings at the inability of Congress to see things his way. Admiral Poindexter, by contrast, projected an air of detachment, as if he was not quite sure what the fuss was all about. Being the Ultimate Staff Man Yet beneath the surface, the two career military officers were perhaps not all that different. In a sense, Admiral Poindexter was Colonel North, stripped of the younger man's personal dynamism and bravado. As he described his role, he was what Colonel North portrayed himself as being: the ultimate staff man. As Admiral Poindexter described what it meant to be a loyal and useful staff member, he provided a glimpse into the heart of a Presidency in which the chief executive's lack of interest in the details of policy was accepted by all as a basic fact of life. In casual, almost off-hand tones, he described a President who had no need to know important facts, who had to be protected and provided with ''deniability.'' ''The President is not a man for great detail,'' he said at one point. There was no need for Mr. Reagan to know how the contras were being supported, he said at another point, because ''the only thing that was important to him was that they were staying alive.'' ''It's always the responsibility of a staff to protect their leader,'' Admiral Poindexter said, explaining why, as the arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran were becoming public last November, he destroyed a document the President had signed in December 1985 that provided retroactive authority for the initial arms transaction. Neutral and Matter of Fact As he described the event, his action was completely natural. It did not give rise to second thoughts at the time or in retrospect: ''I frankly didn't see any need for it at the time,'' he said of the document, known as an intelligence finding. ''I thought it was politically embarrassing. And so I decided to tear it up, and I tore it up, put it in the burn basket behind my desk.'' Still, his tone was neutral, matter of fact. Admiral Poindexter, like Colonel North, had an aggressive defense lawyer at his side who tried to seize the initiative by challenging the validity of the proceedings. Richard Beckler, Admiral Poindexter's lawyer, said his client was the primary target of a Federal grand jury investigation. He argued strenuously that the admiral's right to a fair trial was jeopardized by the hearings. As did Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., Colonel North's lawyer, Mr. Beckler sat tautly in his chair, making frequent objections to Mr. Liman's questions. Quietly, often with a slight smile, Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the chairman, overruled each objection. ''I'd like to have at least one objection possibly sustained sometime,'' Mr. Beckler said in mid-afternoon. ''Brendan Sullivan didn't get one. I'd like to get just one. Thanks.'' Mr. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, was amused but unmoved. ''Counsel will proceed,'' he said.

1357-> IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; The Highlights
John M. Poindexter took responsibility for authorizing the diversion of profits from the Iran arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels, and said he withheld the information from President Reagan. His motive in not telling the President, he told the Congressional investigating committees, was to protect the President from political damage. He said he considered the diversion a ''detail'' in carrying out the President's policy of keeping the rebels fighting after Congress had cut off aid. He also said he watched the President sign a document in December 1985 authorizing the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for the release of hostages, and said he had the finding burned last November. White House aides voiced relief that Admiral Poindexter's testimony had supported the President's denials of knowledge of the diversion, but they said they were being cautious because considerable testimony was yet to come. The President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, described Mr. Reagan as ''gratified'' by the admiral's statements. He added, however, that Mr. Reagan would not have approved of the diversion had he been asked to do so. Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Reagan would have senior aides consult Congressional intelligence committee leaders on changing the procedures for telling Congress about covert operations. The admiral contrasted, in his bland tones, with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, but there were also deep similarities: each officer, in a way, took the role of an ultimate staff man. A threat of prosecution faces Admiral Poindexter, his lawyer, Richard W. Beckler, said. He said he had been informed that his client had been named the ''primary target'' of a Federal grand jury investigating the Iran-contra affair.

1359-> Woman Dies in Plunge; Man Charged in Death
A 35-year-old Manhattan woman died in a plunge from the roof of a six-story building on Saturday and yesterday a man was charged with pushing her to her death, the police said. The man, Bobby Haynes, who told the police he was a resident of a men's shelter at 216 Fort Washington Avenue, was charged with second-degree murder. He was being held pending arraignment. According to the police, the victim, Yvonne Parker, 35 years old, of 145 West 145th Street in Manhattan, was found dead Saturday morning, face down on the sidewalk behind a building at 555 West 151st Street. She was found by a passer-by. The police said the victim did not know Mr. Haynes and that they had not determined why the two were on the roof.

1360-> LONG ISLAND OPINION; TREKKING TO PLACES KNOWN TO FEW
ROLLING downhill in the battered blue Volvo to Port Jefferson past the harbor. . . For a minute I feel things open up - there's a flash of Monterey, Calif., in the corner of my memory; memories of last summer's vacation, the land opening out over the water. I'm quickly easing my way uphill, and the first specks of pale green spot the open sky at the hill's top - spring! Instantly, I remind myself that on this island - recently ruled by Federal courts to henceforth be considered a peninsula, something to do with the settlement of water rights between New York, Connecticut and New Jersey - spring comes hesitantly, briefly, and then, pow, right into hot summer. Like the rest of this island's natural beauty, or rather what beauty's left, spring strikes small. I've got to pull the eye's frame of vision tight, enlarge each point of interest, sharpen the focus. And then, with this intense watchfulness, I catch the fleet signs of spring here: an apple blossom afloat on frail grass, a blooming dogwood among a copse of stunted maples. Even the small mouth of the Nissequogue River gets squinted immensely fresh, decked in color and blossom. I'm heading over to see a friend in Smithtown. I'm riding the back roads because I like them, and because I have the time today to take them, to risk getting caught behind a lost delivery truck, a daring but confused tourist or one of the slower native drivers. I notice surveyor's stakes, those red spray-painted tips and fluorescent orange plastic ribbons, and an empty flatbed. I hear its bulldozer churning tracks, blading a lot's worth of trees up by their roots. Between Setauket and the north road to my friend's house on the west side of the river, I stop counting the freshly dug dirt roads that curve into what will soon be someone's driveway or street. I can imagine their houses waiting for them to come home from work. The levelings of trees used to upset me, caused me to dream of living someplace else. Still here, I keep tabs on the spots that remain secret, shared by a few, like the pond my friend showed me in over Manorville. Hidden on the edge of what is mostly cranberry bogs, Manorville typifies old island in terms of the sandy berms, the vine-clutched hickories, the gnarled black walnuts. Last fall we visited the pond. Set back off the Wading River-Manor Road and closed in by fallen leaves and fallen trees, a small island rose in its center. The pond has maybe 30, 40 years if it's left alone. It probably won't be left alone. The whole area seems marked for housing, mini-malls every three or four blocks. Anyway, I'm going over to see my friend, and just before I come to River Road, the road that skirts the river's east side, a road of unaffordable, as well as pretty much unapproachable, estates, I'm slightly conscious of a lowering in altitude. My car's four wheels slope the Harbor Hills moraine to the West Hills one. My friend lives on four acres of land. His plot, an acre and a half, abuts three other plots. His neighbors agreed to let their shared, uncleared bit of woods grow wild. My friend uses this uncultivated land for a cross-country ski trail. As I arrive, he, in the process of repairing his trail, replaces a few stones here and there to keep the notched grade from eroding under April's downpours. On his property he keeps a horse, two dogs, chickens and an organic garden that he feeds with compost and manure. Last fall his gourds grew huge, like props in a B-grade sci-fi movie. He takes me on a tour. On the south side of the house, downhill from a sprouted greenhouse, stands a solar shower he's used for years. Along the paths, about the house, he's placed scavenged bits of other people's throwaways: a chunk of exquisitely rusted steel is sculpture for a herb garden; an old tractor seat serves as a bird bath. My favorite piece hangs on the side of the horse barn: a single bedspring spotted with circular saw blades, shards of a plow head, all sorts of shapes that metal and steel have been forged into and thrown away after use or misuse. The piece is as intricate and subtle as a Nevelson. My second favorite is a collage of broken canoe paddles and oars my friend collected over the years on his travels up and down the Nissequogue. He's wired the various broken and weathered wooden shapes to a length of snow fence and nailed the piece to the backside of the barn. Following a path leading to a desk he's got sitting in a clearing, my friend tells me how nice it is to come here and write. He opens the desk drawer, saying, ''Look at this.'' Inside, like an artifact, the decaying head of a duck stares off to the north. My friend tells me how rare it is to have the bill so intact. Pulling the drawer out more, I see a skeleton of a fish, again head intact. I'm amazed by the lack of bugs or flies. My friend shows me his latest project. Walking a bit deeper in the woods, he tells me about an Indian powwow he went to in Copiague. There he met some Indians, he says as we come upon his beginning structure of a wigwam. Bent saplings arch a frame tied taut with dried strips of cherry bark. The ground row of dried thatch is incorrectly tied, he explains. He's going to redo it. He plans to move out of the house and spend the summer in his wigwam. He points out how the direction of the door will cause the smoke, but not the heat, to flow out the hole in the roof, leaving him warm and dry. I ask what his wife thinks about his plans, and he shrugs a small war dance. We go for a bike ride to the Nissequogue and a walk along the riverside. I forgot the hills around here, forgot how steep they are, especially on a rickety 10-speed - the kind I haven't been on in 10 years. Sweat and blood pressure rise with each pump of the pedal, my lungs aching. Downhill I find that the rear brakes don't work, and the front ones easily lock up. My heart doesn't attack me, and proper inhaling clears the mind, filling me with elation, the joy of gliding the drifts and rolls of the North Shore. Soaking up the unfurling buds and early leaves of the trees edging the golf course, we silently ride on asphalt to the river. We park the bikes by a stand of locust trees and enter the woods. I'm back in my childhood as we hike a foothill path to a spot overlooking the river. From here, children swinging on rope let go and fall into the silt-bottomed water. A couple of boats, anchored at midriver, risk getting stranded aground by the tide changing low. Soon the boats pull up anchor and steer the current north to Smithtown Bay, the river's mouth, and deeper water, where the town ramp leads to their boat-trailer. We continue our walk and stop at the ''Going Over,'' the spot where the Smiths forded the river, crossing from one side of their vast property to the next, heading into town and back. Turning to return, my friend finds an arrowhead. It's his first ever in almost 20 years of walking this wooded site of the Island Indians' summer settlements. As I poke the ground with a stick looking for my arrowhead, he warns that I shouldn't dig here. The Town of Smithtown doesn't permit any excavation without a permit. I stop digging, and he finds the arrowhead waiting for him on the path back. Pedaling uphill, we zigzag the rise, a sort of tacking that helps the gases, or whatever cramps the muscles, to dissipate in our solar plexus and legs. I manage to keep going up hills I thought for sure I'd have to get off the bike and walk up. Thirsty and riding the neighborhood streets, I glide past someone washing his car in his suburban driveway. The sudsy water trickles down to the river.

1361-> LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
MINISTERING TO THE INDIANS There haven't been many who have ruled both church and state. Michael F. Smith, a Shinnecock Indian, may be considered one of the few. His dual roles are ''time-consuming,'' he said recently, ''but my family and I manage to maintain our sanity.'' As one of the three trustees of the self-governing Shinnecock Indian Reservation in Southampton, he is in charge of the administration of the reservation, primarily determining the land allotments for the 350 Indians who reside on the 800-acre property. Known as Reverend Mike, he has served for the last two years as temporary pastor of the 100-member Shinnecock Presbyterian Church. Established in the 1600's, it's the oldest Indian Presbyterian church in the country. Today, with as little pomp and ceremony as the reserved Mr. Smith can arrange, he will be officially installed as the permanent pastor of the Indian church, the first seminary-trained and ordained Indian to hold that position. The hierachy of the Long Island Presbytery will travel to the East End reservation to perform the rites. ''We'll also celebrate our homecoming,'' Mr. Smith said. ''The first Sunday in June, members of our tribe come back to the church for a sharing of our joys.'' It will be a special homecoming for the 38-year-old pastor. He was raised on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation, but spent much of his adult life away from it, having served in the church's Indian ministries in the Southwest. Now, having returned to his roots, he takes pride in the Shinnecock Indian Reservation's reputation as the oldest self-governing reservation in this country. ''I'm most proud that in spite of what's gone on around us, we've managed to maintain our land base for 350 years, drawing upon the strength of our elders,'' he said. ''And we continue to go on, in spite of external pressures to exploit our natural resources.'' AWAITING THE YO-YO'S RETURN ''Once this thing snowballs, there'll be no stopping it,'' predicted Tom Parks of West Babylon. Mr. Parks is betting that a yo-yo rebirth may soon begin. And for the 50-year-old guidance counselor at Ames Junior High School in Massapequa, renewed interest in the yo-yo is good news, because he is billed as ''the yo-yo champion of the world.'' He demonstrates yo-yos at ''Kiwanis functions, Cub Scout meetings, libraries, Modell's, Genovese Drug Stores, Grossinger's, just about anywhere,'' he said. When most of us were taking piano lessons, Tom Parks was taking yo-yo lessons. ''Twice a week,'' he said. The lessons paid off. ''By 14, I had won all the contests,'' he said. He kept on yo-yoing all through college and through 28 years as a teacher and guidance counselor. Duncan, a major manufacturer of yo-yos, has hired him part time to demonstrate his ''Loop-de-Loop'' and ''Reach for the Moon'' - done at the same time with a yo-yo in each hand. He has appeared on the Johnny Carson and Regis Philbin shows, even ''What's My Line?'' Recently he was asked to hire 10 additional yo-yo demonstrators for Duncan's new push to renew the yo-yo's popularity. ''I put an ad in the paper,'' he said. ''Just about anyone who was willing to work, I hired.'' Demonstrating yo-yos is a necessity, because ''you can't just play with a yo-yo,'' he said. ''A yo-yo requires work and instruction.'' The new yo-yo demonstrators will soon be ''walking the dog'' in retail outlets throughout the metropolitan area. Then it's only a matter of time before yo-yos are again the ''in'' toy, Mr. Parks predicted. ''There's no limit to what you can do with a yo-yo,'' he said. AN UNLIKELY CRITIC The thief may have known something we didn't. When several celebrity auction items were stolen from a closet at WLIW-TV/Channel 21 two months ago, an autographed Joan Rivers record album was left behind. Now that Ms. Rivers no longer has a late-night talk show, it will be interesting to see if WLIW's audience shares the thief's opinion of the album. The comedy disk and other celebrity memorabilia will be offered this week in WLIW's ''Great TV Auction'' - a live two-part program that serves as the station's major fund-raising effort. Tonight is the final evening of ''Gallery 21,'' the art and antiques segment of the Long Island public television station's auction. Paintings, jewelry and a stamp collection valued at $12,000 will be on the block, according to Carole Volkman, WLIW's spokesman. The new merchandise and services segment will air Wednesday through Sunday starting at 7 P.M. Trips, astrology readings, computers, appliances and a ''pasta package from Ronzoni'' will be offered, Ms. Volkman said, as well as the celebrity items including the Rivers album. Ms. Volkman predicts a good price for the recording. ''Joan Rivers is an institution in the history of comedy,'' she said. ''Anything she autographs is an invaluable treasure.'' CENSURING THE CENSORS ''Censorship is not limited to reactionary or conservative areas,'' said Donald Parker of Port Washington. ''It can happen in any community, even where educational levels are very high like on Long Island.'' To prove his point, Mr. Parker, a coordinator of the Long Island Coalition Against Censorship, listed nine examples of censorship that have occurred in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The incidents are all part of a traveling censorship exhibition that the coalition has put together in honor of the bicentennial of the Constitution. The project has started a tour of local libraries. Two identical exhibitions - one for Nassau, one for Suffolk - can be viewed at either the Great Neck or Smithtown libraries in June and Hicksville or Port Jefferson in July. From the 1960's bundling book controversy in Levittown through the Island Trees book ban to the dispute last year over a Planned Parenthood ad in the Nassau County teen-age newspaper Teen to Teen, censorship incidents on Long Island cover a wide range of issues, Mr. Parker said. Examples from the national scene are also included. The exhibition is just one of the activities of the coalition, which is made up of 15 local education and community groups, Mr. Parker said. ''We serve as a watchdog for Long Island,'' he said. ''We should all be continually concerned about censorship.'' EYEING ARCHITECTURE Gay Wagner, the director of the Huntington Historical Society, doesn't mince words. ''Ninety percent of the American adult population is 10 years old in terms of their architectural knowledge,'' she said recently. Try defining terms like ''elevation of the facade'' and Greek Revival and Italianate styles, and you'll probably agree she's right. But help is on the way, at least for Huntington residents. Citibank has joined with the Huntington Historical Society to produce a new booklet called ''Street Sleuths! Learning to Look at Buildings.'' With photographs and an illustrated map, the book uses games, scavenger hunts and a walking tour to help the reader identify historic buildings in Huntington. It's primarily geared toward schoolchildren, according to Roberta Grower of Citibank, but, as Ms. Wagner said, ''The study of architecture has been generally neglected for all of us, so everyone is starting out at the school-age level.'' ''Street Sleuths'' is available free at the Historical Society or at Citibank's Main Street branch in Huntington. Since the book came out only last month, it's too early to tell if it's catching on, Ms. Wagner said. But she added, ''We'll know it's a hit if we see people walking up and down Main Street looking at buildings with the book in their hands.''

1363-> STREET FASHION; STILL ON THE SCENE, THE LONG SKIRT
SHORTER skirts might be making a heralded comeback, but they have a long way to go before they dominate the fashion scene. Evidence of this can be found in the long skirts that still seem to be almost everywhere you look. A lot of women are reluctant to let them go, even on warmer days. Maybe that's not so surprising. There is something very cool - and cool looking - about a billowy cotton skirt that reaches to midcalf or the ankles. Women who live in hot climates have always known this. Aside from their practicality and graceful line, however, the preponderance of long skirts signifies that, in the fashion world, a healthy freedom of choice abounds. Once upon a time, a hot new trend tended to be overwhelming. Remember the 60's, when any skirt that couldn't be shortened to well above the knee was relegated to the trash heap? These days, such a skirt is still worn - unshortened, and without the slightest suggestion of being out of step.

1364-> One Author Is Rankling Two Chinas
Bo Yang is a mild-mannered, bespectacled scholar who scribbles Chinese characters on notebooks in his small study, and infuriates people throughout the Chinese-speaking world. Taiwan once labeled Mr. Bo a Communist agent, and imprisoned him for nine years. On the Chinese mainland, the authorities this year banned his books and condemned him for insulting the Chinese people. And in Chinatowns in the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, Mr. Bo's acid pen has earned him bitter criticism as well as adulation. Mr. Bo is a Chinese Voltaire, a social critic who is prolific, biting, and read. A stocky 68-year-old man with thick glasses and a bump below his knee where Taiwanese interrogators broke his leg to elicit a confession, Mr. Bo is best known for his scathing criticisms of his own people and culture. ''The Chinese people continue to grow increasingly base and despicable,'' Mr. Bo writes in a notable essay, ''The Ugly Chinaman,'' that was first published nearly three years ago. He complains that Chinese people are too conformist, too loud, too cruel, too crass, and, above all, too willing to tolerate injustice. 'A State of Ugliness' ''How is it possible for such a great people and great nation to have degenerated to such a state of ugliness?'' Mr. Bo writes elsewhere in the essay. ''Not only have we been bullied around by foreigners; even worse, for centuries we've been bullied around by our own kind - from tyrannical emperors to despotic officials and ruthless mobs.'' Such vitriol is finding a larger audience. Mr. Bo says that some 120,000 copies of ''The Ugly Chinaman'' have been sold in Taiwan, and at least five editions were published in China in 1986 before Beijing banned the essay this year during the nationwide crackdown on intellectuals. There have been two translations into English, and the Chinese version has been published in periodicals in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, New York and other cities. ''Bo Yang's name is well known on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, in America and in Southeast Asia,'' said T. K. Tong, chairman of the Department of Asian Studies at the City College of New York. ''I'd say he is the leading writer in Chinese literature today.'' Dai Tien, a literary editor and newspaper columnist in Hong Kong, said that what sets Mr. Bo apart is his criticism of Chinese culture. ''Traditionally, Chinese writers have always written nice things about their own people,'' Mr. Dai said. New Book Completed Now Bo Yang has just completed a new book, to be published in October, that expands on the theme of ''The Ugly Chinaman.'' The main essay in the book was published in September in Hong Kong and Los Angeles, and is attracting considerable attention. The essay focuses on the reason why Mr. Bo continues to drum away at what he regards as the shortcomings of the Chinese people. Only when the Chinese acknowledge the flaws, he believes, will they be liberated of them. The latest essay, a blend of history and fiction, is nominally about the brutal destruction of a town by a Chinese warlord 1,200 years ago. As the warlord and his soldiers slaughter the townspeople, the local queen utters a terrible curse on the Chinese people: they will be weak and disunited and suffer constant tragedy. When the warlord asks when the curse will end, the queen answers, ''The curse will never be lifted, unless the Chinese people wake up to the fact that they have been cursed.'' Bo Yang, sipping tea in the living room of his spacious apartment in a Taipei suburb, explained: ''I want to make people think about why we are so weak. We have to wake up to it.'' If his writing style is bold and contentious, Mr. Bo seems quiet, almost diffident, in conversation. He works in a study overlooking the green hills outside of Taipei, his desk crammed with books and papers and unfinished articles. Surrounding the desk are shelves groaning with books, including about 55 volumes of fiction, essays and history that he has written himself. The shelves also accommodate the poetry published by his wife, Jeanette Chang Shiang-hua. Novels Attack Communism Born in Kaifeng, China, as Guo Yidong, the author is today known mostly by the pseudonym Bo Yang. He came to Taiwan after the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, and in the 1950's he wrote many novels attacking Communism. In the 1960's he began attacking the Nationalist Government on Taiwan, and in 1968 he was arrested and accused of being a Communist agent. The prosecutor demanded the death penalty, but he was released after serving nine years and 26 days in prison. ''In prison a day is like a thousand years,'' Mr. Bo wrote in one of the many poems drafted during his imprisonment. He also wrote several history books while incarcerated, and he says that it was during this time that he concluded that there was no moral difference between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan. A common Chinese culture, based on Confucianism and spiced with cruelty and intolerance, afflicts both Taiwan and the mainland, he says. It is changing, he concedes, but too slowly. ''I have discovered that God has predestined people like me to go to jail, whether the jail be in Taiwan or on the Chinese mainland,'' he writes in ''The Ugly Chinaman.'' ''Why does speaking the truth lead to such unfortunate consequences? My answer is that this is not a problem of any particular individual, but of Chinese culture as a whole.''

1368-> TRIAL OF A MARINE IN SPY CASE OPENS
The trial of Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree on charges of spying for the Soviet Union opened at the Marine Corps base here today with his lawyers seeking to portray him as a persecuted American Indian. One lawyer, Michael F. Stuhff, questioned the military judge, Capt. Philip F. Roberts of the Navy, about whether he was prejudiced against Indians. Captain Roberts, who was brought up in South Dakota, which has a large Indian population, denied any prejudice. In addition, members of Sergeant Lonetree's family sat in the courtroom holding eagle feathers and later asserted they thought the trial would be unfair. They were supported by six Indians who chanted a prayer to the beat of a drum beneath the headquarters flagpole. Sergeant Lonetree, once a guard at the United States Embassy in Moscow, faces 13 charges of espionage, disclosing the identity of American intelligence agents and disobeying regulations by consorting with a Russian woman believed to be an intelligence agent. No Formal Plea Entered Sergeant Lonetree did not enter a formal plea as the proceedings were concerned with motions. Earlier, he admitted having an affair with the Russian woman but told The Record-Eagle, a newspaper in Traverse City, Mich.: ''They're making a mountain out of an anthill.'' If convicted on all counts, the maximum sentence he could receive would be confinement for life, forfeiture of pay, reduction to the lowest grade and a dishonorable discharge. Charges that he let Soviet agents into the embassy have been dropped for lack of evidence. Most of the proceedings in a small courtroom were behind closed doors as the military judge, the Marine Corps lawyers and the defense lawyers debated how sensitive information and testimony from officials of intelligence agencies would be handled. Sergeant Lonetree is among five marines who have been charged with a variety of offenses while serving in Moscow. The episode has caused consternation within the Marine Corps, a close brotherhood that takes great pride in its reputation. Variety of Proceedings Among the four other marines, charges against Cpl. Arnold Bracy were dropped in June. Purported espionage by Sgt. John Weirick could not be prosecuted because it was beyond the statute of limitations. Cpl. Robert William's pretrial hearing on charges of perjury has been scheduled for July 27. Sgt. Robert S. Stufflebeam is scheduled to face a general court-martial in September. Some Administration and intelligence officials have been quoted as saying the marines caused a considerable loss of secrets. But the case appears to have been riven with discrepancies and inept inquiry by the Naval Investigative Service. The Marine Corps is part of the Navy Department. In the opening phase of today's trial, news reporters were excluded from the courtroom because, Marine Corps spokesmen said, it was too small to accommodate them. The brief proceedings that were open for coverage were piped to a nearby room on closed circuit television. In his questioning of the military judge, Mr. Stuhff asked Captain Roberts whether he had known many Indians while growing up in South Dakota. The judge, who said he had heard 4,000 cases over the last 10 years, said he could only ''vaguely recall'' having known Indians and had not formed lasting friendships with them. Chooses Trial by Panel The judge then explained to Sergeant Lonetree that, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he could choose to be tried by a judge alone or before a panel of 5 to 10 members that could include enlisted marines. Sergeant Lonetree chose to be tried by a panel made up only of officers. After that, the trial was closed and remained closed until the session ended late this afternoon. At noon, Sergeant Lonetree's mother, father, aunt and grandmother appeared before a bank of television cameras and reporters. His aunt, Mae Benally Washington, said they were holding feathers because the eagle was ''sacred'' and would do anything to protect itself. The sergeant's father, Spencer G. Lonetree, said the evidence against his son was ''fabricated'' and ''hearsay'' from anonymous accusers. Mr. Lonetree said he blamed the State Department for failing to screen Soviet intelligence agents hired by the embassy. William M. Kunstler, Sergeant Lonetree's other civilian lawyer, asserted that the charges against the sergeant were ''pure junk.'' He said he had made an ''impassioned plea'' that the trial be open so that the American people could see that the charges were unfounded.

1369-> How House Candidates Become Shoo-Ins
To the Editor: Your June 15 news article on the steadily diminishing number of politically contestable Congressional districts documents the phenomenon quite well but fails to mention the single most important reason for the decline in competitiveness over the last quarter century: gerrymandering. Prior to the early '60s, the dominant party in each state was free to establish Congressional districts with widely varying populations. By doing so, that party was able to secure very significant electoral advantages for itself. It could stack the deck in such a way that it could win a majority of a state's Congressional seats even when the opposition party won a majority of the votes. But the Supreme Court's ''one person, one vote'' decisions of 1962-1964 declared such manipulation of district populations unconstitutional. In the ensuing years, political leaders seeking to perpetuate their power resorted instead to gerrymandering: a different device used to accomplish the same goal. District boundary lines were drawn in such a way that even in districts of equal population partisan advantage could be maintained. In many states (New York included), the last few decades have also seen the rise of bipartisan gerrymandering, under which the leaders of both parties cooperate and draw district lines in a way designed to ensure the re-election of as many incumbents as possible. Gerrymandering, whether of the one-party or the bipartisan variety, results in the establishment of large numbers of districts where one party or the other is assured of victory. Uncertainty cannot be tolerated. It is this practice which more than anything else is responsible for the disappearance of so many ''swing'' districts. (Your story correctly notes that there has been no comparable decline in the number of closely contested Senate races. The reason is that there is no way to gerrymander state boundaries.) A Supreme Court decision last year took up the issue of gerrymandering and implied that use of this practice in too outrageous a manner could be construed to be a violation of constitutional guarantees, but the ruling left too many loose ends to be considered definitive. Nevertheless, any brake on the use of gerrymandering will surely lead to a reversal of the trend your article noted, and a welcome increase in the number of districts in which the outcome is truly decided by the voters rather than the political leaders.

Purdue, 19-3 over all and 10-2 in the conference, held on to second place in the Big Ten. Iowa (21-3, 8-3) had beaten Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind., by 70-67 on Jan. 19. The Boilermakers, who never trailed, took their biggest lead at 74-63 with 1 minute 34 seconds to play as Iowa's Gerry Wright was called for goaltending. Troy Lewis had 18 points for Purdue, 15 in the first half, as the Boilermakers took a 39-35 lead. Brad Lohaus and Jeff Moe, making his first start of the season, led Iowa with 14 points each. Roy Marble, Iowa's leading scorer, averaging 14.1 points a game, had 11 before fouling out with 4:20 to play. Illinois 79, Minnesota 67 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Ken Norman scored 26 points, Steve Bardo added 16 and the two sparked an 11-1 run to start the second half to lead Illinois in Big Ten play.

But the Illini pulled away in the second half behind Norman's 15 points, sending the Gophers (9-12, 2-9) to their ninth straight loss. Texas Christian 69, Southern Methodist 50 FORT WORTH (AP) - Carven Holcombe scored 17 points and Larry Richard added 16 to lead Texas Christian (20-4, 11-1) in Southwest Conference play. It was the Horned Frogs' 23d consecutive victory at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum. The Mustangs (12-11, 3-8), who dropped their fifth straight, led early behind the 3-point shooting of Scott Johnson. But the Horned Frogs gained control toward the end of the first half to lead by 32-24 at intermission. The Frogs hit 8 of their first 11 shots in the second half. Auburn 59, Mississippi State 45 AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Jeff Moore had 16 points and Auburn (14-8, 7-6) took advantage of a 12:42 cold spell by Mississippi State. The teams stayed close through most of the first half, until Gerald White's 3-point shot put Auburn ahead to stay with 7:19 left. After Reginald Boykin hit a basket with 4:10 left in the half, Mississippi State (5-17, 1-12) did not score again until 12:42 later. Seton Hall 92, Loyola, Md. 85 WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -Seton Hall's Ramon Ramos scored a career-high 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Martin Salley added 18 points as the Pirates held off a late rally. The victory enabled Seton Hall (14-9) to complete a sweep of its 11 games outside the Big East Conference. The Pirates matched their victory total of last year and assured themselves of their first winning season since 1979-80. Loyola, which lost its fourth in a row, fell to 10-12. Seton Hall led by 58-41 before Loyola rallied. Loyola, whose biggest starter was the 6-5 center, Tommy Lee, rallied behind David Gately and Tom Gormley, who scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half. Loyola pulled with 74-70 on a jumper by Gormley at 6:19. With the score 82-77, Seton Hall wrapped up the victory, as John Morton scored on a drive and added two free throws with 1:58 remaining. Rutgers 82, UMass 67 PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) - Eric Riggins, a senior forward, scored a career-high 39 points for Rutgers in the Atlantic Ten victory. Riggins, who has averaged 29.1 points in his last seven games, bettered his mark of 38 points, set last week against Xavier. Rutgers (6-16, 3-10) broke the game open in the second half, expanding a 49-46 lead with 13:19 to go to 74-54 with 4:26 remaining. Riggins scored 14 of the 25 points in the run, including the final 12. Massachusetts (8-14, 4-10) was ahead at halftime, 34-33. Robert Morris 81, Wagner 66 CORAOPOLIS, Pa.

1371-> Robber With Toy Gun Is Killed by Storekeeper
A robber wielding what turned out to be a toy gun was shot to death yesterday by the 23-year-old owner of a Brooklyn grocery store, the police said. The robber, who was shot ''numerous times,'' was dead when the police arrived, according to Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. The holdup man was not immediately identified. A 17-year-old store clerk in the store was also shot but it was not clear who shot him. The clerk, Nabeed Ali, was taken to King's County Hospital where he was listed in critical condition this morning. The store's owner, whose identity was being withheld, and the clerk are immigrants from North Yemen, the police said. The robber entered the store, Joe's Grocery, at 267 Brooklyn Avenue at 5:40 P.M. He drew what turned out to be a ''toy wood and metal gun,'' according to Sergeant O'Donnell, and the owner of the store opened fire. Several guns were recovered and the police were trying to determined which was used in the shootings. No charges have been filed.

1373-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Olympians Honored
A FORMER professional heavyweight boxing champion, two swimming champions and a former Olympic coach were named yesterday to the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. Floyd Patterson, who won the Olympic middleweight title in 1952, will be inducted along with the former track and field coach, Leroy Walker, and two swimming champions, Donna de Varona and Shirley Babashoff. They will be inducted in Durham, N.C., July 16. The voting was done by members of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and members and officials of the United States Olympic Committee. De Varona won two gold medals at the 1964 Games in Tokyo. Babashoff won eight medals, two gold and six silver, at the 1972 Games in Munich and 1976 Games in Montreal. Walker coached at the 1976 Olympics.

1374-> Reagan's Pilot Discounts Peril
President Reagan was never in danger when a small airplane passed near his helicopter over the Presidential ranch near Santa Barbara, Mr. Reagan's pilot has testified. The President's pilot, Lieut. Col. Michael Glynn of the Marine Corps, testifying Monday at a license hearing for the pilot of the small plane, said he had ample warning of the plane's approach on Aug. 13 and made a gentle turn to assure the President's safety. The pilot of the small Piper Cherokee, Ralph William Myers, 32 years old, is seeking to regain his license in a hearing overseen by an administrative law judge for the National Transportation Safety Board. Mr. Myers is a private in the Army who was absent without leave from Fort Lewis, Wash., at the time of the incident. Air traffic around the mountaintop ranch is restricted during Presidential visits. ''I wasn't concerned'' at the approach of the small plane, Colonel Glynn testified. At its closest, the light plane passed 300 to 500 feet below the helicpoter and 200 to 300 feet to the east, Colonel Glynn said. The colonel said that when he saw the plane he stopped his descent toward the ranch and turned gently to the right. He said he had received or overheard four warnings about the approaching plane, three from air traffic controllers at Santa Barbara and one from a Marine helicopter escorting the President on the flight from Point Mugu Naval Air Station. ''The reason that I got a little bit aggravated was because it seemed to me that he didn't have good situational awareness,'' Colonel Glynn said of Mr. Myers. ''He didn't know where he was.'' Mr. Myers was arrested by Secret Service agents when he landed about 125 miles to the southeast at John Wayne Airport in Orange County and his pilot's license was revoked.

1375-> LITHOGRAPHS OFFER HOPE ON HART DEBT
A certain sign that the aborted Presidential campaign of Gary Hart is in financial straits is that the National Bank of Washington plans to dust off a series of 92 lithographs by the American artist Robert Rauschenberg. The artist donated the prints to the 1984 Hart campaign, and they were turned over to the bank and placed in a vault as partial collateral for a loan. The campaign still owes $556,824 to the bank, which now hopes to sell the works for $1,000 or more apiece. ''All we have left are the prints and any potential fund-raising ability that's there,'' said Kathleen Collins, general counsel for the bank. ''We hope to sell them in a commercially reasonable manner.'' The bank has turned to the Rauschenberg works because in the weeks since Mr. Hart withdrew from the 1988 Democratic Presidential contest, officials there have grown increasingly pessimistic about recovering his debt through traditional means. Creditors' Concern Grows The concerns of the bank and dozens of other creditors intensified this week when the Federal Election Commission, in a preliminary decision, ruled that Mr. Hart's Presidential campaign cannot qualify for Federal matching funds because it applied for them 10 days late. The campaign had hoped to receive $900,000 from the Government, and to apply it to both the 1984 and 1988 campaigns. With prospects for a successful appeal uncertain, Mr. Hart's advisers concede that few options remain. They have found that it is difficult to raise funds to pay off a debt, particularly for someone who is no longer a candidate. But the National Bank of Washington is in better shape than most Hart creditors, who do not have artworks to fall back on. When Mr. Hart, a former Colorado Senator, shelved his Presidential bid last month after disclosures about his relationship with a young woman, he left behind a nationwide string of unpaid bills. They were from T-shirt vendors, direct mail houses, airlines, hotels, banks and print shops. ''We got really clobbered by this one,'' said Marius Prince of Prince Lithograph Company in Fairfax, Va., which is owed $78,200 for printing fund-raising literature. ''I'm at a loss as to what eventually will happen. We feel right now that we made an involuntary contribution.'' #19% Settlement Spurned Like Mr. Prince, most of the creditors are owed money from Mr. Hart's 1984 campaign, which has a $1.3 million debt. The 1988 campaign debt is $313,000. He and others refused cash settlements from the Hart campaign last year, figuring that the party's early front-runner for 1988 could raise the resources to retire old debts. ''Last fall, we were offered a settlement of 18 or 19 cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Prince said. ''Naturally we thought we were sitting in a pretty good position because Gary Hart was the front-runner and we thought he wouldn't like some bad publicity. But that's all gone by the boards.'' Hundreds of creditors, however, accepted settlements of the 1984 campaign debts over the last two years. Donald J. Simon, a Washington lawyer for the Hart campaign, said the campaign offered settlements of 20 percent to 60 percent, with larger percentages paid when smaller debts were involved. ''Some of them simply refused to settle for anything less than 100 cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Simon said. ''They hoped they would be able to apply increasingly political pressure. Certainly, that leverage has been lost.'' While Mr. Simon said efforts would continue to try to pay off the debts, he said there was little recourse except to challenge the Federal Election Commission's decision and perhaps to solicit new contributions. The debt dogged Mr. Hart even before he announced his candidacy in April. Three months earlier, he remarked in a lecture that his potential opponents said he had an ''insurmountable debt.'' But, he emphasized, ''I am morally bound to make arrangements to pay it off.'' Other Candidates' Debts Debt is nothing new for Presidential contenders. Even Presidential campaigns from 1980 - President Carter, former Gov. John B. Connally of Texas and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts - are still reporting red ink. But with the Hart campaign, there is more money involved, and there seems to be more bitterness. Some vendors are trying to seize certificates of deposits and other Hart assets. Federal court actions to collect debts from the 1984 Hart campaign have been filed in Washington, Colorado and California by an advertisement placement service, an envelope supply company and a Democrat consultant. Several vendors said they were taking precautions as the 1988 Presidential race progresses. Elaine Murphy, vice president of a San Francisco company that develops mailing lists for fund-raising appeals, which is owned $150,000 by the Hart campaign, said she would insist without exception that campaigns pay their fees up front. ''We are angry,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''We're a bit tired of the situation. It's been since before the 1984 election that money has been owed to us.'' Angry as they are, some creditors said that filing suit would be a costly wasted effort, since the Hart campaign would not likely have the ability to pay a judgement. A few have suggested a milder approach, such as bumper stickers that read: ''Honk If Hart Owes You Money.''

1376-> WASHINGTON TALK: POLITICIANS ABROAD; You Haven't Been Anywhere if Not to Managua
As the Boeing 727 taxied down the runway at Dulles Airport, a flight attendant greeted the passengers over the public address system. ''Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you aboard Mision Libertad,'' she said cheerily. ''Our first stop will be Guatemala City. It is a Federal regulation that all carry-on luggage fit under the seat in front of you.'' The passengers, including Representatives Jack F. Kemp, Republican of New York, and Beau Boulter, Republican of Texas, and more than 50 leaders of conservative research groups, lobbies and publications were only the latest - although by far the largest - delegation to make Central America the Governmental destination of choice this summer. At the same time Mr. Kemp's group was visiting Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica last week, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, was dropping in on Nicaragua. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate's Republican leader, led another Central American ''codel'' (Washington shorthand for Congressional delegation) at the end of August. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, chairman of the new Central American Negotiations Observer group, is planning a fly-in within the next few weeks. And Mayor Koch of New York will be leading an independent observer group to Nicaragua in November. The 'In' Place to Go ''It is kind of the 'in' place to go just now, isn't it?'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, has joined more than a few codels. ''If you're a leftist, you go to see how the cute kids in Nicaragua's schools are learning to count hand grenades,'' he said. ''And if you're on the right, you go to find out that the contras are really nice folks after all.'' Central America is by no means the first spot on the map to become a political mecca. In the 1950's politicians who aspired to be statesmen absolutely had to set foot in West Berlin. A decade later, the trip to make was a ''fact-finding'' mission to Vietnam. ''In the late 1970's over two thirds of the House went to Egypt,'' noted Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a frequent Congressional flier. More recently, Ethiopia and its famine became such a strong magnet for legislators that American Embassy officilas in Addis Ababa occasionally grumbled about spending their time as tour guides. Far-away places have always held allure for those running for office. Presidential candidates regularly visit the ''3-I League'' of Ireland, Israel and Italy, thereby touching base with the ethnic groups most vital for electoral success. For the 1988 campaign, Central America stands to become a new division in this league. ''The nice thing about Central America compared to those other places is that it's so convenient,'' said Eddie Mahe, a Washington-based campaign consultant. ''Just an hour and a half from Miami and you've got a neat little war and guaranteed press coverage.'' Whether voters now feel so strongly about the region that they would reject a candidate who didn't know his way around downtown Tegucigalpa is uncertain. But the serious contenders are all expected eventually to head south and campaign at least briefly in what is being called the ''Central American primary.'' ''If you're on the campaign trail these days,'' said Senator Dodd, ''you almost have to be able to say, 'And I told Danny Ortega . . .,' '' a reference to the Nicaraguan leader. Proponents of Congressional travel say even those with ulterior motives can profit from a trip abroad. ''If you talk to different people - peasants, labor people, everybody - then you can learn something and have a valuable experience,'' Mr. Hyde said. Mr. Mahe added: ''I know of almost no one who ever went on a codel and came back with his opinions changed. But I still think it's better to go than not to go. There's something you get from being there that you just can't get from newspapers and television alone.'' But the slice of reality that visiting dignitaries get may be less than complete. Typically, a delegation arrives on a military or chartered plane, is met at the airport by beaming officials, waived past any gun-toting border guards or avaricious customs officials, chauffeured to elaborate meals and specially prepared hotel rooms, then returned to the airport for the presentation of souvenirs and a fond diplomatic farewell. On a trip to Angola this summer, Representatives Howard Wolpe of Michigan and Mickey Leland of Texas, both Democrats, were deeply involved in discussions about improved relations and the liberalization of that country's Marxist regime. Only later did they learn that an American reporter who had come to cover their visit had been roughly incarcerated at the airport. ''What gets me,'' said F. Andy Messing Jr., executive director of the National Defense Council, a conservative foundation, ''is these Congressmen who go down to Central America and just hold court at the hotel bar. That's no way to run a codel.'' In recent years, Mr. Messing's organization has sponsored more than a dozen Congressional visits to Central America in conjunction with the State Department. ''Anyone who goes with me meets with people on both the left and the right,'' he said. ''I take them into the outback, to civilian hospitals and refugee camps. I take them out where they can get shot.'' Back on Capitol Hill, those who have been abroad may try to use the experience to bolster their points of view. In a House debate over a bill to condemn Ethiopia's Marxist government for human rights violations, Mr. Leland repeatedly taunted his opponents by asking whether they had actually visited Ethiopia, as he had. Finally, Representative Toby Roth, Republican of Wisconsin, replied that while he had not personally been to the Horn of Africa he had spent a great deal of time discussing the situation with such people as the former Ethiopian ambassador to France and the former chief of the Ethiopian famine relief effort, both of whom had defected to the West. ''All of whom are my friends, all of whom are my friends!'' Mr. Leland shot back. The Koch Delegation Such tactics may soon be ineffective where Central America is concerned simply because it will become too difficult to find politicians to debate who have not been to the region. So what if, for example, Mr. Dodd's observer group comes to conclusions that differ sharply from Mayor Koch's observer group? ''Then the public can make its own decisions about who is right,'' the Mayor said. Although the Koch trip is being sponsored by Freedom House, a nonprofit corporation, it has been the subject of some criticism. Mr. Mahe, the political consultant, called it ''funny as a $3 bill - I didn't even realize New York had a foreign policy.'' Mr. Koch noted that in the years he spent as a Congressman he had observed political systems from Mississippi to Moscow. Besides, he said that he had been asked to head the group and that unlike most other politicians he would be going to Central America on his own time. ''I only took off four working days to have my stroke,'' he said, referring to his recent hospital stay. ''I think I've got a few days coming to me.''

1377-> RETAILERS RUSH TO THE MINISKIRT
RETAILERS' memories might be called ''longuette.'' That term was coined to describe the mid-calf (and longer) skirts that designers and retailers banked on almost exclusively in the fall of 1970. At the time, the fashion was described as the most heavily promoted in history; it was hard to find anything else. But the longuettes languished in the stores. They were ''simply not selling,'' The New York Times reported that September. Three months later, as profits soured, retailers knew they had placed a bad bet, and the longuettes became little more than a bad memory. They left a legacy, though. Fashion could no longer dictate hemlines - or anything else - to women. And while long lengths finally caught on later in the 70's, the lesson retailers learned was to stock alternatives. Maybe their memories aren't longuette enough, however. Welcome to fashion for summer, 1987. Buyers for many fashion retailers in New York, ranging from the avant-garde Charivari chain to such mainstream merchants as Macy's, have bet heavily on short, mini- and micro-miniskirts -some of them a scant 15 inches long. And so far, their put-most-of-your-eggs-in-one-basket strategy seems to be paying off. All over New York, short styles are synonymous with sellout this season. Among department stores, Macy's was a leader. In April, just after the presentations of short fall fashions in Europe, the New York collections confirmed the short trend for fall and the flagship Herald Square store opened a junior boutique called Short Cuts. ''It was a straw in the wind and we clutched at it,'' said Joan Kaner, the women's fashion director at Macy's. ''We bought short wherever it was shown. We've featured short in all our ads, and we've had sellouts on all advertised items.'' But how to get short skirts in stock fast? ''We pushed hard,'' said Terry Melville, Macy's junior fashion director. ''Some manufacturers had them. Some got them. The junior market is able to do it. Designers can't turn around as fast. They have an image and a concept for a season.'' A handful of designer lines did show some short lengths for spring and summer. Among them: Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and David Cameron in the United States, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Lolita Lempicka and Claude Montana in Paris, Byblos in Milan and Workers for Freedom in London. Some moderate-price manufacturers were ready to move fast, too. The Expo label, for example, was cited by several retailers for having one of the season's hottest dresses. Its striped, off-the-shoulder cotton minidress has been a sellout all over town at prices from $52 to $60 ''Our business is doubling,'' said David Mercer, Expo's president. ''Right now we're booking about 40 percent of our business on short.'' He added that Bloomingdale's and Saks are predicting 50 percent of their business will be short, while stores in the Middle West are predicting 15 percent. ''Buyers don't usually react unless they see things pointing in a direction,'' Mr. Mercer continued. ''I would say the jump is due to expectations. There hasn't been that much performance at retail to go by.'' Expo initiated its current line of short skirts and dresses before the fall collections. ''Very little was bought before March,'' Mr. Mercer said, but there was a major jump in orders after the collections, followed by a batch of reorders. Reorders are impossible for designers who work with costly, limited-edition fabrics, because they usually cannot get more material. But moderate-price houses like Expo depend on reorders and, partly for that reason, work with denim, twill, cotton sheeting and other basic goods. ''We usually buy fabrics we can get more of,'' Mr. Mercer said. ''We base a lot of our business on reorders.'' It was mainly educated intuition that led Expo to be quick off the mark with short skirts. ''Fashion has a tendency to run in seven-year cycles,'' Mr. Mercer said. ''It's been 21 years since short skirts were last in. It seemed like the right time.'' Granted that, why would a store -or even a junior department - still risk an across-the-board commitment as Macy's has done? For one thing, there were signals from abroad that fashion consumers had gone head over heels for short. ''In London and on the Left Bank in Paris, stores that once sold jeans were selling short skirts,'' Ms. Melville said. Besides, she added, ''We've had long skirts for two or three years. We desperately needed something new. It's the nature of our business.'' Even among conservative retailers, hems are rising. ''We all gasped when we first saw them,'' said David Baron, the visual presentation director of Park Avenue-based Martha. ''Now we're showing everything short.'' But at Lord & Taylor one recent afternoon, though the window-dresser wore short, the mannequins were still wearing long. BUT it is too soon for retailers to rest easy. Although strong summer sales have been encouraging, the risks of stocking all minis are far from over. For fashion tensions are rising along with hemlines. Erma Bombeck, in her widely read column, ''At Wit's End,'' voiced the feelings of many women in expressing dismay over the resurgence of the mini. In fact, some women are saying they want no part of the trend: ''I spent years letting my hems go up and down,'' complained a shopper in Bergdorf Goodman recently. ''Never again.'' But a competing cry is being heard. Many customers are demanding shorter lengths - from knee level to, as one woman recently put it, the ''pardon my vulgarity'' level. Stores are anxious to serve, at any length. ''We've always sold a wardrobe of skirt lengths'' and still will, said Kalman Ruttenstein, executive vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's. Gene Pressman, an executive vice president of Barneys New York, said its youth-oriented Co/Op annex is ''fully committed'' to short - but added that ''the rest of the store is mixed.'' ''Retailers don't have to be as committed as designers because we have alteration rooms,'' he continued. ''We can make them any length we want.'' This will be good news to the legions of women who prefer not to show their thighs off the beach. They will also be relieved to learn that most designers are hedging their bets by shipping skirts to stores in longer lengths than they showed in their runway presentations. Diehards who want no part of the mini tidal wave can turn to Giorgio Armani, the only major designer in any country who continued to show sweeping hemlines for fall. Bergdorf Goodman made what its president, Dawn Mello, termed a major commitment to buying Mr. Armani's long skirts. ''We have a customer who wants them,'' she said. Though the store is buying more short than long, short in Bergdorf Goodman's case will be mid-knee. ''Press photos are exaggerated, because designers want to make exaggerated statements,'' Ms. Mello said. But according to the major department store chains, sales are saying that short is what women want now. As far back as last October, Mr. Ruttenstein recalled, Bloomingdale's ran an advertisement for an exclusive group of very short dresses by Willi Smith that were also shown in the windows of the flagship store. ''They sold out,'' Mr. Ruttenstein said. ''We even sold the window samples.'' This is not an isolated report. Short skirts have also been sellouts at Saks and Bonwit Teller. There is, of course, the chance of overcommitment to short. Some have suggested that trousers - almost entirely absent from fall fashion collections - will regain popularity. ''I had a moment of doubt and thought 'pants,' '' Mr. Ruttenstein said. ''But now I think I was wrong.'' Fashion industry mavens are predicting the success of short skirts will spark plenty of other opportunities to keep the cash registers ringing. ''Because of short skirts, customers must update what they own,'' said Bernard Ozer, a vice president of the Associated Merchandising Corporation, which advises department stores around the world on buying decisions. ''The proportion has changed. Shorter and shapelier skirts mean shorter jackets, big business for shoe and hosiery manufacturers, new blouses, new camisole or turtleneck underlayers.'' Come cold weather, long coats and fuzzy tights are also expected to do well. Mr. Ozer is convinced that short skirts will be more than a flash in the pan. ''We're on to a hot number,'' he said. ''I would say this is the start of a five- or six-year cycle.'' By next year, he contended, ''No one will discuss short. It will just be there.''

Four green-uniformed Chinese policemen swaggered into a small restaurant on Xinfu Road, drank tea and left without paying. The restaurant owner, a Tibetan, shrugged. ''There is nothing we can do,'' he said. ''The police never pay. Who would we complain to?'' Hatred of the Chinese still courses through this arid land. In towns and villages, monasteries and marketplaces, Tibetans harbor a loathing of the Government and the Chinese who are settling here. ''People are afraid of the Chinese,'' said a 22-year-old man who runs a small shop in the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa. ''Remember what they did to us.'' It is the memory of two decades of killing and destruction inflicted by the Chinese that gives passion to Tibetan attitudes. In the 20 years after a futile uprising in 1959, the Chinese destroyed monasteries, temples, even whole villages. Tens of thousands of Tibetans were imprisoned, and thousands were executed. Chinese Influx Resented Since 1979, the Chinese authorities have sought to repair some of the damage. Several major monasteries that were reduced to rubble are being rebuilt. Beijing has injected funds into Tibet for roads and hydroelectric projects. But with the governmental largesse have also come more Chinese, whose imposed presence the Tibetans find oppressive. The Chinese are sent here to run the government, work on construction projects and serve in the many army units. A former member of the Tibetan nobility whose family was jailed and scattered during the post-rebellion decades said the Chinese, who are ethnic Hans, now form the majority in Lhasa, a city of fewer than 200,000 people. ''I think the Chinese are 60 percent now,'' he said. ''You can tell the Chinese apart. They don't look like us. They don't speak our language. They don't even try.'' Tibetans interviewed over a two-week period without any supervision by Government officials often voiced emotional denunciations of the Chinese and their policies. Separate Residential Areas Lhasa has only a small core of traditional Tibetan whitewashed buildings clustered below the soaring Potala Palace, the former residence of the Dalai Lama. Around this core, centered on the Jokhang Temple, ring upon ring of stolid cement-block apartment buildings for the Chinese spread out along the Kyi Chu River and toward the nearby mountains. Though Tibet has been designated an autonomous region, it remains tightly controlled by Beijing, which appoints the region's senior government and party officials. Tibet, with about two million people, remains one of the poorest areas of China, with a per capita income of about $80, less than half the national average. According to official statistics, 52.8 percent of the people cannot read, although Tibetans say the figure is closer to 80 percent. Government Improvements There has been obvious improvement in some urban amenities in the last several years, including the installation of a citywide drinking water system in Lhasa. Officials say that over the last seven years $16.2 million has been allocated to help the poor, although it is not clear where or how the money was spent. Chinese officials extol Beijing's accomplishments in improving the life of Tibetans. In a speech this year, Deputy Prime Minister Wan Li praised the Government's policies of reducing taxes for Tibetans, granting farmers and herders more say in how they work and choosing Tibetans for some official posts. But power still rests with the Chinese. Wu Jinghua, who as Tibet's Communist Party secretary is the most powerful man in the region, is Chinese and does not speak Tibetan. The Contempt Is Mutual Many Chinese officials regard Tibet as a place of exile. In turn, most Tibetans appear to consider China little more than an occupying power. In Tibet, people beg for pictures of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet who lives in exile in Dharmsala, India. Never mentioned is the Panchen Lama, the second-highest leader in Tibetan Buddhism, who lives in Beijing and supports the Government's policies. Some Tibetans try to ignore the Chinese. In the Chago Valley south of Lhasa, a 68-year-old nomad woman named Choden sat inside her tent, woven from chocolate-brown yak wool. Her husband and two sons, she said, were in the mountains watching their 70 yaks. Mrs. Choden said that despite the Chinese authorities, her family of nomadic herders maintained the ways of their parents. ''In the spring, we leave the village with the yaks and go into the mountains,'' she said. ''We read the scriptures and watch the sky. We ask the monks what is a good day, and then we come here. My husband learned this from his father. From older times we learned how to read the sky.'' Yaks Were Collectivized After 1959, the Chinese instituted a system of communes and collective ownership of yaks. Still, Mrs. Choden said, it was almost impossible for the Chinese to control them and their herds, because her family and other nomads wandered the mountains by themselves. ''Before 1949 we were independent,'' she said. ''It was very good. We were free to go where we wanted. When I was younger, there were big festivals in Lhasa, and I used to go sometimes. Now the Chinese stop us from going where we want. They don't want nomad people in Lhasa.''

1379-> United Iran-Contra Report Expected From the 2 Panels
With the Iran-contra hearings nearing a conclusion, the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate select committee said today that they expected the Senate and House committees to be able to present a united report this fall with a statement of facts that is acceptable to all members. ''We're never going to have all the pieces,'' said the chairman, Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, ''but we've got enough pieces to present a pretty complete picture of what happened. ''We will know the story, the major facts,'' said Warren B. Rudman, the vice chairman. ''I've never tried a major case that went to the jury where there weren't conflicts and missing pieces.'' Senator Rudman, a Republican, is a former prosecutor and Attorney General of New Hampshire. Mr. Inouye and Mr. Rudman were interviewed over breakfast in the Capitol with reporters and editors of The New York Times. Committees Recess for Day After two dramatic weeks of testimony from the principal witnesses, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North and Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, the committees were in recess today. On Thursday and Friday, they will hear testimony from Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Then, the panels will complete the hearings with testimony over the next two weeks from Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Donald T. Regan, the former White House chief of staff. The two Senators said they and the other members of the committees would take an active role in preparing the final report and would not, as many Congressional panels do, leave the conclusions to the staff. Where some conflicts between different witnesses' testimony cannot be resolved, they said, they will present the discrepancies and allow readers to draw their own conclusions. The individual members of the panels will have the opportunity to file separate statements if they disagree with or wish to elaborate on the consensus findings. A Wish for Smaller Panels Senator Inouye said he had no real regrets over how the hearings and investigation had been conducted. But he said that if he had known from the beginning that the Senate and House committees would hold the hearings jointly, he would have insisted on smaller panels. With 11 senators and 15 representatives wanting to question witnesses, the sessions have lasted longer and been more repetitive than would have been the case with fewer members. On the other hand, Senator Inouye said, ''it would have been a disaster'' if the panels had held separate hearings. Senator Rudman said he was sorry that Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter had not earlier been granted immunity from prosecution based on their Congressional testimony and had not been required to testify last spring. The committees withheld granting the witnesses immunity at the request of the independent counsel, Lawrence E. Walsh. Senator Rudman said he believed the interest of the country in getting the facts quickly should have outweighed Mr. Walsh's need to gather evidence for possible prosecution. The committees did not grant the colonel and the admiral immunity so they could testify in public until this month. The two men can still be prosecuted on the basis of evidence obtained independently from their testimony. Senator Inouye said the long-term lesson he thought should be learned from the testimony was that Presidents stand to gain much more than they stand to lose by working with Congress. In this case, he said, if leaders of the Congressional intelligence committees had been informed in advance about the Iran arms sales, they could have dissuaded President Reagan from proceeding and saved him from serious political embarrassment. Senator Rudman agreed with that assessment and added that the Iran-contra affair illustrated the folly of advocating one policy in public and conducting another one in private. Legislation Suggested One of the goals of the committees is to suggest new procedures to lessen the chances of repeating the mistakes of the Iran-contra affair. With that in mind, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, today suggested legislation that would require more precise and timely notification of Congress regarding covert operations conducted by Government agencies, including the National Security Council. The committees have tentatively decided not to call several people whose testimony they had expected to take in public. Among them are Robert M. Gates, deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Michael A. Ledeen, formerly a National Security Council consultant who helped with the original negotiations that led to the arms sales to Iran. Both men were questioned in private, and depositions from those sessions are to be made public soon. But staff assistants said the committees had decided not to call them and several others for public testimony because they had no further questions that were not covered in the depositions.

1380-> Police Have Suspect in Witness's Killing
A teen-age friend of a youth charged in a shootout at a Queens livery company is a prime suspect in the murder of a witness who had testified about the incident before a grand jury, senior police officials said yesterday. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the teen-ager was charged last month with the Sept. 2 robbery of a taxi driver in South Jamaica, Queens. They said his accomplice in that robbery was Reynaud Chandler, 18 years old, who was arrested later the same day in the shootout that occurred last month after a fare dispute at the Big D Car Service nearby. Last Friday, the officials said, the teen-ager - whom they would not identify - was bailed out of jail by another man charged in the shootout, Derrick Kornegay. That Friday night, a death threat against the witness, Mildred Green, 61, was telephoned to Big D, where she worked as a dispatcher. Early Sunday, Ms. Green was slain by a shotgun blast to the head as she worked alone. 'We Want to Talk to Him Again' ''We want to talk seriously to this third guy,'' one senior official said of the youth who was bailed out of jail. ''We've talked to him and now we want to talk to him again.'' The report yesterday was the latest twist in a case that law-enforcement officials say epitomizes the public's worst fears about what can happen to crime witnesses who cooperate with the authorities. The officials also said their investigation had revealed these developments: * Ms. Green was seen entering a grand jury room to testify Thursday by a lawyer for Mr. Chandler, who informed his client. They said such conduct by the lawyer was not improper, but there was apparently a security lapse in the courthouse. * A detective at the 113th Precinct, who took an anonymous call from Ms. Green's supervisor Friday night telling of the death threat, tried to call the supervisor back for more information. But the supervisor was not there and did not return the call. * Mr. Kornegay was expected to surrender last night to face charges for participating in the shootout with Mr. Chandler and two Big D cab drivers that followed a $5 fare dispute. The officials said Mr. Kornegay was not now a suspect in Ms. Green's death. The police have described both Mr. Chandler and Mr. Kornegay as drug dealers, and they said the third youth was also. That youth was charged, along with Mr. Chandler, with stealing $100 from a cabdriver on the morning of the shootout at the Big D office. Officials said the third youth was arrested Sept. 26, after the cabbie he is charged with robbing spotted him on the street and notified a passing police officer. He was bailed out on Friday by Mr. Kornegay, they said. Since Ms. Green's body was found in the Big D office at 150-01 Linden Boulevard in South Jamaica, the police and the Queens District Attorney's office have had to contend not only with solving her murder, but also with determining whether any lapses by the authorities contributed to her death. Unaware of Threat A spokesman for the District Attorney's office, Richard Piperno, repeated yesterday that the office had never been told of any death threat against Ms. Green. Asked how a lawyer for Mr. Chandler had been able to see Ms. Green go into the grand jury room to testify, Mr. Piperno said that ''the security of the grand jury area belongs to the courts,'' and referred questions to the Office of Court Administration. A spokesman for the courts, Mary de Bourbon, said ''the security for a district attorney's witness before the grand jury is the responsibility of the district attorney.'' She said that in the Queens courts, witnesses waiting to testify before a grand jury are seated in a room controlled by the prosecutor's office. ''Court officers maintain general security in corridors, and upon request, the courts can and do provide extra security for grand jury witnesses, but it is the resposibility of the D.A. to request extra security,'' Ms. de Bourbon said. She said no such request was received in this case. Effort by Detective Meanwhile, the police said they were still investigating whether anyone in the department had failed to follow up adequately on the threat on Ms. Green. The threat was phoned in to the cab office about 10 P.M. Friday, before Ms. Green came on duty, the police said. The caller said Ms. Green would be killed that night. The manager on duty, whom the police would not identify, called the 113th Precinct detective squad and said a grand jury witness at the company's address had been threatened, but did not give Ms. Green's name. The detective who took the call asked the precinct patrol force to drive past the company's office, and the manager stayed there all night with Ms. Green. Elaborating on their initial account, the police disclosed yesterday that the detective had also called the company seeking the man who reported the threat, but he had left briefly and did not return the detective's call. A senior police official said yesterday that the department had not yet decided whether the detective should be faulted. ''Theoretically, he could have done some other things - check files, let a boss know, call the guy who had the original case, but none of this was done,'' the official said. The police said the threat had not been investigated further on Saturday because, just after midnight Friday, a 69-year-old retired seaman was shot to death in an apparent robbery attempt outside his home, and all the detectives in the precinct began work on that case.

1381-> TWO PORTRAITS OF SHULTZ: CHALLENGE FOR IRAN PANEL
Two contrasting pictures of Secretary of State George P. Shultz have emerged from the Iran-contra hearings. When he sits at the witness table Thursday to begin two days of testimony, the Congressional committees will try to determine which one is real. ''There are two conflicting aspects of this,'' said Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, vice chairman of the Senate committee, referring to roles Mr. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger played. ''Some people say they were cut out. Others have testified they didn't really want to know. We will see.'' On the question of policy toward Iran, some testimony has portrayed Mr. Shultz as an astute Secretary of State whose warnings about the risks of selling arms to Iran sale of arms were prophetic, but ignored. By this account, Mr. Shultz forcefully argued against the arms sales and was repeatedly misled by Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser, and others, who convinced him that the covert sales had been ended. But by this account, he was surprised time and time again to find that the operation was still going on. Later, according to this version, Mr. Shultz insisted that the Administration tell the truth to Congress and insisted that American policy be set straight. But another, less flattering portrait has also emerged. Drawn in darker tones, it is a picture of a Secretary of State, who having lost the initial bureaucratic battles of a major foreign policy decision, threw up his hands and stopped trying to end the program. The Tower Commission said Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger ''simply distanced themselves from the plan,'' adding: ''They protected the record as to their own position on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the President from the consequence of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.'' Nothing 'They Didn't Want' Mr. Shultz reportedly told the commission he did not familiarize himself with some details of the covert program because he did not want to be blamed for any possible leaks. Admiral Poindexter has admitted that he kept information from Mr. Shultz, but has contended that Mr. Shultz wanted it this way. ''I didn't withhold anything from them that they didn't want withheld from them,'' he said, referring to Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger. Two very different portraits of Mr. Shultz have emerged on the issue of providing aid to the contras as well. Documents and testimony show that Mr. Shultz regarded Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North as a ''loose cannon'' and instructed Elliott Abrams, an Assistant Secretary of State, to keep a close watch on Colonel North's activities. Precisely what prompted this concern has not been disclosed, and that certainly will be explored in his testimony. But Colonel North has asserted that Mr. Shultz was aware of his efforts to help manage a network of private assistance to the contras. In his own testimony, Colonel North said Mr. Shultz thanked him in general terms at a September reception for his work on behalf of the contras. A State Department spokesman said Colonel North had distorted the meaning of Mr. Shultz's remarks; Mr. Shultz only meant to thank Colonel North for his role in keeping up the contras' morale, he added. By all accounts, Mr. Shultz strongly opposed the covert arms shipments at the beginning, asserting that proponents of the sale had exaggerated the Soviet threat to Iran and that the policy would contradict the United States anti-terrorism policy. Mr. Shultz was also skeptical of Israeli motives in seeking American support. The key question is how forcefully he pressed his objections. Mr. Shultz said he opposed the first shipment of TOW missiles from Israel to Iran when it was discussed in August 1985. he said he did not remember being informed by Robert C. McFarlane of a Presidential decison to approve the sale. But Mr. McFarlane has said Mr. Shultz was informed. Some accounts by other Administration officials support Mr. Shultz's contention that he had reason for his belief at certain times that the covert operation was not going forward. Mr. Weinberger, for example, came away from a December meeting with the impression that President Reagan had decided not to approve further shipments of Iran, according to a senior aide to Mr. Weinberger. Mr. Weinberger believed that he and Mr. Shultz ''thought they had 'strangled the baby in the cradle,' '' Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, told the Tower Commission. Weeks later, however, Mr. Reagan signed two intelligence findings authorizing the shipment of American arms to Iran. Mr. Shultz asserts that he did not know about the findings until nine months later. Mr. Shultz has also asserted that Mr. Poindexter and William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, misinformed him later about the the program's status. At the Tokyo economic summit in May 1986, Mr. Shultz says he was told the program had ended. Response From Poindexter When preparations were being made several days later for Mr. McFarlane's trip to Teheran, Colonel North urged that Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger attend a meeting with President Reagan to discuss the mission. Mr. Poindexter responded, ''I don't want a meeting with R.R., Shultz and Weinberger,'' according to a note contained in the Tower Commission notes. But there are noteworthy contradictions. Mr. Shultz told the Tower Commission he heard nothing about Iran from early July until the end of October 1986, a period in which President Reagan approved the shipment of more arms and a hostage was released. Mr. Shultz said later, ''I had no idea what was taking place.'' But a note from Colonel North to Admiral Poindexter raised questions about this account. According to the note, Mr. Casey said he informed Mr. Shultz privately of efforts by the C.I.A. to bring a relative of a senior Iranian official to the United States for talks when the Administration decided stop using Manucher Ghorbanifar as the intermediary. The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that Robert M. Oakley, then director of the State Department's office of counterterrorism, warned Mr. Shultz in a memo written June 2, 1986, that arms deals with Iran would be quite damaging to American interests. Mr. Oakley, in an interview tonight, did not deny writing the memo, and said: ''If it's out, it didn't come from me. I don't deny it.'' The Post reported that the memo is in the possession of the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair, and that Mr. Shultz had never responded to it. Mr. Oakley acknowledged that he verbally cautioned Mr. Shultz several times about the dangers of the arms-for-hostages deals. ''Shultz acknowledged that he was told about that,'' he said. ''He's never tried to deny it.''

1382-> Music: Clarinet Pieces On Mostly Mozart Bill
TUESDAY evening's Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra program at Avery Fisher Hall was pretty much business as usual - or business as usual as it used to be, before performance standards were subtly but steadily upgraded over the last couple of summers. Tuesday's concert, repeated last night, was not bad by any means. But the orchestra's performance was still a little rough and perfunctory. The chief interest lay in two pieces for the clarinet family, the clarinet having become popular in the late 18th century and attracting the special attention of performers and composers for several decades to come. To lead things off, there was a Mendelssohn ''Konzertstuck'' for clarinet, basset horn and orchestra in F minor (Op. 113). The orchestral score for this work, composed in 1833, was lost until 1910. It's one of Mendelssohn's fresher mature works, and the intertwining of the clarinet and its deeper cousin is nicely achieved. In this performance, Richard Stoltzman, the clarinetist, tended to overpower Paul Gallo, the basset hornist, but their collaboration still worked well enough. Mr. Stoltzman was the sole soloist in Weber's Clarinet Concerto No. 2 in E flat, after the intermission. Mr. Stoltzman is an interesting artist, and his flaws are nearly as interesting as his virtues. The first movement here was dispatched almost raucously, with hooting, piercing top notes and a general awkwardness of line. But Mr. Stoltzman's gifts for sinuous phrasing shone brightly in the lovely Romance, almost an operatic recitative. And he caught the darting wit of the final Alla polacca beautifully, as well. The conductor of the night was Leopold Hager, who was born in Salzburg and who has conducted frequently on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr. Hager accompanied the Mendelssohn and Weber concertos deferentially, and presided competently over the placid orchestral part in Haydn's Cello Concerto in D (H.VIIb:2). Here the soloist was Janos Starker, who played Haydn's original score (the concerto was much bowdlerized in the 19th century) and his own idiomatically appropriate cadenzas. Like Mr. Stoltzman, Mr. Starker combines true artistic individuality with some technical weaknesses - his intonation was sometimes awry on Tuesday and his phrasing slurred, and yet the veiled, intensely personal tone he drew from his instrument was always compelling. The concert ended with Mozart's Symphony No. 35 (''Haffner,'' K. 385), in a decent but undistinguished run-through.

1383-> Preliminary Trade Pact With Mexico Is Shaped
The Reagan Administration, after concluding a sweeping trade pact with Canada, is about to sign an agreement with Mexico setting up machinery for settling trade disputes and opening negotiations to curb barriers to trade and investment. The draft, which is the product of several months of secret negotiations, is already being reviewed by the Mexican Cabinet and will shortly go to President Reagan's Economic Policy Council, an Administration official said. The two Governments will probably sign the accord within 30 days, the official said, but the negotiations on reducing barriers are expected to be protracted. The Mexican agreement is more modest than the one worked out over the weekend with Canada projecting an end to tariffs and many nontariff barriers by the year 2000, but it has a similar precedent-setting character. Both pacts, reflecting sentiments expressed by President Reagan in speeches early in the decade, look forward to a period when there would be one integrated market from the Arctic to the Yucatan. Canada and the United States are already each other's biggest customers. Mexico, with three times the population of Canada, is the fourth-largest market for American exports, and the United States is by far the largest market for Mexican exports. For years the United States had sought closer trade and consultative links with Mexico but had been rebuffed by Mexico's political leadership, entrenched in policies of trade nationalism. More recently Mexican policy makers have converted to the belief that open trade is the best policy for economic growth. One sign was the addition of Mexico's signature in August 1986 to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter. Since then Mexico has reduced tariffs and dismantled other trade controls. According to experts here on Mexico, its conversion to open trade is expected to be accelerated by the new presidential standard bearer, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the Harvard-educated minister of budget and planning, who is given much of the credit for the country's recent economic turnaround. The agreement with Mexico calls for both Governments to be ready within 90 days to conduct broader trade negotiations. It identifies the areas to be discussed in these negotiations as textiles, steel, agriculture, investment matters, technology transfer, electronic products, services, patents, copyrights and other ''intellectual property.'' It also sets up the first dispute mechanisms for the two countries in trade and investment. Either nation may request consultations at any time on any matter concerning bilateral trade and investment. A cooling-off period is prescribed while working parties from both governments try to resolve disputes. In this provision the agreement falls far short of what was agreed upon in the Canadian pact, which provides for arbitration panels that will make binding decisons. Because the Mexican pact chiefly sets the framework for future talks, it does not require Congressional approval, but members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee have been following the progress of the talks. Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, has briefed members of the Finance Committee. ''The trade framework would be a useful step toward increasing trade between our two countries,'' said the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas. ''I don't have to tell you of the benefits such an increase could bring to a border state like Texas.'' Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the committee's ranking Republican, said, ''If the Mexicans are willing, I can foresee the day of North American free trade.'' He added, however, that Mexico has ''extraordinary investment protections'' that would have to change. Guy F. Erb, a Washington-based consultant with ties in Mexico, said Mexican business interests were pressing for closer relations with the United States. Mexico's Business Coordinating Council strongly supports the agreement, he said, adding that this support ''should help give life to the agreement.'' The American business community also appears to back the accord. Lawrence A. Fox, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, said a consultative arrangement of the type sought in the pact ''appears to meet the needs of the times.'' In recent years the United States has been running a trade deficit with Mexico, mainly as a result of oil purchases. In 1986 American imports from Mexico totaled $17.5 billion, while exports to Mexico were $12.4 billion. Although the Mexican and Canadian trade talks have been proceeding on separate tracks, they have been given momentum by a similar force: the fear of American protectionism. Both Mexico and Canada have worried that their markets in the United States might be cut off. And there is much in both trade agreements that represents emerging trade concerns of the United States, such as trade-distorting investment policies that it wants both Canada and Mexico to terminate.

1384-> Mexican Attacks U.S. Policy
Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda Amor of Mexico said today that the Reagan Administration's policy of aiding Nicaraguan rebels violated international law by blocking Central American peace efforts. ''Not only does it deal with a violation of international law, but it also deals with an attack on the rights and the legitimate interests of Latin American countries,'' he said at a news conference.

1386-> Los Molinos Journal; Shoppers in Spain Now Staying Mainly at the Mall
Only a few hundred yards and centuries of tradition separate the older business section in the heart of this picturesque village from a still-incomplete pink-drab shopping mall on the western edge of town. Older businesses, like the Autoservicio grocery store, are mom-and-pop operations whose ways have seemed as solidly set as stone. The owners, Angel Puga and his father, Marcelino, know all their customers, the customers' children and their children's children. All of them get credit that sometimes takes months to collect. It has been like that for generations in places like this. But when Vivodist, a chain super market and variety store, opened its doors a month ago, it made instant militants out of some normally conservative businessmen who took to the aisles to protest, loading shopping carts and blocking passages and checkout lines. The controversy in this town 48 miles north of Madrid is representative of what is happening around the country as communities like this one, as well as sections of cities of all sizes, adjust to a world of change encouraged by the Socialist Government. Customers May Go Away The owners of small shops are fearful that larger retailers will draw away their customers and eventually force them out of business. To the Pugas and others, that means a way of life will also pass away. Macroeconomics, a word about as big as this town of 2,000 that is a vacation spot for Madrid's middle class, is also involved. The Government's announced policy is that there are too many small shops in Spain that are low on productivity and high on inefficiency and costs to consumers. Two years ago, the Socialists passed a law that liberalized shopping hours, to permit large retailers to stay open late at night and on Sundays. A Commerce Ministry official said Spain had three times as many small shops per capita as other countries in the European Community and that many should close down. The Government also wants industries like shipbuilding, mining and farming to operate more efficiently, which would mean cutting costs and becoming smaller by laying off workers. The policy led to widespread unrest throughout the country for most of the first half of this year and resulted in the Socialists' suffering heavy losses in local and regional elections in June. Preference for the Shops Maria Luisa Blanco, 27 years old, said her family still prefered the shops, although, ''we'll pick up a couple things at the mall.'' ''But mom likes the way she's treated in the shops and doesn't like antiseptic big stores,'' she said. The Socialists' policy has infuriated owners of small shops, who are bitter and frustrated. Consumers, on the other hand, seem to have benefited. Thus, change has arrived, although it is difficult for many to accept, and relationships have been affected. Angel Puga said some longtime patrons had abandoned him and his father. He said business at Autoservicio was down 75 percent so far in the month since the Vivodist opened. ''People are going there because of the novelty of it,'' he said, ''but also because the big store has variety and can undersell me. People walk in to get a can of sardines and walk out with a pair of shoes.'' Complaints From Owners As chain stores like the Vivodist open outlets in central cities, suburban rings and smaller towns, complaints rise from owners of small shops. One such owner, Fernando Partida Lopez, a leader in a movement to repeal the new law on shopping hours, said small shops could not ''open all weekend because they are family run.'' He added that weekend and round-the-clock hours caused undue pressure on the family. Mr. Partida, who owns a children's sportswear store, was an organizer of the shopping-cart protest at Vivodist. He said two groups, the local Independent Small and Medium Business and the Confederation of Small and Medium Businesses of Madrid, organized a large protest against the law in Madrid in March and that more protests were planned in the fall. The Basque and Catalonian autonomous Governments have passed laws that restrict shopping hours, and the business groups are lobbying the Madrid regional government to do the same. Mr. Partida said he would like to see the Government provide low-interest loans to owners of small shops so they can learn marketing and managerial techniques and can modernize and computerize their operations. A Typical Scene Meanwhile, the shopping scene today was a typical one: there were few shoppers at the small stores, but the Vivodist counters were crowded. Javier and Margo Perez Madrid, on vacation from Madrid, said they preferred one-stop shopping ''instead of going to a lot of small stores.'' ''Besides,'' she said, ''small shops can't compete with the prices here.'' Yolando Lopez, also on vacation, said she shopped at her neighborhood stores in Madrid because of their proximity, but said prices were too high at those shops. ''This is great,'' she said. ''I'm glad to see people buying here instead of those expensive little stores.'' Mr. Partida acknowledged that prices used to be high in the small stores because Los Molinos used to attract very rich vacationers, but he says that is no longer true. The younger Mr. Puga said his prices were not high and added that he had been forced to lower them. 'Sometimes I Sell at Cost' ''The big store has forced me to lower prices and hold sales,'' he said, pointing at a sale sign for cheese at 126 pesetas, or about 80 cents. ''I'm making one peseta on that cheese sale,'' he said. ''Sometimes I have to sell at cost.'' ''I buy sugar at 124 pesetas a package and sell it for 127. They sell it for 99 pesetas. I don't see how they do it.'' His father, who worked in construction for most of his life, said he was more optimistic. ''Wait till October when things stabilize,'' he said. ''We'll see how much they charge then. The townspeople are going there now and they pay cash. Here, they have a running account and take care of the bill at the end of the month, sometimes at the end of the year. ''We have hard winters here, when the weather is bad and people have no money. We'll lose money now, but we'll recoup in the fall from our steady clientele.''

1387-> METRO DATELINES; Not Guilty Plea Made In Parkway Shooting
A retired investment banker pleaded not guilty to attempted murder yesterday in the shooting of a teen-ager after a dispute on the Hutchinson River Parkway. The defendant, Arthur Salomon, 53 years old, of Pound Ridge and Manhattan, entered his plea before Acting Justice Carmine Marasco in State Supreme Court. Last month, Mr. Salomon, the grandson of one of the founders of the Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment concern, was indicted in the shooting of Gianluca Cotugno, 19, an Iona College student from Larchmont. The authorities said he was shot once in the stomach and apparently did not provoke the attack. Mr. Salomon is accused of firing a registered .38-caliber Colt revolver at Mr. Cotugno after the defendant's 1977 red Mercedes blocked Mr. Cotugno's 1987 Honda from passing for about three miles on the southbound section of the Hutchinson River Parkway.(AP)

1389-> METRO DATELINES; Wollman Rink Pipe Suffered Minor Leak
A minor leak was found in June in the plastic pipes at the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink, the New York City Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, said yesterday. Parks Department officials had thought a second leak occurred a few weeks later, but the Canadian manufacturer that built the rink in Central Park last year for the developer Donald J. Trump said that it could not find another leak, Mr. Stern said. A report received yesterday from an engineer determined that there was not a second leak. It attributed a small loss in the rink's brine solution to evaporation caused by hot weather, Mr. Trump said. ''There is no leak,'' Mr. Trump said. ''It's in perfect condition.'' The leak in June was caused by a nail that punctured a piece of the rink's 22 miles of piping, Mr. Stern said, and it was fixed quickly by the manufacturer. Mr. Trump built the rink for no profit after New York City had been unable to complete its own renovation for more than six years. The developer has a one-year warranty from the manufacturer, Mr. Stern said.

1390-> NAVY SAID TO FIND NOVEL MINEHUNTER
The United States Navy turned a chartered ship into an improvised minehunter to lead a convoy of warships and tankers on the most dangerous leg of a passage through the Persian Gulf, shipping officials said today. They said the Navy chartered an offshore supply vessel, loaded it with sonar equipment and sailed the vessel in front of the convoy on the final stage to Kuwait. The ships arrived Tuesday night. ''They were very resourceful and made do with the equipment they already had,'' a shipping official said. The convoy - four warships and three Kuwaiti tankers under United States registration - came safely through the area where the supertanker Bridgeton struck a mine last month during the first escorted run. An American television report said that a Saudi minesweeper also sailed ahead of the convoy to Kuwait and that six mines had been cleared. There was no confirmation of this. [ In Washington, a Navy spokesman refused to comment on the reports, noting that Pentagon officials were under orders not to discuss details of the escorts. ] Ready for Return by Sunday Two of the three tankers began loading today for the return. All three are expected to be ready to leave by Sunday. Iran has singled out Kuwaiti-linked vessels for missile and grenade attacks in recent months in retaliation for its support for Iraq in the gulf war. Today, Iran asked the United Arab Emirates for permission to send Iranian ships and minehunting helicopters into its waters to search for mines. An Iranian Foreign Ministry official accused the United States or its agents of laying mines in the gulf and the Gulf of Oman, Teheran radio reported. A senior Iranian diplomat today declined to say whether Iran had sown mines in the northern gulf, where five ships have been damaged in the last four months. But Mohammed Baqeri, charge d'affaires at the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait, said, ''As long as there are big powers in the gulf and they are growing day by day, the region will not be secure for these forces.'' British to Stay in South Britain said today that its four minesweepers would be deployed from next month in the southern gulf only, as part of the Royal Navy's escort operation for British-registered ships. The United States Navy is bolstering its antimine capability with eight Sea Stallion helicopters expected shortly on the amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal. [ Defense officials in Washington said the Guadalcanal had left the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia on what was expected to be a five-day voyage. ] In the land war, the Teheran radio said Iranian Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded 1,000 Iraqis today in a counterattack on positions captured by the Iranians a week ago in Iraqi Kurdistan. Iran also said it shelled industrial targets in Iraq for the last 48 hours in retaliation for attacks two days ago on Iranian oil installations.

1392-> 12 Catholic Dioceses in West Join in Self-Insurance Plan
Twelve Roman Catholic dioceses representing 1,000 churches in California, Nevada and Arizona have formed their own liability insurance company. It is an effort to reduce liability premiums, which in some cases have doubled in the past year for churches. Other types of insurance, such as for fire, theft and property damage, will be bought from private insurers. In the past decade, Catholic dioceses have paid out nine times as much in liability premiums as they have received in claims, said Brother Haig Charshaf, business manager of the Oakland Diocese. The church company will cover dioceses in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and seven other California cities, Reno, Nev., and Tucson, Ariz.

Greenwald, a partner in the New York law firm of Miller, Singer, Raives & Brandes, were married yesterday at the New York home of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. David M. Levitt. Rabbi Jerome Davidson officiated. The bride graduated from Barnard College. Her father recently retired as chairman and chief executive officer of DCA Food Industries. Her mother, Norma Levitt, is an international president of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, an interfaith group. The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce. Mr. Greenwald, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Leonard A. Greenwald of Brooklyn, received bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard University, and graduated from the New York University School of Law. His father owns and operates the Brill Surgical Company in Brooklyn, a supplier of home health care equipment.

1394-> AN AMERICAN IN LONDON PLANS A RESTORED GLOBE THEATER
Odessa, Tex., has one. So, too, do San Diego and Cedar City, Utah. London has, however, managed to survive for over 300 years without one. The items in question are reconstructions of Shakespeare's original Globe Theater. (In fact there were two Globes: the first was destroyed by fire in 1613, the second was pulled down by the Puritans in 1644.) But on July 16 the Duke of Edinburgh, at a private ground-breaking ceremony on the south bank of the Thames, will present an oak timber post from Windsor Great Park to the International Shakespeare Globe Center. It will join 23 other timber posts staking out the perimeter of a planned new Globe Theater. It will also mark a vital point in a 17-year-long campaign waged by Sam Wanamaker, an American actor and director, against considerable odds, to remind London of its Shakespearean heritage. Mr. Wanamaker's dream dates back to his boyhood. At the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, he saw a replica of Shakespeare's Globe and said he was struck by ''the avoidance of the sort of hushed quality you had to have when you went to the theater.'' Later he acted in a Globe Theater in the Great Lakes Festival at Cleveland. Legal Battles and Ill Winds Arriving in London in 1949 he made a beeline for the Bankside in Southwark - directly opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, on the south side of the Thames - to find the British equivalent. All he discovered was a power station, desolate wharves, rickety tenements and an obscure bronze plaque set into the wall of a brewery commemorating the existence of Shakespeare's theater. In his disappointment lay the birth of a notion. In 1970 Mr. Wanamaker became executive director of the Globe Playhouse Trust, whose goal was rebuilding Shakespeare's theater and providing facilities for scholars. In 1972 he opened the Bear Gardens Museum on the site of a former bear-baiting pit. He also supervised a Shakespeare Festival on Bankside, which came to a premature end in 1973 when a tent in which Vanessa Redgrave was playing Cleopatra blew down in a storm. But the biggest blow to Mr. Wanamaker's dream came in 1982 when a newly elected Southwark Council decided that the provision of employment and council housing took precedence over Shakespeare, and reneged on an agreement to provide planning permission. The result was a bitter legal battle, which ended in the High Court in June 1986 in a vindication of Mr. Wanamaker. As a result the council has given the Globe Trust a 125-year lease on the one-acre site for a nominal rent. When it comes to financing the project, Mr. Wanamaker is unshakably optimistic. He estimates the capital cost of the project as $:16 million, or about $25.8 million at current exchange rates. He has raised $:1 million in pledges and commitments. ''Of the total cost,'' he said, ''I believe half will come from the United States. We have a Shakespeare Globe Center of North America with five offices across the country. I also spent three weeks fund raising in America in March and found a lot of support from individuals, private foundations and multinational corporations that have a stake in Britain.'' ''Once we are open, hopefully from the date of Shakespeare's birthday in 1992, we will also be a self-supporting organization.'' ''Two and a half million people visit St. Paul's every year. If only 10 percent of them came across the river -and there is the possibility of a new footbridge being built across the Thames - that would be enough to make us viable.'' But what will Bankside pilgrims actually see? The plans are highly ambitious. Theo Crosby, an architect, has designed a replica of the Globe (based on a drawing of the circular building made by Wenzel Hollar in 1640) with room for an audience of 1,500: some standing in an open pit around the apron stage, others seated in three-tiered, roofed-in galleries. The theater is to be constructed out of heavy oak, so slow burning as to be safe. In addition, there will be an adjacent reconstruction of Inigo Jones's indoor, intimate Cockpit Theater, seating 450. Mr. Wanamaker, who would like to open with ''Henry V,'' with its references to the ''wooden 0,'' envisages the Globe will house four productions a year from May to September; some performances, as in Shakespeare's day, will start at 2 P.M., others in late afternoon. Mr. Wanamaker's reconstructed Globe has to co-exist not only with the National Theater three-quarters of a mile away but also with a Royal Shakespeare Company currently operating in six theaters in Stratford-on-Avon and London. ''I see no conflict of interest with the R.S.C.,'' Mr. Wanamaker said. Mr. Wanamaker's venture has so far attracted much more overt enthusiasm and practical support in the United States than in Britain. But that is part of the current pattern. The Royal Shakespeare Company's million-pound Swan Theater in Stratford was capitalized by an American benefactor. Its equivalent London space, the Mermaid, is being supported by a Broadway producer. ''That,'' said Mr. Wanamaker, ''is in the nature of the American character. The British are much more cynical and regard the idea of a Globe reconstruction as an Elizabethan Disneyland. But the Americans have a real hunger for what they see as their history, their culture and their Shakespeare.''

1396-> STOCK MANIPULATION CHARGED
One of the nation's biggest players in a fairly new industry - Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc. of Ada, Okla. -says it is being victimized by investors who have been manipulating its stock price. The American Stock Exchange, where the stock has been trading since October last year, confirmed yesterday that it is investigating the matter. ''We are looking into it,'' said Robert Shabazian, a spokesman for the Amex. ''We have no idea when we will finish our investigation.'' Mary Wood, vice president for corporate finance at Pre-Paid, said that for nine months a group of investors had taken a large short position in the company. She declined to identify the investors, but she said that during that time the company has been plagued by a series of market rumors - all of which she said have been unfounded - and negative articles in the press that have caused the stock to fall. Short Sellers' Strategy An investor who takes a short position makes a profit when the price of a stock goes down. In expectation of such a decline, a short seller borrows and sells shares at a high price and then replaces them with shares purchased at a lower price. Pre-Paid has about six million shares outstanding, of which about 30 percent are held by insiders and another 5 percent by institutions. Short sellers hold about 500,000 shares, according to Mr. Shabazian of the stock exchange. Pre-Paid said it has been particularly troubled by a combination of unusually high trading volume and precipitous drops in the price of its shares. Since early May, shares of Pre-Paid have been slowly falling from about $11 a share, on daily volume in the range of 30,000 to 80,000 shares. In 1986, the stock traded between $14.875 and $8. But of late, the trading volume has changed dramatically. On Monday, June 29, for instance, Pre-Paid opened at $6.875 and closed at $5.75 on volume of 225,000 shares. On Wednesday, the stock fell to a low of $4.25 a share on volume of 447,200 shares before closing at $4.625. Yesterday, the stock closed at $5.50 a share, down 50 cents, on volume of 100,300 shares. Ms. Wood said that the company has made no announcements that would account for the sudden surge in trading volume last week. Wild Market Rumors Cited Over the last several months, the company has denied a variety of market rumors, including one that said that all the company's executives had been killed in an airplane crash and another that the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Pre-Paid, which was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1976 and experienced significant growth in the early 1980's, is one of the oldest and largest of a group of companies that market legal-service contracts to individuals who prepay for future legal needs. Pre-Paid has about 150,000 people in 22 states who sell its plans door-to-door or at gatherings of friends and neighbors. Last year, the company earned 30 cents a share on revenues of $42 million. Ms. Wood said that the only negative news issued by the company of late was that its 1987 first-quarter earnings were flat, compared with the corresponding period last year, when the company earned 5 cents a share. Barron's Article Disputed Thomas Richter, an analyst with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, said that Pre-Paid was vulnerable to the activity of short sellers and had also been hurt by negative articles in the financial press that he contended were both overly harsh and inaccurate. He specifically pointed to a June 8 article in Barron's, after which the stock price fell about a point on the week and daily volume soared by nearly 200,000 shares. The article, which criticized the financial condition of the company, was defended yesterday by Alan Abelson, editor of the business magazine, who said he had received no complaints from the company and that ''subsequent events have borne out our story quite nicely.'' Mr. Shabazian of the American Stock Exchange said that the Amex begins inquiries into potential stock manipulation when shares begin to trade outside of their normal trading pattern. He also said that the Securities and Exchange Commission would be apprised of the Pre-Paid investigation.

1397-> O'Connor's Worship Proposal Is Rejected by Jewish Group
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a major Jewish organization devoted to keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive, rejected yesterday John Cardinal O'Connor's call for Catholics and Jews to come together in worship to heal the wounds left by the recent visit of President Kurt Waldheim of Austria to Pope John Paul II. At the same time, the American Jewish Committee said it was exploring an appropriate forum to join the Cardinal and other Catholics in prayer. The New York-based committee gave qualified endorsement to the suggestion after it was made Sunday by the Cardinal. In a letter to its 361,000 members, the head of the Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier, said a joint prayer meeting ''would tend to expand the dispute into an American Jewish-Catholic issue rather than focusing on the source of the controversy - the Vatican.''

1399-> ALL NEW YORK AUDITIONS AS A SET FOR TV'S 'EQUALIZER'
RICHARD BIANCHI stepped onto the roof of the abandoned warehouse. He looked at the blistered tar at his feet, the decaying wood of the water tower and the rusted walls of the building next door. ''It's beautiful,'' he said. ''Just beautiful.'' With a tape measure he checked whether the cracked panes of the skylight were wide enough for a person to crash through. They were. Then he poked at the peeling paint in the stairwell, wondering if it would crumble in his hands. It did. Having found what he wanted -yet another location for the CBS-TV series ''The Equalizer'' - Mr. Bianchi and his scouting team headed back to the van that had brought them to Brooklyn. The next stop was a renovated loft in SoHo, followed by a town house in the West Village. ''The Equalizer,'' which stars Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, a retired secret agent who comes to the aid of the underdog, is videotaped at as many as half a dozen locations each week, all in New York. The sites, from opulent mansions to rundown tenements, are found by teams like this one. In their search, the scouts have been known to tape fliers to light poles and knock on apartment doors at random. The program's executive producer, James McAdams, said the use of real locations gives the show a gritty, real-life look. ''There's an indefinable thing about real places,'' he said. ''The feel of age; the crack in the ceiling. When there's a real window in the background, you're looking out a real window onto a real street.'' Perhaps more important, however, is the cost of renting a real location compared with constructing a set. Re-creating the living room of a wealthy matron would cost about $40,000, Mr. Bianchi explained, while renting a fully decorated room for a day costs about $4,000. Finding just such a living room was one of the goals of the recent scouting trip. The team was choosing sites for a story of a young man with a low I.Q., the son of a well-to-do mother, who seeks his independence as a stock clerk in a clothing store. While leaving work late one night, the young man, named Davey Baylor, finds a fellow employee dead in the alley. He is cradling her in his arms when the police arrive and accuse him of the crime. McCall comes to his aid. The scenes in McCall's apartment will be taped, as such scenes always are, in a studio on West End Avenue. But that does not keep Mr. Bianchi from creating a history for these rooms. He said the apartment was situated - at least spiritually - in a brownstone on a shady street in the West Village, which is where exterior scenes are shot. This particular morning, the scouting group consisted of Mr. Bianchi, the show's production designer; Bettiann Fishman, the locations manager; Bruce Nalepinski, the first assistant director, and Diane Foti, the unit production manager. At 9, a late start in an industry where filming often begins before dawn, they set out. There was a stop at the Mayflower Hotel to pick up Russ Mayberry, the director of the episode. During the ride, they talked sporadically among themselves and constantly on the car telephone. One call concerned the Borough of Manhattan Community College, where an office scene was scheduled. The school, eager to make a striking television appearance, had sent the drapes out to be cleaned. They disintegrated. Mr. Bianchi took the news philosophically. ''We were going to leave them open for that scene anyway,'' he said. The office called the van again, this time about an apartment owner who had agreed to accept $4,000 for two days' use of his home. The script had changed, and the location was needed for only one day, but the man insisted that he receive $4,000. The compromise, reached on the Brooklyn Bridge, was to pay the full fee but to reserve the right to reshoot scenes, if necessary, at no additional charge. At their first location, the burned-out warehouse, the only part of the building of interest to the scouting team was the water tower, which they hoped to use as Davey Baylor's hideaway, a secret place that he would fill with toys. Mr. Bianchi took photographs, as he does of every location he sees. Some of the pictures included people, for perspective, while others were of the structure only. The next stop was a loft on Prince Street in SoHo, a candidate for use as a safe house to which McCall would bring Davey Baylor. The scene required a kitchen that opened into the living room, and although this loft had walls dividing the two bedrooms from the living and dining area, the kitchen was not enclosed, the only demarcation being the terra-cotta tile of the kitchen floor. Film makers like lofts, the scouting team explained, because they are ideal for spatial illusions. The rooms are generally big enough to accommodate equipment and crew comfortably, but Mr. Bianchi said, ''You can use the camera to make them look as small as you want.'' Lofts also tend to be well lighted and open. ''Light dynamics can influence the psychology of the scene, the look of the scene,'' he said. ''The more light the better.'' The owner of the loft, a co-op, explained that the building's board might object to the filming. ''A year ago 'The Equalizer' filmed here,'' she said. ''They broke the roof. We had to spend $20,000 to fix it. The board may go crazy. I give it a 50-50 shot.'' The search for Mrs. Baylor's apartment took the van to a town house on West 10th Street. The group stopped only briefly. The visit was longer, but equally unproductive, at another town house on West 88th Street. Although the upstairs sitting room, with its French provincial chairs covered in green and white chintz, suited the crew's needs, the halls were carpeted in marigold yellow. The right lighting would make the furniture look less worn, Mr. Bianchi told Mr. Mayberry, but lighting would not camouflage the carpet. After a stop for lunch - where the discussion included whether the alley behind the restaurant could be used in the scene when Davey Baylor would discover his co-worker's body - the van pulled up in front of a building in the West 90's. In the apartment they visited, the paint had started to peel, and the living room furnishings consisted of a brown futon and some makeshift bookshelves. There were plastic chairs in the kitchen, and bicycles filled the entrance hall. Though it looked to an outsider like the perfect setting for Davey Baylor's apartment, the scouts shook their heads. The walls were too white, Mr. Bianchi explained, and the lighting crew would complain about reflections. ''They would make us put more things on the walls to cut the glare, and that would ruin the sparse effect,'' he said. But the apartment will be kept on file in the overstuffed cabinet at the company's offices. The sheer number of photographs there, Mr. Bianchi said, keeps him from worrying about running out of places to film in New York. ''I hope I'm not in this job long enough for that to happen,'' he said. But if it does, there will always be one fallback location. Mr. Bianchi has not let the cameras into his own apartment - yet.

1400-> SAILORS TRAIN IN PORT TO BATTLE ONE OF THEIR DEADLIEST ENEMIES: FIRE AT SEA
The alarm sounds aboard the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach: ''This is a drill. Fire in the forward port berthing compartment. Fire party, fire party.'' A dozen Navy firefighters race to an equipment locker. Behind them, watertight doors slam shut. The firefighters wiggle into fireproof coveralls, don red steel helmets and pull on oxygen masks. In a darkened compartment a drill team in yellow T-shirts simulates the fire. Two sailors flash red lanterns to signify flames, another flaps a gray blanket for black smoke, still another fluffs a white sheet for white smoke. Charred clothing and bedding have been scattered about. Perhaps nothing strikes so much fear in a sailor as a fire at sea. No one can escape, as he might from a burning house. Space is tight, making it easy for fire to spread and hard to fight. Sailors compete with the flames for the oxygen. Sailors fight the fire to save their ship and their lives. Heroism Aboard Stark In May, after 37 sailors were killed aboard the American warship Stark in the Persian Gulf when the frigate was hit by a missile from an Iraqi warplane, the crew needed almost 24 hours to douse the intense flames for good, finish damage control and treat the wounded, according to the House Armed Services Committee. In a preliminary report, the panel said the actions of the crew were ''heroic.'' Aboard the Long Beach, talkers begin a running report to the damage control center deep amidships, where it is protected, like the combat center and ammunition magazines. Should there be more than one fire, or flooding, which often accompanies a blaze, the fight to save the ship would be coordinated from there. As soon as the fire team is in place, one man feels the door to the burning compartment while another sprays it with a fine cooling mist. The first man cracks the door open enough to allow the inside to be sprayed. Then the team leader gives the word, the firefighters tug on their pressurized hoses and charge into the compartment to battle the blaze. Going in with them are an electrician to find switches to cut the power and a medic to look for injured seamen. Success in fighting a blaze comes from drill, drill, drill, said the Long Beach's skipper, Capt. Marvin J. Weniger, who calls his firefighters ''the Long Beach Fire Department.'' When Training Paid Off The Stark's crew, evidently well trained, suffered no casualties from fighting the fire, the Congressional report said. ''Given the ferocity of and intensity of fires on ships, this is a remarkable achievement,'' it said. Firefighting on the Stark was hampered because the missiles had ruptured the water main on the port side. That required rigging hoses from the aft water mains. Moreover, the crew reported that the fire kept reigniting at new locations. ''Crew members described the fire as so intense that it eventually began to melt portions of the superstructure and decking,'' the report said. Some estimated that the temperature in some compartments reached 1,800 degrees. ''Crew members said the amount and density of the smoke generated by the fires kept them from isolating the source of the fire for several hours and combined to block all visibility in the adjacent work spaces,'' the report said. From Captain to Seaman To teach sailors to fight fire and to control shipboard damage, the Navy operates schools in ports such as San Diego to train every member of a crew, from the captain to the newest seaman. In the firefighting school next to the piers here, Chief Warrant Officer Paul D. Hacker said a key step was teaching sailors to identify what kind of fire they were up against so that they used the right techniques. Class A fires give off white smoke from burning wood, clothing, mattresses or, grimmest of all, men. Those fires are fought with water. Class B fires, produce black smoke from burning oil or paint and are fought with chemical foam. Class C fires, are electrical fires fought by cutting off power and dousing the flames with carbon dioxide. Class D fires are burning magnesium or other metal and are the hardest to fight because they are so hot they turn water to steam. A blaze near ammunition is also classed as a delta fire. A 1982 Sinking Recalled The fire aboard the Stark was a Class D fire, as was that aboard the British destroyer Sheffield, which was sunk by an Exocet missile in the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. On any ship, Captain Weniger said, citing not only training but the importance of storing flammable materiel properly, ''two-thirds of fighting fire is done before the fire starts.'' Crewmen are trained to report a fire first, then to shut watertight doors around it. If the fire is bad, the crew is called to battle stations, as sailors were on the Stark. Most important, fire teams must be organized and trained under the direction of a damage control officer. Another critical element is overcoming a natural fear of fire. The firefighting school has erected steel structures that look like the superstructure of a ship, a boiler room and an engine room and, for aircraft carriers, a flight deck. Oil is dumped into those buildings and set afire to give sailors the experience of fighting live flames. Every Man a Mission Here the firefighters learn teamwork, Mr. Hacker said. Each man is assigned a specific job - nozzleman, hose man, boundary man to keep the watertight doors around the fire closed and extraneous sailors away. Each is rotated through the different assignments. In a similar school, Senior Chief Petty Officer Raymond F. Trumpe 3d trains sailors to handle flooding caused by holes in the ship's hull or ruptured pipes, which can be caused by missiles. A damage control party of five or six sailors is sent into another set of structures that look like ship compartments. As water under high pressure gushes through holes in the hull and rises around their feet, the sailors place steel plates over the hole, jam wooden beams into place to hold the plates and seal off the water. In another drill, the sailors drive wooden wedges into ruptured pipes, place rubber mats over the hole and bind it with heavy twine. Fleeing Through a Flood Still another drill teaches sailors to escape a flooding compartment. In a compartment above them a rescue team stands hip-deep in 19 tons of water. The rescue team leader stands atop a hatch in the deck between the two compartments, finding its handle with his feet. Two other rescuers stand on either side of the hatch. Signals are passed by thumps on the steel. When both rescuers and trapped sailors are ready, the leader yanks the hatch open and holds it back while the trapped sailors climb up a ladder through the water pouring down on them. Each is hauled away by the two rescuers standing beside the hatch so the next man can climb up. Finally, damage control teams are taught to use portable pumps to empty a compartment that has been flooded with seawater or water used to fight fire. In the fire aboard the Stark, the ship listed 17 degrees to port because so much water had been pumped in to fight fire. But the crew pumped it out again to save the ship.

1401-> THE RESTAURANT GAME: A FRENETIC TALE OF SURVIVAL
FOR 10 years Zeus Goldberg presided over Woods, a popular restaurant on Madison Avenue in the 60's that managed to be elegant but not intimidating. Three weeks ago Mr. Goldberg presided over the restaurant's closing, watching from a barstool as an auctioneer disposed of dishes, cutlery and kitchen equipment. ''The building was bought by a foreign company for an outrageous amount of money,'' said Mr. Goldberg. He said he would have had to move, but a comparable 1,500-square-foot space in the neighborhood would have cost $150,000 to $200,000 a year in rent, five times what he had been paying. Escalating rents are putting many New York restaurateurs out of business and racking the nerves of survivors. The cost of space, however, is just part of an increasingly frenetic - and worrisome - restaurant scene, according to interviews with restaurant owners, suppliers, real estate brokers and consultants. The feeling is pervasive that business is softer, that succeeding is harder, that the margin for error is shrinking. Rents are up, as are outlays for food, labor and utilities, but passing these costs on is risky when competition is fierce. Slower liquor sales are hurting profits. Diners are less loyal and more demanding. The new tax law reducing the deduction for business meals might be discouraging expense-account dining. At the same time restaurants are facing competition from new quarters, including takeout shops, hotel restaurants, caterers and corporate dining rooms. An economic measure of the industry is maintained by PMS: The Food Industry's Clearinghouse, which provides restaurant suppliers with information on which restaurants are in bankruptcy, behind on their bills or delinquent in tax payments. This year far more restaurants in Manhattan are in trouble or dying than last. Lawrence Sarf, vice president of PMS, which has offices in Larchmont, N.Y., said that between January and May, 31 Manhattan restaurants that he called ''substantial'' filed for protection from their creditors under the Federal bankruptcy code; 9 filed in the same period last year. Despite the higher failure rate, the business still attracts investors lured by the many success stories and by the knowledge that New Yorkers are always ready to try a new restaurant. ''I hear of a lot of places that are closing, but every day there is someone taking their place,'' said Charles Morris Mount, a restaurant designer who said he had three calls in one day from potential clients. ''Everyone has a fantasy.'' Because of the competition in New York, though, even thriving establishments feel they must improve. ''I really think it's a shakedown period,'' said Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant in the city. ''No one takes success for granted for a minute.'' Even restaurants considered among the best are not immune. Barry Wine, owner of the Quilted Giraffe - an expensive, highly rated East Side restaurant - said business is strong, but he is facing new competition from restaurants in luxury hotels. Because they are subsidized by the hotels, he said, ''those restaurants have menu prices that don't properly reflect the cost of doing business today.'' He said he is reluctant to raise his prix fixe of $75. Dozens of restaurants that glitter and shine burn out fast; some cater to fickle tastes and die by them. Good reviews and big crowds are no guarantee of lasting success. El Internacional, a TriBeCa restaurant where crowds once waited for blue drinks and tiny plates of tapas, is still open but filed for bankruptcy protection in January, citing poor management and a downturn in the restaurant business. Joanna, a popular pioneer on East 18th Street, was forced into bankruptcy in April by creditors and is now closed. Q.V. on the Upper East Side reopened to glowing reviews, but survived less than a year; it filed for protection from creditors in April and is being sold. Amsterdam's, a success in the west 80's, opened a downtown branch that is faltering. The owners filed for bankruptcy for the downtown operation in January. Brandon Steiner, the general manager, said business is better, but rising costs make profits elusive. ''Salmon went from $4 a pound to $6 a pound,'' he said, but menu prices were not changed, for fear of damaging Amsterdam's image as an inexpensive dining spot. Mr. Steiner said Amsterdam's arrived on lower Broadway too early. It hoped other restaurants would follow, but they did not. The neighborhood is also different. ''We found that people down here eat at home a little more often, and when they go out it's fancier,'' he said. Suppliers are the first to know which restaurants might go under. Ariane Daguin of D'Artagnan Inc., which sells fresh game and foie gras, said more better-known restaurants than usual are falling behind in paying their bills. Of her 120 restaurant customers in New York, about a dozen must now pay cash because they are not credit-worthy. Paul Campbell, a partner at Bink & Bink, a produce supplier, said more of his customers, too, have been slipping into a slower payment pattern. Jean Paul Pico, owner of JP's French Bakery, said the list of credit risks that circulates in the industry is ''frightening to see.'' Mr. Sarf, whose company compiles that list, said it is three times as long as in 1975. About 75 percent of the restaurants in the city close or change hands within five years of opening, according to the New York State Restaurant Association. Under these conditions, the business is like a revolving door, spinning off phenomenal failures and, periodically, big successes like Le Bernardin, Harry Cipriani, Provence and Arqua that feed the hopes of would-be restaurant owners. Their hopes are not altogether misplaced. Alan Stillman, who owns Smith & Wollensky in midtown, the Post House on East 63d Street and the Manhattan Ocean Club on West 58th Street, is optimistic. He said business at each restaurant is up by at least 5 percent this year. ''As soon as I get off the telephone,'' he said, ''I'm meeting with my lawyer to talk about a major, 300-seat restaurant in midtown.'' But owners must know what they are doing, he said. ''I would suspect there has been more turnover in the last three years than in the previous 10 years,'' he said. ''The pressure on restaurants to succeed has become quicker and more difficult. You cannot open a minor restaurant. You have to do it perfectly.'' Competition is tougher partly because there are more restaurants, and they are better. According to Mr. Sarf there are 19,000 restaurants in the five boroughs now, ranging from coffee shops to Lutece; that is 2,000 more than in 1975. Mr. Whiteman said the profusion of new office complexes with important restaurants on the ground floor means that midtown might have a surplus of restaurant seats at night. ''We always believed that if anyplace provided an infinite market, it was New York,'' he said. But those days might be over. With more and better choices available to consumers, owners have to offer something different, cheaper or more exciting. Mark Fleischman, who once owned Studio 54, worked with his brother Alan and with Dan Robinson to develop Home on the Range, a new 225-seat restaurant on Third Avenue near 14th Street that has a disk jockey and a design meant to recall a Southwestern village during fiesta time. ''You have to give them more entertainment, more flair, more pizazz each time,'' he said. Pizazz, not to mention plumbing, costs more each year, so that when a restaurant fails the expense can be spectacular. Mr. Mount, the designer, said restaurants are spending $300 a square foot on construction; three years ago it was $125. ''They want more opulence and better lighting,'' he said, ''and they want leather on the chairs instead of vinyl.'' Rents on the Upper West side above 72d Street now range from $75 to $125 a square foot, twice the cost of space on the Upper East Side above 72d Street, according to Robert Futterman, who specializes in restaurants at Garrick/Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc. In the Flatiron district the cost of space has doubled, to about $40 a square foot, in three years. Chefs can command $150,000 at top restaurants, and even young culinary graduates can start at $20,000. Thomas Baratta, an owner of Marylou's in Greenwich Village, said its insurance premium went from $11,000 to $36,000 in one year. Undercapitalized restaurants fold; others risk going through enormous amounts of money. Much of it can dribble away almost unnoticed in day-to-day operations - by ordering too much food and watching it spoil, for instance. Knowing how to control costs is especially hard for neophytes. Some restaurants owned by celebrities are for sale, according to Michael Weinstein, president of the Ark Restaurants Corporation, whose places include Ernie's on the Upper West Side and America on East 18th Street. They find it hard to operate under today's circumstances. ''They could get away with it seven or eight years ago,'' he said. The restaurant Twenty Twenty, opened last summer by the singers Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson at a cost of $1 million, recently brought in a new partner who has restaurant experience to try to save the operation. Celebrities are not alone in trying to bail out. ''There have never been more restaurants for sale,'' said David Liederman, owner of Chez Louis in the East 50's. Mr. Liederman suggested that people overestimate what a restaurant can gross. ''They don't realize that 90 percent of New Yorkers want to eat at 8 and be home at 10,'' he said. Because of the uneasiness in the business, some investors are more cautious. Mr. Futterman at Garrick/ Aug said his clients want to pick up leases of smaller, failing restaurants to lessen their risk. ''It no longer pays to build these big places when the chance of survival is slim,'' he said. Owners' needs might also coincide with consumers' interests. Mr. Futterman and many others said they believe that New Yorkers now want small, intimate restaurants. They are also more cost conscious. ''People are eating out because they're tired, and looking for a way to have a pleasant time together without killing the pocketbook,'' said Mr. Whiteman. But the dream of the big, smash-hit restaurant lives on. Scheduled to open next week at 21st Street and Broadway is Cafe Society, a 15,000-square-foot restaurant that is costing $3.5 million to open. The owners dismiss the idea that large places are passe. ''I don't think it's been done as well as it can be,'' said Shelly Abramowitz, who helped draw crowds to Canastel's, in the Flatiron district, when it opened. ''You have to create a party every night.'' Cafe Society culled investors from Wall Street, which might have more than the usual number of people with the souls of gamblers and money to burn. As one of them, John Schneider, a broker, explained, ''It looked like more than a 50-50 shot.''

1402-> AIDS TESTS URGED FOR TRANSPLANTS
Transplant specialists are recommending that people in need of donor organs be tested for the AIDS virus before they are placed on waiting lists, a leading transplant surgeon said Tuesday. The surgeon, Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, head of transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh, a leading transplant center, said the recommendation was one of several submitted last week to the United Network for Organ Sharing. The network, based in Richmond, was awarded a Federal contract last year to establish a national organ procurement network and to devise policies on sharing scarce donor organs for the nation's approximately 200 transplant centers. Dr. Starzl headed a special committee of the organization that formulated the AIDS guidelines last week. The committee recommended that patients who test positive for the AIDS virus but do not exhibit symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be eligible for transplantation. Those with symptoms, however, are on ''a slippery slope'' and should not receive scarce organs since AIDS is invariably fatal, Dr. Starzl said at a news conference. Screening of Donors Organ donors are already screened for the AIDS virus, and organs from those testing positive are rejected for transplantation. Patients who test positive for AIDS antibodies do not necessarily go on to develop the incurable disease.

1405-> Argentina Reins In Economy
Argentina today announced a series of drastic economic measures, including a wage and price freeze, in the apparent hope of increasing confidence in the beleaguered administration of President Raul Alfonsin. The economic package came just weeks after Mr. Alfonsin's party, the Radical Civic Union, suffered major losses in midterm congressional and gubernatorial elections, a setback attributed to voters' unhappiness with the return of three-digit inflation. Before announcing the changes, Mr. Alfonsin had spent several days negotiating with opposition leaders in an attempt to obtain broad support. The powerful Peronist Party had said it would back the measures only if they protected the poorest sectors of society. The Peronists did not have an immediate response today to the Alfonsin plan. Salaries Raised Before Freeze The Government made a gesture to low-income groups by raising the minimum wage by 75 percent, to the equivalent of $100 a month. All other salaries were increased by 12 percent and then frozen. The Government also ordered a 10.8 percent currency devaluation and a 15 percent increase in most public utility tariffs. Government officials said that, along with curbing inflation, the measures were aimed at reducing the public sector deficit, stimulating exports and attracting private investment, all objectives contained in Argentina's most recent accord with the International Monetary Fund. Despite earlier demands by opposition parties that Argentina reduce interest payments on its $54 billion foreign debt, today's announcement made no reference to this problem, suggesting that the Government would continue to respect its agreement with its creditors. The wage and price freeze dramatically illustrated how Latin America's leading debtor countries - Argentina, Brazil and Mexico - continue to consider high inflation as their main economic and political problem. Argentina's first anti-inflationary program, known as the Austral Plan, was imposed in June 1985, after inflation had reached an annual rate of around 1,000 percent. But once wage and price controls were relaxed, inflationary pressures returned and, in the last 12 months, prices have risen by about 135 percent. Brazil and Mexico have fared similarly. A wage and price freeze imposed in Brazil in February 1986 collapsed early this year. A new freeze was ordered in June, but inflation is again running at an annual rate of more than 200 percent. Mexico, in contrast, has avoided the freeze strategy, but inflation is expected to reach a record 140 percent this year. Mr. Alfonsin's Government picked no date for relaxing the latest freeze, but it excluded a number of products that are considered luxuries or are in short supply, including liquor, wine, cigarettes, jewelry, books, weapons, fruit, rice and coffee. The 15 percent tariff increase for such public utilities as water, light, telephones, trains and buses also suggested the Government would try once again to reduce its deficit from about 10 percent to 3 percent of gross domestic product. Gasoline prices were raised by 18 percent. Another Currency Devaluation On the other hand, the currency devaluation, which followed an 11.5 percent devaluation of the Austral only five days ago, apparently reflected the growing alarm over falling exports and rising imports, which reduced Argentina's trade surplus by 57 percent - to $610 million - in the first six months of this year. Under a new plan announced today, Argentina will officially have a two-tier exchange rate - in practice, because of an active black market, it already had two exchange rates - with an official rate of 3.5 Australs to the dollar and a free-floating rate outside central bank control. A tax on all imports was also raised to 15 percent, from 10 percent. With currency reserves badly depleted, to less than $1 billion, according to some experts, the country's export performance is expected to have a critical impact on its ability to continue servicing its foreign debt. Interest payments totaling $4.4 billion are due this year. After last month's election setback, President Alfonsin sharply attacked the ''ridiculous recipes'' of austerity that the I.M.F. was imposing on debtor nations. Subsequently, he softened his criticism when the fund agreed to disburse the latest $210 million payment of a $1.4 billion credit even though Argentina had failed to meet several economic targets. Further Loans May Be Needed Yet financial experts said Argentina might still find itself unable to make debt payments through the end of this year, a situation that might force the Alfonsin administration to seek a bridge loan from the United States or to turn again to commercial creditors for new loans. While Mr. Alfonsin apparently hopes to avoid Brazil's tactic of suspending commercial debt payments, the experts said the Government would nonetheless come under enormous domestic pressure to do so if the latest economic measures fail to curb inflation and revive growth. Argentine officials conceded that private sector investment, now almost negligible, was essential if the economy was to grow. A central purpose of the new package, they said, is to stimulate confidence so that resources will be switched toward genuine investment and away from financial speculation. ''We have no choice but to change direction,'' the Government said in an official statement.

1406-> Bomb Hits U.S. Office in Spain
A bomb exploded today outside the United States Consulate in this Mediterranean port city, wounding eight Spaniards and seriously damaging the building, the police said. The eight were treated for cuts and bruises. Two were consular employees. A man speaking Catalan, the provincial language, called the newspaper, Diari de Barcelona, this evening, and said the Catalonian separatist group Terra Lliure was responsible for the attack. A package containing a small amount of a powerful explosive ripped through the hallway in front of the main doors of the consulate offices shortly after 1 P.M., the police said. The consulate is on the fourth floor of a nine-story building. Firemen used truck-mounted hydraulic ladders to evacuate about 20 people from floors above the blast site, a spokesman said. The explosion wrecked the stairway, stalled elevators, broke windows and sent glass flying, the police said. A United States Embassy spokesman, Bob Meade, said the consulate had received no bomb threats and had no previous warning of the bombing. The police cordoned off the area for hours while experts searched for other bombs. In addition to the consulate, the building houses Spanish Government offices. ''Once again, we have the sad mission of having to condemn a criminal act,'' the Catalonian regional government minister, Agusti Bassols, later told reporters, referring to numerous bombings in the city in the last year claimed by Basque and Catalonian nationalist militants. Terra Lliure, which means Free Land in Catalan, seeks independence from Spain for the four-province northeastern region of Catalonia. The tiny group has claimed responsibility for numerous bombings in cities in the region, including attacks on United States businesses in Barcelona, in the last two years. One person was killed Sept. 10 when one of the group's bombs exploded in a town in the province of Lerida.

1410-> Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth
The psychoanalyst and the analysand sat in facing black leather chairs. There was, of course, a couch. ''God forbid,'' muttered the real Dr. Ruth Westheimer, as distinct from the media personality, ''I would never lie on the couch.'' Although she did allow her feet, in size 4 Ferragamo pumps, to rest briefly on an ottomon, her posture, like her manner, was mostly formal during an hourlong interview in her analyst's office on Central Park West. The subject was the psychoanalysis of Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Some might call it, the shrinking of Dr. Ruth. ''Hmmmm'' said the analyst, Dr. Mark Blechner, ''I'd call it the stretching of Dr. Ruth.'' ''I like that!'' exclaimed the 4-foot, 7-inch sex therapist, clapping her hands the way she does on television. A Rare Light Moment It was a rare light moment in a therapeutic relationship that began this past spring. Faced with a block while writing her autobiography, Dr. Westheimer was forced to follow her own advice: ''I tell everybody, 'Go for help,' right?'' On the air, I say constantly to people with problems, 'Do go to a counselor or a therapist.' I say this in my private practice if something is beyond my competence, 'Go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist.'' ''And here I was,'' she went on, ''holding back painful experiences, not wanting to look at them, maybe because I was scared I would get so sad that I wouldn't be able to do the things I needed to do as 'Dr. Ruth.' '' Long before ''Dr. Ruth'' she was Karola Ruth Siegel, a German-Jewish refugee who came of age in a Swiss orphanage, waiting in vain for her parents to escape the Holocaust. She has spoken of this period in interviews, but never in any depth. When her own children used to ask how it was to be 10 years old and without a mother or father, she said, ''I changed the subject.'' Typical Patient To Dr. Blechner, who is 36 years old and a faculty member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, as well as being on the staff of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Dr. Westheimer, 59, was a typical patient in terms of symptoms. ''She was having dificulties,'' he said, ''not only in recalling memories but also in talking about them.'' In addition, he said, Dr. Westheimer had not come to terms with her parents' fate after September 1941, when she stopped receiving their letters. Nor, he added, have some others he has interviewed for the Yale Holocaust study. ''I've seen people in their 70's, who despite firsthand testimony of what happened, maintain a kind of magical idea that maybe a relative survived.'' The jargon for what a patient brings to the psychoanalytic process is ''psychological baggage.'' Dr. Westheimer first arrived at the analyst's office literally carrying a battered valise. Inside were stacks of faded blue composition books containing the ''Diary of Karola Siegel,'' her parents' letters and other memorabilia. Guided by Dr. Blechner, who is fluent in German and Hebrew, she was able to speak again in those languages and read the diaries and letters untouched for half a century. Most of those years, she lived with an ''irrational guilt,'' she said, believing that if she had stayed in Germany she could have saved her parents. The guilt is gone, and in its place is an admiration for her parents and their sacrifice in sending her to safety. She said, ''I would not have the courage to send my own children away like that.'' Even as she spoke of grappling with the past, she still evinced ''ambivalence'' as the analyst put it. She said she has not made a concerted effort to learn when and where her parents died, despite some evidence that they were sent to Auschwitz. Nor has she registered their names in the Holocaust memorial in Israel, although her daughter did so recently. She has tried to block out the image of the gas chamber and yet she acknowledged, ''When I see a shower head or a fire sprinkler, I can't help thinking, 'this is how it happened.' '' Dr. Westheimer's autobiography, written with Ben Yagoda, ''All in a Lifetime'' (Warner Books; $17.95), deals with some of the material uncovered during analysis. The book also answers the question: ''What did I know about sex and when did I know about it?'' As a child in Frankfurt, she knew babies did not come from storks after peeking into a marriage manual her parents kept hidden away. At the orphanage, she passed on the facts of life to other 10-year-olds. ''Shut up!'' the adults told her. She went to the roof and knocked on the boys' window. The window broke and she got spanked. 'Wrong Information' At 13, she wrote in her diary that a friend, Else, ''was told everything wrong about menstruation.'' She set Else straight ''because I know how bad it is when one is given wrong information about these things.'' Other diary entries reflect the confusions of teen-agers who call in the night saying, ''Hello, Dr. Ruth?'' For example, she wrote: ''Nobody is going to want me. I am so short and ugly.'' ''He understands me and likes me. But does he really?'' After the war she emigrated to Israel where, at 17, she first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack - without contraception. ''I am not happy about that,'' she admitted, ''but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.'' Dr. Westheimer's analysis took place during a series of Sunday sessions, some lasting four hours, and did not deal with her life after the years in Israel. Her only other psychotherapeutic experience was 25 years ago when a therapist agreed to half-hour sessions at half-price because she talked fast. But, she said, ''I didn't discuss my past in detail because it would have been too painful.'' She sighed and said it was still painful, recalling that another therapist had warned that looking at old scars would mean the loss of her ''joie de vivre.'' Then, glancing at Dr. Blechner, she said, ''I think he was right, Mark.'' The interview hour was almost over. Dr. Westheimer produced a box of Swiss chocolates, tore off the cellophane and proffered it to Dr. Blechner. ''Always,'' she said, ''on those sad Sundays I brought chocolates for us to eat, maybe so Mark would not be so hard on me. Never mind if I believe in transference or not, that certainly wasn't discussed. I could have fallen in love with you, Mark, and you would not have known it.'' Dr. Blechner smiled and took a chocolate. ''We don't analyze them,'' he said. ''We just eat them.''

1411-> New Evidence Cited Against Drexel
The Government has received documents bolstering allegations by Ivan F. Boesky that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. engaged in illegal stock trading activities with his securities firm, according to legal sources with knowledge of the investigation. Mr. Boesky told the Government he had engaged in the scheme with Drexel, the sources said previously. But Drexel and its lawyers have insisted that they know of no wrongdoing by the firm or its officials. The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said a trader who worked for Mr. Boesky had kept records of the trades with Drexel. Mr. Boesky was not aware of the records, they said. The trader was granted immunity from prosecution by the United States Attorney in Manhattan several months ago and handed over the material then, the sources said. A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office would not comment. The Washington Post reported yesterday that the trader, David Jachimczyk, had been granted immunity and had corroborated some of Mr. Boesky's accusations. Frank H. Wohl, a Manhattan lawyer who represents Mr. Jachimczyk, would not comment on the report. 3 Thought to Have Immunity Mr. Jachimczyk is the third person said to have been offered immunity in the Government's investigation of Drexel, and the head of its junk bond operation, Michael Milken. The others named in news reports over the last six months as having been offered immunity are Charles Thurnher, an accountant who works closely with Mr. Milken, and Setrag Mooradian, an accountant with Mr. Boesky's securities firm. A year ago, Mr. Boesky settled the largest insider-trading case ever filed by the Government. He paid $100 million to settle civil charges and pleaded guilty to a fraud charge after admitting that he illegally bought inside information from several investment bankers and engaged in illegal stock-parking schemes. In such a scheme, a firm holds stock on behalf of a person without disclosing the owner, and it can be illegal if it is done to avoid Government reporting requirements. Mr. Boesky, who is cooperating with investigators, has yet to be sentenced but faces up to five years in prison. The chief trader at Mr. Boesky's firm was Michael Davidoff, who pleaded guilty to a fraud charge related to an illegal stock-parking scheme last year and is cooperating with the investigation. Mr. Jachimczyk was directed by Mr. Davidoff, for whom he worked, to keep detailed records of certain stock trades, the sources said, including the trades with Drexel that the Government is studying.

1412-> Public Financing Will Keep City Council Elections Out of Trouble
To the Editor: New York City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler asks that candidates for the City Council be exempted from a proposal to set up a system of partial public funding of local elections (letter, Oct. 19). His suggestion would undermine efforts both to reform the city's scandalous campaign finance laws and to increase the City Council's power. Look what has happened on the Federal level, where public funds are provided to Presidential candidates, but not to those running for Congress. In Presidential elections, public funds have checked the growth of big spending, increased the number of candidates and broadened the fund base for campaigns. Thirty-four of 35 major party candidates have chosen to accept public funds and in return to limit their overall spending. Where Richard M. Nixon spent $62 million in private funds in 1972, Ronald Reagan's 1984 election cost $68 million -just a 10 percent increase in 12 years. However, as Common Cause has noted, ''With the role of private contributions drastically curbed in Presidential politics, moneyed interests naturally turned to Congress.'' Congressional campaign spending increased from $99 million in 1976 to more than $300 million in 1986. Political action committee contributions to House and Senate candidates has skyrocketed fivefold in a decade. Campaign money is like water. If there is a hole in the dam, special-interest dollars will flow through. True, in the past, most of the big money has gone to members of the Board of Estimate, which awards government favors worth millions. But the Council is now asking the New York City Charter Revision Commission for more power, including sole authority to approve the Mayor's budget. Several civic groups, including the New York Public Interest Research Group, have supported the Council position. We would have to reconsider the broadening of the Council's power if its members would be the major target of special-interest funds in future elections. Do taxpayers want their dollars spent to pay for most City Council campaigns? Mr. Leffler thinks not. The answer depends on how the question is put. We have been asking New Yorkers, ''Do you want candidates for city offices to rely on money from big real estate developers or others who seek government favors?'' The vast majority say ''no'' and sign postcards urging passage of Intro 906, the campaign-finance-reform legislation now in the Council.

1416-> Buyback Of Shares By Caesars
In a new twist to one of the year's longest-running takeover battles, Caesars World Inc. announced yesterday a stock buyback plan that could cost it up to $400 million. The proposal by the casino and hotel operator is the latest fallout from the struggle between the company's management and its largest stockholder, Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor. Caesars said it would hold a ''Dutch auction'' tender offer, in which shareholder bids will set the price the company pays for almost one-third of its shares. The company said it would buy 31 percent of its stock for $29.50 to $34 a share through the offer, which begins today. On Friday, Caesars World shares closed at $29.25, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Recapitalization Dropped Caesars said it was abandoning a recapitalization effort it advanced while fighting to defeat a $35-a-share acquisition offer by Mr. Sosnoff last spring. Last month, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission rejected the recapitalization plan, saying it was an ''imprudent, risky'' strategy. The company had proposed taking on an additional $960 million in debt to finance a plan that included a one-time special dividend of $26.25 a share. The New Jersey commission said the plan did not have any clear business purpose and was intended to ''greatly enrich and permanently entrench present corporate officials.'' Caesars said yesterday it would pay a single price for each of the 11 million shares it is prepared to buy. In a standard Dutch auction, the share price is continuously lowered until a bidder responds favorably. Caesars said its buyback price would be set by a computation based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by shareholders. Caesars said it would finance the stock repurchase with a new debt offering and other borrowing. Ruling Won't Be Appealed Last week, Mr. Sosnoff said he had contacted Caesars after the New Jersey ruling and expressed an interest in renewing his bid. He said that Caesars had not responded and that he would decide whether to make a new formal bid after he learned whether Caesars would appeal the commission's ruling. In announcing the buyback plan, Caesars officials said they would not appeal. In June, after the company proposed the recapitalization, Mr. Sosnoff withdrew his offer but retained his 12 percent interest in the company. An investment banker representing the investor said Mr. Sosnoff's advisers had not yet reviewed the latest Caesars offer and would not comment. A spokesman said Mr. Sosnoff would have a response later this week. The chairman of Caesars World, Henry Gluck, said the company's management believed the stock-purchase plan represented a good investment for the company ''because of recent market prices for Caesars World shares, the company's reduced level of long-term debt and our business and financial prospects.'' Mr. Gluck also said in a statement that the company hoped the offer would ''normalize'' its shareholder base. Arbitragers currently hold large blocks of Caesars stock. Before the decision by the casino control commission, Caesars' stock was selling at $35. The battle for Caesars, which runs casinos in New Jersey and Nevada and four resorts without gambling in Pennsylvania, has been complex. Mr. Sosnoff began in March with a $28-a-share bid that perplexed some Wall Street professionals. Some analysts speculated at the time that the 55-year-old money manager and author was merely trying to pressure Mr. Gluck into buying him out at a profit. Mr. Gluck, an entrepreneur who made millions from his own industrial-products company, Monogram Industries, responded with a series of defenses and offers by the company. But instead of selling his Caesars stake, Mr. Sosnoff raised his offer. A series of revised bids and court confrontations followed, ending with the recapitalization plan.

1417-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS
Ron Whitten may be an experienced prosecutor and an accomplished golf writer, but the city attorney in Topeka, Kan., who doubles as a contributor to Golf Digest, also has a secret passion, or did, anyway, until he proclaimed it to the world in the magazine's September issue. Whitten, it seems, has been a closet golf architect, one who comes away from playing a new course not with visions of perfectly-hit shots dancing in his mind, but with mental images of how the course could have been improved by some judicious bull-dozing or creative bunkering. It turns out that Whitten, whose doodles run to sloping doglegs and hilltop greens, is not alone. When he sketched out an imaginary landscape and announced a contest to turn the parcel into an ideal golf hole, some 15,000 entries - more than 10 times the expected response - poured into the magazine. Based on a quick look at the early entries, Whitten believes the judges will have their work cut out for them. ''I was astounded at the high caliber,'' he said. He was especially impressed with the presentations, which included full-color paintings, schematic drawings, elaborate graphics, blueprints, three-dimensional models and written descriptions running to four or five pages. But armchair architects, he has found, often make the same mistakes the pros do, putting in too many bunkers and other hazards, for example, and in general making the hole, intended as the 18th on a championship club course, too difficult for the club members, and, in some cases, for the touring pros. Among other features, Whitten found island greens, heart-shaped greens, Texas-shaped greens, Texas-sized greens, postage-stamp greens and one layout that could be called ''the wishbone,'' an acute dogleg in the shape of a V. ''Not too practical,'' Whitten said. Although the contest layout included an existing 17th green to give the contestants some perspective, not all of them took the hint. Among the deviations from scale, Whitten said, were greens too small to provide a reasonable approach target and some so large they provided for putts as long as 150 yards. There were also some full-fledged fantasy designs evocative of the familiar amusement park miniature courses, but Whitten, who is saving them for his own article on the contest, won't say whether they include giant windmills.

1423-> Budget Deficit Talks Shouldn't Be Adversarial
To the Editor: Your judgment that ''President Reagan offered just enough to begin serious bargaining with Congress on the budget deficit'' (''History, Mr. President,'' editorial, Oct. 24) seems misguided in light of answers he gave at his Oct. 22 news conference. He resorted by way of analogy to his negotiations ''for a union, against the employers,'' adding later: ''You're all trying to get me into saying what am I going to do when I sit down at the table with the other fellows.'' Aside from the ambiguities that persist about Mr. Reagan's role as a union negotiator, he does not seem to appreciate the difference between collective bargaining in labor-management relations and collaborative problem solving. Unlike labor negotiations, the President's meetings with Congressional leaders are not supposed to be based on conflicting ends, although there may be differences about the means chosen to attain them. The talks are not poker games, campaign debates or even superpower summit meetings, in which each of the parties uses strategies and bargaining chips to come out ahead of ''the other fellows.'' In such meetings, Congressional leaders are not the other side or the other fellows, but partners, presumably engaged with the President in attempts to find solutions to problems that are proving to be extremely critical for the nation as a whole on both the economic and foreign policy fronts. The objective should not be for either some macho conquest or childish one-upmanship, but serious and open-minded thought and deliberation. The country has far too much at stake for these meetings to be anything else. CHARLES S. LEVY Flushing, Queens, Oct. 25, 1987

1424-> AID SHIFT TO YOUNG WEIGHED
The Reagan Administration will consider shifting more Federal aid to educate younger children, as recommended by a prominent business group, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett says. ''We believe that for disadvantaged children early intervention can help, can make a big difference, provided you bring the family along with them,'' Mr. Bennett said. His comments, made Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' came in response to a report by the Committee for Economic Development that calls for preschool programs for all educationally disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds, quality child-care programs, parenting education and prenatal and postnatal care for pregnant teen-agers. ''We're happy to take a look at this and think about redeploying some of our funds at that early level,'' the Education Secretary said. Threat to Nation Is Seen Mr. Bennett said that $308 billion would be spent on education in the school year that is just beginning, and that it ''ought to be enough.'' But priorities might be shifted to include more funds for programs to educate younger children, he said. The 87-page report, titled ''Children in Need: Investment Strategies for the Educationally Disadvantaged,'' warns that allowing these children to fail ''will not only impoverish these children, it will impoverish our nation -culturally, politically, economically.'' The report is to be made public Tuesday. The committee, which is made up of the nation's top corporate executives, said that if schools imposed higher standards but failed to provide special help to meet those standards, one million students would drop out and up to 700,000 would graduate without the skills necessary for higher education or employment. Mr. Bennett said his department had taken a hard look at its program for educationally disadvantaged children, and ''suggested moving the grants to children at a younger age.'' Rich Dividends Foreseen Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who appeared on the program from Little Rock, Ark., said an investment of a few hundred million dollars in the plan would pay rich dividends.

1427-> National Horse Show; Spirited Puissance Ends in a Tie at 7-5
The National Horse Show's $10,000 puissance stake, an event that pits horse and rider against a wall far too tall to be seen over, was so diligently contested last night at Madison Square Garden that four jumpoff rounds were needed before two co-champions - Buddy Brown on Aramis and Nick Skelton on Raffles Apollo - emerged. The winning height, 7 feet 5 inches, was a personal best for both horses, although it was 2 1/2 inches below the indoor record set by Anthony D'Ambrosio atop the late Sweet 'n' Low at Washington in 1983. The puissance is a normal open-jumping obstacle course with the addition of an imitation stone wall, the top blocks of which are raised higher with each successive jumpoff. Skelton, a veteran member of the British grand prix team who is expected to compete in the 1988 Olympics, and Brown, who has ridden for the United States at the Pan American Games, used different methods to survive the growth of the wall from its opening height of 5 feet 11 inches. Brown, a rider from Oyster Bay, L.I., piloted his 10-year-old Hanoverian slowly and methodically over the course, and began his approach to the wall at a trot. Last week, the pair had jumped a 7-foot-2-inch wall at Washington before a knockdown, and Brown sensed that Aramis was agreeable to last night's height. ''Because of what happened at Washington, I figured he'd pay more attention tonight,'' said Brown, who had not won a puissance here before. Skelton's horse took a more excitable course, virtually charging at the wall in the final round. ''He'd never done that height before, but he was jumping well, so I figured I'd let him have a go at it,'' said Skelton. ''Before, I'd always held him back a bit, but tonight I changed my ways and let him go, and I think it relaxed him.'' Leones Strike Out The event was not as productive for Peter and Mark Leone, two brothers in a tandem entry who rode horses owned and stabled at their family's farm in Franklin Lakes, N.J. Mark's horse, Gumby, a newcomer to the event, knocked down the wall at its preliminary height, while Joe, a frisky horse Peter rides with some trepidation, bucked his way through the opening round but knocked down the wall at its second height, 6 feet 5 inches. Team Leone was missing the services of a third brother, Armand, who has married and relocated in Australia, but the two younger brothers approached the puissance with great expectations. Neither was riding a reliable mount, but neither seemed particularly concerned yesterday before the competition. Peter, a 27-year-old financial consultant for Merrill Lynch, said that the recent roller-coaster atmosphere on Wall Street had him ready for the bumpy ride he anticipated on Joe, a 10-year-old Irish-bred jumper with a penchant for bucking his way over -and occasionally through - jumps. ''He's spirited and colorful, and the crowd loves the way he bucks and kicks around the course, but I wish Joe weren't quite as crazy,'' said Peter Leone, who won the speed stake Wednesday on Oxo, his grand prix mount. ''But it's either ride Joe or sit and watch, and since this is New York, I want to give it a try.'' The rider said he was only concerned about Joe's quirky temper. ''If you have the right type of horse, jumping a seven-foot wall is not such a problem,'' he explained, ''but the difference between riding a puissance specialist and a plain utility horse is like the difference between going out on rough seas in an ocean liner or a Boston Whaler.'' Mark Leone, who is two years younger than Peter, had to bring in a substitute at the last minute after his scheduled mount, Tarco, came down with a respiratory ailment. Gumby, an 8-year-old, had never competed in a puissance. The rider said that he wasn't concerned about Gumby's reaction to the wall. ''He's handled that before; I'm more worried about his reaction to the crowd,'' Leone said. ''This is pretty much a spectator event, and it'll be new for him.'' Although most of the horses entered in the event are familiar with a 6-foot fence, few approach the 7-foot wall with any degree of security. ''It's not something you can practice at home,'' said Mark Leone. ''When you get up to the 7-foot club, that's when the horses with weak hearts give out, but the horse with a little dare will stay in.''

1428-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; The Desperate Giants
IN the return of real pro football, the real Giants finally stood up. Not just the real Giants who wore Super Bowl XXI rings on the picket line during the recent strike, but the real Giants who earned those rings with a 12-game winning streak. In their Giants Stadium locker room, somebody had chalked, ''We Don't Have a Choice -We Must Win.'' And win the real Giants did. Burdened with an 0-5 start to which they had contributed an 0-2 sleepwalk, the real Giants responded with urgency yesterday, demolishing the St. Louis Cardinals, 30-7. And in retrospect, that 0-5 record might be the best thing to have happened to the real Giants this season. If they had resumed the season with, say, a 2-3 record, they might have assumed that they could still catch the Washington Redskins in the National Conference East, just as they assumed they would somehow beat the Dallas Cowboys five weeks ago - until they lost that game. But at 0-5, the Giants didn't dare assume anything yesterday. They were desperate. And they played desperately. ''When we lost to Dallas, it left a bitter taste,'' Harry Carson, the 34-year-old linebacker, was saying at his locker. ''We felt we should've won that game. But now we don't have time to regret not giving our best effort. Now, we understand the position we're in.'' Even with their 1-5 record, the Giants don't dare assume anything. About all that Bill Parcells would say about yesterday's victory was that ''we played pretty well in all phases.'' But the Giants' coach knows that any team's performance in the National Football League is relative to the quality of the opponent. And with a 2-4 record now, the Cardinals are not exactly considered a Super Bowl contender. Neither are the Dallas Cowboys, but next Monday night in Texas Stadium, the Cowboys will be more of a test for the Giants than the Cardinals were. ''But this game gets us started,'' Parcells said. ''Is this,'' somebody asked, ''a new beginning?'' ''I don't know about that,'' the coach said with a cool stare. Bill Parcells appears to be using that same cool stare to motivate his real Giant players after coping with what he often described as the ''frustration'' of the imposter Giants who lost all three of their games. In the real Giants' drive to Super Bowl XXI last season, Parcells was the good-guy coach who shrugged off the Gatorade shower after each victory. But not now. ''We decided in July that the Gatorade is over, the Gatorade was last year,'' Carson said. ''But I think if I had drenched the coach after this game, he would've punched me.'' The coach's cool stare had his team playing the way it did late last season. The defense, notably Leonard Marshall and Carl Banks, had a shutout until the final minutes. Phil Simms completed 17 of 21 passes for 253 yards and three touchdowns, with no interceptions. Joe Morris darted through big holes for 88 yards. And the offense displayed a new weapon: George Adams, the new starting fullback, who caught six passes for 78 yards, rushed for 24 yards in only five carries and blocked effectively. ''We don't have Karl Nelson and Chris Godfrey on our offensive line, so we're doing different things,'' Ron Ehrhardt, the Giants' offensive coordinator, said of the ailing right tackle and right guard. ''Adams catching those passes. Mowatt. Bavaro.'' More than ever before, the Giants used both Mark Bavaro and Zeke Mowatt in a two-tight-end formation. After two dull games in the 0-2 start, Bavaro caught three passes for 38 yards and one touchdown. Mowatt caught two passes for 38 yards. In all, Simms hit eight different receivers, including Lionel Manuel twice for touchdowns. ''We tried to use George as a receiver in Chicago, but it didn't work - but it worked this time,'' Simms said. ''It worked today. The Cardinals gave us George and we took it.'' Now that the Cowboys have seen Simms throw to Adams, those passes might not be there for the taking next Monday night. But whether those passes are there or not, the Giants know they must keep winning if they are to make a run at the playoffs. In the National Conference East, they still trail the first-place Redskins by four games. And of the Giants' remaining nine games, only one is with the Redskins, on Nov. 29 in Washington. ''We know we got to win ten in a row,'' Lawrence Taylor said. ''And by God, we're going to try to do it. One mistake and we could be out of it. Every week, we've got to find a new kind of intensity. It's hard to know if everybody is up to that kind of pressure. We just got to stick together and play hard.'' The day before the 24-day strike ended, Taylor reported and played in the 6-3 loss in Buffalo a week ago. But according to Billy Ard, the guard, whatever hard feelings some Giants may have had about Taylor no longer exist. Ard called Taylor ''a different bird,'' and added that with ''any other person, it might be different, but L.T. played hard - he's a great football player.'' Ard didn't even resent some of the Cardinals' picket-line crossers. ''I kept telling myself I was going to get E.J. Junior and Curtis Greer,'' Ard said, ''but once the game started, I told myself, 'Oh, forget it.' '' Even before the game started, the 74,391 spectators seemed to be saying, ''Oh, forget it.'' When the Giants' offensive unit was introduced, the cheers were more welcoming than enthusiastic. But hardly a boo was heard. Real pro football had returned. So had the real Giants.

1429-> TAX LAW AND ART GIFTS
The announcement last Wednesday by a philanthropist and art dealer that he would sell Vincent van Gogh's ''Irises,'' rather than donate the painting to the small Maine college it has been on loan to for the last decade, is the first public evidence that the current art boom and changes in the Federal tax law may result in a cutback in gifts to museums this year. The decision by the philanthropist, John Whitney Payson, to consign to auction van Gogh's 1889 landscape was made, he said, after ''the recent and unprecedented spiral in art prices'' and the reduced benefit to donors under the 1986 Tax Reform Act necessitated a re-evaluation of his art holdings. Mr. Payson may not be alone in his decision to sell rather than donate. In interviews with auctioneers, art dealers, lawyers and museum officials since the announcement, several have said they expected donations to museums to be down this year. ''The jury is still out because it is too early to know for sure,'' said a prominent art lawyer, Eugene Vogel, a partner in Rosenman & Colin, a firm specializing in the art field. ''But I would certainly expect to see a reduction in gifts, both cash and property. Why? It is simple: we have a lower tax rate.'' Soaring Values, Soaring Costs Mr. Payson cited other concerns for selling. ''I made the decision to sell the flagship of the collection because this painting had become too valuable to loan to other institutions,'' he said. The 27 other artworks he inherited with the van Gogh in 1975 from his mother, Joan Whitney Payson, art collector, philanthropist and owner of the New York Mets, will remain on loan to Westbrook College in Portland, Me. Soaring values for artworks -especially van Gogh paintings -have increased insurance and security costs, he added. Two van Gogh paintings were auctioned this year at Christie's in London for extraordinary prices - ''Sunflowers,'' brought $39.9 million in March and ''Bridge of Trinquetaille,'' $20.2 million in June. ''Irises,'' a ravishing, light-washed study of a field of purple flowers and one white bloom, is to be auctioned at Sotheby's Nov. 11 and is expected to sell for between $20 and $39 million, according to David Nash, who heads fine-art sales at the auction house. Mr. Nash said Mr. Payson's twofold explanation for why he was selling represented a first. Mr. Nash said most people who have consigned artworks seem motivated by the increased volume in sales and the high prices achieved, ''not the tax consequences.'' Tax Effect: Too Soon to Tell The same is true at Christie's, according to its president, Christopher Burge. ''Lawyers have said 'I bet the new tax laws will help your business,' '' he said. ''But to my knowledge, not a single major work of art has come to us because of this issue. One has a faint suspicion that perhaps the real reason people are selling art is because a painting is suddenly worth $30 million. But that may sound a tiny bit greedy to cite as a reason for selling.'' Most museum officials declined to comment or said they were not certain whether there would be cutbacks in art gifts because of the reduced tax incentives. ''We have not seen anything that we can put our finger on in any way,'' said a spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, John Ross. ''We feel it is a little too soon to evaluate any effect of the new tax situation on donors.'' Fewer Large Gifts Expected Mr. Vogel agreed. ''You don't ever see anyone give for tax-motivated reasons in June,'' he said. ''Giving a painting on Dec. 30 gives you the same benefit as in June. More important, if you have the painting on the wall, you have an option to change your mind until the end of the year. I expect there will be fewer gifts of an intermediate size this year. This does not apply to major collectors who have nonfinancial reasons for doing it or who have an estate reason for making a gift.'' Tax rates today, Mr. Vogel said, are in sharp contrast to a decade ago when art gifts represented a 70 percent tax benefit. ''Some people even made money on charitable donations then,'' he said. ''The rates dropped to 50 percent and now to 38. Any gift you will make next year when the top tax rate drops to 28 percent, the United States Government will contribute 28 percent of the value.'' Using the Alternative Mr. Payson has a lower tax rate and saving on gifts of 21 percent, because he is in what is called the alternative minimum tax position, according to his attorney, Patrick Daniel Martin of Nixon Hargrave Devons & Doyle. Taxpayers who pay an alternative minumum tax compute their taxes in two ways: under the prevailing rates and under the provisions of the alternative minimum tax. This alternative position, which is not unusual today for wealthy art collectors with heavily sheltered property, specifies that the taxpayer must pay the higher of the two tax figures. The saving under the alternative position is determined on the tax basis of the property in question - in this case, the value of ''Irises'' -when inherited or acquired, not its appreciated worth or current market value. The painting, with the 27 others, was appraised at a total of about $5 million in 1975, Mr. Martin said, adding that ''Irises'' was appraised at less than $1 million. An art dealer, Richard L. Feigen, said the current tax rates are probably only temporary. ''Nobody expects that these rates will stay the way they are beyond the end of this Administration,'' he said. In his view, the decision to sell now seems motivated by the current boom in art sales. ''The point is that this is such a massive amount of money and Mr. Payson is one of the minority of people who own a van Gogh and he may feel the bubble will burst.'' At the Art Dealers Association, art appraisals on gifts to museums are completed between October and December, according to administrative vice president, Gilbert S. Edelson. ''My hunch is that there will be fewer donations this year,'' he said. ''We had a record number of appraisals of works being given to museums last year - about 30 percent more than in 1985. These people said they wanted to donate in 1986 because of the pending change in the capital gains tax. These are works that might have been given away in 1986, 1987 or 1988.'' Mr. Edelson said the Tax Reform Act would not deter all art gifts. ''There are people who will want to give to museums for a variety of reasons irrespective of the tax consequences,'' he said.

1430-> Survival Test Makes a City A Wilderness
A frigid autumn night had fallen over the high grass of the Gateway National Recreation Area in southeastern Brooklyn, and Ary Hernandez was alone. From a tongue of sand jutting into the salty waters of Jamaica Bay, she crouched at the shore's edge and peered out. On the horizon, Manhattan appeared bright and quiet and distant. ''I looked at the stars and listened to the water,'' Miss Hernandez, a junior at South Bronx High School who is more accustomed to listening to the radio than to nature, recalled recently. ''I looked at the city and started seeing it in a different way.'' Dotted along Gateway's shore and flatlands last week, almost a dozen others like Miss Hernandez completed an exercise in solitude and survival, living on the streets and in the parks of New York City for four days and three nights without their credit cards or own money. Some Were young and others much older. Among them were executives, educators and, like Miss Hernandez, teen-age students with after-school jobs. And in the four days of the experi-ment Outward Bound course, each of those New Yorkers had confronted a city that had - sometimes subtly, sometimes shockingly - become dif-ferent. Outward Bound, a program that has traditionally taught self-discovery and cooperation through backpacking and rock climbing in the nation's woods and rocklands, is venturing into the urban wilderness. ''You bring a program like this into the city and you use the wilderness of the city as a course area just like you use the mountains and the sea,'' explained Gregory Farrell, a veteran of the program, which has been bringing together people to enhance understanding for nearly 50 years. Where North Carolina has towering cedar and spruce trees, New York offers a forest of high-rise steel and glass. A subway station can seem as damp and mysterious as a cave in the Middle West. Outward Bound's arrival in New York is part of a recent movement to re-establish the organization's commitment to serving the troubled and disadvantaged; new programs have also sprung up in such cities as Baltimore, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Los Angeles. New York City has long been considered a prime location for Outward Bound, said Mr. Farrell, executive director of the Fund for the City of New York, a nonprofit foundation that works with Outward Bound. In a city increasingly divided by poverty and racial strife, the New York City Outward Bound Center would have ample opportunities to apply its philosophy of healing through working together, he said. ''What Outward Bound is about at base is compassionate service,'' said Mr. Farrell. ''The whole point of going through these expeditionary things in the wilderness is not to become a mountaineer, but to come into another relationship with your fellow man.'' Cajoling for Food For now, operating on a first-year budget of about $250,000 - half provided by the city - Outward Bound will run monthly pilot programs in New York through next July. Although participation is now by invitation only and is limited to people with considerable Outward Bound experience, the cost is $250 for four days for those who can afford to pay, said Outward Bound officials. In two journeys in recent weeks, Outward Bound instructors sent 60 people out across the face of the city. Rising every morning at 6, three crews of 12 people each experienced New York without benefit of beds and bathing. Voluntarily stripped of their credit cards, workday identities and almost all of their cash, urban dwellers were hammered into urban adventurers with only one change of clothes. Transportation was managed by foot, subway and occasionally by van, row boat and canoe. Meals were communal, forcing the crew to test its resources, wits and patience. One night, the bright bustling streets of Chinatown seemed strangely dark and unfeeling. The crew had been given $20 to provide dinner for its 12 members. Tired of cold cuts and peanut butter, the crew had decided to have Chinese food. But several modest restaurants refused to serve a dozen people for so little money. After almost an hour, the group was treated to the begrudging charity of a restaurant that agreed to try to accommodate them. Days later, Hector (Ivan) Mercado served a tepid spoonful of canned beef stew to his crew taking a lunch break on a tiny island in Jamaica Bay. ''Isn't this great?'' he chuckled. His crew had hiked through ravines of vacant tenement houses, camped on the city's sandy fringe and scaled the rock outcroppings of Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan. Along the way, it explored deteriorating neighborhoods, stopping to interview residents and to collect artifacts for discussion. The crew also spent Oct. 18 helping to paint and refurbish an apartment for homeless young men. ''We were in that house all day,'' recalled Helen Hill Updike, a former educator and a partner in a midtown investment management company. ''The boys became real people to us. The texture of their lives became clear.'' As is becoming customary, the New York City Outward Bound course began beneath the old prow of the Peking, a four-masked bark permanently moored at the South Street Seaport. At the swell of its stern, 30 people dressed in jeans and zip-up jackets huddled at dusk. In the background, the sounds and sights of the seaport seemed especially festive. It was the Friday before ''Black Monday.'' Young Wall Streeters drank and dined with abandon in watering holes that smelled of old liquor and new money. On the Peking's deck the air was foul with the scent of ripe fish. ''Look, that's cute,'' Miss Hernandez said as a tugboat loud with a party passed by. Amid the beat of a Whitney Houston song, the poetry of T. S. Eliot and Walt Whitman were read aloud. Earlier in the evening, the group had been divided into three groups of 10 people with 2 Outward Bound instructors. Partners were assigned, intentionally creating pairings of people with vastly different ages and backgrounds. ''I want you to get to know your partners,'' said John Allison, a bearded former Long Island high school teacher and leader of an Outward Bound crew. In some cases his request appeared too difficult to grant. ''I don't like your ways,'' a 16-year-old told her considerably older and well-educated partner. Miss Hernandez, 17, said she thought her partner, a 33-year-old newspaper reporter, was ''boring.'' Nonetheless, Virginia de los Santos, a 22-year-old co-leader of a group, said the pairings are particularly good for minority youths. ''It helps these students see that the adults are human beings,'' Ms. de los Santos said. ''They will not be afraid of them when they go out into the world. They won't be intimidated.'' By midnight, Mr. Allison's crew slipped into life jackets and into the Monomoy, a World War II vintage life boat. After some brief instruction, the crew - five women and seven men of which four were white, one black, two Chinese and five Hispanic - rowed into the lilting black of the East River. Learing to Row in Unison Sanna Randolph, 45 years old and a crew co-leader, sat near the stern. Looking back at lower Manhattan, she said she ''fell in love with New York all over again.'' But her gaze was strained by her struggle to row the heavy oars in time with the others. ''It felt like we were crossing swords,'' said Ms. Randolph, a Harvard educated consultant for the City Volunteer Corps. ''I couldn't imagine how we could all row in unison. But at times, we did.'' Three nights later, at a Greek restaurant near Columbia University, the program came to an end. One-time strangers now ate from the same plates. Some giggled like children when they relived the crashing conclusion of a canoe race. Some talked about embarrassing moments, gaffes of poor taste and insensitivity. But mostly the Outward Bound crews talked like friends, noted Tony Lopez, a 25-year-old director with the I Have A Dream Foundation, a nonprofit educational goup in Manhattan. Mr. Lopez had just completed the course. ''I never thought I could get so close, almost like family, to 11 'strangers,' '' he said. ''I found that really remarkable - intense.''

1431-> CUBAN PRISONERS IN ATLANTA TAKE 25 MORE HOSTAGES
In less than an hour early today, rioting Cuban inmates released five hostages from a prison in Atlanta, then seized another 25. That left about 125 hostages in the hands of Cuban prisoners controlling prisons here and at Oakdale, La. Sylvia Simons, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, said officials believed the inmates in Atlanta were holding 94 hostages after the flurry of moves between 11:30 Tuesday and 12:15 A.M today. She said that while one group of inmates was releasing five hostages, another group seized 25 staff members in the prison hospital, which apparently had been isolated since the takeover began Monday. Inmates quickly released one of the 25 because of a medical problem, she said. Little Hope for Quick End Even after the five hostages were released, Ms. Simons said, Federal officials had not altered their view that there was little hope for a quick end to the sieges. ''It might be a gesture of good faith,'' she said of the releases, ''or it might just be game-playing.'' Outside the Atlanta prison, there was little evidence of the taking of addtional hostages. Fire trucks, which had been stationed in front of the prison. exited in a routine manner, and guards at the gates showed no unusual action. Short-wave radio scanners being monitored outside the prison also indicated little change in activity. On Tuesday, a guard who suffered from high blood pressure was set free by prisoners at the Atlanta penitentiary. Since the siege began here Monday morning, 315 prisoners have surrendered officials said. Some were Cubans and some were American prisoners. Two hundred American inmates who had turned themselves in were escorted in handcuffs out of the prison Tuesday afternoon and onto buses. Later Tuesday, about 100 inmates were flown to the Federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., Tom Delaney, a spokesman for that facility, told The Associated Press. The five hostages who were released this morning were in good condition, Ms. Simons said. ''Their spirits seemed to be good, and they were shaking hands with everybody,'' she said, referring to other prison employees. She said she could offer no further details until officials had finished speaking with the released hostages. Negotiations at 'Standstill' On Tuesday Joseph Petrovsky, warden of the Atlanta prison, said at a news conference that negotiations were at a ''standstill'' because of shifting leadership and the multiple demands of the 1,400 Cuban inmates. In Louisiana, an official at the Oakdale detention center predicted it would take ''some time'' to persuade inmates to trust Government assurances of a moratorium on the deportations called for under an agreement reached last week between the United States and Cuba. Fears of being sent back to Cuba set off the riots that began Saturday night at the Oakdale facility and erupted at here on Monday. Both prisons have been heavily damaged. In Atlanta, Mr. Petrovsky said that one Cuban prisoner, whom he would not identify, had died of gunshot wounds and that three prison staff members had been injured. He said he knew nothing of earlier reports that as many as six people had been killed. Shortly after 6 P.M. Tuesday, law-enforcement agents began climbing ladders they had placed against the 37-foot walls of the prison. From conversations on police radios, it appeared the agents were concerned that at least one faction of Cuban inmates were planning to seize the prison hospital. However, the agents soon climbed down from the ladders. Precautions at Other Prisons Also in Washington, Federal prison officials said they had taken precautions at 24 other Federal prisons and ''separated and locked-down'' any detained Cubans among the prison population. In some of the prisons, that meant that the one or two Cubans being held were separated and confined to their cells, the spokesman said. Helicopters hovered over the prison here trailing huge buckets containing 250 gallons of water, which they dropped on the smoldering fires at the complex. Mr. Petrovsky would not discuss the circumstances surrounding the death of the Cuban inmate, but he said the man suffered gunshot wounds. Federal negotiators believed the inmates had only makeshift weapons and no firearms. In Oakdale, 28 hostages were still being held Tuesday by about 1,000 inmates. About 30 inmates and workers suffered minor injuries over the weekend there. At one point officials used high-pressure hoses to knock down a makeshift barricade erected by the inmates near the entrance. Families of the Louisiana inmates said that an end to the rioting there depended on two elements: whether the Cubans could be persuaded to trust Government assurances that there would be a moratorium on any deportations, and a continuation of individual hearings to determine whether the detained Cubans can be released to live in halfway houses or with relatives in the United States. J. R. Johnson, warden of the two-year-old center, said Tuesday that it would take ''some time'' to convince inmates that ''they can believe what's been told to them.'' Wary of Moratorium Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d pledged on Monday to declare a moratorium on any deportation under the agreement with Cuba if the inmates ended their sieges. According to Mr. Petrovsky, the Atlanta inmates appeared to be wary of the Government's assurances. ''Obviously they are not buying Mr. Meese's moratorium,'' he said. In Washington, Ramon Sanchez Parodi, chief of the Cuban interests section, said tonight that his country welcomed the prisoners' return and that no reprisals would be taken against them. ''They will be exonerated from illegal activities they might have committed before their departure from Cuba,'' Mr. Parodi said in a statement. That those who do not have records of mental problems would be permitted to resume their lives in Cuba. He said that Cuban authorities would rely on American medical records to determine who would be committed for treatment. Mr. Parodi said those Cubans who already have returned have been well treated. ''If you want to go there and talk with them, you are welcome,'' he told reporters. Periodic Review of Status Since the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States, about 10,000 of them have been imprisoned for crimes committed in this country, because of mental illness or because of suspicion of criminal activity in Cuba. Under immigration law the Cubans are classified as excludable and subject to indefinite detention after serving sentences for their crimes. In 1984 the Reagan Administration signed an agreement with Cuba to deport 2,746 of the excludable aliens. But after 201 of them were returned, the agreement foundered in May 1985 after the United States began radio broadcasts aimed at Cuba. In the absence of a deportation agreement, immigration officials have held the Cubans in prisons around country and granted them periodic reviews of their status. About 3,000 inmates, in fact, have been sent to halfway houses or are living with their families. '12 Sets of Leaders' At the prison here, situated next to a residential area in the southeast part of the city, a single plume of dense smoke rose from the 23-acre complex's east wing. A half-dozen ambulances were parked in the curving driveway and three helicopters sat on the grass just inside the fenced-in prison grounds. Correction officers carrying shotguns or automatic rifles guarded entrances to the prison. In his briefing Mr. Petrovsky said that 315 of the prisons inmates had turned themselves in since the rioting began. Among those were many of the Americans imprisoned here. Late in the afternoon at least buses loaded with inmates drove out of the prison, and as they passed the wives and family members of some of the inmates gathered behind police barricades across the street, a shout of ''Libertad,'' or Liberty, rose from the crowd. The warden said that at various times since the riot started at 10:15 A.M. Monday there had been ''12 sets of leaders'' negotiation with officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

1432-> THE MARKET PLUNGE; Fall Stuns Corporate Leaders
Leaders of major American companies were shaken by the stock market plunge yesterday that wiped out vast amounts of their enterprises' market value and caught them as much by surprise as it did most investors. But many of them expressed confidence that the economy is fundamentally sound and said they hoped the markets would rise and behave more rationally after the panic has passed. ''I have never experienced anything like this, so it is difficult to have clear vision,'' said Robert E. Allen, president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, whose shares are among the most widely held in the nation. ''I don't understand it in terms of the fundamentals of the economy.'' Confidence in the Economy United States business in general is healthy and corporate earnings prospects are good, said David T. Kearns, chairman and chief executive of the Xerox Corporation, mentioning economic indicators that are often keys to stock market performance. ''We are confident in the underlying economy and hope the stock market will soon reflect an understanding of that strength.'' Thomas G. Labrecque, president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, said of the panic: ''The fundamentals don't call for it. The activity far exceeds the facts.'' ''We believe it is an overreaction,'' said John A. Rolls, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the United Technologies Corporation, in a statement. ''We don't know how to interpret it, and we don't think anyone else does either.'' Several of the country's top corporations and business leaders offered explanations for the huge shudder in the market, and there was a diversity of opinion. The International Business Machines Corporation issued a statement that said a large part of the tumble was caused by investors' concerns about events in the Persian Gulf and panic selling by people who were anxious to cash in on unusual profits from the long bull market. Iacocca Criticizes Deficits The Chrysler Corporation's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, attributed the drop to the Federal budget and trade deficits. ''The borrowing has to stop,'' he said. The market slide was a shot ''right between the eyes that had better wake us all up to the simple fact that we can't keep romping forever on borrowed money.'' He said that the way to avoid further panic was for the President and other political leaders to act immediately to cut Government spending and increase revenues. Charles E. Hugel, chief executive of Combustion Engineering Inc., said that much of the strength in the stock market recently came from investors from Europe and Japan. ''I think the weakening of the dollar has caused a withdrawal of investment,'' he said. ''This has an impact on the stock market but not necessarily on the strength of business.'' Whatever the cause of the huge Wall Street fall, executives said they were sobered by it. Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chief executive of Pfizer Inc., the big drug maker, said he had just come out of a staff meeting to assess the situation. Pfizer shareholders lost $1.7 billion in the value of their shares during yesterday's wild trading. Mr. Pratt ticked off a series of indications that the business economy is healthy and reasons that stocks should recover. All the same, he said, ''it's not very reassuring because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.'' Like Yelling 'Fire!' Andrew S. Grove, president and chief executive of the Intel Corporation, the computer chip manufacturer, said that an unusually high level of herd behavior by investors had contributed to the volatility. ''There is so much psychological togetherness that seems to have worked both on the up side and on the down side,'' he said. ''It's a little like a theater where someone yells 'Fire!' '' Even those who said they normally see little real economic impact from dramatic stock market fluctuations worried about the aftershocks of this one. ''I've always separated the real world from the stock market,'' said Maurice Segall, chief executive of the Zayre Corporation, one of the nation's largest discount retailers. ''But when the stock market drops 500 points, it means that a significant part of the American net worth has been erased.''

1438-> PROSPECTS
A Beneficiary Boom Already the most courted demographic group in America's history, the baby boom generation is poised to acquire more assets - the easy way. ''Since their parents have accumulated more than any preceding generation, many baby boomers can expect to become heirs to substantial wealth,'' said Fabian Linden, consumer research director at the Conference Board. The boomers' parents, many of whom entered the labor force just after World War II, lived through an unprecedented era of prosperity, Mr. Linden said, adding that per capita income ''more than doubled between 1945 and 1985.'' Now, people over 65, who account for 20 percent of all households, hold 40 percent, or $1 trillion, of the nation's personal financial assets. And ''they aren't going to live forever,'' Mr. Linden said. One asset that the beneficiaries of this wealth could acquire: a home. Rising prices and mortgage rates have kept many baby boomers from buying a house. Now, Mr. Linden says, as rates ease and boomers reach the age of inheritance, all but a small number will become homeowners. The Coupon Wars More than 200 billion ''cents-off'' coupons were distributed through magazines and newspapers last year, up 13 percent from 1985. But the coupon redemption rate is stuck between 3.6 and 3.9 percent, and this means coupons are mostly rewarding current customers, not attracting new ones, said Philip Lempert of the Lempert Company, a food industry consultant. Now, to get new customers, some companies are using direct marketing firms to survey consumer preferences and then mailing coupons to their competitors' customers. The targeted couponing costs about $150 per thousand, more than 20 times the cost of general distribution. ''But those experimenting with it are having great results,'' Mr. Lempert said. Companies are using other new tactics, too. Some focus on Spanish-language publications, since studies show that Hispanic consumers redeem coupons twice as often as non-Hispanic consumers. And soon, Mr. Lempert predicts, supermarket check-out scanners will monitor the redeeming. If they want to, he said, companies will be able to target ''people in yellow houses who live on the left side of the street.'' Office Parties Persist Losses, layoffs and mergers may loom on Wall Street in the wake of the market plunge, but the annual Christmas parties may be as festive as ever. An informal survey of caterers and their clients discloses no extensive plans for cutting back on holiday cheer. ''Everybody talks about it, but nothing happens,'' said Harry Poulakakos, the proprietor of Harry's at Hanover Square, a popular Wall Street bar. Mr. Poulakakos, who provides banquet rooms for annual fetes, says he had ''a couple of cancellations'' but that ''the rooms were rebooked instantly.'' Likewise at Windows on the World, where Wall Street firms this year account for roughly the same number of holiday reservations as they did last year - about 20 percent of the total. But Gail Draper, a restaurant spokeswoman, conceded that ''in our catering going to Wall Street, we have seen some declining numbers.'' Some firms, she says, are ordering less expensive menus or feeding fewer guests. The First Boston Corporation has dropped plans for its party, and will instead make a hefty contribution to charities. But a spokesman said the decision was entirely unrelated to the market.

1440-> New Brazil Inflation Record
Brazil's inflation rate soared to a record 365.96 percent in 1987, according to figures released today, easily beating the previous high of 233 percent of 1985. The rate was more than six times last year's 58.60 percent. Prices exploded this year in Brazil, the developing world's biggest debtor, after the collapse of a price freeze that had artifically contained rises for most of 1986. In May, consumer prices rose a monthly record of 23 percent. Today's figures show the biggest rises this year were 459 percent in the cost of housing and 401 percent in the cost of health and personal care. This year was the worst for the Brazilian economy since the recession of the early 1980's. Accompanying the surge in prices was a fall in the rate of growth in the gross domestic product, to around 3.5 percent from last year's 8.2 percent, while industrial production is calculated to have grown by only 1 percent this year. Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, an economist, resigned his post as Finance Minister on Dec. 18 after his plans to introduce tax changes and cut public spending were watered down by President Jose Sarney.

1441-> Giants (0-2) Leave Parcells Frustrated
Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants was in his office at 6:30 this morning watching tapes of Sunday's 16-14 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He watched for three hours, took a break and talked to his trainer about the many player injuries, one of which has put Lionel Manuel on injured reserve. Then he watched tapes again. He was not happy, not when the team that won Super Bowl XXI last January has started the new season with an 0-2 record. He said the word to describe his feelings was ''frustrated.'' ''I can't be too disappointed with the defense,'' he said, ''when it played 81 minutes for 80 plays and we made five turnovers and the Cowboys still scored only one touchdown. You'd think the score would be 35-10. Sailed Wide Left ''I thought we improved on defense and special teams. Offensively, we've scored only two touchdowns in two weeks when you come down to it. Yesterday, the defense put the ball on the 6-inch line, so you can't count that. That's where the problem is.'' With 1 minute 52 seconds left in the game, the Giants stopped Herschel Walker on fourth down and took possession on their 2-yard line. Phil Simms passed them upfield in a two-minute drive, but three passes went incomplete and Raul Allegre's 46-yard field-goal attempt for the winning field goal sailed wide left at the last moment. Parcells thought Allegre's kick was good and thrust his arms in the air in triumph. ''I didn't even follow the flight of the ball,'' said the coach. ''The kick was solid. I didn't know it missed until I saw the Dallas guys jumping up and down. I'm not mad at the kid, just frustrated.'' On two earlier possessions in the fourth quarter, Stephen Baker could not hold a pass from Phil Simms that would have gained 40 yards and Phil McConkey could not catch a pass that was just overthrown. Reasons Activated ''I thought they were both catchable against the blitz,'' said Parcells. ''We certainly had ample opportunities to win, not that we deserved to.'' Because of the injuries the Giants suffered against the Cowboys, Tuesday's scheduled strike of National Football League players complicated Parcells's planning. The two-week roster exemption for Gary Reasons, the starting inside linebacker who signed late, expired today. The Giants activated him and made room by deactivating Manuel, the starting flanker. Manuel broke his left wrist while tackling Everson Walls of the Cowboys after an interception. He must now sit out at least four weeks. The other serious injury was to Chris Godfrey's left knee. The starting offensive guard underwent tests today to determine the extent of the injury. He was on crutches and might be sidelined for weeks, with or without a strike. Barring a long strike, the Giants probably will seek an experienced replacement. Andy Headen was limping on a sprained left ankle. Greg Lasker had a bruised left shoulder and Harry Carson bruised ribs. Joe Morris and Lawrence Taylor took blows to the head. Parcells said Morris did not suffer a concussion, as first announced, but he did not know about Taylor. Kenny Hill said his previously bruised right knee was swollen again. 'Waiting for the Big Play' The Giants' offense has been so inconsistent that the running game has produced only 141 yards in two games, or 22 yards less than Terry Kinard's four interception returns. The Giants have injured psyches, too. ''We don't seem to have any confidence, any enthusiasm in the huddle,'' said Billy Ard, the offensive guard. ''It seems we're all waiting for the big play to happen, but you can't wait for someone else to do it.'' ''You get enthusiasm if you make good plays,'' Simms said. ''I wouldn't be enthusiastic, either.'' ''It doesn't seem right that we're 0-2,'' McConkey said. ''It's not something you work for. You expect continuity to be there and it's broke. But 0-2 isn't the end of the world. We're only one game out of first after two games.'' Still, the team that went through last year's regular season and playoffs with a 20-2 record is the only team in its division with a record other than 1-1. So when Parcells was asked if he was convinced he had a good team, he did not couch his feelings. ''No,'' he said, ''because I haven't seen solid evidence offensively. I think it can be done. Whether it will be done, I don't know.''

1445-> About Real Estate; Concert Aid Part of TriBeCa Campaign
Sipping very dry martinis one evening this week in one of TriBeCa's high-style restaurants, three artists-turned-developers - joined under the name L.M. Dalton Corporation -tried to articulate the reasoning behind their public-spirited marketing campaigns. To promote their new 72-unit condominium building, for example, which is at the corner of Chambers and Greenwich Streets, they have taken over the financing of a foundering summer concert series in the adjacent Washington Market Park, provided lighting for the tennis courts there and, for every apartment sold, are donating $50 to a scholarship fund at a nearby pre-school. ''It's part of the general philosophy of the company,'' said Anne Dalton, a Peace Corps graduate and former concert musician. ''We want to give something back to the community -we came out of the 60's.'' ''She means the 60's on the Upper East Side,'' teased her partner, Michael LaBadie, who was trained as an art photographer and seems to balance his partners' idealism. ''Seriously, from a business standpoint, it's a very logical thing to do. There is certainly an element of tit for tat. We do seek publicity.'' Even without the concert series and scholarship donations, which totaled $35,000, their new building, Dalton on Greenwich, would merit attention. The 11-story structure, designed by Beyer Blinder Belle of Manhattan to mimic the cast-iron buildings in the area, is in the Washington Market neighborhood of TriBeCa, five blocks north of the World Trade Center and a short walk from the Hudson River. It is a section where, less than a decade ago, buildings still resounded with the clamor of manufacturing. Then artists started taking over the giant loft spaces for studios. Now a new generation of buildings, well symbolized by Dalton on Greenwich, is growing up there - opulent residences with many of the amenities of the Upper East Side, such as 24-hour doormen, mahogany-clad lobbies and microwave ovens. But these condominiums have a definitive downtown spirit, as evidenced by the modern yet understated designs and the slightly more manageable prices. Apartments here, for instance, will average about $320 a square foot, compared with the $350 typical of new ''luxury'' construction uptown in Manhattan. Twenty-two studios, averaging 480 square feet, will sell for $140,000 to $200,000; 33 one-bedrooms, at 670 square feet, will go for $180,000 to $325,000; 13 two-bedrooms, measuring 1,000 square feet, will range from $289,000 to $370,000, and four three-bedroom apartments, at 1,300 square feet, will cost from $480,000 to $650,000. So far, 30 units are under contract, and occupancy is planned for October. Two-thirds of the condominiums will have views either of the Hudson or the privately run Washington Market Park, which is a two-acre stretch of open lawn with myriad trees and flowers, enclosed by a wrought-iron Victorian-style fence. L.M. Dalton is also renovating three five-story manufacturing buildings into 12 loft condominiums, ranging from 1,200 to 1,500 square feet and selling for $300,000 to $700,000. Construction will begin next week on the structures, two on Reade Street, just behind the new building, and the third on Chambers Street. Occupancy is scheduled for April. The lofts, formally part of Dalton on Greenwich, will be accessible through the main building, where an interior landscaped courtyard - now a jumble of construction materials -will border all the loft buildings, leading to a common entrance. About 10,000 square feet of retail space is also planned for the project, with five or six convenience stores, leasing for $50 to $60 a square foot, fronting on Reade, Greenwich and Chambers Streets. The $20 million development -L.M. Dalton's first new construction in Manhattan - will soon be joined by another 11-story condominium building, developed by Joseph and Douglas Gardner, principals of P&J Realty of Manhattan. Scheduled to start rising next month on a parking lot at the corner of Reade and Greenwich Streets, next to Dalton on Greenwich, the red brick building will have 80 apartments and 9,000 square feet of retail space. And immediately south, on two block fronts along Greenwich Street between Chambers and Murray Streets, is a new 11-story condominium project, called Greenwich Court, with two buildings totaling 262 units. Developed by the Charles H. Shaw Company of Manhattan, the complex is now about 95 percent occupied, a company spokesman said. All of this construction is no coincidence. Besides the success of nearby Battery Park City, the four-block area from Murray to Reade Streets along Greenwich was rezoned a few years ago, allowing new residential buildings with a 100-foot height limitation. ''It's one of the most interesting pieces of Manhattan,'' said Philip Mendlow, a former film maker and L.M. Dalton's third partner and chief operating officer. ''There's such a diversity of commercial and manufacturing establishments. It's not all boutiqued-up.''

1446-> Gap Plunges $10.25; Lower Profit Seen
In a stock plunge that demonstrated Wall Street's obsession with quarterly earnings, The Gap Inc., a pace-setting apparel retailer, lost $10.25 a share, to $37, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in heavy trading. The rush to sell followed the company's disclosure over the weekend that its third-quarter earnings could range from 45 to 50 cents a share, compared with 60 cents a share last year. Yesterday's sell-off, together with an $8.625 drop on Friday, knocked the wind out of one of the best-performing stocks of the 1980's bull market. A Fallen Star By any standards, The Gap's stock had been a star, doubling this year by early August and rising sixfold over the course of the decade. Bad news hit The Gap's stock hard and fast. The Gap, whose clothing stores cater largely to the teen-age market, recently stunned analysts by informing them that its inventory had risen 50 percent because of sluggish sales as it entered the third quarter. Suddenly, earnings growth that had been increasing at an annual rate of 50 percent over the last three years no longer appeared to be on track. Then last Thursday, at a seminar held by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York, Donald G. Fisher, The Gap's chairman and chief executive, added to the concerns by noting that wholesale costs had risen 15 percent this year. On Friday, analysts who had generally been recommending The Gap's stock showed their dismay and quickly changed their recommendations from buy to sell or hold. And institutions that owned The Gap's shares began to dump them. 'An Industrywide Situation' The dramatic reversal of The Gap's image on Wall Street is a striking example of how those who recommend stocks can abruptly turn against them. ''I pulled The Gap's stock on Friday,'' said Michele Y. Davis, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''But it's an industrywide situation in which prices are going up and being passed on to the consumer, so that we can only expect profit margin erosion.'' ''The Gap raised its prices 15 percent for fall, but business had already turned difficult for the whole industry,'' said Robert Buchanan, an analyst for L. F. Rothschild & Company. But in a telephone interview, The Gap's president, Millard S. Drexler, contended: ''We had a bad August, and September is already much better. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this company except the bad back-to-school business last month, which affected everyone.'' And Alan E. Zimtbaum, The Gap's chief financial officer, who joined in the interview, asserted: ''What happened to our stock shows that, as a high-growth retailer, we've been under a continuous microscope. People have taken the weak August and extrapolated from that.'' Emphasis on Banana Republic With 784 stores in four divisions, the San Bruno, Calif., company gave special emphasis in recent years to its Banana Republic stores, a mail-order and specialty retailer of travel and safari clothing. Like other Gap stores, Banana Republic recently attracted negative questions from investors concerned with possible overexpansion and flattened sales in older outlets. But, Mr. Drexler said, ''the sluggishness of business in August affected the entire company.'' Referring to the Banana Republic stores, he added, ''We're continuing last year's new store openings of 30 this year, too.'' Mr. Zimtbaum declined to comment on reports that Banana Republic's older stores - those open a year or more - had shown no sales gain in the last two years. He noted, however, the company had previously said that sales at older Banana Republic stores could not be expected to exceed their ''extremely high first year.'' Consumer buying has been disappointing to the larger apparel chains, such as The Gap, The Limited Inc. and others, as well as to such giant department store chains as Sears, Roebuck & Company. These companies depend upon August and early September to produce considerable back-to-school business. For the industry as a whole, however, the most recent selling period came in with results that were flat or only slightly above last year, in part because of the decline over the last six months in consumer disposable income. Big Inventory Buildup The Gap was hurt worse than other retailers, however, largely because of a big inventory bulge at the end of the second quarter. That buildup was ''a deliberate move on our part because we had an aggressive sales plan in the third quarter,'' Mr. Drexler said. ''But there was literally no back-to-school bulge for us and many of the others. The jeans business and the corduroy bottoms business, both important to us, were very weak in August.'' Over the weekend, The Gap's management decided to respond to the queries regarding the big drop in the stock on Friday. But its statement that its third-quarter net income would decline sent the stock tumbling further yesterday. More than 3.6 million shares were traded, making The Gap the most active stock on the Big Board. Other retailing stocks also fell. The Gap also said on Sunday that, despite the anticipated decline in third-quarter earnings, it still expected sales and earnings this year to exceed last year's. Until now, The Gap has had few setbacks in its growth. The company was founded in 1969 by Mr. Fisher, an engineer who said he decided to ''fill the gap'' in the marketplace when he couldn't find a store that had the pair of slacks he wanted. His stores succeeded primarily by concentrating on selling jeans and slacks made by Levi Strauss & Company. Baby Boomers Grow Up But beginning in the early 1980's, as the baby boomers grew up and turned the jeans craze over to a smaller and younger audience, The Gap diversified into a full line of casual clothes. In 1983, it acquired Banana Republic and more recently started the Super Gap stores, larger versions of the basic Gap outlets, and Gap Kids for children's wear. The shifts gave The Gap two major retailing concepts - The Gap stores, with their private-label goods, and the Banana Republic stores, with their African safari-style clothing and lushly worded catalogues. To bolster sales, the company said on Sunday that it expected many retailers, including itself, to adopt aggressive sales promotions. Meanwhile, The Gap has been planning to improve the performance of its Banana Republic chain by shifting more toward travel apparel and away from the safari clothing, according to Mr. Drexler. ''There is a bigger market in travel,'' he said. As a result, he said, the term ''safari'' would eventually be removed from the division's full name, ''The Banana Republic Travel and Safari Clothing Company.''

1448-> KOCH'S PLAN FACES A TEST; Case Raises Questions In Homless Roundup
When Mayor Koch began an effort to hospitalize mentally ill homeless people against their will last month, he called it the ''single most important program'' of his administration. Instead of clarifying the issue, the case of Joyce Brown - the first person picked up under the program aimed at treating homeless people who cannot care for themselves - has sharpened the debate over how government should care for the homeless. Among the questions raised are: * Should people, even if deeply disturbed, be left alone to their eccentricities or to anti-social behavior on the street, if they are not in immediate danger? * Is the policy intended to help mentally ill people or, as some assert, to clean up an unsightly disorder? Why can't the city simply force homeless people to move on? * Is Miss Brown, who has used two fictitious names and has made up a past for herself, a sane, reasonable person, victimized by an overzealous bureaucracy anxious to please the Mayor? Or is she suffering from chronic mental illness, and likely to succumb rapidly to the elements? * Should homeless people, who may not belong in the hospital, be released if they have nowhere to go but the streets? Lucid and Articulate Above all the case of Miss Brown shows the difficulties that lawyers, psychiatrists and judges have in coming to an agreement on the basic facts in a case, especially where predictions about future behavior may be as important as past action. For nearly a year, Miss Brown, a 40-year-old former secretary and drug addict, had lived on a hot air exhaust vent at a restaurant on Second Avenue and 65th Street. She survived a winter on the streets, is in good physical health, appears lucid and articulate, eats well and has developed a network of supporters from the community. City psychiatrists, supported by Miss Brown's four sisters, say she, nonetheless, suffers from a serious mental ailment. She shouts abuse at passersby, defecates in her clothing, suffers from delusions and cuts and burns paper money. Without treatment, they say, she will get worse and probably die on the street. But the courts have held that vagrants cannot be arrested simply for being undesirable or different from other people. Other than issuing summonses, the city is hard put to enforce sanitation or zoning laws. To protect the rights of mentally ill people, state law sets up rigorous commitment procedures and gives each patient the right to a court hearing. Under the State Mental Hygiene Law, people who are mentally ill, in need of hospitalization and not a danger to others, can be involuntarily hospitalized only if they are putting themselves at risk. In the past this has often been interpreted to be at risk of immediate harm - death or injury in a matter of a day or two. But Mr. Koch's new program views the law broadly to include risk of harm ''within the foreseeable future.'' This broader standard, particularly as argued by the city in the case of Miss Brown, is based less on past harmful conduct than the conclusion that she is mentally ill and therefor likely to harm herself in the future. Simply because she survived last winter does not mean she can survive the next one, the city argued. Her lawyers and psychiatrists responded that since she survived last year in good shape, there is no reason to think that she is in risk of harm in the future. They said that when someone as intelligent as she decides to live on the street, she clearly has some problems. But so do many other people who are not taken into custody. They contend the city program may be more intended to clean up streets, than to help the most seriously mentally ill. But there is a strong argument on the other side. ''To be seriously mentally ill,'' said Dr. Luis Marcos, a psychiatrist and vice president for mental hygiene at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, ''and to have it not treated and deteriorate to the point of being dangerous to self or others, is not a right, it is a cruel neglect on the part of society.'' Miss Brown's lawyer, Robert Levy, said: ''Anyone who saw her on the witness stand would have to conclude that this is a lucid and rational woman who is down on her luck. Certainly not a danger to herself or others.'' Rational Explanations In the courtroom, Miss Brown, dressed neatly and speaking clearly, made the city's portrayal of her, though well intentioned, seem farfetched at best. She offered rational explanations for many of the actions cited by the city as evidence of psychosis. She said she used the street as a bathroom because the railroad stations were too far away. She shouted curses and sometimes chased city outreach workers - on one occasion throwing the contents of a bag lunch at them -because they had taken her in handcuffs to a hospital three times. City psychiatrists said they believed that Miss Brown had changed dramatically once removed from the terrors of the street and placed in the safe and structured life of the hospital ward. Going to court and finding lawyers, judges and even reporters willing to listen to her story may have also helped, they said. Of the 23 people hospitalized on a special ward at Bellevue so far, she is the only one who has pulled herself together so well, they said. The other 22 patients - including another woman who had a court hearing yesterday and was ordered held at the hospital -have clear cut symptoms and behavior patterns that make it clear that they fall within the limits of the commitment law, which has been repeatedly upheld in court, city officials said. That raises a question about why Miss Brown was picked up under the new program. Perhaps at least part of the explanation comes from a visit by Mayor Koch last May to six homeless people on the street, including Miss Brown. Karen Schwab, a City Hall aide overseeing the program, said that the Mayor was ''absolutely devastated'' by the visit and out of compassion was determined to do more to help people like Miss Brown. Some 'Loony' Advisers City officials who accompanied the Mayor that day said even then there were questions raised about whether Miss Brown needed to be hospitalized. The Mayor approached her, discovered that she knew his name and stood by while the city's mental health commissioner, Dr. Sara L. Kellermann questioned her about how she survived in the street. Miss Brown gave some plausible answers, officials recalled. Later Mr. Koch said he thought to himself that his advisers were ''loony'' when they told him the woman could not be hospitalized. Without the Mayor's interest, it seems unlikely that Miss Brown would have emerged as a test case of the issue. The advisers now say that while the decision to pick up Miss Brown was correct, they would have preferred to delay such a controversial case. ''One questions whether this woman was picked up because she was the focus of the Mayor's attention,'' Mr. Levy, Miss Brown's lawyer, said. Acting Justice Robert Lippmann of State Supreme Court in Manhattan is expected to rule by tomorrow. City officials said that if Miss Brown is released, they will offer her help in finding a place to live in a community residence or in locating housing. But they said she may choose to return to her spot on Second Avenue, where her presence would in all liklihood continue to pose a dilemma for those concerned about her welfare and others concerned about the neighborhood.

1452-> COMPANY NEWS; Carson to Buy Donaldson's
Carson Pirie Scott & Company said today that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Minneapolis-based Donaldson's Department Stores unit of the Allied Stores Corporation for $163.5 million. ''This fits real well,'' said George Strachan, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said the deal would increase efficiency because both chains could use the same distribution and buying systems. In recent months Carson has been pursuing a strategy of selling various businesses, such as food service and restaurants, to concentrate on retailing. Carson officials said that Donaldson's, which operates 15 stores in Minnesota and Iowa, appealed to the same market segments as Carson's stores. In the fiscal year 1986, Donaldson's reported net income of $15 million on revenues of $190 million. Since being acquired by the Campeau Corporation of Canada for about $3.5 billion last year, Allied has agreed to sell 14 of its 16 retail chains, including Bonwit Teller and Garfinckel's.

1453-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; A Remarkable Athlete
By major college standards, Tony Dawson of Florida State is neither a particularly quick basketball player nor an impressive jumper. But by any measure, Dawson is truly a remarkable athlete. Dawson, a 6-foot-7-inch junior forward, was hit by an automobile on three occasions as a youth. The third accident, when he was 7 years old, was the most serious, nearly forcing doctors to amputate his left foot. Since that time, he has had bone and skin surgically attached to his foot and a piece of bone from his hip moved to his left knee to correct a severe limp. Despite the pain and the fact that Dawson was not able to play basketball until his junior year in high school, he is the leading scorer for the Seminoles (4-3) with a 17.4 average and is one of the top newcomers in the Metro Conference. ''The first time I saw him play, I fell in love with him,'' said Pat Kennedy, the Florida State coach. ''He can flat out play against anyone.'' When Dawson finally was able to play basketball at Kinston (N.C.) High School, he was overshadowed by a teammate, Charles Shackleford, now at North Carolina State. Despite averaging over 20 points per game in his senior season, Dawson was not heavily recruited and he enrolled at Florida's Gulf Coast Community College. At Gulf Coast, Dawson blossomed into one of the best junior college players in the country. He averaged 29.5 points and 12 rebounds his second year. Florida State never hesitated in offering him a scholarship. ''We noticed a slight limp when we recruited Tony, but it didn't seem to bother him,'' Kennedy said. ''I realize he plays in pain sometimes. But he's a special kid. And when we get the ball in Tony's hands, he scores.'' Dawson said he actually uses his damaged leg to his advantage. ''It throws guys off guard,'' he explained. ''They're used to seeing guys jump off their left foot when they drive. When I go off my right foot, they don't know what to do.''

1454-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; American Home Names Chief of Wyeth-Ayerst
For decades two major pharmaceutical laboratories have operated largely independently of each other even though they belong to the same company, the American Home Products Corporation. One, Wyeth Laboratories Inc., based in Radnor Pa., specializes in developing tranquilizers, oral contraceptives and vaccines, while its smaller cousin, Ayerst Laboratories, New York, concentrates on cardiovascular drugs, estrogen and over-the-counter drugs. But yesterday American Home announced that the two units would be merged by the end of the year in a move to cut duplication and costs and to lessen the time that it takes to bring a drug from the laboratory to the marketplace. Taking the helm as chairman of the merged unit, to be called Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, will be Bernard Canavan, formerly president of Wyeth. Dr. Canavan, 51, began his career as a general practitioner in Ontario after getting his medical training at the University of Edinburgh. He had been president of Wyeth since 1984. Dr. Canavan was also named an executive vice president of American Home. Also Raised to the executive vice president level was Robert G. Blount, 48, who had been senior vice president of finance. Judson St. John, who was formerly president of Ayerst, was named president of the merged unit, which will have annual sales of about $2.5 billion. John R. Stafford, the chairman, president and chief executive of American Home, said that the merger would lead to reductions in staff, but he said he did not know how many people would lose their jobs. Up to now, he said, each of the divisions has had its own staff for research, for coordinating trials with the Food and Drug Administration and for sales. ''It's this kind of duplication that we think should be eliminated,'' he said, but added that the staff for sales would be kept largely intact in the new organization. There are now about 3,000 people working at Ayerst, with about 400 of those in New York, and 7,300 employees at Wyeth.

1456-> Japanese Dominate Auction Bidding
Japanese dealers and collectors dominated bidding last night at Christie's auction of Impressionist and modern art - purchasing paintings by Renoir, Kandinsky and Chagall at record prices for these artists and buying other major works by Monet, Miro, Rouault and Laurencin. Overall, however, the results seemed to move like a roller coaster, from successful highs to disappointments. The auction totaled $37.6 million, which was both the low presale estimate for the auction and also a record total for any sale at Christie's in New York. Twenty works out of the 71 offered did not sell. At least three works were purchased at double the presale expectations. ''This is the best sale we have ever had,'' said Michael Findlay, Christie's director of fine-art sales. ''Fresh things that have not been on the market for decades did so well despite all the nay-sayers, and despite the very real prospect of the market being dampened by the economy.'' Renoir Sold for $5.2 Million Indeed, the work that brought the highest price of the sale - Renoir's ''Young Woman Carrying a Basket of Flowers,'' from 1888 - had been in one family's possession for over 50 years. It was purchased by H. Matsua, a dealer and collector of Motomachi Gallery of Yokohama for $5.28 million, a record for the artist. ''Quality works are selling very well,'' said Masaharu Fujii of the Fujii Gallery of Tokyo through an interpreter, after he made several purchases: Kandinsky's ''Murnau-Landscape with Church I'' from 1909, for which he paid $2.42 million, a record at auction for the artist; Bourdelle's ''Herakles, Archer,'' at $143,000 and Braque's ''Still Life'' at $143,000. Europeans were busy bidding throughout and purchased 17 of the works sold. When asked halfway through the sale how he thought the auction was doing, Desmond Cochrane, a dealer with Lefevre of London, said ''Incredible, isn't it?'' Prices? ''A lot are more than fabulous,'' he said. Fantin-Latour's ''Sweet Peas in a Vase,'' was sold by the Philippine Government - it was found in an Olympic Towers apartment in March of 1987 under a bed - for $440,000 to the Citibank Art Advisory. The biggest disappointment of the evening was the painting that was expected to bring the highest total -Egon Schiele's ''Lovers (Man and Woman l)'' from 1914. Purchased in 1984 at Sotheby's in London for $3.77 million, the record price at auction for a work by the artist, it was consigned by its owner, Wendell Cherry, president and chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the Louisville, Ky.-based health-care corporation. ''You can't put things up twice at auction in such a short time like that,'' said Richard Feigen, a dealer. Shigeki Kameyama, a dealer of the Mountain Tortoise Gallery of Tokyo, bought three works - Miro's 1947 abstract in reds, blues and grays for $1.1 million; Laurencin's ''Three Women'' from 1943 at $462,000, and Chagall's ''Farmer's Bouquet'' from 1966 at $1.54 million - almost twice the top estimate of $800,000.

1457-> CANDIDATES CLASH ON FOREIGN POLICY
The Republican said he thought of himself as a dove, ''a heavily armed dove.'' The Democrat charged that ''support for the contras is a dead end, a seven-year exercise in macho and mayhem.'' The lines were crisply drawn and starkly ideological today in the latest of a recent flurry of two-candidate debates, this one pitting Representatives Jack F. Kemp and Richard A. Gephardt in a debate on foreign policy. Before an audience in an auditorium at Rivier College, a Catholic school in Nashua, Mr. Kemp accused Mr. Gephardt of naivete toward the Russians and the Sandinistas, and of following ''a neo-isolationist policy that's as dangerous in the 1980's as it was in the 1930's.'' Chamberlain Is Recalled Mr. Kemp, a Buffalo Republican who has been trying to consolidate his support on the party's right, reiterated his call for the development and deployment of the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative. ''Weakness causes war, not strength,'' he asserted. He also urged continued aid to the Nicaraguan rebels despite the recent round of peace plans for Central America, declaring: ''A peace plan with no teeth won't work. A peace plan on a piece of paper means nothing. Chamberlain came home from Munich with a piece of paper.'' Mr. Gephardt, meanwhile, compared the Strategic Defense Initiative to the Maginot Line, saying that the latter was also ''a noble idea at one time, but it didn't work out very well.'' ''We can't afford more and more homes for missiles when we don't have homes for the homeless poeple on our streets,'' the Missouri Democrat asserted. Backs Some Research Mr. Gephardt said he supported ''laboratory research'' into the Strategic Defense Intiative ''at a reasonable level.'' But he argued that the best way to prevent nuclear war was through arms control negotiations. ''I don't think there's a technological fix to a human problem,'' he said. Mr. Gephardt said Mr. Kemp seemed incapable of endorsing diplomatic means of achieving peace and stability. ''I think what you really believe is the only answer to our foreign policy is to wipe out anybody who doesn't agree with us,'' he told Mr. Kemp. Much of the debate was along predictable partisan grounds. Mr. Gephardt, for example, described the Reagan Administration as pursuing a ''rogue foreign policy.'' He called the American presence in the Persian Gulf ''a floating Beirut, waiting to happen.'' Mr. Kemp countered that the Russians ''were coming to the table in the Reagan Administration, not the Carter Administration'' because ''once again the United States is strong.''

SKIING Tomba Leads Sweep: Alberto Tomba of Italy, who threw away his birthday cake after his four-race World Cup winning streak was broken, began a new streak yesterday, leading a 1-2 Italian sweep in a men's slalom in Kranjska Gora, Yugoslavia, and improving his lead in the World Cup ski standing. The victory, Tomba's fifth this season, gave him 125 points, 34 ahead of Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland. Zurbriggen, the defending World Cup champion, placed fourth here. Richard Pramotton finished second and Guenther Mader of Austria was third. Tomba, starting in the second group, was timed in 1 minute 46.35 seconds. Pramotton was clocked in 1:46.95 and Mader in 1:47.27. Tomba fell in the first heat of a giant slalom Saturday - his 21st birthday - ending his streak of four consecutive victories. The spill prevented Tomba from equaling the record of six straight victories set by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark during the 1977-78 season.(AP) Frenchwoman Is First: Catherine Quittet of France, returning from a serious knee injury, upset the Swiss favorites yesterday in Piancavallo, Italy, to win her first World Cup giant slalom. The 23-year-old skier Quittet, whose previous and only World Cup victory was a Super-G in Prfonten, West Germany last Jan. 17, was the fastest in the first heat. She had the second-best time in the second run for a winning aggregate of 2 minutes 27.32 seconds.

1460-> Ford Dismisses 3,200 Mexicans
The Ford Motor Company has dismissed 3,200 Mexican workers as part of a settlement ending a nine-week strike at one of its Mexico assembly plants, a company spokesman said today. With the weekend settlement, the workers at the Ford assembly plant in Cuautitlan, just north of the capital, lost their jobs but will receive compensation from the company, the spokesman said. He said many of the workers would be considered for rehiring when the plant reopens. The spokesman said that it was not known when the plant would reopen or how many workers would be rehired, but that the company was likely to increase automation at the plant, built in 1964. The strike began July 20 after Ford rejected a union demand for a 23 percent emergency wage increase to counter an annual inflation rate of 133 percent. Ford argued that it could grant only a 16 percent raise in wages and benefits and still remain competitive in Mexico's depressed automobile industry. The company's domestic sales fell 45 percent in 1986, according to the Mexican Automobile Association. Before the strike, the Cuautitlan plant produced about 200 vehicles a day, including the Topaz, Cougar and Thunderbird models.

1461-> News Service to Supply U.S.-Soviet Exchange
The major American broadcast networks, which plan a New Year's Day schedule of parades and football games, may not broadcast the video greetings exchanged between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but a satellite news service will transmit the speeches to more than 900 local television stations across the country. A five-minute speech by President Reagan, taped last week, has been made available to Soviet television, but it was not known whether the Russians intended to broadcast it. A similar greeting by Mr. Reagan last year was not broadcast in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, will deliver a five-minute taped speech by Mr. Gorbachev to NBC News in Washington this week, probably today. NBC, the designated pool carrier for the networks, will then distribute the tape of the Soviet leader's speech to all major broadcast outlets. So far, however, none of the American broadcasters - ABC, NBC or CBS - plan to carry Mr. Gorbachev's greeting. The Soviets have suggested that the speech be carried at noon on Friday - New Year's Day. Obstacle: The Festivities The networks would have to pre-empt coverage of the Tournament of Roses Parade or pre-game activities for the Citrus Bowl to carry the speech. ''I don't think we're going to interrupt for it,'' said Howard Stringer, the president of CBS News. Lawrence K. Grossman, the president of NBC News, said that he and his associates would view the Gorbachev tape this week, and broadcast it only if it contains news-breaking material. ''Something will have to be postponed to carry it,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''We do that all the time if it's newsworthy - but it has to be news.'' Steve Haworth, a spokesman for the Cable News Network, which has no special programming scheduled on New Year's Day, said CNN would also view the Gorbachev tape before deciding whether to broadcast it. Sending the Messages However, officials for TV Direct, a news service that sells video news packages delivered by satellite to television stations, said yesterday that it would transmit both Mr. Gorbachev's speech and Mr. Reagan's greeting to all of the more than 900 local television stations capable of receiving its satellite transmission. For TV Direct, which is a joint venture between The Associated Press and Conus, a Minnesota-based satellite news service, the Gorbachev speech is a distinct public relations opportunity. ''We're doing this very much because we want to show a lot of broadcasters around the country what we do on a daily basis,'' said Conus's Washington bureau chief, Scott Goodfellow. ''We're allowing the stations to see what they want on their own air, not just what the networks decide for them.'' Mr. Goodfellow noted that all of NBC's affiliates would receive the TV Direct signal. However, Mr. Grossman, the head of NBC News, said that even if NBC News did not broadcast the Gorbachev or Reagan speeches, the networks' own syndication service would transmit the exchanges to NBC-affiliated stations.

1463-> Sentences Are Reduced In Polish Priest's Death
Four former officials of the Interior Ministry, who were convicted of murdering a priest who supported the Solidarity labor movement, have been given shorter prison sentences, Government officials said today. The four men who killed the priest, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, are benefitting from a general amnesty that freed hundreds of Solidarity supporters interned during martial law. Former Capt. Grzegorz Piotrowski, who received the maximum term of 25 years for leading the attack on the priest, will serve 15 years. The term of one accomplice, former Col. Adam Pietruszka, was reduced from 25 to 10 years. The sentences of the other two men, former Lieut. Leszek Pekala and former Lieut. Waldemar Chmielewski, were shortened to six and four and one half years respectively, from 15 and 14 years. All four men have already served three years. Father Popieluszko was abducted in October 1984. He was tortured and killed and his body was thrown into a reservoir.

1465-> Hurricane Emily Strengthens, Posing Threat to Hispaniola
Tropical Storm Emily hn the Caribbean tonight became Hurricane Emily, with winds of up to 75 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center extended a hurricane watch to the south coast of Hispaniola. ''Further strengthening is likely tonight and Tuesday,'' said a hurricane forecaster, Joseph Pelissher. At midnight, the center of the hurricane was at latitude 14.5 north and longitude 66.0 west, or about 550 miles southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and was moving west-northwest at 20 miles an hour. A hurricane watch was in effect for the south coast of both the Dominican Republic and Haiti and the entire southwestern peninsula of Haiti, all on the island of Hispaniola. Earlier today, Tropical Storm Emily churned past St. Vincent, causing extensive damage to agriculture and closing schools and businesses.

1466-> PRO HOCKEY; NORDIQUES EDGE SAUVE AND DEVILS
Anton Stastny and Jeff Brown each had one goal and one assist tonight to lead the Quebec Nordiques past the Devils, 3-2. The victory ended the Nordiques' four-game losing streak. Quebec has won only twice in 10 starts. The victory gave Ron Lapointe his first victorty as a National Hockey League head coach. Lapointe took over Friday after the team dismissed Coach Andre Savard. Brown set up Stastny for a second-period goal to gave Quebec a lead it never relinquished. Brown scored what proved to be the winner early in the third period. Alain Cote also scored for Quebec. Craig Wolanin and Kirk Muller scored for the Devils, Muller on a short-handed effort in the third period. Mario Gosselin faced 22 shots in goal for Quebec; Bob Sauve faced 20 shots for the Devils. ''We controlled the game for 50 minutes and then we let up for the last 10,'' Lapointe said. ''But we showed a lot of character by hanging on.'' The character of the club has been in question lately, particularly because Quebec seemed to have developed a habit of losing its grip on leads. That resulted in four straight losses and eight defeats in nine starts into tonight's game. ''The work ethic around here has changed,'' said Brown. ''Even the guys who were on the bench and not playing seemed to be cheering a lot more - they were really into the game.'' Rangers 3, Blues 2 ST. LOUIS (AP) - John Ogrodnick's goal with 9:48 left snapped a tie for the Rangers. Ogrodnick's goal, his eighth of the season, came after he took a pass from Brian Mullen behind the St. Louis net. Ogrodnick beat the Blues' goalie, Greg Millen, to Millen's stick side with a back-hander. James Patrick and Mullen also scored for the Rangers. Brian Benning and Ron Flockhart scored for St. Louis. The Blues scored first on Benning's 35-foot slap shot off the left boards at 6:59 of the first period. His low shot eluded Bob Froese. It was Benning's second goal of the season. The Rangers rebounded in the second period on power-play goals 3 minutes apart. Patrick's blistering slap shot from the top of the left faceoff circle produced a 1-1 tie at 10:50 with a St. Louis defenseman, Charlie Bourgeois, off the ice for elbowing. Following an interference penalty to the Blues' Todd Ewen, the Rangers grabbed a 2-1 lead at 13:50 on Mullen's weak shot from the side of the net. Flockhart scored 44 seconds after Mullen with a knuckling shot from 20 feet out. The Blues' forward dashed up the left side and beat Froese for his fifth goal of the season at 14:34 of the second period.

Bernard H. Barnett, past national president of the charity organization United Jewish Appeal, died Thursday at University Hospital here. He was 71 years old. Mr. Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., and Washington, D.C., was senior partner of Barnett & Alagia, a regional law firm he founded in Louisville, Ky., where he was also a former chairman of the Louisville Jewish Federation. He founded National Industries, a Louisville conglomerate later merged into Fuqua Industries. After the merger he continued as a director and also was a director of Hasbro Industries and U.S. Container Corporation. He worked to build Israel's oil and petrochemical industries beginning in the 1950's. He also was a founder and legal counsel of the Cuban American National Foundation and a leader in its efforts to establish Radio Marti. He is survived by his wife, Marian S.; three sons and four grandchildren.

1469-> Belgium's Coalition Loses Ground in Election
The governing conservative coalition lost at least seven seats in elections in Belgium today, making it likely that there will be new participants in the government to be formed in January. In results that will not be confirmed for another day or so, it appeared that the Christian Democratic Party of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and its partners lost enough ground to force a shuffling of the coalition, possibly leaving Mr. Martens out of the leadership. The Prime Minister was gloomy when he appeared on television in the evening. ''I did not expect such a severe decision,'' he said. But politics among Belgium's 29 recognized parties is never cut and dried. In the process of forming a government that gets a majority of the 212 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, many alliances are formed and many promises broken. Mr. Martens, a 51-year-old lawyer from Ghent, in the Flemish-speaking part of the country, has made seven governments out of unpromising material since he first became Prime Minister in 1979. It was clear tonight that the Socialists, the main opposition to Mr. Martens in his past governments, had gained seats in the French-speaking part of the country while remaining the same in Flanders, the nation's north. The Ecologist Party in Flanders also won at least two seats. But given the pliability of Belgian political parties, no one was predicting what government might result. Belgium is a constitutional monarchy, and King Baudouin assists in the formation of governments, trying to get a balance between the bitterly divided French-speaking and Flemish-speaking parts of the country. The process takes weeks, sometimes months. Mr. Martens and his coalition partners had imposed a tough austerity program to reduce Belgium's persistent budget deficit. Under his Governments, the deficit had been reduced from 14 percent of the gross annual domestic product in 1981 to less than 8 percent now. The comparable figure for the United States is 3 percent. The program has necessitated cuts in social services, which the Socialists made an issue of in today's election. The French-speaking wing of the party promised to inject $1.2 billion into the economy if elected despite the heavy public debt. The caolition called the promise ''the politics of Santa Claus.'' The Government fell in October in a language dispute over a French-speaking mayor in a Flemish-speaking area who refused to take his oath of office in Flemish, as required by law.

1471-> Third of Medical Graduates Are Women
Women make up nearly a third of the 15,830 students who graduated from the nation's 127 medical schools this year, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The number of graduating medical students was down by 287 from last year and by 513 from the peak year of 1984, the association said. Women made up 32.3 percent of the class of 1987, up from 30.8 percent in 1986. Seven percent of the graduates were members of minority groups. The association also reported that there were 28,500 applicants for the 16,000 available spaces in this year's freshman class at medical schools around the country. In 1986 there were 31,323 applicants. The number of applicants began falling after 1984. If the trend continues, the association predicts there will be only 23,000 people vying for admission to medical school by 1990. Over the last two decades, there were two to three applicants for each available space. The ratio dropped to 1.9 candidates per space in 1986 and 1.8 this year. The association suggested several possible factors in the drop in applicants, including a 1980 Federal report that warned of a surplus of physicians by 1990, the high cost of a medical degree, the seven years it takes to complete medical school and residency training and the cost of establishing a practice and paying liability insurance. Some physicians have complained that cost-cutting moves by Government agencies and insurers have reduced their autonomy and made the profession less attractive. Other experts have speculated that some college students see greater opportunities for wealth in business and and other fields.

1472-> Shuttle Rocket Test Discloses Flaw That Will Delay Scheduled Flight
The first space shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster is being delayed because of the failure of a redesigned rocket nozzle component in a recent test firing, the space agency announced yesterday. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it would be several days before they could determine whether the delay would run to weeks or months beyond the launching that had been scheduled June 2. But the latest problem was certain to put new pressure on the beleaguered space agency and its efforts to restore regular shuttle operations. More Redesigning Possible An engineer with the National Academy of Sciences, which has been monitoring NASA's shuttle recovery program, said the delay could be ''very serious'' if it is found that the malfunctioning component has to be redesigned. The guidance of the shuttle depends on the swiveling of the nozzles of the booster rockets. The space agency said the malfunction was unrelated to the booster rocket joint that caused the destruction of the Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, which killed all seven crew members and grounded the other three shuttles. The joint was redesigned in the 23 months since the accident and was undergoing its second full-duration test firing last week when the new failure occurred. Although the test was initially called a success, based primarily on the performance of the joint, engineers of Morton Thiokol Inc., the rocket contractor, conducted a more detailed inspection this week and reported finding key pieces of nozzle's outer boot ring were missing. The boot is the flexible carbon composite material where the swiveling nozzle is attached to the rigid case of the solid-fuel rocket. Inspectors found that a large part of the outer ring had separated from the boot and about 180 degrees of that ring appeared to be missing. Part of it was found inside the rocket casing after inspectors equipped with lights crawled into the nozzle Monday morning. ''You can see a piece of it lying in the motor,'' said John D. Thirkill, the general manager of Morton Thiokol's Wasatch Operations, where the tests are conducted. ''From an engineering standpoint, it is sort of a puzzlement.'' Mr. Thirkill cautioned that he could not estimate the full extent of the damage or how long it would take to redesign the part. Sections of the rocket have not yet be disassembled for a more thorough analysis. This was the first full-scale test for the boot ring since it was redesigned, using a new construction technique. Engineers had observed that on previous firings the carbon ply material of the nozzle components had tended to separate. They decided that, while the shuttle was grounded anyway, they would seek to improve the boot ring in an attempt to alleviate the separations of the laminated carbon phenolic composite material. Nozzles a Longtime Concern The Challenger disaster was the result of a failure in O-ring seals about a third of the way up the booster, where two major segments of the rocket are connected. The failure announced yesterday occurred in the delicate mechanism surrounding the nozzle at the base of the booster. The nozzles have long been a concern to rocket engineers because of past near-failures. David Winterhalter, a shuttle engineer at NASA headquarters in Washington, said it would take ''a number of days'' to remove the rocket from the test stand and conduct a more detailed examination. Only then would it be possible, he said, to determine at what point in the test firing the ring failed and thus how serious the malfunction is to the shuttle's launching schedule. If, for example, the ring disintegrated after the firing, when the rocket was being cooled off with a deluge of water, engineers said it was unlikely that the components would have to be redesigned. But if the problem occurred in the firing itself, the engineers added, a major redesign would probably be required. It would be ''pure speculation at this point'' to try to estimate how much longer the shuttles will be grounded, Mr. Winterhalter said. Meanwhile, Morton Thiokol and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., were continuing to assess the anomaly and were developing contingency plans for future testing. NASA said that ''until the condition is understood and corrected,'' the rocket components will be held at Morton Thiokol's plant in Utah. ''I'm not very optimistic that they will be usable,'' Mr. Winterhalter said, commenting on whether the rocket motors that had been ready for shipment to Cape Canaveral, Fla., would have to be modified. Sarah Keegan, a spokeswoman at NASA headquarters, emphasized that the modifications of the ring were unrelated to the Challenger accident and were not one of the requirements dictated by the Presidential Commission that investigated the accident. Firing Tested All Changes The full-scale test firing on Dec. 23, which lasted two minutes at full thrust, was the second of four required by the space agency before the shuttles could be cleared for flight. The firing was the first that tested all of the rocket design changes. Even before this problem developed, shuttle officials were expressing some doubts that they would be able to meet the June 2 schedule for the first post-Challenger mission. They said the slightest disruption in preparations could cause a significant postponement. If the shuttles did resume flights in June, NASA had hoped to launch two more missions before the end of the year and then gradually to accelerate the launching rate in 1989.

1473-> THE BIG CONGRESSIONAL WAR POWERS SURRENDER; A Menu of Laws
To the Editor: In advocating invocation of the War Powers Act to support United States involvement in the Persian Gulf (Op-Ed Oct. 28), the usually thoughtful Representative Stephen J. Solarz offers a very unthoughtful and dangerous suggestion. To satisfy political conflicts, he suggests, ''the White House and Congressional leaders could agree that Congress would adopt a joint resolution triggering the War Powers Resolution, while simultaneously authorizing the presence of American forces in the gulf.'' He adds: ''Mr. Reagan could then sign the resolution while issuing a statement that his signature did not represent an admission of the law's constitutionality.'' At this point, Mr. Solarz vitiates the significance of his argument. Worse than that, he demonstrates how easy it is to step over the line from principle to tactic without the alarm going off. Do I understand the point? The President obeys the law once guaranteed that it will not cause him any pain. If this is a government of laws, then the condition of obedience to the law is not that the law must in a given instance be made agreeable. Sound the alarm! JEFFREY KRAMER New York, Oct. 28, 1987

1474-> Hastings Loses Appeal to Prevent House Panel From Getting Report
A Federal appeals judge today turned down a bid by Federal District Judge Alcee Hastings to prevent a secret grand jury report from being sent to a House committee considering whether he should be impeached. The appeals judge also refused to order public release of the grand jury testimony, which led to Judge Hastings's 1981 bribery indictment. He was later acquitted. Judge Hastings has maintained that he and his lawyers have a right to know everything that the House Judiciary Committee sees during its consideration of possible impeachment proceedings. Senior Circuit Judge John D. Butzner Jr. of Richmond, Va., ordered the grand jury testimony delivered to Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. But Judge Butzner stayed his order for 21 days to give Judge Hastings' attorney, Terence Anderson of Miami, an opportunity to appeal. Panel May Release Report Judge Butzner also gave permission for the House Judiciary Committee to disclose to Judge Hastings any materials that it chooses to release. Mr. Anderson said Judge Hastings would appeal the judge's order to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. Attorneys for Congressional investigators had asked for the transcripts, which prompted Judge Hastings' attorneys to demand that he also receive a copy and that they be made public. Justice Department lawyers argued last week against public release of any grand jury transcripts on grounds that those hearings should be kept private to avoid inhibiting ongoing investigations. Mr. Anderson had attacked the fairness of letting the grand jury proceedings go to the Congressional investigators without making it public and letting Judge Hastings see it. Another Defendant Convicted The Congressional investigation comes after a Federal undercover operation in 1981. That operation resulted in Judge Hastings' being charged with conspiring with William A. Borders Jr., a prominent Washington lawyer, to solicit a $150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers. Mr. Borders was convicted, but Judge Hastings was acquitted. The 27-member Judicial Conference of the United States, the Federal judiciary's policymaking body, after an internal investigation, informed the House last March that ''consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' An impeachment resolution was introduced in the House by Republican Representatives Henry J. Hyde of Illinois and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin. Last week, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Judge Hastings' argument that the law governing the Judicial Conference's action is too vague. But the appeals court allowed Judge Hastings to pursue another claim, that his due-process rights had been violated.

The World Boxing Council has given Thomas Hearns, the light-heavyweight champion, 48 hours to decide whether he will seek the vacant middleweight title against Juan Domingo Roldan of Argentina. A statement released yesterday said the council had not yet authorized a Hearns-Roldan fight ''because that is conditioned on Tommy Hearns unfreezing the light-heavyweight title he holds.'' Hearns won the light-heavyweight title on March 7 by knocking out Dennis Andries of Britain. Besides fighting Roldan, his other option is to defend the light-heavyweight title against Eddie Davis. The middleweight title has been vacant since Sugar Ray Leonard announced his retirement on June 8, after his victory over Marvelous Marvin Hagler in April. . . . George Foreman, the former heavyweight boxing champion who is 2-0 on the comeback trail, has signed to fight the unbeaten Orlin Norris on Sept. 12, a boxing promoter said yesterday. A site for the fight has not been selected. Foreman, 38 years old, last fought in July when he knocked out Charlie Hostetter in the third round. He is 46-2 and hopes to earn a title shot.

1477-> SHERRARD OUT FOR '87
Mike Sherrard, the Dallas Cowboys' wide receiver, suffered a broken leg during a scrimmage yesterday with the San Diego Chargers in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and is apparently lost for the season. Sherrard, who caught 48 passes last season, stumbled while running a pattern, pursued by Carl Brazley, a Chargers cornerback. The injury was to his right leg. He was rushed to a nearby hospital after the incident. Tex Schramm, president of the Cowboys, said later that Sherrard would probably not have a chance to play this season. Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears isn't saying whether this will be his last season in the National Football League. But yesterday, Payton, who is getting set for his 13th N.F.L. season, did compare himself to a sports superstar who retired this year. ''Athletes like Julius Erving and I have an obligation to the fans to go out on the top of our game,'' said the 33-year-old running back, who has rushed for an N.F.L.-record 16,193 yards. Butch Woolfolk has found work, signing a free-agent contract with the Cleveland Browns. The former Michigan star running back, recently released by Houston, began his pro career as the No. 1 draft choice of the Giants in 1982. Eric Hipple, the Detroit Lion quarterback, had his broken right thumb placed in a cast yesterday, but he's optimistic. ''I think I can come back in three to five weeks,'' said Hipple, who jammed the thumb on another player's helmet on Monday.

1478-> Uncle Sugar's Sugar Deal
America will import no more sugar in 1988 than it did in 1875. The way things are going, it may soon import none at all. That's splendid for a few thousand protected farmers - but a raw deal for everyone else. Hopes of relief have faded what with Congress adjourning, but the Administration and consumers need to keep up the pressure for a reduced support price. U.S. sugar law, in force since 1982, sets the American price, currently 21.8 cents a pound, more than triple the world market price. At retail, sugar goes for about 36 cents a pound in Washington, D.C., is higher in Europe and still higher in Japan. In Latin America and other third world countries, it is substantially less. To avoid Federal outlays for surplus sugar, Congress ordained that the price be enforced by curtailing imports. If American production rises, imports must fall and the consumer pays. The Administration, having no real choice but to obey the law, has just whacked the 1988 quota by 25 percent, to approximately 750,000 tons - down 75 percent since 1982. It could drop to zero by 1990. The American quota means trouble for the economies of the Caribbean, Brazil, the Philippines and Australia, among others. It also distorts agriculture and food processing at home. The high sugar price has increased the popularity of corn sweeteners and has driven some American food companies over the border to Canada, where they can make their cake mixes, cookies and candy with cheaper raw material. Why should all of America pay three times the world sugar price for the sake of a few farmers? In large measure because the sugar lobby, rated as one of Washington's most effective, has a solid phalanx of support from the four big sugar-cane states - Texas, Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii - plus a dozen others that grow sugar beets, and lately the corn belt too. The lobbyists point to a major factor driving down the world price: government subsidies that have generated oversupply in Europe. Washington hesitates to sacrifice American farmers to keep subsidized European farmers afloat. To deflect some of the impact on countries Washington wants to help, and to help American refiners, Congress has voted to permit importation of an extra 800,000 tons next year from the Philippines and the Caribbean, provided that the refined product is re-exported. The sugar will come in at the American price and be re-exported at the lower world price, with the Government making up the difference by giving refiners other surplus commodities. American consumers get no benefit; countries that aren't in on the deal resent it. While the Reagan Administration would prefer a free market, foreign subsidies prevent it. But the Administration believes, with reason, that a 12-cent support price would benefit consumers and America's trading partners without too much grief for American farmers. Congress continues to turn a deaf ear. On a broader plane, the Administration is also pursuing the issue with the Europeans in the new round of global trade negotiations. Meanwhile, Uncle Sugar's unnecessarily high support price gouges consumers and hurts foreign friends.

1479-> Bias Cases Fuel Anger Of Blacks
Tawana Brawley, a popular 15-year-old high school student, was found Nov. 28 curled in a fetal position inside a plastic bag behind an apartment house in Wappingers Falls, six miles south of here. Miss Brawley, who is black, had been beaten. ''Nigger'' and ''KKK'' had been written in charcoal or marker on her torso, feces had been smeared across her body and her hair had been chopped off, the police said. She later told her family and law-enforcement authorities that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by six white men - one of whom wore a police badge. On Nov. 21, Alphonso Smith of Peekskill, N.Y., who is black, was chased down a road on the outskirts of the community by three bat- and pipe-wielding white men before being picked up by a passing motorist, the police said. Five days later, a large cardboard box placed beside his family's home was set on fire, causing damage to the house. There were no injuries. Anger and Protest And on the night of Nov. 22, several black and Hispanic inmates at the Orange County Jail in Goshen, 15 miles south of here, held a protest, in part over what they said was too much heat in their cells. The State Commission of Correction is investigating whether white correction officers then shouted racial slurs and wrapped their heads in white towels or linen to represent the Ku Klux Klan and whether they used excessive force to quell the disturbance. These three cases have touched off protests among angry blacks living in the Mid-Hudson Valley, protests that have been joined by people from other parts of the state and the nation. These critics said the cases highlight the difficulties encountered by blacks in suburban and rural communities. At two rallies Saturday, one here and one in Newburgh, 16 miles to the south, more than 1,200 protesters repeated their demand for a special prosecutor in the Brawley case and vowed further demonstrations and civil disobedience until the attackers are found. Speaking at the rally at the Baptist Temple in Newburgh, Sadie A. Tallie, executive director of the Coalition for People's Rights, a nonprofit group based in Newburgh, said: ''We've been devastated by this. But it's made us realize that we have some major problems. We're going to have to unite. If it happened to Tawana, it could happen to any of our children.'' The Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the Black Muslim minister who attended the rally, quoted the Koran and said, ''You will not do to another black girl in America what you did to Tawana Brawley and get away with it.'' The case of Miss Brawley has provoked the most anger and has become the subject of a dispute about its prosecution. Local law-enforcement officials have questioned the truthfulness of the girl's statements. Other people, like B. Harold Ramsey, president of the local chapter of the N. A. A. C. P., and Clarence McGill, head of the Dutchess County Committee Against Racism, charged there has been a cover-up because of Miss Brawley's allegation of police involvement. Miss Brawley, who has been in and out of the hospital since the incident and unable to walk, was at first too distraught and reluctant to give more than a sketchy interview to law-enforcement officials. Since then, she has declined to speak to anyone without her attorney, Alton H. Maddox Jr., present, according to her aunt, Juanita Brawley and the Dutchess County District Attorney, William V. Grady. Mr. Grady, spokesman for a law-enforcement task force that was ordered last week by Governor Cuomo to investigate the Brawley case, said that his office had sent a letter to Mr. Maddox to arrange the interview and has received no response. Mr. Maddox, one of the lawyers who pushed successfully for the apppointment of a special state prosecutor in the Howard Beach murder case, did not return telephone messages left at his home and office in recent days by a reporter. Mr. Grady said as the task force waits to talk with the girl, valuable time and possibly evidence is being lost. Account of Sexual Assault The teen-ager has given the fullest account of the incident to her aunt and to her mother, Glenda Brawley, with whom she lives in Wappingers Falls. The account, from her family and other news reports, is this: On the afternoon of Nov. 24, shortly after the teen-ager returned from Newburgh on a bus, she was approached by a man with a badge, whom she assumed to be a police officer. The man asked her to get into a dark green car. Inside the car was another man. At some point Miss Brawley was struck and she was driven to a wooded area where four more men were waiting, and where all six sodomized her. Four days later, according to a county sheriff's report, an anonymous caller reported seeing a girl carrying a garbage bag walking in a daze at the side of a road in Wappingers Falls. After a search of the area, a Dutchess County sheriff's deputy found the girl behind an apartment complex, lying inside the bag. Arrests in Peekskill In the Peekskill case, four white men have been arrested and charged with aggravated harassment and menacing under the civil rights section of the state's penal code, the police said. But there is no evidence linking the four to the fire at the home shared by Mr. Smith, his parents and four brothers and sisters, according to the police, who are still investigating that crime. ''My family wants me to always go out with family members or someone now,'' said Mr. Smith, a former high school varsity athlete who handles insurance claims for Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield. ''And I try to do that.'' Jennie L. Smith, Mr. Smith's mother, said, ''It's been going on two weeks since the fire and I'm still in a daze.'' Mrs. Smith, a nurse's assistant who settled in Peekskill 25 years ago, said, ''There must be something going on for all these things to happen one after another.'' She was referring to another black family in Peekskill whose home burned in a suspicious blaze shortly after the fire at the Smith home. The authorities have not linked the two incidents. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the State Commission of Correction, Stephen Del Giacco, said his agency ''doesn't have all the answers'' to what occurred during the uprising at the Orange County Jail. Granville I. Dehaney, a former inmate at the prison who served a four-month sentence for drug possession that ended Dec. 9, said that he had experienced racial slurs from correction officers there and that he had sent a written complaint to correction officials. Contrasting Protests Mr. Del Giacco said that he was not aware of any racial incident that had been brought to the commission's attention. The protests this weekend were in many ways a study in contrasts. The gathering at the Baptist Temple was attended primarily by hundreds of people who came by bus from New York City, and was militant in tone, as was a half-hour march through Newburgh. Viola Plummer, a member of the recently formed Dec. 12 Coalition, which sponsored the church rally, said that the coalition would stage a day of civil disobedience this Saturday in New York City. In contrast, the smaller rally here of about 200 people - sponsored by Mr. McGill's Dutchess County Committee Against Racism and a racially diverse coalition thatincluded Jewish and women's groups - was more subdued. It ended with a call for a voter registration drive and a boycott of stores that discriminate against blacks either through hiring or the quality of customer service. ''There are people who feel we are too moderate,'' Mr. McGill said. ''That may be. We know we are in the heat of battle. This is a battle we are engaged in.''

1480-> IN SHORT: FICTION
TEMPTING FATE. By Laurie Alberts. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) The state of Alaska, disconnected from the rest of the country, has much in common with the characters in Laurie Alberts's first novel, ''Tempting Fate.'' Alaska is separate, little explored and cold. So are many of the characters. A disconsolate Russian, a hell-bent Indian and a flaky dropout from New England move about the little island of Vladimir, salmon fishing for a living and getting potted the rest of the time in local saloons. The ragtag characters in this book have settled in Alaska for various reasons, some because fishing is in their blood, one because the name ''Vladimir'' has special significance for him, and Allie, the novel's main character, because she claims to have already ''used up'' the rest of the continent. Yet instead of being the last, great untamed frontier, the wild and woolly dreamscape that many of these people think it is, Alaska serves in this story as a sort of subarctic halfway house, a rehab center for the wayward who are presumably en route to a better life (though many, it turns out, are not). Ms. Alberts, who has traveled widely and who won a Michener award for this novel, is at her best in describing the rigors of life aboard the fishing boats; she ably evokes a climate and style of life that few will ever know, much less imagine. The scenery is vivid, as is her depiction of the life of the Alaskan Indian, whose customs and lore have been compromised by the influx of oil entrepreneurs and big business. Though limited by the sameness of its scenes (bars, boats and more bars) and an excess of pitiable characters, ''Tempting Fate'' is a perceptive work of adventure fiction.

1481-> HOME CLINIC; IF THE FAUCET WON'T STOP DRIPPING, HERE'S WHAT TO DO
When a conventional washer-type faucet has to be excessively tightened down each time you shut it off in order to keep it from dripping, or when the faucet develops a drip that won't stop no matter how hard you tighten it, then prompt repairs are advisable to keep things from getting worse - for example, to keep from damaging the faucet seat and possibly causing extensive damage to the faucet stem itself. Most leaks can be repaired by taking the faucet apart and then installing a new washer at the end of the spindle, as well as replacing the packing or O-ring that goes around the outside of the stem in some cases. However, if you wait too long and keep trying to tighten the faucet down harder in order to stop the drip, then chances are that the valve seat will be damaged. The reason is that when you turn the handle on a washer-type faucet to shut off the flow of water the threaded spindle or stem screws its way down into the faucet body and presses the rubber washer on the end of the stem down against the metal valve seat inside the faucet body, thus closing the opening and shuting off the flow of water. Unfortunately, the continual twisting of this washer as it presses down against the metal seat, coupled with the pressure exerted on it when the stem forces it into place, all contribute to comparatively rapid wearing of the washer. If this wear continues long enough, the metal end of the stem, and sometimes the metal screw that holds the washer in place, will start to grate against the metal valve seat, scratching and defacing it so that even a brand new rubber washer will no longer form a watertight seal when fully closed. In addition, these faucet seats can also be damaged by wear that results from abrasive particles in the water, or even mineral buildups that accumulate between the washer and the metal seat. Fortunately, on most faucets the metal valve seats are replaceable - the old one can be unscrewed and a new one installed in its place. Valve seats that are not replaceable can usually be dressed or refaced with a special seat dressing tool that is sold for just this purpose in most hardware stores and plumbing supply outlets. In order to remove the old valve seat you will first have to take the faucet apart, the same as you would for replacing the washer at the end of the stem. Shut off the water supply to that faucet by closing the valve under the sink, or by shutting off the main water supply valve next to the meter. Remove the handle from the faucet, then unscrew the packing nut or bonnet that holds the stem in place. (On some models there will be a large bonnet, held in place by a large flat nut on top, that fits over the stem and covers the packing nut. With these you will have toremove the flat nut then slide the bonnet up over the stem, after which you can get at the packing nut.) After the packing nut has been removed you can unscrew the entire spindle and remove it from the faucet body by turning it in the same direction as you normally do when turning the faucet on. The easiest way to do this is to temporarily replace the handle on top of the stem and then use this to turn the entire spindle assembly. After the stem has been removed replace the rubber washer on the end with a new one of the proper size and shape (if the old washer is so deformed that you cannot tell the original shape take apart another faucet that doesn't leak so you can examine that washer to see what the original one looked like). If the brass screw that holds the washer in place is corroded or worn, replace this with a new screw at the same time. Now shine a bright light down into the faucet body to check the metal valve seat at the bottom. See if the hole in the center of the valve seat is round, square, or hexagonal in shape. If the hole is square or hexagon in shape, then the faucet seat is removable and can be replaced with a new one. However, if the valve seat is round, then it is a permanent one that cannot be removed. Carefully inspect the surface of the valve seat to see if it is scratched, gouged or pitted, or if it is badly corroded and coated with a layer of sediment. If it is, and if the valve seat is the replaceable kind, then it should be taken out and replaced. Most hardware stores and all plumbing supply outlets sell special tools or wrenches for just this purpose. Looking very much like an oversized Allen wrench or hex wrench (in fact, for many of the older faucets you can use a large Allen wrench to remove the valve seat), some versions of this tool have both a square and a hex-shaped section at one end (as shown here). Others have a square shank at the end of one arm and a hex-shaped shank at the end of the other arm. To remove the old seat you insert the appropriate end of this tool into the square or hex-shaped hole at the bottom of the faucet body, then turn the handle end of the tool counterclockwise to unscrew the seat. Lift the old valve seat out and take it with you to the hardware store when you go shopping for a new one to make certain you get one of exactly the same size. You can then install the new one by slipping it onto the end of the wrench after coating the threads on the new seat with a small amount of pipe compound. Fit this into the threaded hole at the bottom of the faucet body, then turn the handle of the tool clockwise to tighten the valve seat firmly into place. If the valve seat is not the replaceable kind but is obviously gouged or pitted, then there is an inexpensive seat dressing tool that you can use for smoothing it down by removing burrs and rough spots. Sold in most hardware stores and in all plumbing supply outlets, this tool fits into the body of the faucet in place of the regular spindle after you have taken the faucet apart as described above. Some models have threads to match those on the spindle so that they can be screwed into the faucet body in place of the spindle, while others have a tapered guide that just fits into the opening in the faucet body. Either way, insert the tool and turn the handle gently until the cutter end is resting against the valve seat at the bottom, then give it one or two turns in a clockwise direction while pressing down firmly. Then turn once or twice in the opposite direction. Remove the seat dressing tool from the faucet, then use a small piece of wet cloth to wipe out any chips or filings that are left on the inside. Better yet, turn the water on momentarily to flush this debris out, but be careful to put something over the top of the faucet to catch the spurt of water that will shoot up out of the faucet body. After cleaning out the inside and installing a new washer on the end of the spindle you can reassemble the faucet. However, before doing so it is usually a good idea to replace the packing material under the packing nut just to make sure there will be no leaks around the stem when the water is turned back on. Some of the newer faucets have a rubber O-ring around the stem instead of packing; replacements for these are readily available in all hardware stores. ANSWERING THE MAIL Q. I have a covered porch that has a concrete slab floor. I have enclosed this porch and would now like to lay ceramic tile on the concrete floor. However, the concrete has several coats of oil paint on it and I am told that the adhesive used to put down the ceramic tile will not adhere over this old paint. Is there any way to remove all of the paint, or is there another alternative you can suggest? - C.A.S., Massapequa, L.I. A. If you definitely want to put down ceramic tile, then you must remove all of the paint first. The easiest way to do this is by using a semi-paste paint and varnish remover. Buy one of the brands that can be washed off with water and spread this on in thick layers with a single stroke of the brush (don't brush back and forth). Cover only a few square feet at a time and allow this to soak on the surface for 10 or 15 minutes. Then scrub off the softened paint with a stiff brush that has been dipped into a detergent solution, and if possible, flush the residue away with a hose. As far as an alternative to tile, using an indoor/outdoor carpet is one of the most popular means for covering floors of this kind - and it is a lot simpler than putting down tile. Q. My asphalt driveway has cracks in several places, but none are more than about 1/4-inch wide. I want to fill these in before coating the entire driveway. Can you tell me what kind of material to use for filling these cracks, and what would be the best type of sealer to apply to this driveway? - J.S., Hampton Bays, L.I. A. Most hardware stores, lumber yards and home centers sell a ready-mixed blacktop patching material that is formulated for use on driveways of this kind. Clean out all leaves, dirt or other debris, then trowel in enough of this mix to completely fill the crack and leave a slight mound on top. Tamp this down firmly with a block of wood and a hammer, or by driving one wheel of you car over it until the patch is level. If necessary add more patching compound to fill it in more. For a sealer use any of the better quality latex emulsion coatings that are also sold for use on driveways of this kind. Questions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually. 3/4i 05-27-87 1124

1484-> Fish Stories That Ospreys Tell
OSPREYS are fish-eating hawks that sometimes nest in colonies, each nest about 50 yards from its neighbors. Such colonies are most common in coastal regions, and scientists have wondered what advantage they have for the birds. The answer, supplied in a recent article in Nature, is that the ospreys actually exchange information that helps members of the colony catch fish. The cooperation is most important during the breeding season when male hawks do most of the fishing and bring food to their mates and chicks. Studying an osprey colony on the Nova Scotia coast, scientists found that hawks even discriminate between good and bad fishing tips. ''Successful foragers are conspicuous from a great distance because they fly with the fish held in their feet,'' said Erick Greene of Princeton University, the author of the report. Other ospreys in the colony recognize the species of the catch and act accordingly. When an osprey returns to the nesting area with an alewife, pollock or smelt, other males will take to the air to retrace the flight path in the hope of good fishing. There is seldom such a response if the first bird comes back with a winter flounder. Alewives, pollock and smelt move in schools while the winter flounder do not. The ospreys evidently know that they have no more than a random chance of catching a flounder if another bird returns with one, but that one of the other species signals the presence of a school within a mile or so. But there is more to the information exchange than that. Some of the returning males perform conspicuous displays as they near the nests. ''These birds would call persistently and fly in an undulating fashion towards the colony,'' the report said. The displays were usually performed by ospreys that had caught fish after a long period in which no other colony members had been successful. The report said the study provided ''the first demonstration of a colonial vertebrate discriminating between prey species with different spatial distributions brought back by returning foragers, and selectively using information about location of prey species to increase foraging efficiency.''

1488-> A REVIVAL OF PROBLEMS IS EXPECTED FOR TEXACO
The decision yesterday by a Texas appeals court could create serious problems for Texaco Inc., according to industry analysts and specialists who have followed the struggle. Those interviewed said that they expect the ruling to revive many of the difficulties the nation's third-largest oil company faced when the original verdict was returned by a jury in Houston in November 1985: a decline in the value of Texaco stock; an increased concern among creditors, bondholders and shareholders about the company's ability to survive, and a hindering of Texaco's ability to carry out normal business. Sanford Margoshes, an oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said: ''In terms of day-to-day business, it means the Texaco management's attention will continue to be diverted from the regular business of looking for, developing, refining and marketing oil. It has clearly been an important diversion of their energy and attention.'' Stock Decline Seen George F. Friesen, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the court's decision would put pressure on Texaco stock. The decision was announced after the close of trading yesterday. Texaco shares had closed on the Big Board at $38.50, down 75 cents. Pennzoil shares closed at $71, down $1. Several analysts said the verdict increases pressure on Texaco to settle the case out of court on terms that are less favorable than would have been the case had the appeals court reduced the amount of the compensatory damage award. ''This clearly has to be construed as a short-term negative,'' said one industry analyst who asked not to be identified. This analyst said that Texaco's poor showing so far in the Texas state courts leaves little hope that it will gain much when it appeals to the Texas Supreme Court. Regardless of the outcome there, the case is almost certain to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Chairman's Response Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., Texaco's chairman, said in a telephone interview late yesterday that the ''fundamental constitutional issues in this case are of such significance that we certainly will take it to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I have every confidence that they would want to hear them.'' Mr. DeCrane also seemed to disagree with any suggestions that Texaco would now be more willing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil. He contended that the Texas courts had twice overlooked clear evidence that the judge's charge to the jury in the original trial was faulty. He said that when the ''applicable law has been ignored and damages that have absolutely no relationship to the size of the transaction are allowed by an appellate court, that doesn't clear the air at all.'' He went on to say, ''That complicates the efforts of the parties to sit down and talk, because an absurdity is not the basis for a resolution of the matter.''

1491-> A MEETING OF ART AND THE DIVINE
Hanging from the rafters of the towering Cathedral of Saint John the Divine these days, there is - of all things - a giant plastic fish. Suspended from the soaring, vaulted ceiling of the nave and constructed of 36 luminescent cylinders, the 42-foot-long, 18-foot-high, S-shaped fish appears to be swimming above the heads of worshipers as its ever-changing colors complement the play of light from the cathedral's mammoth stained-glass windows. The fish - a sculpture by Jonathan Borofsky - is made up of invisible strands of optical fibers encased in bolts of plastic bubble wrap and illuminated by light bulbs shining through revolving wheels of color concealed in a wooden truss. Two giant red spheres for eyes protrude like rubies from each side of the work, suspended 11 feet above the cathedral's floor by a two-ton truss attached through pre-existing holes in the ceiling of the nave to steel cables in the cathedral's attic. Swimmingly Successful ''The cathedral has suddenly become a great ocean and this fish is in it,'' the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the cathedral's dean, said, expressing delight with the fish's arrival. ''The cathedral becomes the cosmos and this fish is passing through it.'' Mr. Borofsky, 44 years old, a California artist known for his eclectic range and untraditional style (his paintings and sculpture often overflow onto ceilings, walls and floors), created the fish for a retrospective of his work at the Museum of Creative Arts in Los Angeles last spring. But at the show's close, the well-received piscine creation became an instant orphan because of its immense size. It requires a floor-to-ceiling space of at least 40 feet. The work's plight piqued the interest of Dean Morton because of the fish's symbolism in Christianity. ''The fish represents Christ,'' said the dean, who heard about the work from a friend. ''The fish represents the resurrection. It was the earliest password between Christians when Christianity was illegal. You find drawings of fish in the catacombs. You find fish in paintings of the Last Supper.'' The work - ''Fish With Ruby Eye'' - will hang from the nave in front of the cathedral's main altar for the next few months, including a period of sermons on ''Art as the Revelation of the Divine in the Common.'' 'I Just Like Fish' Mr. Borofsky, who is of Jewish descent and has no formal religious affiliation, is to deliver such a sermon tomorrow at the 11 A.M. service at the church. ''Frankly I just like animals,'' Mr. Borofsky said the other day, taking a break from a hectic morning of installing the work. ''I like fish.'' Mr. Borofsky and a staff of four workers have been busy all week wrapping, taping, stapling and hoisting the mammoth fish - which, despite its size, appears friendly and minnowlike. A special support had to be built to suspend the work. Special lifts had to be brought in to hoist it. An engineer was consulted to insure that the cables suspended from the attic could hold the work's weight. According to Paula Cooper, Mr. Borofsky's New York dealer, the installation of the work in the cathedral will cost about $35,000, which she and Mr. Borofsky are paying with the hope that they will eventually be reimbursed by a foundation or other sources. The work itself, on loan from the artist to the cathedral amid expectations that it will eventually find a permanent home, perhaps in an airport or a similar large site, has been insured for $300,000, Ms. Cooper said. The work has had to be reconstructed in the cathedral because the sculpture's key component - bubble wrap (material commonly used to pack china) - ''pops'' when the work is dismounted and taken apart for transport. The sculpture's cylinders are formed by using a specially crafted steel tube to roll tight, six-foot-wide strips of bubble wrap that form the body of the fish. Given the enormous installation job, what has been the biggest problem? No bubble wrap six feet wide, Mr. Borofsky said. Although the six-foot variety is readily available on the West Coast, he said, for some reason the East Coast favors bolts of bubble wrap only in four-foot and two-foot widths. So - in addition to everything else -he and his assistants have been busy all week taping four-foot wrap to two-foot wrap to be able to make the cylinders. Californian's Dreaming Why ruby eyes? ''The ruby is a symbol,'' Mr. Borofsky said. ''I've used this ruby before. The ruby comes from a dream I had: I found this red ruby and it made me feel very good. ''I began to draw it and paint it. And it began to take on the symbolism of the heart. My heart. The heart. It felt good to find my heart. It went on to symbolize the heart of humanity.'' Mr. Borofsky said his fish with ruby eyes ''sees with the heart.'' ''Where are the leaders that see with ruby eyes?'' he said would ask in his sermon. ''Where are the leaders that see with their heart?''

1493-> CITIZENS COMMITTEE HONORS NEW YORKERS FOR SERVICE TO PUBLIC
The house next to Edna Robinson's on 97th Street in Corona, Queens, burned down in 1976. Garbage began to pile up on the lot. ''I couldn't even open my window there was so much stench,'' she said. Mrs. Robinson formed the 97th Street-98th Street Block Association to clean up the lot. Last night, the Citizens Committee for New York City awarded the group one of its New Yorker for New York awards at a fund-raising dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria. The committee honored business executives, volunteers and block associations for their work in improving the quality of life in the city, each in a special way. Mrs. Robinson said that the 97th Street-98th Street Block Association was ''still going strong.'' ''I can open up my window,'' she said. ''In the spring you smell the flowers and the aroma from the roses.'' Thurman Smith, the president of the Ditmas Area Coalition, said before the ceremony that the award ''gives us an extra incentive to go on.'' He added that it would serve as a lesson to other neighborhood groups. Senator Jacob K. Javits founded the Citizens Committee in 1975. Organizers raised about $400,000 at last night's dinner for grants and awards to neighborhood groups. The winners of the awards were: Edward G. Finkelstein, the chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company, for sponsoring the annual Thanksgiving Day parade, Fourth of July fireworks, a party for 5,000 handicapped children and a shopping spree for 1,000 underpriveledged children. John Brademas, the president of New York University, for his work in reform in education and the arts. Eugene M. Lang, the president of REFAC Technology Development Corporation, for agreeing to pay for the college educations of an entire class at a school in Harlem and for inspiring other philanthropists to do so through his ''I Have a Dream'' project. Elizabeth Davidson, Andrew Hoover and Laura Kauffmann, volunteers for the Performing Arts Research Center of the New York Public Library who research and catalogue donations for the center's annual benefit bazar. Ocean Hill Coalition, a group of 16 block associations in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, for finding homes for the homeless, educating parents on the dangers of drugs. Ditmas Area Coalition, a tenant group in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, for fighting against drugs in its neighborhood and sponsoring after-school, summer and placement programs for young people. Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy-Drugs Out Committee, a group of 12 neighborhood associations and clergy for organizing to rid their neighborhood of drugs. 97th-98th Street Block Association, Corona, Queens, for creating a community garden, getting the street resurfaced and fighting for a traffic light at an intersection in the neighborhood. East 79th Street Block Association in the Yorkville section of Manhattan for organizing tenants, landlords and homeowners to preserve housing affordable to middle- and low-income residents of the area.

1494-> OLYMPIC GAMES; Hurdle Facing Samaranch: What Role for North Korea?
ON the bookshelf to the right of his desk stand three pewter goblets that remind Juan Antonio Samaranch how far he has gone as the president of the International Olympic Committee. He received one after every million kilometers flown. A fourth is on the way. It is a source of pride that he has now visited 153 of the 167 nations he expects to participate in the 1988 Olympics - the Winter Games in Calgary or the Summer Games in Seoul. More importantly, he has every indication that all the nations, with one possible exception, will compete. Yet that one - North Korea - has consumed a disproportionate amount of his time and energy in recent months, over the question of its role in the Summer Games. With invitations to be extended to all nations Thursday - the customary one year before the Games begin - the North Korean issue remains the last major hurdle between now and the opening ceremonies. ''If we don't reach a solution, I will be sure that we did our best to keep the door open,'' Samaranch said in a recent interview at the Chateau de Vidy, the I.O.C. headquarters. ''I have learned to negotiate with the Oriental style - not to be in a hurry and to know what it means to ask one question and get an answer that does not have anything to do with what was asked.'' The North Koreans initially wanted to be co-hosts with South Korea and threatened to boycott the Games if their request was denied. Which it was. Though a series of negotiations, however, the I.O.C. agreed to offer Pyongyang a limited program, and the current offer is five events -women's volleyball, men's and women's archery and table tennis, a cycling event and a preliminary round of the soccer tournament. North Korea's response was a demand for eight events and another meeting. With time growing short, Samaranch refused both, creating a scenario in which nations may not know to where they are are being invited. On Saturday, the North Koreans sent a new letter to South Korea. The South Koreans did not immediately accept it, saying that it was not passed along during normal business hours. Both Samaranch and Kim Un Yong, an I.O.C. member from South Korea who is here for I.O.C. meetings this week, said they would not know the contents until it was accepted today. ''We have gone very, very far in offering North Korea the possibility of organizing some events from the Olympic program,'' Samaranch said. ''If they accept the offer, we will be ready to sit down at the table and discuss many other points we must resolve if some of the Games are organized in North Korea. But we are not ready to discuss any of that until there is agreement on which sports they will organize.'' By now, it is clear to Samaranch that the North Korea question is one of logistics, rather than politics. A former Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union and the I.O.C. president since 1980, he has developed close relations with many Soviet-bloc leaders as well as with many from Western and third-world countries. Those ties, plus the disruption of the last three Summer Games by boycotts, have convinced him that other countries would not follow a boycott by North Korea. Only one leader worried him, Fidel Castro of Cuba, who publicly supported North Korea's early insistence upon serving as equal co-host. Samaranch subsequently met with Castro, and the two seemed to strike a compromise. ''He recommended to me to improve the offer made to North Korea,'' Samaranch said of their meeting several months ago. ''I followed his advice.'' That might have been something of a gift by Samaranch, in that Cuba was only awarded the 1991 Pan American Games with the promise that Cuban athletes participate in this year's Pan American Games, which they did, last month in Indianapolis, and in the 1988 Summer Games. ''When we gave individual events to North Korea, we felt it was the best way possible for North Korea to accept the invitation,'' Samaranch said. ''We were also thinking how to ease the situation for Socialist countries around the world to accept.'' But, he noted, some Soviet-bloc countries responded by saying it was not necessary to reward North Korea, inasmuch as they did not view North Korea and South Korea as separate states of a single country. Samaranch and other I.O.C. officials have met with the North Koreans four times in efforts to resolve their differences. The ''ambiance'' of each successive meeting improved, he said. He also described the Pyongyang delegation as ''serious and eager'' to organize Games in the North. Yet another view has emerged from within the I.O.C. family, one that would seem to contradict Samaranch. This view holds that the North Koreans actually want no part of staging events, that they never expected the I.O.C. to be even this accommodating, that their real intent is to disrupt the Games and serving as a host would make that objective impossible. ''I wonder if they really want them or if they ever wanted them,'' said an I.O.C. member who asked that his name not be used. ''I wonder if all they really want to do is rain on the parade.'' That sort of postulation raises the more ominous question of whether a disruption from the North would be the equivalent of a shower or a thunderstorm. ''I don't think anyone fears military intervention,'' said the member, a strong Samaranch supporter. ''But a minor border incident, say in July 1988, could destabilize the situation on the peninsula and make people wonder if it's a safe place to go.'' Samaranch discounted the possibility that the North Koreans' bargaining position might be insincere. But, as his colleague pointed out, he almost has to, in that as long as the I.O.C. appears accommodating to the North Koreans, the North Koreans may feel compelled to continue negotiating. ''It's a brilliant move on the part of the president,'' the member said. ''As long as they're trying to co-host, they can't attack.'' The logistics of staging games in the North may be far more difficult than deciding which ones to stage. Samaranch said he would insist that the North Koreans open their border to ''all the Olympic family,'' which means coaches, trainers and officials, as well as journalists. Among the other considerations are the technological problems of the television networks broadcasting the events, the distribution of television rights fees and the accessability of games in the North to spectators from the South and other countries. Samaranch insisted he cannot envision the ultimate solution, saying, ''I don't like to dream.'' ''One day,'' he said, ''we must say yes or no, and then we will go our way. If we organize some games in North Korea, I will be very happy. But we are not stopping our progress because of North Korea. At one point, it will be too late for North Korea. But I don't like to study this point now. Now, I like to be more optimistic.''

1495-> JAZZ: BYRD ON TRUMPET
DONALD BYRD was part of the hard-bop jazz mainstream in the 1950's and 1960's; in the 1970's, he took a lucrative detour into pop. But through this Sunday at the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, he is playing what he said was his first New York jazz club date in 17 years, working with a quartet led by James Williams on piano. (He shares a double bill with the pianist Michel Petrucciani and his trio.) It's not strictly a return to hard-bop - the group includes a synthesizer player, Michael Doherty, who added some unwelcome pseudo-string sweetening - but it's definitely jazz, not pop. The open, singing tone that established Mr. Byrd's reputation is intact, as he showed in Thursday's first set with a reverent and virtually unembellished reading of W. C. Handy's ''Harlem Blues,'' recalling Mr. Byrd's early-1960's gospel-jazz albums, and in Mr. Williams's languid ''Alter Ego.'' But the other tunes in the set suggested that Mr. Byrd had sacrificed some of his individuality, in solos that echoed his contemporaries Freddie Hubbard and Miles Davis. A breakneck version of Jimmy Heath's ''Ginger Bread Boy'' had Hubbard-style flurries of notes, aggressive but lacking in melody; a new piece by Mr. Doherty was a virtual homage to Mr. Davis's 1969 album ''In a Silent Way,'' complete with muted, interrogatory solos by Mr. Byrd. Mr. Williams's piano solos rely on melodic sequences that grow predictable, but with Marc Johnson on bass and the vociferously exact Marvin (Smitty) Smith on drums, the quintet had a brisk, gusting momentum. Perhaps Thursday's set was just an uninspired one.

1498-> FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; New York City Seeking Bids for a Reduced Sale
New York City said yesterday that it would sell $600 million of revenue anticipation notes due June 30, 1988, in competitive bidding today. After disclosing plans to sell up to $1 billion of notes last week, city officials reduced the sale to assure compliance with new Federal tax laws that more severely restrict the size of local government borrowings and their ability to earn interest from temporary investing of those funds. Fresh cash-flow projections also pointed to a smaller financing, a spokesman for the City Comptroller's office said. However, he added, another note sale later in the fiscal year is possible, but it would be preceded by a new announcement. The notes, backed by state aid payments, are expected to carry the highest ratings of MIG-1 from Moody's Investors Service and S.&P.-1+ from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Securities dealers expect the notes to yield about 4 percent. New York City is emulating other local governments that seek flexibility by announcing plans for competitive debt sales far in advance but giving securities dealers only a day or two of notice before bids are made.

1499-> Siamese Twins Begin To Wake From Coma And Breathe Alone
The infant twins who were separated last week in a 22-hour operation began to emerge today from the drug-induced comas in which they were placed for the surgery, a hospital official said. ''They're starting to show signs of waking up now,'' said Ghita Levine, a spokeswoman at Johns Hopkins Hospital here. They are starting to ''show some spontaneous movement'' and trying to breathe on their own. Doctors began reducing the barbiturate dosage Saturday night and planned to withdraw the drug completely tonight, Ms. Levine said. The 7-month-old twins, Patrick and Benjamin Binder, are not expected to awaken completely for several days, Ms. Levine said. The boys, West Germans who were born joined at the head and shared a major vein, were separated Sept. 5. Brain Swelling Absent Doctors maintained the infants in a coma for a week to keep their brain functions to a minimum so the brains could use most of their energy to heal. The twins, who had been breathing on a respirator, are now beginning to breathe independently, said Ms. Levine. They remain listed in critical but stable condition, she said. Patrick and Benjamin were in the operating room for two hours Friday night to have their scalp wounds cleaned, said Lisa Hillman, a hospital spokeswoman.
