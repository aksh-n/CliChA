The shadow of that powerful Gallic drama all but obliterates the pleasant, thoughtful but rather pat go in the same direction, filmed in 1959 in Amsterdam as a German-Dutch co-production and opening, finally, yesterday at the Casino Theater.
NOBODY who saw it is likely to forget that marvelous French movie several seasons back called "The 400 Blows," wherein a relentless life pounded the mind and soul of a small boy into those of an old man. The shadow of that powerful Gallic drama all but obliterates the pleasant, thoughtful but rather pat go in the same direction, filmed in 1959 in Amsterdam as a German-Dutch co-production and opening, finally, yesterday at the Casino Theater."Ciske" (the young hero's name) is the second American premiere, with English titles, in the Yorkville showcase's current festival. Considered strictly on its own, "Ciske" is somewhat better than okay.Here, in the person of a 13-year-old named Dick van der Velde, we have a young neurotic abused by an abominable mother and neglected by a sailor father. The terror of his school, the desperate child commits matricide, is packed off to a reformatory and, after his release, undergoes some civilized torture at the hands of his schoolmates and their parents. The climax radiates love, serenity and well-being. Actually.At the outset (unlike Françoise Truffaut), director-scenarist Wolfgang Staudte makes a mistake by telling his story from the viewpoint of some hovering adults, including a rather blithely solicitous teacher (Kees Brusse) and a kind-hearted shopkeeper (Riek Schagen). This makes for a slightly condescending tone, even as the child's tragedy deepens.Furthermore, even after the horror of the child's reflexive act of murder—staged with brisk taste, we must admit—the boy's rehabilitation is a little too neatly circumstantial. It's reassuring to watch the young hero's comforting by the older folk, which extends to his reformatory stretch. But somehow the later ugliness, when his classmates and their parents hound the little fellow for his past, makes more sense as a study of human meanness. Never mind, though—the fadeout couldn't be sunnier.Master van der Velde is an expressive young punching bag—though, again, we wish we had seen more from his specific viewpoint. As two stanch little friends, Heidi Everts and Piet van Leeuwen are entirely disarming. Rob de Bries does well enough as the lad's father and, as the mother, a portly actress named Jenny van Maerlant is a billowing horror.All considered, "Ciske" is mighty comforting. In his "400 Blows," Mr. Truffaut applied a sledgehammer. Take your choice. The CastCISKE, scenario by Wolfgang Staudte, based on the novel by Piet Bakker; directed by Mr. Staudte; co-produced by Film Productions M.I.J. (of Germany) and Amsterdam N. V.

680-> The Screen: Wilder's 'Irma la Douce':Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon Star
WHO would have dreamed that Billy Wilder could make a bright and yet acceptable film out of the Gallic naughtiness and mischief of the stage show "Irma la Douce"? Not I, for one, with all due deference to the eminent director's comic skill and his ability to handle raw material with deceptively silken gloves.Well, surprise, surprise! He's gone and done it. At least, he's made a brisk and bubbly film that has got past the official bluenoses and onto the DeMille and the Baronet screens. Whether more sensitive patrons will find it wholly acceptable and proper for teen-age youngsters, I wouldn't want to guess. But as light and satiric entertainment, it is certainly acceptable to me.For Mr. Wilder has taken this tale of a brash Parisian poule (that's a prostitute in our language) and her mec (that's a "business manager") and run it into a charmingly antic romantic comedy. Sure, he lets us know beyond question what the lady's profession is. He even gives some humorous demonstrations of her and her associates plying their trade in the luridly lighted area adjoining the markets (Les Halles). And he frankly maintains the fiction of her and her fellow living in sin—double sin, in fact, because the fellow also woos her once a week in disguise.But the major thing that Mr. Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond have accomplished in their script is to force the essential good humor and innocence of a spoof—a travesty of the legend of the Parisian apache and his girl. This is an obvious needle of "bourgeois morality," and as such the exaggeration is extravagant and broad.Without the employment of the music and dance that were used on the stage to give the whole thing an aura of conscious theatricality, Mr. Wilder has had his performers deliver the travesty straight, relying on comic invention to do the service of music and dance.Thus the wonderfully skillful Jack Lemmon, who has the role of the impromptu mec (a job he picks up after being fired as a policeman for staging a raid on the poules), is called on to work the hardest and to the sharpest effect. His magnificently keen and agile clowning is what really carries this film.Whether acting the naive policeman ("What are all you girls doing around here?") or slyly impersonating a bucktoothed and one-eyed English peer (the bridge on the River Kwai fell on him and left him but "half a man"), Mr. Lemmon is little short of brilliant — vigorous, incisive and deft. And he also contributes to the character a little genuine sentiment.A good bit of that is delivered by Shirley MacLaine as his poule, whose sense of moral stricture is as loose as her flimsy bodice. But Miss MacLaine, too, has a wondrously casual and candid air that sweeps indignation before it and leaves one sweetly enamored of her. Though the film is less hers than Mr. Lemmon's, she is cheerful, impudent and droll.Lou Jacobi is dry and nutty as the cafe proprietor, Moustache, who flavors the wild proceedings with a light philosophical zaniness. As the mec whom Mr. Lemmon displaces, Bruce Yarnell is a snarling bully-boy, and Hope Holiday does some funny business as a Lolita-type poule.The staging (much in Paris) and the color have character and glow. The only fault I can find is that the whole thing is somewhat one-tracked and overlong. Mr. Wilder worked harder than was needed with the readily available Irma la Douce. The CastIRMA LA DOUCE, screenplay by Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond, based on the play by Alexandre Breffort. Produced and directed by Mr. Wilder; a Mirisch Company and Edward L. Alperson presentation, released through United Artists; at the DeMille Theater, 47th Street and Broadway, and the Baronet Theater, 59th Street and Third Avenue.

THE Casino Theater, in presenting a festival of subtitled revivals of German features, is including a batch of American premieres. The first one, "City of Secrets," opened at the Yorkville Theater yesterday, and it's a nice one.Made in 1957 and marking the first postwar movie direction by the beloved old actor Fritz Kortner, this unpretentious film is a quiet, "winning study of some factory employes facing dismissal.Mr. Kortner, making the most of a good cast, has guided a series of linked vignettes, ranging from sad to frisky, with taste and ease. But it is the varying reactions of his protagonists, abruptly exposed to hard reality, and the appropriate performances that give the film its disarming—if mild—tonic effect. These people may be unspectacular, but they are real, including a murderer.There is the crusty factory boss (Walter Stissenguth)—not a bad chap, just brick-headed, as his whirlwind daughter (Margot Trooger) happily reminds him. There's a blithe telephone girl (Eva-Ingeborg Scholz), ready to team up with the office publicist. Add a pretty spinster (Bruni Lõbel), terrified of the future, and the world's gabbiest cleaning woman (Grethe Weiser), who blandly makes the premises her rent-free home.But it is the deceptive simplicity of the plot (by Mr. Kortner and Curt Johannes Braun) that gives the film its low-keyed, lifelike flavoring—and occasional poignance.In a tender, beautifully written episode (with a grand O. Henry twist) Annemarie Düring, as a lonely secretary, shares a meaningful day with a neighbor, Erich Schellow. By contrast, two old-timers, Paul Hörbiger and Miss Weiser, superbly carry off one moving scene—a brief reunion, after 30 years.It's a small picture, but thanks to Mr. Kortner and a cast of subtle professionals, there's nothing small about the characters. They're likeable, they matter, and that's size enough. The CastCITY OF SECRETS, screenplay by Fritz Kortner and Carl Johannes Braun; directed by Mr. Kortner; produced by Real-Film; presented by Bakros Corporation.

1484-> The Screen: 'Three Fables of Love':French and Italian Tales Open at Cinema I Free Adaptations Come From La Fontaine 'Good Soldier' Opens
LIGHTWEIGHT — so light and fluffy you could pulverize them with one puff—are the three little episodes or incidents presented in "Three Fables of Love," a Franco-Italian production, which came to Cinema I yesterday. But it's hardly worthwhile to waste breath on them. Nature will soon blow them away.Most trivial of the lot, but least annoying because of the slick little way in which it is made, is the third vignette with Leslie Caron and Charles Aznavour, directed by Réné Clair. It simply tells how she, a model, and he, a picture-framer, get trapped in a room by a faulty door-lock, and have to stay there through a weekend in which Paris is deserted.An air of iciness and truculence on both performers' parts and some cute little tricks with cutting and flashbacks by the nimble Mr. Clair make for a tense and frosty climate that is intruded on by a sly denouement. It isn't much of a fable, but it is certainly the best in the film.For the others—a routine comedy about a man, his mistress and his wife, with the roles played by Rosanno Brazzi, Monica Vitti and Sylva Koscina, and a mere skit in which Michel Serrault is flattered by Jean Poiret to the point of being obvlivious while Mr. Poiret flirts with Mr. Serrault's wife—are so frivolous and foolish, so tediously worked out in talk, that it is difficult to endure them.La Fontaine, the French fabulist, would hardly be flattered by these labored transmutations of three of his tales.On the bill with this limp little picture is an extraordinary 30-minute short, called "The Most"—a devastating documentation of Hugh M. Hefner, the editor and publisher of Playboy magazine. In it Mr. Hefner and some of his associates endeavor to explain him and his enterprises against a shifting background of his office and his Playboy clubs. It concludes with a candid-camera look at a frenzied party in Mr. Hefner's home."I am," he frankly tells the camera, "the most successful man I know."The picture makes one wonder what his notion of success really is. THREE FABLES OF LOVE, a co-production of Madeleine Films-Franco London Films from an idea of Frederic Grendel and Herve Bromberger, produced by Gilbert de Goldschmidt and presented by Janus Films.

Charles AznavourSINCE laughing at war has come to be one of the more familiar motifs of German-language films, it was logical that the moviemakers eventually would turn to "The Good Soldier Schweik."The well-known satirical novel by Jaroslav Hasek, which caused something of a stir as a theater piece in the nineteen-twenties, was presented yesterday in a carefully mounted Austrian version at the Carnegie Hall Cinema for a run that is likely to be limited.For the heavy satirical style of Germanic acting and direction, recently evident in such films as "Aren't We Wonderful?" and "The Captain From Kopenik," today seems as stilted and archaic as the once sensational antimilitaristic material. In the highly technical but stodgily mannered acting of Heinz Rühmann, "Schweik," the symbol of punctured pomposity, seems merely a ponderous bore.The character so minutely depicted is a "certified idiot" conscripted into the Austrian Army during World War I. He is patriotic, well-intentioned and seemingly harmless but given to excessive philosophical resignation when confronted with hostile global forces. Facing a firing squad after being captured by his own army, he typically shrugs."It makes no difference whether I'm shot by a Russian or an Austrian bullet. A bullet is a bullet."Occasionally the idea is amusing, as Schweik fumbles his way into the war as a model orderly and unwittingly pushes his battle-shirking lieutenant into heroism at the front. When the dashing young officer, nicely played by Ernst Stnkovski, dies laughing at one of his orderly's shaggy-dog jokes, the ironic effect could hardly misfire.Nonetheless, the art-house and off Broadway habituées who are today's foreign-film audiences will find this decidedly familiar fare. Bertolt Brecht did it all before in the series of expressionistic anti-war plays that recently have been so much in vogue—and even the most dedicated partisans of cinema-over-theater must concede that he did it a great deal better.

1487-> Screen: Cockney Comedy:'Sparrows Don't Sing' Arrives at Cinema I
A WILD and wacky frolic with some lusty characters is the only description for the chaos that occurs in "Sparrows Can't Sing," a Cockney farce that came to Cinema I yesterday. It is set in London's East End, that cluttered area of the city that has been called Brooklyn-by-the-Thames.Disorder reigns in this picture as if it were purposely enthroned amid the consideration with which Elizabeth II was crowned Queen. Disorder is in the behavior and the general attitude of the people involved toward life, and disorder is in the story structure and in the way it is splashed onto the screen.Joan Littlewood was the director. She's the Jack-of-all-trades noted for the fertile Theater Workshop, which she developed in the East End. From it she sent forth such items as "A Taste of Honey" and "The Hostage" of Brendan Behan.The present conglomeration, first done by Miss Littlewood on her East End stage, smacks of thee place of its origin and of Miss Littlewoods' inexperience with film.It charges into its low-class area, where old slums are being knocked down and glass-and-concrete hives are rising, as if it were spoiling for a brawl, and it flails away at a wisp of story with the untidiness of a drunken sailor in a free-for-all.Indeed, the focal character is a sailor home from the sea and looking about for the little woman and for the grubby neighborhood he left two years before. He flounders in brute irresolution, he flings money to the winds and he gurgles goodwill and vexation at not being able to find what he seeks. No wonder nobody wants to tell him that his little woman is living with Bert, a thick bus driver, in one of those concrete boxes and "fings eyen't wot they used t'be" back here.That's the Frankie-and-Johnny situation. Stephen Lewis, original author of the play, and Miss Littlewood have barely managed to keep it more or less in the clear while theatrical chaos swirls around it and cinema techniques crash and bang all over. But out of it do emerge some raw chunks of straight Cockney comedy and farce, some bright bits of social observation and, too, a faint strain of pathos.For there is something moderately amusing and mildly sad about this crude sailor, played by James Booth with a vast lot of gesturing and groping; he is so eager and yet so patient toward his pint-sized wife, whom Barbara Windsor plays with all the perkiness and eccentricity of a bouncy English sparrow.There is a nice hint of humorous folkways in the casualness with which the East End tribe treats a matter of domestic relations, how it adjusts—or doesn't adjust—to new things. There is fun in the gross and mad performing of Roy Kinnear, Murray Melvin and such as those.However, this isn't a picture for anyone with a logical mind or an ear for the English language. The garble of Cockney spoken here is as incomprehensible as the reasoning of the characters who speak it—and that's profound.As a restorative for the damage this picture does to the ear, the program also offers a very lovely 30-minute film, "A Tribute to Dylan Thomas," in which Richard Burton reads from the works of the Welsh poet while beautiful scenes of Wales are shown. A mood of nostalgia and sadness is spelled with images and words. The CastSPARROWS DON'T SING, screenplay by Stephen Lewis and Joan Littlewood, based on the play by Mr. Lewis.
