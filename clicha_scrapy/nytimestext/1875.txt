The Democrats of the so-called Southern Tier of New-York have not worked harmoniously during the present political campaign, and in common with their brethren in other parts of the State they are divided, low-spirited, and discontented.

We rushed irreverently upon this hoary and hallowed old town on the night of the 27th. The railroad is considered by devout Shakespearean devotees a pert and sauey innovation, but it is a most convenient one, and brings here thousands of pilgrims who would else "pass by on the other side".
