357-> At the Central
Crime, in which the Central Theatre specializes, and which has been grounded for some time, even at that progressive establishment, takes to the air along a politely vague but nevertheless definitely Mexican-ish border in Columbia's "Criminals of the Air." As if the title weren't sufficiently self-explanatory, the picture opens on an air-field maintained by a fictional "Border Patrol" (successor to the Texas Rangers), takes off shortly afterward in quest of the smugglers of aliens into these racially pure precincts and hardly lands again until the criminals have been brought to earth in a dog-fight and motor-car-strafing sequence which ought to stir even the sluggish pulses of the Roaring Forties. The cast, more than merely "adequate," play their parts with genuine gusto. Our departmental theme-song, in the secondary or "Class B" field, is still "Hail Columbia."
