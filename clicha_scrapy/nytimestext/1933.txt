1-> A "CALCULATED STUMBLE."

2-> Richard Dix, Wera Engels and Florence Eldridge in an Adaptation of a Novel by Fulton Oursley.
Few screen tales have been quite as extravagant as that of "The Great Jasper," an adaptation of a novel by Fulton Oursler, which is now at the Radio City Music Hall. One is tempted to aver that a great deal of pains have been taken to make this piece of fiction stranger than truth, but then the producers might retaliate by saying that it is based on fact. However, Richard Dix who has been called upon in his career to play many adventurous rôles tops everything he has done in this weird affair.Mr. Dix Impersonates Jasper Horn, who starts out as the driver of the last horse-car in his home town. He is a peculiarly vacillating individual and when he hears that the conductors and drivers of the line resent the coming of electricity, he volunteers to run the first electrically driven car. So far, this tale is not without interest, but subsequently Jasper falls in love with his employer's wife, Norma McGowd, who be it known is played by the attractive German actress, Wera Engels. The excuse for her rather fascinating foreign accent is that she is "McGowd's European wife." Jasper is married and has a youngster, but in course of time he becomes the father of Norma's child, a fact which is eventually discovered by McGowd.After his dismissal by McGowd, Jasper goes to Atlantic City with his son, Andrew. Jenny Horn, being thoroughly upset by her husband's amours and his drinking, refuses to accompany him. Once in Atlantic City, Jasper determines to stay there. The question is what he can do to earn a living. It happens that he seeks to ascertain this from a fortune teller, named Mme. Talma, portrayed by Edna May Oliver. As both of them like to imbibe liquor, it is not long before they are good platonic friends. Time passes rapidly in this picture, but one or two of the characters look just as young as they did in the opening scenes. Mme. Talma one day sends for her lawyer and also for Jasper. She wills Jasper her business and her fortune.So the car driver of the first sequence undertakes to wear a fez and to tell gullible women their fortunes and in doing so he makes quite a good deal of money. There comes the time when he encounters Norma again. Their son, Roger, is a band leader with a gift for small talk. It is quite plain that he has inherited his father's reprehensible characteristics.Notwithstanding the capable performances of several in the cast, the incidents are not a little tiresome. Mr. Dix tries hard to cope with the peculiarities of his rôle and Wera Engels is worthy of a more suitable part. Florence Eldridge is thoroughly believable as Jenny.On the Stage.In the stage production there are glittering conceptions of Venice, one scene being of the Grand Canal, with Patricia Bowman, the ballet corps, and the Roxyettes lending their terpsichorean talents to the colorful activities.This is prefaced by the orchestral overture, "Frimliana," arranged by Maurice Baron, and by the singing of "Only a Rose," "The Indian Love Call" and other Friml compositions. THE GREAT JASPER, based on the novel by Fulton Oursler; directed by J. Walter Ruben; an RKO Radio production. At the Radio City Music Hall.Jasper Horn . . . . . Richard DixJenny Horn . . . . .

9-> The Late Ernest Torrence in His Last Picture, a Melodrama of San Diego's Waterfront.
Culled from Max Miller's book, "I Cover the Waterfront," there has reached the Rivoli a stolid and often grim picture, the principal asset of which is the clever acting of the principals, particularly that of the late Ernest Torrence. Its drama is not nearly as successful as one might expect in a film directed by James Cruze. The sullen happenings are more shocking than suspenseful, and for moments of levity there are the mumblings and doings of a bibulous newspaper man and the Hollywood conception of the manner in which another reporter berates his city editor.Instead of depicting several contrasting episodes from the original chronicle, the producers have contented themselves with concentrating on a melodramatic series of incidents concerned with a sinister fisherman who finds that there is more money in smuggling Chinese into the United States than in angling for tuna. This evil specimen of humanity is known as Eli Kirk, and it chances that he has an unusually attractive daughter named Julie, who is personated by Claudette Colbert. She, it appears, is much more simple than she looks, for while she knows that her father is a terror when drunk, she evidently believes that that is the limit of his wrongdoing. There is also Joseph Miller, one of those newspaper geniuses to be found only in motion pictures. Ben Lyon has charge of this part.This melodrama is laid on San Diego's waterfront. Kirk is a kindly father, but he thinks nothing of dropping a bound and gagged Chinese overboard when a Coast Guard cutter pursues his fishing craft. Later a character referred to as Old Chris, who drags the harbor water for anything he can find, brings up the body of the Chinese just when the ubiquitous Miller comes alongside in another boat. It looks like a good story to Miller, who, knowing that his city editor, John Phelps, may doubt him, decides to take the body to his office. The reporter insists that Kirk is responsible for the death of the Chinese, but Phelps hazards in no uncertain terms that there must be evidence against Kirk before the story can be printed.Miller decides to pay attention to Julie, hoping to glean from her information regarding her father's secret activities, but evidently she knows nothing, and what is more, Miller is not precisely blind to the girl's beauty; in fact, he falls in love with her. Nevertheless, he continues his investigation, and once again the Coast Guard men board Kirk's boat. He has been shark fishing this time. This is suspicious, inasmuch as it would have been to a fisherman's advantage to go South for tuna. Kirk, however, has his reason for harpooning sharks, which is disclosed in the course of this narrative. Miller is Kirk's nemesis, but after the old man passes away with a bullet through his lung, one is informed that Julie and the great reporter are to be married.Mr. Torrence's last performance was the part of Kirk. He did, as always, excellent work. Miss Colbert does well as Julie, but she is scarcely convincing as a fisherman's daughter, chiefly because she does not look the type. Ben Lyon makes the most of his part. Purnell Pratt, Harry Beresford and Rosita Marstini are equal to the demands of their rôles.

177-> Mary Pickford, Leslie Howard and C. Aubrey Smith in a Free Film Version of the Play, "Secrets."
Mary Pickford, whose comely presence has not decorated the Broadway screens for two years—her last film having been a version of "Kiki"—is now to be seen at the Rivoli in a very free translation of the play "Secrets." This current offering has its intriguing episodes, notably in the beginning, but the latter sections are somewhat confusing.It seems as if Frances Marion, who was responsible for the adaptation, had suddenly realized, after becoming very enthusiastic over her own ideas that there must be something about the basic thought of the parent work in the production. Therefore the "Secrets" part of the film does not emerge until an entirely different story is well under way, and when it comes, it is a sorry surprise. It is then that one hears that John Carlton, who has shown himself to be a heroic and an ideal husband, has been philandering in a California city. One of his paramours turns up at a reception, when John has political ambitions, and is recognized as a woman who had been seen with him in San Francisco.Many years prior to this sorry development John is beheld as the ardent suitor for Mary Marlowe's hand. Her tyrannical father, however, is eager to have her married to the terribly boring Lord Hurley. These initial sequences are set forth with some degree of amusement and romance. They happen in New England in the days of high bicycles and crinolines, which seems rather anachronistic.Eventually John and Mary elope, and then journey to the Golden West in covered wagons to the tune of "Susannah." John is a stalwart husband, who resents the stealing of his cattle and returns shot for shot when desperadoes attack his log cabin. Nobody would ever suspect him then of turning out to be a husband who would fall from grace. Through diligent work he prospers, and it is surmised that this prosperity goes to his head, particularly when it is heralded that he may be nominated for Governor of California.But Mary finally overlooks her husband's latter day wild oats and believes him when he insists that he loves only her. There is a threat from the other woman, but right triumphs in the end.Notwithstanding the disjointed story, Leslie Howard favors it with an excellent performance. He is admirable as the love-lorn young man, and he looks the rugged pioneer in subsequent episodes. But one cannot say that he ever strikes one as a man who has clandestine appointments with fast women.Miss Pickford is vivacious and charming in the New England phases of the picture, but her acting during the hard times in the log cabin is not always convincing. She is at her best in the lighter interludes. The Western element of this pioneering outburst is not suited to her. C. Aubrey Smith does capital work as Mary's unsympathetic father. In fact, it is with regret that one leaves him to go West, for it is quite evident that this good actor will not be seen again. And he is not. There is, however, Mr. Howard, besides Miss Pickford, all through the years of this trying tale.

THE SINNER" is a translation of the novel from which was taken Maurice Schwartz's remarkable play. "Yoshe Kalb," now at the Yiddish Art Theatre.

527-> Lionel Barrymore and Gregory Ratoff in a Film Version of a Novel by Lester Cohen.
Many a comparatively young actor has "grown old" in the course of a cinema story, but it has remained for Lionel Barrymore to reverse this order of things. For in the film conception of Lester Cohen's novel, "Sweepings," which is at the Radio City Music Hall, this talented player, with the assistance of the studio make-up wizards, takes thirty years off his age, or appearance, in the itroductory episodes. And he looks quite convincing as a man of 25.So long as Lionel Barrymore lends his presence to a picture it is bound to arouse a good deal of enthusiasm, and if this particular offering has its weak moments and patches of poor humor and crude dialogue, it also has some strong sequences. Besides Mr. Barrymore's forceful portrayal, it is also blessed with a fine human impersonation by Gregory Ratoff.In an opening flash there is the reminder of Mrs. O'Leary's cow, which kicked over the lamp that started the great Chicago fire. The sight of the blazing buildings is followed by a brief but very effective depiction of the hardships and discomforts endured by many persons. Then comes the time when Daniel Pardway (Mr. Barrymore) opens his small dry-goods store, called the Bazaar, which, as years roll by, proves an immensely successful venture. Pardway becomes so wealthy that he builds a pretentious home, but just before he moves into it, his wife, Abigail, dies.Notwithstanding the care devoted to the education of the three sons and the daughter, Pardway is doomed to be disappointed in them. He had hoped that Gene, Fred and Bert would be proud to take part in directing the affairs of the great store, but Gene is not partial to business and gets into trouble with a girl. Bert rebels against the position of assistant general manager, preferring to devote his time to window dressing, and, young Fred flies high and then for months lives like a tramp. As for the daughter, Phoebe, played by the comely Gloria Stuart, she is impelled to become the bride of a ne'er-do-well Prince, who deserts her after he has obtained all her available cash.It had always been Pardway's desire that the store would be owned only by his children and because of this he refuses to satisfy his general manager, Abe Ullman, by giving him a part ownership in the business. As it turns out, Abe is more loyal to Pardway than any of his offspring, but before Pardway passes out of this life, he has the satisfaction of knowing that after sowing more than their share of wild oats, the sons and the daughter are repentant.Miss Stuart makes the most of her rôle. Allan Dinehart gives a clever impersonation as one of Pardway's intimate friends. Eric Linden does highly creditable work as Fred. William Gargan is excellent as Gene and George Meeker is believable as Bert. And then there is Mr. Ratoff's splendid interpretation of Abe.The various flashes of the business in the store, with the throngs at the bargain counters and the astute salesmanship of Abe, both in the early interludes and later ones, are set forth most entertainingly.On the Stage.Among the striking features on the stage program is "The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise," in which the Roxyettes in glittering gold costumes contribute their usual clever precision dancing.The other number, "Big City Blues," which has several scenes, has among other performers Jane Froman and Eric Titus as singers, more dancing by the Roxyettes, the ballet and Margaret Sande. Several of the performances aroused applause. SWEEPINGS, based on the novel by Lester Cohen; directed by John Cromwell; an RKO Radio picture. At the Radio City Music Hall.Daniel Pardway . . . . .

823-> Pity the Hero.
Many a mystery is less bewildering than "Heroes for Sale," which was not intended as a puzzler at all. Just when the Strand audience is beginning to wonder how Richard Barthelmess is going to handle an interesting situation, the producers throw the Jonah plot over-board and set the cast to work on a new one. Both plots are good, but not in the same picture.Plot No. 1 tells the story of a rich young man and a poor young man, both from the same town. During the war Roger Winston, the rich one, leads a prisoner-seeking foray into No Man's Land. He loses his nerve and the capture is made by Tom Holmes, the poor one. Roger receives all the credit while Tom, seeking surcease from the pain of his wounds, acquires the morphine habit. Discredited when his addiction becomes known back home, Tom is cast off, while Roger continues to enjoy his unmerited laurels.Plot No. 2 shows Tom starting life anew in Chicago. He prospers, marries and becomes half-owner of a labor-saving machine. During a workers' strike, which he tried to stop, his wife is killed. He is blamed for leading the riot and is sentenced to jail. Still prompted by love for his fellow-man, he devotes his fortune to feeding the hungry, but becomes himself a homeless wanderer, unable to find work.If there be any connection between these stories, it is only that of Tom's unbroken misfortune.Mr. Barthelmess carries on bravely under the afflictions which fall to the lot of Tom; Aline Mac-Mahon does well, as in any part, as the keeper of the soup kitchen, and Loretta Young, as the wife, and Gordon Westcott, as the spineless Winston, help the story along. The brightest characterization is that of Roger Barrat as Max, the Communist inventor who turns capitalist when his invention proves successful.

905-> " Strange People" a Murder Mystery Film That Draws on the Familiar Devices of Its Genre.
Most of the staple commodities of the mystery-homicide school have found their way into "Strange People," the new arrival at the Seventh Avenue Roxy. Rain, shadows and the half-human sounds the wind makes when it whistles around the gables of a house at night; stairs that creak and floors that groan; the stifled screams of women who imagine they can see the silhouette of a man hanging dead on the balcony; and the look on the face of a corpse when it tumbles out from behind a screen. If anything has been left out, notify Richard Thorpe, who directed "Strange People," or Jack Townley, who wrote the story.Only a calloused rogue would say that murder is commonplace, but "Strange People" makes rogues of us all Not that the situation is not chilling enough on which to build a presentable shocker. The twelve members of the jury which sentenced an innocent man to death are summoned at midnight to the murdered man's house. There the defense attorney stages a murder to prove that circumstantial evidence is too capricious a thing with which to sign away a man's life. When the assembly discovers that the "subject" of the test really is dead, the plot begins to whirr with the violent machinery of melodrama. Evil faces peer from behind gratings and the house becomes heavily populated with suspects and trapdoors.Although there are enough corpses and motives to keep an audience mystified, the film has a tired and hackneyed look. The cast is pleasing, the acting is conventional and reminiscent, and "Strange People" is a good deal milder than a murder mystery has any right to be.

1075-> Henrietta Crosman Scores in "Pilgrimage," Which Has Premiere at the Gaiety.
Between them John Ford and Henrietta Crosman have declared a sentimental holiday in "Pilgrimage," which was unreeled at the Gaiety last night. As the producer of "Four Sons," Mr. Ford revealed his talent for compounding eloquent drama out of tears and laughter. In "Pilgrimage" he has crowded the screen with the details and simplicities of emotions both ordinary and profound. Miss Crosman, by some strange magic of her own, makes the old, commonplace virtues of motherhood not only dramatic, but fresh and clean and very touching. "My hair is growing white," she said in a short stage appearance last night. "If you like Hannah Jessop, you make me the happiest woman in New York." This morning she has had her wish.If the story of the embittered mother and her lost son seems overlong, if it seems to lure easy tears out of an audience, it is also filled with sincerity and warmth. Nor could one believe that a group of Gold Star mothers on their way to France could be so rich in humor.The story of Hannah Jessop is the story of a mother who sends her son to war because of her consuming pride and possessive motherhood. On adjoining farms in Arkansas the boy Jim and the girl Mary fall in love at the outbreak of the war. Torn with jealousy, the mother tries to break the affair, and when she fails signs the boy over to the draft board. He is shipped to France before he has time to marry Mary and he is killed not long after he knows that she is wth child. The lonely mother, hard with bitterness against the girl who took her son from her, watches Mary and her baby with venomous eyes.When she is persuaded against her will to accompany a gold-star delegation to France, she comes in contact with many touching stories of the love of mothers for sons who are dead. In Paris one night she finds a boy and a girl who are about to re-enact the original tragedy of Jim and Mary. In the process of persuading another selfish mother to release her son to the girl he loves Mrs. Jessop comes to understand the wrong she has done, and she returns to Arkansas with a new and cleansing emotion.This is a fable that could drip with maudlin tears in any one of a score of sentimental scenes. It is a triumph for Miss Crosman and for Mr. Ford that "Pilgrimage" achieves delicacy and tact where those commendable qualities seem beyond reach. From a technical standpoint the film is replete with expertly contrived bits. The feel of misty mornings is in the opening farm scenes, and the quaint rural manners of the Middle West are presented with charming accuracy in a number of briefly drawn characters.Although it is Miss Crosman's film, the cast is uniformly good in support of her. Norman Foster and Marian Nixon as the young lovers are believable and moving in their portrait of frustrated romance. For humor there are Lucille La Verne as a hearty dame from the Ozarks and Charley Grapewin as a bibulous farmer. As the latter-day girl in Paris, Heather Angel is splendidly fresh and lovely in her American screen début. PILGRIMAGE, based on a story by I. A. R. Wylie; directed by John Ford; a Fox Film production. At the Gaiety.Hannah Jessop . . . . . Henrietta CrosmanSuzanne . . . . . Heather AngelJim Jessop . . . . . Norman FosterMary Saunders . . . . .

1121-> A Soviet Yiddish Picture.
Another Soviet motion picture based on the clash between the "old" and the "new" in Russia is at the Europa Theatre under the title of "The Return of Nathan Becker." This time, however, the dialogue is in Yiddish. The spectators get an interesting view of a cross-section of the Jewish population and see the best side of the industrializing of the Soviet Union being pushed forward ruthlessly by the government in a hurried effort to make the country economically self-sufficient.The central figure of the story, Nathan Becker (David Gutman), returns to his native village after an absence of twenty-eight years spent in the United States, mostly in laying brick, eager to place his skill at the service of the Soviets, although he apparently has only a vague idea as to what it is all about. His father (S. M. Mikhoels), despite his age, has become a Soviet enthusiast and is a leader on the job of building the huge steel plant at Magnitogorsk. Becker and his wife (Elena Kashnitskaya) are accompanied by Jim (Kadler-Ben-Salem), a Negro bricklayer, who contributes materially to the comedy side of the action. After at first scorning the Soviet methods of training bricklayers and being beaten in a contest by a youthful trowel wielder, Becker finally becomes reconciled to the "new" way and is overjoyed at being told by the construction chief that a combination of the American and Soviet technique will make the work move still faster.In the screen telling of this simple tale the directors have presented many highly entertaining incidents of Jewish life in the Russia of today and have refrained from dwelling too much upon the building activities. The acting of the principals is excellent. A feature of the film is the humming and singing of Yiddish folk songs, especially by Mrs. Becker, who to the very end has only a hazy conception of the new Russia. Plenty of English titles make the action plain to those unfamiliar with Yiddish. THE RETURN OF NATHAN BECKER, a Yiddish dialogue film, with David Gutman, S. M. Mikhoels, Elena Kashnitskaya, Kadler-Ben-Salem, B. Babotchkin and V. Yablonsky; directed by B. V. Shpiss and R. M. Milman; a Belgoshkino production. At the Europa Theatre.

1164-> John Barrymore as the Timid and Benign Professor Topaze of the Play by Marcel Pagnol.
John Barrymore is the leading figure in the pictorial translation of Marcel Pagnol's play, "Topaze," which is now at the Radio City Music Hall. Notwithstanding differences in mood and action from the original work as it was offered on Broadway, it is an agreeable and effective film, and Mr. Barrymore lends no little artistry to the rôle of the benign Professor Auguste Topaze, a part played with rare skill on the stage by Frank Morgan.Although Mr. Barrymore's performance is not always as beguiling as was that of Mr. Morgan, it is readily understood that his slight failings are the result of the bidding of H. d'Abbadie d'Arrast, the director, who, although he is French, has, curiously enough, endeavored to popularize this story by making some of the episodes unnecessarily farcical. In the French version "Topaze" was looked upon as bitingly satirical and Benn W. Levy's English adaptation was described as being sunny and sly. The humor in the picture takes a downward trend, which, it is to be presumed, was done under instructions from studio executives.The kindly Parisian pedagogue, however, survives to a certain extent, although his timidity is sometimes akin to stupidity. He appears in various places which cannot be said to possess much in the way of French atmosphere and now and again he has to listen to lines interspersed with American colloquialisms. His way of talking, however, is quite satisfactory, even though he seems to emulate the ostrich in some of his actions.Professor Topaze first appears in the school dominated by Dr. Stegg. Topaze is a champion of honesty and in his class of boys is one incorrigible pupil named Charlemagne de Latour-Latour, son of Baron Latour-Latour. Professor Topaze's report on this youngster is anything but satisfactory to his parents. This leads to the professor's dismissal and eventually to an unexpectedly new way of earning his living. For Topaze soon finds himself head of the Baron's allegedly scientific laboratory at what to him is an enormous salary.Up to that time Professor Topaze's main ambition was to win an academy decoration. The Baron is a designing politician and apparently such a trivial wish as the academy decoration is easy to obtain.Then comes the shock when the professor discovers that the health-giving water the Baron makes his money from is scarcely fit to drink. To pacify Topaze the Baron arranges that he receive the long-desired decoration, with the result that after having upheld honesty the professor decides to get on the other side of the fence. The upshot is that he outpoints the Baron at his own game and blossoms into a well-bartered and magnificently tailored man who has no qualms about blackmail or stealing the Baron's mistress.Mr. Barrymore accomplishes the change from the bearded Topaze to the immaculate, dishonest, but rich, man with the necessary impressiveness. The hitherto timid and often silly Topaze, a man who dare not say boo to a goose, assumes a position in which he takes full advantage of his authority to keep not only ordinary persons waiting but also the Baron.Reginald Mason is excellent as the Baron. Myrna Loy does very well as Coco, the Baron's mistress. Jobyna Howland is moderately funny as the Baron's adipose wife, but Jackie Searle as the dunce of the class is disappointing. Frank Reicher makes the most of the rôle of Dr. Stegg.Amos and Andy.That radio team, known throughout the land as Amos and Andy, appear on the stage of the Radio City Music Hall and demonstrate with vocal changes the various characters heard over the air. Their efforts aroused hearty applause.On this end of the program there are also several numbers, with dancing by the dependable Roxyettes, Patricia Bowman, Eleanor Powell, and singing by other members of the company.

1284-> Manhattan Folly.
As a title "Daring Daughters" is as forlorn as the picture it represents, which went on view at the Seventh Avenue Roxy yesterday. For a heroine it offers Marian Marsh as a disagreeable young woman who glories in her ability to cause the men of her wide acquaintance to look dull-witted. She is selfish, willful and ill-tempered toward the men she is presumed to be so adept at deceiving, and by some miracle of the scenarist's art her methods are pictured as altogether successful. Perhaps the most violent paradox in the film, however, is that the girl is presented as a sympathetic and even glamorous gold-digger.The story is about two sisters, of whom Miss Marsh is the elder and wiser. Joan Marsn, no relative of Marian, is the little country sister who must be protected from the males of the big city. There is an evil fellow, played by Kenneth Thomson, and a fine young man, played by Allen Vincent, and the story shows how the one is defeated in his sinister designs on the virtuous sister and how the other wins the grudging admiration of the elder girl. In the world of reality, which "Daring Daughters" avoids at all points, neither of these particular young women would be in need of protection.Clever Imitations.Charlie Jordan and Johnny Woods, radio entertainers, give a number of skillful and hilarious impersonations of celebrities as their contribution to the stage show. Rosita Moreno dances in a lively way and engages in banter with Dave Schooler, the master of ceremonies.Elsewhere on the varied program of song and dance are Tom and Betty Wonder, the Trojans. Lee, Port and Dotty, and the Gae Foster Girls. DARING DAUGHTERS, based on a story by Sam Mintz; directed by Christy Cabanne; a Tower production. At the Seventh Avenue Roxy.Terry Cummings . . . . .
