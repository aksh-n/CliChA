89-> THE BUMPER CROPS.

93-> DETROIT DEFEATS CRIPPLED YANKEES; Manager Wolverton's Hard-Luck Crew Fall by a Score of 6 to 2.
The Yankees have caught up with, tied, and passed out all records for hard luck among baseball clubs. Not because Detroit beat them on the torrid Hilltop yesterday by a score of 6 to 2, but because of the big hospital list the club possesses. Three convalescents got back into harness yesterday, Simmons and Hartzell, who have just recovered from sprains, and Maloney, who has just cheated the hospital out of a case of malaria. 
--------
94-> Central Park Plants, Rooting Near the Surface, May Be Injured.
The Sage rhododendrons are now being hoed in Central Park. It seems a pity that such a fine gift of Mrs. Sage is so very unjustly treated in the hands of the Park Department. The department, or at least the men employed in it, or those who give orders, ought to know that rhododendrons should not be subjected to being hoed, as it is totally against the nature and habits of these plants.

--------
113-> Against the Intellect
There is a widespread revolt against the intellect. It is represented in philosophy by such men as Bergson, Eucken, and James.

A few weeks ago an authoritative estimate of the number of armed opponents of the Government in Mexico was 20,000, but that is a great many, even in a nation of 15,000,000 inhabitants. Every armed rebel must represent a number of non-combatants who desire the overthrow of the Government.

Except for the strength and moderate activity in a number of the copper shares yesterday's trading on the Stock Exchange was as lifeless as on any mid-Summer half-holiday.

248-> BY CHARLES LEE.; Perhaps a New Barrie -- At Any Rate, a Charming Writer
THE annals of a quiet life are by no means the easiest to chronicle. There is temptation to be either condescending or sentimental, to trim matters up a bit or else help them with a touch of brutality. There's another difficulty. Observation is excellent, but it isn't actual experience.

Dealings on the Stock Exchange contracted further yesterday and prices, gauged by the average quotations for fifty issues, were almost stationary.

The Chicago White Sox continued their course toward embarrassing the Athletics in their quest for the American League pennant at the Hilltop yesterday by defeating the Yankees.

--------
269-> KIRKBY LEADS GOLF FIELD AT BALTUSROL; Travis and Travers Among Stars Who Qualified in Metropolitan Tournament.
With rounds of 82 and 81 for a total of 163, Oswald Kirkby of Englewood led the field in the qualifying round, which was at thirty-six holes, of the fourteenth annual championship tournament of the Metropolitan Golf Association over the links of the Baltusrol Golf Club yesterday.

--------
277-> RUNNING THE ENGINE.

LONDON, Dec. 21. -- To those who know London it is no news that, given the requisite capital, it is a simple matter to discover facilities for losing it over a gambling table.

--------
288-> LOTS OF GLITTER, GIRLS, AND WHIRLS; With Gertrude Hoffmann of the Aubrey Beardsley Poses in New Show at the Winter Garden.
Gertrude Hoffmann, fleet of foot and lithe of limb, with her transformations from Aubrey Beardsley poster effects, deep-shadowed, Carmen-lipped, and auburn-hued, to a sunlit figure, flesh tinted and flaunting a mass of golden hair -- the same Gertrude Hoffmann whose voice takes on the syrupy sweetness of an earlier Ethel Barrymore, then breaks into the queer squeakings of an Eddie Foy. 
--------
289-> Unkind Criticism from Doctors Thins Their Ranks.
As a friend of the nurse, and a lover of justice, I wish to ask why the pupil nurse is taught such loyalty and subjection to the doctor? Why is she expected and commanded, when graduated, whether in private duty or in an institution, to always defend the doctor, even when she knows him guilty of gross mistakes, and possibly worse? 
--------
290-> LOCK POLICEMAN IN HOUSE HE GUARDS; Rosenthal Asked Him to Consider Himself "Thrown Out" for Test Assault Case.

NEWPORT, R.I., July 21. -- Princess Lwoff-Paraghy, who came from New York Friday to the New Cliffs to deliver a portrait to August Belmont, left for New York to-night, and will sail for Europe to-morrow.

--------
295-> TOO POSITIVE A CURE
EVEN a Connecticut farmer can make a mistake. One of them did when he became over-enthusiastic in his conversation with the top-floor girl. The top-floor girl had engaged board at the farm for three weeks, but before she had been there three days she appeared dissatisfied with her surroundings. 
--------
296-> SHOE SALESMEN'S REPORTS.; Coming Season Expected to be the Best in Some Time.
With a good number of the salesmen representing the more important shoe wholesalers operating in the Duane Street district returned from their Fall trips, a general compilation of the advance orders booked tends to bear out the predictions made in certain quarters of the market several weeks ago that the coming season would be one of the best in some time.

--------
298-> POPULAR AND PUBLIC.
The list of the contributors to its campaign fund which the Democratic National Committee made public on Monday is interesting. The very idea of publishing the names of contributors is interesting, because in a National campaign it is a novelty. It is a novel procedure, too, to attempt to conduct a campaign for the Presidency upon popular subscriptions. 
--------
299-> NEW USE FOR MICROBES.; How Dead Ones Are Used to Slay the Evil in London Hospital.
LONDON, July 27. -- The old American frontier adage that the only good Indians are dead ones is more than pertinently applicable to the microbe war that is going on at St. Mary's Hospital here, for in this hospital the dead good microbes are used to slay the living evil ones. 
--------
300-> PRISON BOARD TO RESIGN.; Dilemma Over Governor's and Carmody's Views on Contract Too Hard.

LONDON, Thursday, May 23. -- The Times says in its City article to-day: 
--------
303-> THE GIFT HORSE'S VITALS.
When the Greeks despaired of taking Troy by force they tried stratagem. The gift horse which ULYSSES and his Captains left at the Trojan gates was received with joy, and was set on the citadel. The siege of Central Park has been unremitting these fifty years. It has been generaled by every private interest that would pervert this landscape of green and trees from its original purpose. 
--------

--------
307-> SERVIA PLACATES AUSTRIA.; Grants One Demand -- An Ultimatum Was to be Sent To-day.
LONDON, Thursday, Nov. 21. -- The outlook between Austria and Servia has improved. Servia has given way in the affair of M.

--------
308-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
The demand for call funds has been eased to some extent by the entrance of some of the savings banks into the loan market. Brokers who have been able to obtain a share of this money have paid less than the prevailing rate, owing to the fact that the savings bank laws require high-class bonds as collateral. 
--------
309-> LONDON HEAVY, BUT OPTIMISTIC; Trade Improvement Tends to Offset Drop in Stock Prices.
LONDON, July 21. -- The continued depreciation in high-class securities, the losses suffered by the recent liquidation, and the general dullness on foreign Stock Exchanges and Bourses continue to weigh upon London stock markets. 
--------

LENOX, Mass., Aug. 10. -- Dancing is being revived in the Berkshire resorts, largely because of the interest in the country clubs, where after dinners guests engage in the dances of the day.

--------
313-> MR. CARNEGIE'S TAX PAYMENT.
Citizens like Mr. CARNEGIE are not born every year, but taxpaying property equaling his does come into existence annually. Accordingly, it is doing him less than justice when his tax payment under the secured debts law is described as a tax-dodging device. It is true that he pays on his registered bonds but once, and that he used to pay on his millions of personalty annually. 
--------
314-> SCHOOLGIRLS' CLOTHES
DON'T get lingerie so sheer and so lacebedecked that the first laundering will leave it in rags. Nothing is more serviceable for girls use than French embroidered underwear without lace on heavy linen. 
--------
315-> THE SEVENTH SUFFRAGE STATE.
Since Ohio's Constitutional Convention has adopted the Woman Suffrage proposal, that State, if the people ratify the committee's will, follows California into the suffragist column.

Ohio makes the seventh.

Coney Island's week of fun, the Coney Island Mardi Gras, which has become an established custom and brings to an end each Coney season, began last night in a blaze of color and with much music and confetti. The show will last a week, and, judging from the crowd that journeyed to the resort last night, this will be one of the most successful celebrations since the Mardi Gras became a Coney Island institution. 
--------
318-> NO FREAKS IN NEW FASHIONS; Skirt Model to be Wider Above and Narrower Below the Ankles.

--------
320-> THE FIRST CROP REPORT.
The severity of the Winter sufficiently explains a decline double that which is usual in the condition of Winter wheat. But the cause which explains the decline is the basis of reasonable hope that the setback may be recovered. A wet Spring makes a fat harvest proverbially, and the floods now raging are proof almost in excess of the wetness of the season. 
--------
321-> CULTURE, MONEY, AND VULGARITY.
Mr. I. TOWNSEND BURDEN, Jr., will never understand the processes of nature unless he masters the doctrine of Determinism. Mr. TOWNSEND'S' immediate trouble is not with nature, but with the habits of the newly rich. He draws up his complaint in this wise:

PARIS, June 30. -- Although enormous crowds journeyed to the Longchamps racecourse for the Grand Prix de Paris this afternoon, the wet weather robbed the meeting of its customary elegance. 
--------
323-> MISS HOSTETTER, DEBUTANTE; Mrs. Theodore Hostetter Introduces Flee Daughter at Dinner Dance.
Mrs. Theodore Hostetter gave a dinner dance last night at Sherry's to introduce her daughter, Miss Greta Hestetter. They have been abroad since last May when they went to London, and in the early Winter went to India for the Durbar.

PHILADELPHIA, Penn., Dec. 21. -- Indications point to a widespread shake-up in the coaching of three of Pennsylvania's major sports -- crew, football and track. 
--------
325-> THE TAFT-BRYCE PLOT.
It seems that President TAFT is a conspirator and that Ambassador BRYCE is a traitor. These bad men alone together, so to speak, passed the agreement of reciprocity which at the present moment threatens the British Empire, and will disrupt it as soon as they take formal steps to that end. 
--------
326-> MAY BE CHANGES AT YALE.; Rumors Mostly Concern New Coaching System in Football and Rowing.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 21. -- Although Yale's football players will hold a meeting next week to select a resident head coach for a term of years, this movement is overshadowed in the general demand for a reorganization of Yale athletics.

--------
583-> WHY PAGAN?; And Why Should Friends Battle with Friends?
WALTER LIPPMANN in a revival of Paris bestowing the pagan apple of discord on Venus O'Sheel is an engaging figure. But before we applaud this Trojan fall of a lucid thinker beneath the aphrodisiac philologics of Mr. O'Sheel, we might in fairness recall the origin of a controversy that has stoked to such ardor the embattled penmen of New York.

THE basic difficulty in the relationship between employer and employed, especially in the servant situation of to-day, lies in the fact that every one is thinking of his rights, and no one of his duties.

LONDON, Nov. 10. -- Balkan developments again considerably influenced the stock markets the past week, Reports, good and otherwise, caused prices to fluctuate, the week ending with a general depression of prices, which, however, was due partly to the dislocation of business caused by the annual Lord Mayor's show on Saturday, dealers taking the opportunity to lower prices because no bidders were present to challenge them.

THE heading of Dr. Hill's recent article, "Impure Air Not Un-Healthy if Stirred and Cooled," is the most startling part of what he writes, and, if misinterpreted, the most harmful.

Many of the scenes enacted to bring about this result read like fairy tales, a particularly good one being where the Queen Mother signs the new constitution.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. -- With many witnesses still to be heard in the impeachment proceeding against Judge Robert W.

PHILADELPHIA, Penn., Dec. 13. -- The "Candy Trust" of Philadelphia was attacked by Attorney General Wickersham in a civil suit filed here to-day against the Philadelphia Jobbing Confectioners' Association, which has combined and conspired, it is charged, to coerce candy manufacturers from selling direct to retailers, to consumers or to jobbers other than members of the association.

973-> ART NOTES FROM PARIS
PARIS, Aug. 18. - "Decentralization in art" is a phrase which is gaining a good deal of currency. It means, if anything, the establishment of regional centres of art in France, in semi-independence of the aesthetic authority of Paris. But the idea is as yet vague in its limitations, and it is uncertain as to what it may lead. 
--------
974-> GROWTH OF RAILWAYS; Why It Has Failed to Keep Pace with Agricultural and Manufacturing Interests.
An interesting study worked out by the Bureau of Railway Economics at Washington, D.C., leads to the conclusion that the money and brains which have been put into the construction of steam railways in the United States have been rewarded to a much smaller extent than similar investments in the other two great branches of industry, agriculture and manufacturing.

975-> TIGERS' PLAY RAGGED.; Princeton Shows Poor Form, but Easily Defeats Virginia P.I.
PRINCETON N.J., Oct. 12. -- Though offering the most ragged football of the season, Princeton had enough individual stars to romp away with a 31 to 0 victory over Virginia Polytechnic Institute this afternoon. Frequent fumbling by the Tigers and a continuous imposition of penalties, most of which were due to Princeton's holding, marred the play, and only the spectacular power of the Tiger players saved the game from being a very uninteresting affair.

976-> NO INSURANCE FOR GERMANY'S AVIATORS; Navigators of Balloons Can Get It at High Cost, but Not Aeroplanists.
The business of insuring the limbs and lives of aviators, which has been carried on in Germany for about two years now, has proved to be far from satisfactory to the insurance companies, according to United States Consul General A.M. Thackara, stationed at Berlin.

979-> GRADE CROSSINGS REMAIN.; Commission Has Money for One at Babbitt's, Westchester.
ALBANY, May 5. -- The ordered elimination of the grade crossing on the Harlem Division of the New York Central lines at Babbitt's Crossing, in Westchester County, by the Public Service Commission, Second District, has caused some speculation by reason of the statement issued by the commission that it would be impracticable for the commission to do any more work for lack of funds.

981-> PLAN FOR CREATING ADMIRALS FOR NAVY; Committee for Making Fleet Commanders Admirals and Flag Officers Vice Admirals.
WASHINGTON, May 5. -- The Naval Appropriation bill, which will probably be reported to the House the coming week, will provide for two Admirals and two Vice Admirals for the United States Navy. This will be done without increasing the number of flag officers now in the navy and without lumbering up the retired list, already very large, with additional officers of high rank. 
--------
982-> TAFT IS STUDYING ELECTORAL MIX-UP; Roosevelt Men Control Ten States Where Electors Already Have Been Chosen.

William Barnes, Jr., in addition to being Chairman of the Republican State Committee, will be Chairman of the Advisory Committee to be appointed by Chairman Hilles of the Republican National Committee to aid in the Taft campaign. Mr. Barnes will have a desk at the headquarters of the National Commitee in the Times Building, and virtually will be the right-hand man of Mr. Hilles in the conduct of the National campaign. 
--------
984-> WHO COOKED THE PANAMA MESS?
President TAFT has too many troubles of his own to have unloaded upon him the responsibility for the Panama proposals which the country has rejected so generally. It is now recalled that in his message last year he recommended equality of treatment of the ships of all nations regarding tolls, and added that subsidies might be voted to American ships out of the tolls collected from the ships of other nations. 
--------
985-> MELTING THE ICE CAPS.; Mr. Riker Maintains His Plan Would Benefit Northern Europe.

In introducing the budget for the coming year the British Chancellor, as told in yesterday's cables, referred to business conditions in the United States as stronger than at any time for years and he ventured the prediction that the Presidential election, which he described as the only disturbing factor, would not have any very serious effect on the trade of the United States.

--------
992-> ART NOTES FROM LONDON
LONDON, June 6. -- The eccentricities of the Italian Futurists, which scored a succes de scandale in London a month or two ago, have at least had one beneficial effect. They have made the Londoner's attitude toward art more tolerant. Things are now accepted, or at least seriously discussed, that only a short while ago would have been dismissed with a shrug or a jeer. 
--------
993-> WANTED, REGULATION OF REGULATION.
Evidence accumulates of anxiety on the part of those not long since most eager for the regulation of railways. Not that anybody is anxious about the railways. But the idea is spreading that it is not possible to confine damage of the railways to the railways. The cries which are now arising are for the regulation of regulation of the railways, in the interests of the users of them.

994-> EDUCATION NOTES.
Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University, was unable to attend the celebration in honor of Dr. Maxwell on Thursday evening because he was making the first political speech of his life in Boston.

--------
996-> A JOURNALIST'S STORY; George W. Smalley Reminisces About Whistler, Irving, Roosevelt, Morgan and Other Celebrities
THERE is nothing more entertaining than a collection of reminiscences from the pen of a veteran journalist; and no writer has had a more varied and more significant career than Mr. Smalley, whose name has for so many years been familiar to the readers of The New York Tribune and of The London Times. Being a correspondent for both papers, his official capacity made him friends in vastly significant circles. 
--------
997-> U.S. FASTEST SHIPBUILDER.; Navy Yard Work on New York Beats Private Construction.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. -- The tradition concerning the slowness of navy yard work has been smashed by the New York Navy Yard in the construction of the big battleship New York.

--------
998-> STILL ALARMED BY AUSTRIA.; Other Powers Cannot Understand Why She Does Not Demobilize.
LONDON, Wednesday, Dec. 25. -- The question looming sinister in the European sky is not when peace will be signed by the belligerents but why, in view of the settlement of the cause of the quarrel between Austria and Servia, Austria does not demobilize. 
--------
999-> NOTES AND GLEANINGS.
Oysters fattened and bleached in polluted fresh water streams are classed by the laws of this State as "adulterated food." Unquestionably there is danger, not from the gray and lean oyster of the salt bottoms, but frown his river-fattened and whitened brother. Sporadic cases of typhoid fever occurring in Greater New York have been traced to this source, and serious epidemics in other cities.

1000-> STUDIES ITALIAN SAUCES.; Large Imports Here Cause Washington Official to Investigate.
ROME, Oct. 12. -- Burton Howard of the Department of Agriculture at Washington has spent some time in traveling throughout Italy and visiting manufacturers of tomato sauce.

BALTIMORE, Md., June 24. -- William Jennings Bryan, backed by the Wilson and other Progressive leaders, is standing against the field to-night on the question whether the Progressives shall organize and run the Democratic National Convention, or whether it shall be opened with a reactionary keynote in an address by ex-Judge Alton B. Parker as Temporary Chairman. 
--------
1002-> THE CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE.
Never probably were more words spoken or printed in any Presidential campaign than in the present, nor were more subjects ever compressed into the various platforms. It is, therefore, odd that there should be even one man in the United States who imagines that there is a conspiracy of silence on anything. 
--------
1003-> SPARK PLUG HAS RETARDED PROGRESS; Adoption of Standard Thread Makes It Expensive for Car Owners.
It is a question whether on any single component of a car more inventive ingenuity has been expended than has been the case with the sparking plug. The manufacture of this small, but vitally important part, runs into millions annually, and new types are still being introduced. On the whole, no part of the car's construction is more reliable than the sparking plug.

HAMILTON, Bermuda, Oct. 22. -- The Australian Cricketers "came, saw, and conquered," but Bermuda was by no means disgraced.

--------
1008-> VISCOUNT CHINDA SHOCKED.; Self-Destruction Has Been Rare in Recent Times, He Says.

--------
1009-> REGISTRATION FALLS 25,000 BEHIND 1908; Hope of the Politicians That the Holiday Would Bring Out the Voters, Disappointed.
The second days registration yesterday was again marked by low figures. As it was a legal holiday, with all workers at leisure, the political leaders had anticipated an increase in the number of those qualifying at the booths. This did not materialize. In 90 per cent. of all the Assembly districts throughout the city yesterday's figures were below the figures of the preceding day, which had been low enough to worry the political leaders.

1013-> ANATOLE FRANCE; " La Reine Pedauque" Introduced by W.J. Locke
AS Anatole France writes without a thought for any limitations of subject or treatment except those imposed by the taste and judgment of his own countrymen, and as he uses to the full all the liberties which they permit to an adult addressing adults, there is something of peril in translating him into English. 
--------
1014-> NO PLAYING WITH FIRE.
In his message to the Aldermen disapproving resolutions permitting two political clubs to have displays of fireworks in this city, Mayor GAYNOR gives good and sufficient reasons for his veto. The city is responsible for injuries, deaths and damage to property caused by explosions of fireworks when they are thus authorized.

A cleverly executed double steal by the Yankees on the Hilltop yesterday tied the score with Detroit in the eighth inning and a lucky Texas Leaguer by Hal Chase sent Bert Daniels over the plate with the run which defeated Detroit by a score of 3 to 2.

Two men who were busy unloading cement from a barge at the eastern end of Blackwell's Island yesterday saw a man climb up on the sea wall near the pavilions where the tuberculosis patients are sheltered and start to write something in a little notebook.

1036-> BELATED JUDGMENT.
The action of the House of Representatives in unseating the Republican member from the Eleventh Pennsylvania District is very tardy and unsatisfactory. The cause of the action was bribery. The case seems to have been a pretty unsavory one all through, as the committee reported the rival of the unseated member was not entitled to the place. It is pleasant to record that the vote was not divided on party lines.

--------
1063-> DEFLATED TIRE TROUBLE.; Motorist Frequently Travel Long Distance Ignorant of Puncture.
It often happens, says a tire expert, that motorists travel on deflated tires for considerable distances without knowing that such is the case. This is generally due to the fact that punctures are not always followed by sudden deflation, but frequently allow the air to escape very slowly. 
--------

In so many words, he warns them not to split upon the rock of Bryanism. 
--------
1066-> A MUSICAL MEMORIAL.
The institution by bequest, as a perpetual memorial, of a yearly concert of good music, seems as wise and as conducive to public benefit as the foundation of an annual lecture on science or art. Many such lectureships are held by colleges and universities. Music of the right sort is as uplifting as knowledge of science and art.

William Shapiro, the bullet-headed, low-browed chauffeur who drove the automobile in which the assassins of Rosenthal, the gambler, escaped, answered questions for nearly an hour yesterday afternoon in Justice Goff's Extraordinary Term of the Supreme Court at the trial of the four gunmen.

--------
1072-> INDUSTRIAL COMPENSATION.
Our readers will be particularly interested, we are sure, in the letter which we publish this morning from the head of the Claim Department of the New York Central  Hudson River Railroad. It is a very clear analysis of the main features of the plans for compensation for injuries sustained by workers. 
--------
1073-> THE END OF CONGRESS.
It is one of the queer features of our political life, in what we like to call a democracy, that it takes ordinarily more than a year for a change of parties in Congress to have any practical effect. The Representatives elected in November begin their nominal term of service only in March, and, unless sooner called together by the President, they do not meet until thirteen months from the date of their election.

BALTIMORE, June 24. -- "It makes no difference to me what the committee does," said William Jennings Bryan this morning.

--------
1084-> DOCTORS AND A SANE FOURTH.
If Independence Day is to be celebrated this year with comparatively little slaughter, the saving of life should be attributed largely to the efforts of the American Medical Association. The Journal of this association, beginning its propaganda for a "sane Fourth" in 1903, published lists of the dead and maimed after the celebration of that year and after every subsequent celebration.

NEWPORT, R.I., July 3. -- James J. Van Allen has served an attachment on an appropriation of $30,000 made by the Board of Aldermen for the completion of buildings at Easton's Beach. Mr. Van Alen alleges that he loaned that sum to the company which had the contract to erect the buildings. The notes went to protest. 
--------
1088-> POTATOES, FOR INSTANCE.; If Supply Is Short, the Tariff Shoots a High Price Higher.
That a tariff tends to make times hard is easily seen. Take one item, potatoes. Think of a dozen nations, all of whose people like potatoes, fried, mashed, boiled. The total crop for the year may be enough for all, but the crop in two or three countries may be a failure. Why should the potato-hungry people refuse to buy? Why should their wonted food be made unduly dear? 
--------
1089-> MRS. WALLACH WINS TWICE.; Captured Matches In Women's Tennis on Longwood Courts.
BOSTON, Sept. 23. -- Miss Mary Browne of Pasadena, Cal., the National woman lawn tennis champion, and two other former title holders, together with a number of players of National reputation were contenders to-day in the opening rounds of the annual woman's tournament at the Longwood Cricket Club. 
--------
1090-> COTTON YARN PRICES UP.; Advances General in the Local Market -- Worsted Yarns Firm.
The local cotton yarn market continues active and strong. A heavy business was done during the week, and prices were advanced from 1 cent to 1 1/2 cents on practically all numbers. The advances do not seem to bother buyers so much as the question of delivery. The market is bare of desirable stock and immediate delivery is almost impossible to get on the most-wanted yarns. 
--------
1091-> ENGLAND'S NEW LEAGUE.; Will Foster Field Athletics to Make Showing in Next Olympics.
That England is about to take the lessons of the recent Olympic games to heart and help re-establish the supremacy of the "tight little isle" in the track and field sports is evidenced by the formation of the Amateur Fields Events Association, which is to foster these sports which have been practically a dead letter in the United Kingdom for years past. 
--------
1092-> DRY GOODS IMPROVED.; More Spot Buying and Stocks of Seasonable Goods Move Rapidly.
Under the stimulus of an almost unbroken period of bright weather, trading in the New York dry goods markets showed considerable improvement during the week just closed.

1097-> AFTER ARGENTINA TRADE.; Americans Trying Hard for It, but Find Difficulties.
Answering the charge of Consul General R.M. Bartleman, stationed at Buenos Aires, that it is largely the fault of American manufacturers and merchants that a greater volume of American textile merchandise is not marketed in Argentina, a prominent domestic silk manufacturer says: 
--------
1098-> SEPTEMBER'S FAILURES.; No Let-Up In Large Total of Manufacturing and Trade Insolvencies.
The number of business failures over the country still continues high, as evidenced by the September report of Dun's Review, which records a total of 1,167, the highest for any September in recent years, not excluding even 1908. The liabilities made a smaller total, however, being $13,280,511, against $15,933,182 in 1910, and $17,208,186 in 1908. 
--------
1099-> MEDIAEVAL ART IN THE BRONX
UP in Williamsbridge, on the banks of the little Bronx River, stands a vine-covered manor house with nothing about its slanting roof, its colonial doorway, its grape arbors and old-time garden, to suggest a factory. Yet an inscription over the door designates it as one of the few places in America where hand-made tapestries are produced. 
--------
1100-> JAMES OPPENHEIM'S REPLY; Ties Himself to Ibsen and Sinks with the Ship
THE reviewer of my novel "The Olympian" has, I see in the REVIEW this morning, again delivered a broadside at the shrinking author. But whether it is a broadside of confetti or shrapnel I haven't as yet been able to determine by the damage done.

1101-> SURE OF 501 VOTES, SAYS COL. ROOSEVELT; Admits 345 Delegates Are "For Some Other Candidate," 84 Uninstructed, 38 Contested.
TOLEDO, Ohio, May 16. -- "Of the delegates already elected I have 501," said Col. Roosevelt to-day. He stood by his statement of yesterday that he was confident he would be nominated on the first ballot at the Chicago Convention.

1102-> A DISABLED TURBINE DELAYS LUSITANIA; It Breaks Down as the Liner Leaves Queenstown and Keeps Her Back a Day.
The Cunard liner Lusitania arrived yesterday morning from Liverpool twentyfour hours late, owing chiefly to a breakdown of her port low-pressure turbine just as she was leaving Queenstown last Sunday at 8 A.M., making the passage in five days, twenty hours, and fifty minutes, at an average speed of 21.48 knots.

RED BANK, N.J., April 3. -- The bomb which exploded in the hands of Andrew Shkulsky, a Pole, last night as he was leaving a union meeting in Columbus Hall was one of several prepared for use in case of a strike which was threatened a month ago, according to a statement made to-day by a strike agitator to Chief of Police Arthur Wymbs. 
--------
1104-> SEPTEMBER IS THE MONTH FOR RAILBIRD SHOOTING; And the Sportsman Can Find Plenty of These Appetizing Little Game Birds Within an Hour of the City.
WITH the coming of September every man in town who is fond of outdoor sports yearns for a little shooting. But by that time the average man has had his vacation, he cannot hope for more than a day off now and then in the Autumn, and he finally decides that the opportunities for shooting on day trips are too few to be considered, so he dismisses the subject. 
--------
1105-> BROADWAY JONES' IS BIG HIT OF LAUGHTER; And This Play Without Music Mark Progress for Cohan Both as Author and Actor.
For that great general public -- and it is great -- which acclaims George M. Cohan and the mother of George M. Cohan and the father of George M. Cohan, the best feature of his new play, "Broadway Jones," will be found in the fact that it keeps them laughing all the time, laughing for the most part frankly, unreservedly, and hilariously. 
--------
1106-> THE FUTURE OF THE NOVEL; W.B. Maxwell Claims That the Novel Has a Future -- How He Came to Write "In Cotton Wool"
A FEW days ago the Authors' Club did me the honor of inviting me to dinner and to hold forth after dinner upon "The Future of the Novel." We in England are fond of this sort of friendly debate or discussion. We say it is like the old-fashioned balloon; it is full of gas; it remains in the clouds most of the time; and it takes one nowhere in particular. 
--------
1107-> DEFENDS MODERN OPERA.; Mme. Gadski Claims Old Operas Are Only Disciplinary Now.
I notice that Mme. Sembrich has stated that the art of singing is on the decline, but I believe that in making this statement she is speaking from her own point of view as a coloratura soprano, just as Mr. Frank Damrosch in his recent letter to THE TIMES spoke from his point of view as a teacher. 
--------
1108-> LACK OF MONEY IS CIVIL SERVICE PERIL; James Creelman Makes Statement of Present Dangers to Work of Commission.
Unless more money is provided to pay Inspectors to investigate the characters of applicants, for city positions, there is serious danger that the merit system may be broken down and the civil service law trampled under foot, with the consequent rise of the old spoils system, according to James Creelman, President of the Civil Service Commission.

--------
1112-> THE COMPLETE HOWELLS; The Disgrace to American Letters Through the Lack of a Uniform Edition of Howells Is Finally Eradicated
IT is an indisputable fact that no author can take with him his complete works down to posterity; the skirmishes of time are certain to capture his baggage-wagons, and he is lucky if he can save his saddle-bags. Nevertheless it has long been a matter of annoying surprise that the writings of Mr. Howells should not have been collected into a uniform edition worthy of his position as the foremost figure in American literature.

PHILADELPHIA, Penn., Nov. 13. -- Peter A.B. Widener, philanthropist and patron of art, is 78 years old to-day.

Widener, in the Titanic disaster last April.

--------
1116-> WANT TO COMPLETE STATE HIGHWAYS; Motorists Will Have Chance to Vote on Bill to Appropriate $50,000,000 for Roads.
Motorists, as the constant users of highways, have become ardent and energetic good roads enthusiasts. In every community bettered highway conditions are largely due to motorists, and particularly to the organized motorists. Without the active co-operation of each member of the New York State Automobile Association, the $50,000,000 good roads referendum is not likely to be adopted at the next general election.

1126-> PROCLAIM SECOND COMING.; Faction in Zion City Says It Is Imminent -- Voliva Skeptical.
CHICAGO, Dec. 1 -- Reporters were dispatched post haste to Zion City to-night to investigate rumors of the prevalence of the belief among the Dowieites that the prophecy of the second coming was on the eve of fulfillment.

--------
1297-> WHAT HONORS FOR COL. GOETHALS?
We are willing to believe the assertion of the Hon. JAMES R. MANN of Illinois that "the building of the Pan''ama Canal constitutes the greatest "engineering feat in the history of "the world."

--------
1298-> THE PARK PLAZA.

--------
1303-> BLUNTSCHLI NOT IN THIS WAR.
Who remembered that the scene of BERNARD SHAW'S "Arms and the Man" is laid in the Balkan country, and that the hero, Bluntschli, though a mercenary, is a Balkan warrior? We can remember the plots and scenes of SHAKESPEARE'S Play, but not of SHAW'S. 
--------
1304-> NEWSMEN ENTER PROTEST.; Assail Service Board in Resolutions for Breaking Faith with Them.
The Newsdealers' and Stationers' Association meeting in the Lenox Casino at ll6th Street and Lenox Avenue last night, to protest against the resolution in the Board of Aldermen and the resolution passed by the Board of Estimate relative to newsstand privileges, developed into a meeting of protest against the Public Service Commission.

--------
1308-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.
The certainty that there is to be a "Money Trust" investigation has caused much less uneasiness than the rumors of such action when they first made their appearance. Not infrequently Wall Street appears to act first and think afterward. Now that it is becoming accustomed to the idea of a Congressional investigation there is a general disposition to look upon the project as foolish and wasteful, but not in any way inimical to business. 
--------
1309-> SPEEDING CARS IN THE STREETS.
If Mr. HAROLD OSGOOD BINNEY, whose racing car was twice within a day pursued for speeding in this city's chief thoroughfares, could fined but not imprisoned for violating the Callan law and the city ordinances by his performances, then those legal instruments need amending.

--------
1318-> DRUNKEN" OYSTERS.
" Drinks," so called by the oystermen because the white and bloated bivalves are artificially fattened in the running fresh water of estuaries, have properly come under the scrutiny of the Health Department. Too many of the oysters that are "drunk" are intoxicated in the sense of that word which means poisoned.

--------
1320-> A MISTAKEN FRENCH CRITIC.
When the Paris Journal accuses the United States of provoking the rebellion in Nicaragua for purposes of its own it overstates the case. The United States has helped to suppress this particular rebellion, which was simply an armed uprising against the interests of the Nicaraguan people, and the Journal cannot understand what United States troops are doing there.

So far as is known publicly there were no American celebrations on Thursday of the ninety-eighth anniversary of the Treaty of Ghent.

--------
1326-> FINANCIAL MARKETS; Prices React on Renewed Liquidation -- Money Rates Show Further Ease.
Most of the ground which was gained by the stock market on Thursday was lost yesterday.

--------
1327-> GREECE REFUSES ARMISTICE PLANS; Statement by Minister in Paris -- Will Not Consent to Feeding Besieged Turks.

The people of the country would be profoundly shocked by President TAFT'S Boston speech if they did not already know the character of THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

--------
1330-> MATHEWSON AND BEDIENT.
Mr. "CHRISTY" MATHEWSON has cause to reflect, with SHAKESPEARE'S Ulysses, that "the present eye praises the present object." He pitched well in Saturday's game, but the bats of the Bostons were quick enough to hit him. His average in the league games this season was good, if not equal to his best.

--------
1337-> To Fight for Colonel In Maryland.
BALTIMORE, Md., July 4. -- While not a few Independent Republicans of Maryland, formerly for Roosevelt, have signified their intention or supporting Wilson, the Roosevelt and Taft leaders are in for the most bitter factional fight that the party has ever seen.

--------
1338-> BERT KEYES DEFEATED.; Eddie Smith More Than a Master for His Opponent at Sharkey.

I suggest a "League of Universal Liberty," with branches in all countries, which should enroll in its membership writers, educators, clergymen, statesmen, scientists, philanthropists, and others who are factors in the advance of progress and culture.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. -- The Supreme Court to-day reaffirmed its decision that the Kansas corporation law, closing Kansas State courts to foreign corporations without a certificate to do business in the State, was unconstitutional.
