213-> THE SCREEN; The Desert Humbug.
The picturization of Mrs. E. M. Hull's novel, "The Sheik," started a craze among film prodcers for Sahara photoplays in hich the beguiling beauty of Anglo-Saxon maidens wrought havoc with the hearts of handsome Arabian chieftains, who decided that after all they only wanted one wife. The latest of such stories is Rex Ingram's production, "The Arab," adapted from Edgar Selwyn's play, which is the principal feature at the Capitol this week. It has the distinction of having been filmed in Northern Africa, with the result that there are many absorbingly interesting scenes of great pictorial value. One sees a mosque and is inspired by the fact that it is a real mosque and not a studio reproduction. There are caravans of Bedouins, actually true followers of the Prophet—except for the hero, who in this instance is impersonated by Ramon Novarro. Chapters in this picture recall the poetic nature of the Mohammedan, who, even when he sells oranges in the streets of Biskra, does not shout in vulgar fashion the nature of his wares, but cries aloud to Allah to empty his baskets of the burden of fruit.Judging from the decline in desert productions we have seen, Mrs. Hull and Robert Hichens appear to have sapped the Sahara of its fascination and romance. Although "The Arab" has its moments, it is based upon a decidedly sketchy narrative and Mr. Ingram seems occasionally to have grown impatient with the frail plot, as he falls to give plausible reason for some of the action. According to the laws of producers and distributers the ending of this narrative is not satisfactory, although its artistic worth is undeniable."The Arab" is an entertainment which begets thought. There are fanatics sharpening their sticks to use as weapons on the "infidels". There are impressive stretches showing Arabs in white burnous seated on the hot sands in the scanty shade of a few palm trees. The sight of the great arched wall of striking length is compelling, as are also the scenes of low white building's, the odd, narrow streets and the interiors where one sees the Mohammedans sipping their Turkish coffee from tiny cups as they play chess, or pulling on their narghiles.The hero of this story is at first a humbug, the outcast son of a white-bearded sheik. He is known by all his names, but intimately as Jamil. He officiates as a dragoman or porter, who several times describes himself as "the best dragoman in the world." Unlike the usual sheik in these stories, he is indigenous to the desert, and therefore to a white girl his ways, like Bret Harte's "Heathen Chinee," are peculiar. His chief interest in having the Bible read to him by pretty Mary Hilbert (Alice Terry) is listening to the sweet voice and watching the fair face before him. Jamil, who is proud of his smattering of English, which he can't read, often shows the testimonial given to him by a witty American—he thinks the foreigners smile because of the precious praise in the document, which really reads: "Jamil is the finest little liar in this country of liars, and as a dragoman he is a bunco artist."The tale is spun around the hatred of the Mohammedans for the "infidels," and consequently one is surprised at the temerity of the missionary. Dr. Hilbert, in setting up his headquarters in a house contiguous to a mosque. The Governor of the district is a hypocritical, pernicious specimen, whose aim is to stir up the fanatics against the few white people and those who have been won over to Christianity. The high light of the production is where "the best dragoman in the world" goes to his father and borrows an army to save the foreigners from being massacred. At the psychological moment, and, of course, not a second too soon, the white-clad hordes of Jamil's father pounce down upon El Kirouan, under the command of the hitherto lazy Jamil, and all is saved.Miss Terry is sympathetic as the missionary's daughter, and Gerald Robertshaw is capable as the father. Mr. Novarro characterizes the part of the lying-yet-loving Jamil conscientiously and efficiently. Paul Vermoyal delivers an excellent performance as Iphraim, a sort of Mohammedan Uriah Heap, and Justa Uribe makes an effective Myrza, whose ears are so often busy in a good cause. The Desert Humbug. THE ARAB, with Ramon Novarro, Alice Terry, Gerald Robertshaw, Maxudian, Count de Limur, Adelqui Millar, Paul Vermoyal, Justa Uribe, Gluseppe de Campo, Paul Francesci and Alexandresco, adapted from the play by Edgar Selwyn, directed by Rex Ingram; special prologue; Doris Niles in "Danse Arabe;" "Bedouin Love Song," by Douglas Stanbury. At the Capitol.Talented players have been wasted in "For Sale," the screen perpetration which is enjoying the good fortune of being presented at the Mark Strand this week. It is presumed that the author penned the narative to fit the title. The depth of the story, its drama and the logic of the situations reminded us of a discarded effort of Daisy Ashford before she wrote "The Young Visitors."The heroine dwells in a mansion, the rooms of which are immense and ornate, and her father's office strikes one as being designed for a boiler maker who became a financial magnate and wanted room to move around. The desk in this Louvre-like room is of proportions which call attention to its size and design. In fact Harrison Bates (Tully Marshall) looks like a Lilliputian lost in the hall of a Brobdingnagian castle. Incidentally he, on the night of a glamorous party for his daughter, Eleanor (Clair Windsor), comes home with the fateful news that he has lost everything. He finds the pistol in its accustomed place—the drawer of the writing desk. His idea of shooting himself is halted by the scheme of having his daughter wed a wealthy reprobate, who in one scene is shown striking a woman in the face with his fist. He is killed one hour after the engagement is announced. Mrs. Bates decides something must be done to save her husband from disgrace; so although Eleanor is in love with Allan Penfield (Robert Ellis), whose finances are not as attractive as his face and character, she is persuaded to accept the attentions of Joseph Hudley (Adolphe Menjou), described as a social climber, who puts up with more snubbing than one is accustomed to see in the average ball room. But Mr. Bates had embezzled some of Hudley's money, and therefore he became persona grata with everybody except the Twombly-Smiths.Penfield goes off to Paris to drink himself to death, which he nearly succeeded in doing, as he is shown in a frightful condition in a café known on the screen as "The Agile Rabbit." Here one has a glimpse of a Hollywood conception of Paris with apaches in new clothes.In the end there's nothing to worry about, as one suspects from the introduction.This is one of those productions which provoke admiration for the temerity of the scenic constructors and the photographer's good word. The players, including Miss Windsor, Mr. Menjou, Tully Marshall and Robert Ellis, are as good as one would expect them to be in such a vehicle. The story is said to have been written by Earl Hudson and the production was directed by George Archainbaud. FOR SALE, with Claire Windsor, Adolphe Menjou, Robert Ellis, Mary Carr, Tully Marshall, John Patrick, Vera Reynolds, Jules Power, Lou Payne, Phillips Smalley, Christine Mayo, Jean Vac???hon, George Irving, Frank Elliott, Finch Smiles and Marga La Rub???ia, written by Earl Hudson, directed by George Archainbaud; overture, "Naughty Marietta" selections: "The Arbor of Love."

437-> THE SCREEN; A Rejuvenation Story.
In "Vanity's Price," the celluloid feature at the Cameo this week, Vanna du Maurier, an actress, not only is restored to her pristine loveliness through the Steinach operation, but she also suffers a youthful change in her whole nature. Incidents that occurred just before she went to Vienna to be rejuvenated have passed from her mind, and she becomes a dazzling creature who basks in the sunshine of flattery. To charm the opposite sex is paramount in her thoughts, and she even finds the man who she once detested quite fascinating.While her grown-up son Teddy is gratified with his mother's appearance, he cannot understand her desperate flirtation with Henri de Greve (Stuart Hoimes). It is only when Vanna learns that this scoundrel has been paying attention to her son's sweetheart that she regains her proper mentality. De Greve is punished as badly as any screen villain who is not killed could be, for in one sequence he is horsewhipped, and in the next he receives a sound thrashing from Richard Dowling, a playwright, who aspires to make Vanna his wife.The costumes and stage settings of this production are quite promising, but the direction appears to be inexperienced, certainly so far as this type of narrative is concerned. R. William Neill, the director, has some of his characters often standing in awkward and stiff poses???.Vanna, who has been most successful in her stage career, owns a house which reminds one of St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome, wherein, it is said, armies can be hidden. She has footmen, butlers, special Russian dancers and Ethiopian underlings Anna Q. Nilsson impersonates Vanna, and her performance is really efficient. She wears startling gowns with amazing headdresses.Stuart Holmes, as de Greve, amuses himself in the first chapter by admiring Vanna and eating chocolates by the pound. He also has a magnificent dwelling. His hobby at home is music. One sees him dallying with a guitar, and when he tires of that instrument he goes over to a sideboard and picks up a clarinet. He wants to buy a theatre for Vanna, who, one would think after seeing her home, could well afford to build a theatre for herself.The operating room in Vienna is shown, with visiting surgeons studying the operation on Vanna through field glasses. One surgeon shakes his head, knowing that the woman's vanity is bound to suffer by the effect the Steinach treatment will have on her mentality.The thrashing de Greve receives from Dowling (Wyndham Standing) is at the outset a deliberate affair. First Dowling takes off his coat and places it on a chair. Then he frees himself of his waistcoat, and so is ready to take de Greve's head in one hand and punch it with the other.While this is not a film that is going to set the world on fire, it is an entertainment which is not badly done. The story was written by the imaginative Paul Bern, and it would have been a superior effort if he had directed it. A Rejuvenation Story.VANITY'S PRICE, with Anna Q. Nilsson, Stuart Holmes, Wyndham Standing, Arthur Rankin, Lucille Ricksen, Robert Bolder, Cissy Fitzgerald. Dot Farley and Charles Newton: written by Paul Bern, directed by R. William Neill; overture, "Csarda Scene": "Noah's Ark," an "Aesop Fable": Kol Nidre," 'cello solo by Edward Turk. At the Cameo.

875-> THE SCREEN; Plotting Made Easy.
Hope Hampton's first picture in more than a year is a mildly entertaining melodrama, equipped with adequate settings, brilliant costumes and helped along by a competent cast. This feature is called "The Price of a Party," and is the new offering at the Cameo. In the beginning Charles Giblyn, the director, appears to have a penchant for eliminating suspense, and therefore one is interested without being unduly excited.For the first few hundred feet one sees little more than men and women chattering, and according to the subtitles they are plotting to lay a trap for Robert Casson due from South America about that time. The director, with wonderful facility, jumps from a scene of a thronged dancing floor to a glimpse of a steamship entering New York Bay. Of course Casson, ignorant of all that is going to happen in the next five reels, plunges into the net set for him by Kenneth Bellwood, who would rather make money by villainy than by work. He arranges that Casson shall see Grace Barrow (Miss Hampton), and she, after her palm has been crossed with gold, consents to do her best to detain Casson in New York, so that he will not return to Brazil in time to attend to certain concessions. Miss Barrow in "borrowed plumage and a borrowed nest" appears to be unusually successful in making Casson forget all about Brazil. Actually she is not as bad as one might think, for she has an old mother who must undergo an operation, and therefore part of the money advanced to her by Bellwood is used for this charitable purpose.Casson is painted as a hero, until he meets Grace. One woman tries to flirt with him in a cabaret, and observing that there is no reciprocal wink, she promptly makes grimaces at him.Dagmar Godowsky as Evelyn Dolores helps the villain to the best of her ability. You see her opening and narrowing her eyes, as she makes sure that her hair is plastered flat on her head. Grace's sister, Alice, (Mary Astor) comes to New York in a rather fashionable suit. She is not unattractive to Bellwood, which stirs the plot up a bit.There is a certain amount of mystery when a murder takes place, but the audience is not permitted to worry long concerning the outcome of the investigation.This is a film which has just a little too much of the bright lights and not enough real atmosphere. The producers, however, have kept within certain bounds in telling the story. Miss Hampton is cheerful and attractive in her gay costumes. Arthur Edmund Carew, who figured as Svengali in the film version of "Trilby," is a little too much of the heavy and occasionally not sufficiently natural and spontaneous in his actions and expressions. Mr. Ford is rather a gloomy hero in spite of his experience before the camera. Plotting Made Easy. THE PRICE OF A PARTY, with Hope Hampton, Harrison Ford, Arthur Edmund Carew, Mary Astor, Dagmar Godowsky, Fred Hadley, Florence Richardson, Edna Richmond, Donald Lashey, Daniel Pennell, Moy Bennett and others, adapted from a story by William MacHarg, directed by Charles Giblyn. At the Cameo.Cheek to cheek poses are popular with L. Gasnier in his current film, "The Breath of Scandal," which title quite suits this effort. Mr. Gasnier obviously hopes to stir the emotions of his audience with close-ups of women's heads moving slowly while tears drop from the right eyes. Everybody is well dressed in this production, no matter what happens, or where they go. They are not even tactful in their attire. There is Sybil Russell (Betty Blythe) on the threshold of whose apartment Charles Hale (Lou Tel'egen) has been wounded. Mrs. Russell does not change her gown, but appears to enjoy her inappropriate appearance.The scenario writer decided that Hale ought to live. It would have been better if he hadn't, as Mr. Tellegen would have been spared much useless energy. While he is suffering from "an unidentified bandit's bullet," the doctor, Mrs. Russell and two other characters stand like sentries in the room.Patsy Ruth Miller impersonates Marjorie Hale. She has given far better performances. If any honors are to be accorded in this film, they ought to go to Myrtle Stedman, who is cast as Mrs. Hale. She makes up for many moments of badly acted sorrow by the other players.When a prominent man is discovered by an irate husband on the threshold of the latter's apartment, acting like Lou Tellegen, it is not to be wondered at that he pulled the trigger of a pistol.The Hales appear to be able to conceal their troubles, although it would seem that Mr. Hale ought to have been punished far more than he is. He is not only wicked, but stupid.We presume that Mr. Gasnier must have no end of fun making these contraptions, as they are sapped of interest by the time they reach the screen.Francis Macmillen Plays.The violin recital of Francis Macmillen at Carnegie Hall last evening attracted a good sized audience, which grew more and more appreciative as the evening wore on and discovered the violinist's virtuosity. A large part of the program consisted of compositions by French writers, and Mr. Macmillen had chosen to begin with Faure's Sonata in A major as a tribute to the memory of the dead composer.Mr. Macmillen, with Richard Hageman at the piano, played the four movements in an ascending scale of effectiveness; the two being recalled twice at the conclusion: but it was in Frederic d'Erlanger's Concerto that Mr. Macmillen came into real touch with the imagination of his audience. There was something very much alive in the work and as played by the violinist it went straight home. There was enthusiastic applause after each movement.The remainder of the program included a Sinding, a César Thomson and Saint-Saëns's "Rondo Capriccioso."Richard Keys Biggs in Organ RecitalRichard Keys Biggs, organist of the Church of the Queen of All Saints, Brooklyn, and one of those who had played at the dedication of the Speyer memorial organ, reappeared in a recital on that instrument at the Town Hall last night. He gave excerpts from organ sonatas of Borowski and Rogers, among Americans, as well as Torjussen's "To the Rising Sun" and the E minor prelude and fugue of Bacn. French masters dominated his program, which ranged from a "Carillon," by Vierne to three old French "Noëls."SCREEN NOTES."Yorktown," one of the filmed "Chronicles of America" series produced by the Yale University Press, was a feature last night at the Plaza Hotel when the Sons of the Revolution celebrated the 141st anniversary of the evacuation of New York by the British. The picture, though not dealing directly with that particular historical incident, covers the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, and was considered appropriate for the occasion."Janice Meredith," with Marion Davies, is to be the pictorial feature next week at the Capitol.Gloria Swanson in "Wages of Virtue" is to be moved next week to the Rialto.At the Picadilly the film feature next week will be "Sundown."David W. Griffith's "Isn't Life Wonderful?" is to be presented next week at the Rivoli.MUSIC NOTES.Chaliapin sings this afternoon at the first Ritz-Carlton musicale, assisted by Anna Fitziu and Paul Bernard. Part of the proceeds go to the Child Welfare work under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Oliver Harriman.Two American artists, Ralph Errolle, tenor of the Metropolitan, and Lowell Sherman, will appear with Lucrezia Bori today at the second of Andres de Segurola's musical mornings at the Plaza Hotel.Twelve young American singers, to be presented in public recitals by the Beethoven Society, Inc., will be chosen at a series of ??? auditions starting this noon at the Hotel Astor. Tears and Slow Music.THE BREATH OF SCANDAL, with Betty Blythe, Lou Tellegen, Patsy Ruth Miller, Forrest Stanley, Jack Mulhall, Phyllis Haver, Myrtle Stedman, Frank Leigh and Charles Clary, by Edwin Balmer, directed by L.

As an entertainment of the highly imaginative and improbable variety which in serious moments is apt to stir up mirth, "Empty Hands," the new picture at the Rivoli, is an effort which will undoubtedly please the majority of persons who view it. The story, which was adapted from Arthur Stringer's novel, is based upon the experiences of a mining engineer and a headstrong girl who are accidentally isolated in an inaccessible section of Canada, which is an entrancing spot. As the film is unfurled one is bound to feel incredulous regarding the inability of the two to get back to civilization.While in the lonely spot Grimshaw (Jack Holt) outdoes Robinson Crusoe with discoveries. He makes wooden forks, leather coats, wedding rings and catches rabbits by sympathetic appeal. One almost expects the little animals to report to the Grimshaw shack for breakfast and dinner. Fishing is done without difficulty or hooks, and judging by the clothes worn by Claire Endicott (Norma Shearer) Grimshaw is pretty quick at catching wild animals.The sequestered situation can be traced to one of those after-dinner swimming pools. Claire had a party at her home, and at one point, when the villain, who has a wife, is becoming bored, the pretty girl says: "Never mind, Milt, in an hourr we will be in the pool." Somebody is drowned that night after many synthetic concoctions.Then Claire finds herself one day with a canoe on a lake. Grimshaw happens to be there, too. He warns Claire about the rapids, but the girl, ever a stubborn minx, paddles off and is soon swept down to the surging depths. Soon, according to a subtitle, she is "battling for life through the foaming stretches of maddened water." Grimshaw goes to the rescue, and eventually the two climb ashore without their canoes. Claire's only possession is a torn bathing suit. Grimshaw, after lending the girl his coat, goes around in an undershirt and trousers. Fortunately he has a knife, with which he accomplishes wonders. It serves for cutting his hair, shaving his beard, and also for making wooden forks and other trifles necessary to comfort and happiness in this Canadian wilderness.From the discoveries they make one would imagine that Grimshaw and Claire were in the lonely region for several years—except that they don't age. But when other scenes are shown it is revealed that the villain's wife has just divorced him, naming Claire as a corespondent: so they can't have been away so long after all!Miss Shearer's eyes are really beautiful and, as her hair is not curied according to movie fashion, she is quite pleasing in this film. She seems to be a good swimmer when in the water, and is evidently conscious that her ankles are by no means ungainly. Her eyebrows deserve at least two words of praise.The exterior scenes are quite wonderful, especially the stretch showing the curling rapids flanked by tremendously high rocks. Victor Fleming, the director has done very well in this production, but in a number of sequences he has made it unnecessarily impossible. One sees an airplane about a mile in the air, and then Grimshaw is depicted trying to signal to the pilot by waving his coat. Somebody looking at this scene said that it would have been all right if he had worn his red flannel mining shirt.Mr. Holt is capable in his part, but his eyebrows would never be seen in mining engineer circles.This is a picture which is amusing both when it should be and when it shouldn't, but nobody will complain about being bored when sitting through it. Robinson Crusoe Outdone.EMPTY HANDS, with Jack Holt, Norma Shearer, Charles Clary, Hazel Keener, Gertrude Olmsted, Ramsay Wallace, Ward Crane, Charles Stevens, Hank Mann and Charles Green, adapted from the novel by Arthur Stringer, directed by Victor Fleming; Henry Scott, bass-baritone of the Metropolitan Opera Company. "The Drinking Song," from "Martha." Rialto orchestra, guests at this theatre, plays the overture, "The Second Hungarian Rhapsody," Franz Liszt. At the Rivoli.Clever nonsense is what one might call "Fools in the Dark," the new contribution to the pictures which is being presented this week at the Cameo. The producers call it a melodramtic farce, but whatever one decides to term this production it is thoroughly entertaining, with really good subtitles and spirited acting. It would be very difficult for a cynic to sit in the Cameo this week without cracking a smile once or twice, and the ordinary individual after a good luncheon or dinner will find that he can very nearly laugh through the whole business."Fools in the Dark" is like a serial packed into seven reels which isn't to be taken seriously. There is the literary light of the Schwartz family who aspires to the terrific heights of writing moving picture scenarios, and the business-loving father whose aim in life is to push his garbage can business in every corner of the universe. There is, of course, a comely maiden, Ruth Rand, who is impersonated by Patsy Ruth Miller: a scheming inventor of a death ray and his deceitful cohort. But the cast would not be complete without Diploma, a burnt cork negro. This diversity of characters ought to appeal to almost anybody.Diploma's greatest ambition in life is the solution of a three-ring puzzle and, through following the amiable Percy Schwartz, the aforesaid man of letters, the black-face Diploma dives into dangerous places. These situations give the title writer a chance and he makes the most of it. Diploma is frightened and the caption, as he stands gazing into the glistening orbs of a stuffed tiger, has him saying: "Feet, don't fail me now !" His most terrified period is where he inadvertently steps into a pool of glue, his substantial pedal extremities becoming stuck, without his being aware of it, to some calico attached to Dr. Rand's pet skeleton. Hence one sees the skeleton following Diploma's every step. This goes on for quite a stretch, when through clever manipulation the cold bone fingers reach out and touch Diploma on the shoulder. As the negro is not accustomed to medical research or ethnological studies he is quiveringly surprised at the lightness of the tap and the coldness and hardness of the fingers. He dare not look around, so feels behind him with trepidation, getting his fingers on about the location of the skeleton's fourth rib. Then slowly he turns his head, and the second his eyes light on the skull he flees for dear life.Even this running around has its laughs, as it looks as if the form of bones is after him, keeping pace with his every step, eager to get Diploma's dusky life.Dr. Rand, the inventor, is not unlike Svengali in appearance and in actions. He is naturally anxious to ascertain whether his death ray discovery is effective on humans, and so he is seen smiling when his assistant reports to him that the patient has just died. Kotah, the helper (Bert Grasby), is a sort of Hindu whose face would be a fortune in the average poker game. He only moves his eyes to express anything in this picture.Matt Moore is splendid in this film. He has done good work in a number of pictures, but his performance in "Fools in the Dark" is enjoyable every minute he is on the screen, as he is one of those quiet comedians with an occasional awestruck expression. He is the Ernest Truex of the shadow world. Tom Wilson is splendid as Diploma.The story, such as it is, brings to mind D. W. Griffith's "One Exciting Night." Those who feel they need the exercise of laughter will find this the very thing to cause chuckles, grins, smiles, smirks and full explosions from the lungs.Other Films."Monsieur Beaucaire," with Rodolph Valentino, is at the Mark Strand; "The Covered Wagon" is at the Rialto; "Secrets," with Norma Talmadge, is at the Capitol; "The Ten Commandments" is at the George M.

1255-> THE SCREEN; Strained Adventures.
The film version of Robert W. Service's "The Roughneck," now on view at the Central Theatre, is a boy's idea of adventure with plenty of scenes of George O'Brien's biceps and ankles. After observing all that Mr. O'Brien experiences as Jerry Delaney, one concludes that he needs his deep chest and brawny arms. Mr. O'Brien goes to no particular pains to conceal that he has the strength of an ox and the ankles of a Mercury. He has an artistic waist line, a physiognomy suited to adventurous rôles in melodramatic pictures and dark hair with the suggestion of a curl.Delaney is a judicious modern knight. In one sequence the pretty heroine. Felicity Arden (Billie Dove), is forced by a storm to take refuge in Mad Marrat's dwelling on the South Sea Isle. Jerry's mother is well aware of Marrat's designing brutality, and she therefore urges her son to hasten over to the other section of the island and save the girl, with whom he is in love. He is about to start, when he thinks it over, saying to his mother: "I can't go. I have got one man's death to answer for."Jerry began to have adventures as a small boy, and he has them thrust upon him until the closing scene of this picture. No sooner has he escaped from drowning that he is asked to engage in a fist fight, which is delayed for monetary reasons until that evening.The fight appears to be going against the hero—as these conflicts usually do on the screen—when suddenly Jerry's opponent blurts out an insult about Jerry's mother, and he flares up and punches with such vim and rapidity that when they look at the other man he is thought to be dead.One of Jerry's passing adventures takes place when he is aboard a vessel bound from San Francisco for Tahiti. Felicity is on the steamship, and, as Jerry has been a stowaway, the girl urges him to swim ashore. It is a full five miles, which would not have been such a terrible task for this young gentleman, but Felicity had not calculated upon sharks. As soon as they are mentioned in a subtitle, one of these man-eaters appears, its dorsal fin being seen hurrying in Jerry's direction, acting more like a motor launch than one's conception of a shark. Here one has to be very young and quite credulous, for a native girl springs from her craft and goes to Jerry's rescue, engaging the fish in battle under water. One sees Jerry having his tussle under the surface, and then the lithe form of the girl putting a knife through the shark's belly.This picture is made up of this type of thrills, which are hardly convincing to an adult. The most capable actor in the cast is Harry T. Morey, who has the rôle of Marrat, the villain. He is well worth seeing. Miss Dove is attractice as Felicity and Cleo Madison is competent in the maternal rôle. Mr. O'Brien apepars to have a weakness for displaying his figure, but otherwise his performance is good.This is an extravagant story which is only likely to apepal to the youthful mind. Strained Adventures. THE ROUGHNECK, with George O'Brien, Billie Dove Harry T. Morey, Cleo Madison, Charles A. Sellon, Anne Cornwall, Harvey Clark, Maryon Aye, Edna Eichnor and Buddy Smith. Adapted from Robert W. Service's poem. Directed by John Conway. "The Burglar," a comedy. At the Central Theatre.David Warfield, the American actor, returned yesterday from Europe on the Leviathan of the U. S. Lines and said that he had purchased abroad the rights of a scenario which he may soon use as a movie medium. He was asked if he expected to play the leading rôle in "The Music Master" for the screen and re- plied, "Maybe so. It would make a good film." Asked about the rumors of his retirement in the near future. Mr. Warfield said: "I have no immediate plans. For thirty-four years I have been on the stage, week in and week out, and naturally I am a little tired, but there is nothing in the report that I am to retire, nothing whatever."Titta Ruffo, baritone of the Metropolitan Opera Company, also arrived on the liner for the season in New York and said that he would make a concert tour through the United States in the Spring. Yvonne Darle, a singer, also arrived.Tatiana Zaroubina, a Russian comedienne from Leningrad, arrived via Hamburg on the Royal Mail liner Orduna to appear here under the management of Morris Gest.Charges that members of the Boulevard Police of Weehawken. Union Hill and adjacent places are working hand in hand with bootleggers engaged in extensive traffic at Weehawken will be considered at a special meeting of the Weehawken Home Owners' Association Friday evening. The charges are contained in an affidavit prepared by John Dorsey of Willow Avenue and Nineteenth Street, Weehawken. Dorsey, a confessed former member of a bootlegging gang, gave the affidavit to a Jersey City lawyer. A copy of the affidavit is in the possession of the Weehawken Home owners' Association.The Jersey City lawyer, it is understood, will shortly present the affidavit to State and Federal authorities with a request for investigation. The affidavit charges that for the last six months half of the Weehawken night police force have been taken off post between midnight and dawn about three times a week and enlisted as aids, longshoremen and guards for bootleggers operating from the foot of Baldwin Avenue. It was at this point that the body of Frank D'Agostino, alleged hijacker, was found murdered last Summer. It is also charged in the affidavit that these policemen have received $10 a night for this service to the bootleggers.Dorsey said that he had been a witness to these bootleg activities and he named three high police officers and five policemen in connection with his charges. Dorsey gave the details of one episode."One night not long ago I went down to Baldwin Avenue in an automobile," he said. "A uniformed police officer tried to stop me. I told him I intended to go down to the Baldwin Avenue river front unless he arrested me. He said he would not arrest me, and begged and pleaded that I go back. I refused to do so, and he said to me: 'Don't you see how it will look for me down there if you pass this point?'"In an interview yesterday Dorsey charged that the Union Hill police recently arrested him to find out whether he had the affidavit containing the charges on his person. Following his arrest on a charge of suspicion by Detective Lieutenant Charles Dillman of the Union Hill police. Dorsey said, he was held without being permitted to communicate with any one for fourteen hours, when he was freed by Recorder Louis Hauenstein without being questioned.

1289-> THE SCREEN
The film version of Sacha Guitry's play "Deburau," masquerading under the title of "The Lover of Camille," is holding forth at the Piccadilly this week. It is only a vague and artless reflection or the superb Belasco presentation of this charming, slow-moving, sad romance. Monte Blue enacts the rôle of Jean Gaspard Deburau, the celebrated Pierrot of the early nineteenth century, whose silent performance took all Paris by storm, attracting the elite and the guttersnipe, the rich and the power to the portals of the Théâtre des Funambules.One is bound to compare Mr. Blue's performance with Lionel Atwill's artistic achievement on the stage, and the conclusion is that, able a comedian as Mr. Blue is, this rôle is not suited to his type. Mr. Atwill's features are singularly delicate and clean-cut, while Mr. Blue's are heavier. He appears to smile in some of his most earnest love scenes. Of course one might say that a clown with a painted face may seem to grin when his grief is greatest. It is also apparent, paradoxical as it may be, that this story of a pantomimist's unrequited love needs, above all, the various vocal qualities and color to give it the full strength of its melancholy beauty. This narrative is not adaptable to the screen, that is to make it comparable to the play.As Dr. Braun in Ernst Lubitsch's "The Marriage Circle," Mr. Blue gave a splendid performance, his facial expression being just what that character called for. But as Deburau he is pathetic without being effective. In those scenes where he is not dressed as a Pierrot, his make-up appears to be overdone.Marie Prevost, the minx of "The Marriage Circle," impersonates Marie Duplessis. Miss Prevost is not a beguiling beauty, her prettiness being more of the roguish type, slightly toned down for this rôle. Despite the totally different mental picture we had of this character before viewing this film, we found Miss Prevost quite pleasing and sympathetic.There are a few sequences in this production which are unnecessarily exaggerated. In the beginning one sees the crowd forging its way along the sidewalks to see Deburau, and to make it plain that the people come from widely different spheres of life, Harry Beaumont, the director, depicts a man and a woman coming from the Paris sewers for their night in the open. They emerge from their underground habitat through the manhole in front of the Theatre des Funambules!One wonders why Parisians made such a fuss about this Pierrot, as there is nothing Mr. Blue does in the stage scene that would be likely to cause any furor. Yet the audience goes wild over his pantomimic efforts, as it might have done following listening to Paganini play one of his ecstatic variations. Perhaps in Deburau's day such a Pierrot's performance was a joy to behold, their entertainment fare being so meagre compared with Broadway in 1924.The comedy in this picture is a little crude for such a delicate romance. It would have been wiser to adhere to the play and forego any searching for laughter. Willard Louis, who gave an outstanding performance in "Beau Brummel," is only moderately interesting as Robillard. As years roll on to the tune of seven, one sees the heartbroken Pierrot, bent and gray, while Robillard cavorts around as young as ever.The scene in the theatre, where Deburau first sees the captivating and vacillating Marie is effective. You see the expensively dressed woman waiting until the theatre is empty to speak to the renowned Pierrot. Miss Prevost controls her usual buoyancy and her movements are slow and seductive.Deburau's son at the age of 10 looks as if he were ??? and as portrayed by Pierre Gendron at the age of 17, he looks 27. Mr. Gendron is hardly what Terrence Moore, who plays the child, might expect.This picture will probably please many of those who have not seen the play, but it will hardly appeal to those who witnessed the delicate, exquisite performance given by Lionel Atwill. "Deburau." THE LOVER OF CAMILLE, with Monte Blue. Marie Prevost, Willard Louis, Terrence Moore, Pierre Gendron, Rose Dion, Rosa Rosanova, Trilby Clark, Brandon Hurst and Rosita Marstini, adapted from Sacha Guitry's play, "Deburau," directed by Harry Beaumont, musical score by Mischa Guterson;??? Joseph Turin, tenor. At the Piccadilly.George Beban is appearing this week at the Rivoli in a novelty combination of the silent and spoken drama, the story of which is entitled "The Greatest Love of All." It is rather startling suddently to see the screen vanish and the stage flooded with light, revealing all the characters in the flesh, gesticulating and talking. Mr. Behan's idea is clever, but his story is weighted with unnatural woe, being an old-fashioned sentimental affair with little plausibility.It is somewhat far-fetched to have muscular detectives roughly treating an old mother of 76, and we think that the censor ought to have objected to some of the subtitles, in which the District Attorney is declared to be "ruthless in his prosecutions." Why shouldn't a prosecutor perform the task allotted to him?Mr. Beban wrote and directed this effort, and he seems to have done what he wished with the courtroom scene, such things as leading questions meaning nothing to him so long as the story was unfolded. The jury in the spoken portion of this affair laughs loudly at one time, and the hero would have little chance of giving such an exhibition in a real court. In the story it almost seems as if the District Attorney was a villain because he wanted to rid the city of crooks. And in spite of the fact that one has to take such a narrative for what it is worth, it is, nevertheless, possible that some unsophisticated persons might almost believe it is a reflection of what really happens.Mr. Beban is efficient in these Italian rôles. His vociferous outbursts in the courtroom scene and his playing in the screen chapters appealed to the audience. One young woman seated behind us delivered her opinion of Mr. Beban's histrionic ability by saying: "He plays good, he does." This actor also provoked a good deal of laughter with some of his characteristic ejaculations.The weird idea of filling a gold ball shell with high explosive so that when the District Attorney hit it he might be blown to pieces made quite an impression on the spectators. Joe, this hero, relents after having put the ball in the fairway of the golf course and rescues it just as the prosecutor is swinging at it with his brassie. He is hurt, but still clutches the ball. Eventually it is taken from him and placed on a smooth table with a ledge hardly visible. The ball rolls and the audience expects that it will drop to the floor and blow everybody up, but the ledge stops it, with the result that a few hundred sighs of relief are audible in the theatre.Joe's mother is accused of stealing a bracelet which was put into the basket containing soiled linen by the District Attorney's little girl. Marie di Benedetta is excellent as the old mother. Joe's "sweetheart."
