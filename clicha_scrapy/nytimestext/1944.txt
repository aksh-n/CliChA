97-> THE SCREEN; Iron Ships, Wooden Plot
A nice little amateur idea which took seed in Hollywood several years ago when a group of theatrical youngsters put on a stage revue has finally arrived obscurely, in the last phase of tottering decline, on the screen in Metro's "Meet the People," which came to Loew's State yesterday. If you keep your eyes open and look closely, you may see it kicking around. Otherwise you will miss it completely in a dull mass of studio plot. For Metro has buried the original in an East Coast shipyard locale and has tossed around it a labored story featuring Dick Powell, Lucille Ball and Bert Lahr.Now the revue crops out occasionally (supposedly played by workers in the yard) when Miss Ball and Mr. Powell aren't swapping insults as an actress-welder and an author of the show. And, in between ponderous Lahrisms, it gets a modest chance. A travesty number, "Shicklegruber," has some freshness and amateur bounce, and the finale, "Meet the People," manifests ingenuity. Also one comedy number, sung professionally by Virginia O'Brien, the persistently deadpan torch warbler, is amusing in a stylized way. (Sample: "I didn't know our romance was ended until you tried to poison my food—.")But, for the rest, it is one of those pictures which simply switch the backstage boy-girl yarn, and it has actors threatening to "put on the greatest show you ever saw," which they don't "Rags" Ragland and little June Allyson, who is a honey, are lost in the pile. They may build iron ships in that shipyard but they certainly have got a wooden plot. Iron Ships, Wooden Plot MEET THE PEOPLE; screen play by S. M. Herzig and Fred Saidy; suggested by a story by Sol and Ben Barzman and Louis Lantz; directed by Charles Riesner; produced by E. Y. Harburg for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

288-> 'Since You Went Away,' a Film of Wartime Domestic Life, With Claudette Colbert and Others, Opens at the Capitol
In his first screen production in four years—his first since "Rebecca" and "Gone With the Wind"—David O Selznick has surrendered again to his hankering for size and has turned out another massive picture in "Since You Went Away." For two hours and fifty-one minutes this new film at the Capitol delves with a warm and gracious sympathy into the heart of what it terms "the American home" and yearns with a mother and her daughters whose best-loved men go dutifully to war. Although it makes several passes at observing surface phases of home-front life, its chief concern is three females and their immediate circle of friends. Its humors are frequent and cheerful; its spirit is hopeful and brave. But it does come off, altogether, as a rather large dose of choking sentiment.For Mr. Selznick, as writer of the screen play as well as producer of the film, let himself go in an excess of exhausting emotional detail. From a mild little volume of letters which Margaret Buell Wilder wrote—letters supposedly written by a wife to her husband off at war—he has gathered some fragments of story and magnified them into a towering tale of one mid-West family's experiences under the abnormal strains of war. He has hung on the wife's poignant moments of loneliness and despair with abundantly generous compassion which counts every moist and glistening tear. And he has detailed a daughter's pretty courtship by a bashful soldier from first blush to sad farewell.He has also embellished the story with a wealth of domestic incident and sweetened it well with genial traffic with contiguous friends and pets. There is the charming old pal of the family, now arrayed in a Navy uniform, who bobs up quite often at the fireside to offer the flattering attentions of a male. There is a bumptious retired Army colonel who elaborately comes to lodge, full of abuse and selfish habits, but remains to grow mellow and sweet. And there is the loving old Negro servant who, despite the familiar rule, refuses to leave her "white folks" and stays on at a minimum of pay.As a typical American family, the one which Mr. Selznick has devised might be seriously questioned, however—except as a radiant ideal. There is a great deal of talk and anxiety about the family's financial plight. (Papa is only a captain and they must presumably subsist on his pay.) Yet their home is an absolute vision of well-decorated luxury. And the wardrobes of mama and the daughters seem inexhaustible.True, Mr. Selznick has slipped in a scalding reflection here and there on people who trade at black markets, hoard and do other hateful things. He has even created a character—an odiously selfish female—who points up the wretched hypocrisy of a certain aggrandizing type. But he has oddly forgotten to caution the more pleasant characters to set a visible example in the saving of food and drink. At least five times we caught them in flagrant and thoughtless waste. Vaguely, we got the impression that a double-standard prevails.As the mother and center of the family, Claudette Colbert gives an excellent show of gallantly self-contained emotion, and Jennifer Jones is surpassingly sweet as a well-bred American daughter in the first bloom of womanhood and love. Robert Walker is uncommonly appealing as the young soldier whom she tragically adores, and Shirley Temple, now grown to 'teen-age freshness, is pert as the young sister. Monty Woolley makes a full-blown character of the man who comes to lodge; Joseph Cotten is droll as the Navy playboy, and Hattie McDaniel does an Andy-act quite well. Several score other actors pop up for a line or two, including Lionel Barrymore, who recites the last verse of "The Star-Spangled Banner" in a church. John Cromwell has directed everyone with his customary finish and style.No doubt, this would have been a sharper picture if Mr. Selznick had played it in much less time, and it would have been considerably more significant had he kept it somewhat closer to average means. Two hours and fifty-one minutes is a lot of time to harp upon one well-known theme—lonesomeness and anxiety. And that is all this picture really does. SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, from a screen play by David O Selznick, based on the novel of the same title by Margaret Buell Wilder; directed by John Cromwell, produced by Mr. Selznick and released by United Artists.

316-> THE SCREEN; 'Mr. Winkle Goes to War,' a Modest Comedy, in Which E.G. Robinson Plays a Draftee, at Loew's Criterion
If you car take Edward G. Robinson as a very mouse of a man, hen-pecked beyond endurance and virtually subsisting on a diet of pills, then you may find modest entertainment in "Mr. Winkle Goes to War," Columbia's picture from the Theodore Pratt novel, which came to Loew's Criterion yesterday. For a fair lot of leisurely humor has been caught in this unpretentious tale of a 44-year-old draftee's troubles, first at home and then at training camp. It is obvious humor, clearly just the sort you would normally expect: a gentle man's contact with tough sergeants, obstacle courses and, eventually, the Japanese. But it is sure-fire and timeless humor, a non-violent form of slapstick, and it fulfills the basic requirements of the entertainment film.It does, that is, if you can reckon Mr. Robinson as a meek and modest man — a wishful characterization which this writer finds most hard to take. True, the erstwhile "Little Caesar" does everything within his power to give a comic simulation of a Caspar Milquetoast turned GI. And some of his flashes of bewilderment are briefly amusing, too. But somehow his granite-chiseled visage and his plainly hard-boiled voice betray a contradiction which insistently muddles his act. It is hard to believe that Mr. Robinson would take what he does lying down. Richard Lane is amusing as a sergeant, Robert Armstrong plays a rough and tough GI and Ted Donaldson is wistfully appealing as the hero's idolizing juvenile pal. Maybe the bulk of the audience can accept Mr. Robinson's change of pace—plus the obsolescence of the story. But it stuck unconvincingly in our craw. MR.

337-> 'Dragon Seed,' Picturization of the Pearl Buck Novel, With Katharine Hepburn, Walter Huston, Arrives at Music Hall
The picture "Dragon Seed," which came to the Music Hall yesterday, goes at its story like a farmer's disk going over hard, uneven ground. At times it takes a good, deep bite. Again, it skids ineffectually along the top barely making scratches. Just as eventually, the farmer completes his field, just so, eventually, the two-and-a-half hour M-G-M production becomes a complete picture with all of its depths and shallownesses fully amplified.There are moments when the audience feels or, at the least, almost feels the real immensity of the theme, that of a big, lumbering nation being stabbed and slashed and humiliated by inexorable and vicious little men. At such times the disk takes a deep and bitter bite. At other times the focus closes down from infinity to a picayunish foreground and shows, simply, a group of muddled people in makeup speaking nonsensically in divers accents. At such times the disk skids and there's a tiny sound and there's no bite.Essentially "Dragon Seed," as taken from Pearl S. Buck's novel by that title, is the story of a large Chinese farm family and community, and the first impact of total war upon them. The familiar pattern for such things is followed: curiosity about the enemy; bewilderment at enemy atrocities; the inevitable quisling; a sporadic reign of terror, and, finally, grim and determined guerrilla warfare. Throughout all of it there is the painful stress and strain on the relationships of the closely knit family. The general comprehension of this theme has all the power that Miss Buck has put into her novel. The picture's great weakness lies in its failure to produce characterizations as strong and as faithful as the over-all structure.Granting that much of the theatre's illusion must be furnished by the audience itself, it seems to be asking too much of an audience to supply the deficiency of Katharine Hepburn's characterization of a Chinese girl. She is brittle and non-resilient throughout, and is constantly betrayed by an accent she has made into her own trademark of sophisticated drama. And speaking of accents, the heavy speech of Akim Tamiroff falls upon the ear as resonantly as the sound of a gefülte fish banged against a temple gong.These departures are more or less neutralized by the normal performances of Walter Huston, Aline MacMahon and Henry Travers. Nevertheless it is disconcerting to hear one brother of a family talking with a guttural Germanic accent, another in broad Oxonian and still another in something approaching a Midwestern drawl.As has been indicated "Dragon Seed" is long enough to provide practically everything, and in quantity. It provides pathos in a simple family being uprooted physically and spiritually. It provides no end of straightaway melodrama. Then too, there are a number of out-and-out spectacles such as the scorched-earth scene which, truly, is a firebug's dream. And finally, there is, still speaking of plenty, plenty of useless footage. DRAGON SEED, screen play by Marguerite Roberts and Jane Murfin; based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck: directed by Jack Conway and Harold S. Bucquet: produced by Pandro S. Berman for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; narrated by Lionel Barrymore. At the Music Hall.Jade . . . . . Katharine HepburnLing Tan . . . . . Walter HustonLing's Wife . . . . . Aline MacMahonWu Lien . . . . .

386-> THE SCREEN; One Less Spider
No use getting all excited about the damage that is likely to be done to your sensitive nervous system by "Spider Woman," which came to the Rialto yesterday. For this luridly titled picture is nothing more than a new turn with Sherlock Holmes, in which the famed Baker Street detective rounds up another criminal gang. The villains in this case are some cool coves, with a woman leading them, who specialize in doing away with people who are well but not wisely insured. By rigging himself out as a Hindu and by exposing himself to the villains' trap, old Sherlock discovers that the damage is being done in a most extraordinary way: spiders are being turned loose on the victims, who, once bitten, go mad with pain and kill themselves."It is a quaint but not especially frightening method, as demonstrated in this film, so that the singular recommendation of "Spider Woman" is its Holmesian suavity. Basil Rathbone plays the versatile detective with his usual serene elegance, while Nigel Bruce and Dennis Hoey are his old reliable thickskulled running mates. Gale Sondergaard is the poisonous gang queen, very sinister in a soporific way, and a youngster named Teddy Infuhr plays a diabolic child cleverly. There aren't many thrills in "Spider Woman" but there is a measure of amusing acting at least.

1395-> THE SCREEN; Lower and Lower
The Frank Sinatra cultists were in force at the Palace yesterday to squeal and go into spasms over their hero's new picture, "Higher and Higher." At least they are calling it his picture. Actually, Frankie appears at such times as he is graciously permitted to warble and ooze out what passes for charm. Very wisely, the director has managed to keep him out of the way for the rest of it. For the simple fact is that Frankie is no Gable or Barrymore.As to the picture, you might call it a switch on the Cinderella yarn—which is to say that Prince Charming (Frankie) doesn't get the girl. The producers were either cautious or careless in this respect, but we rather suspect the latter, for the whole thing seems carelessly done. The girl in the case is Michele Morgan, a lovely and talented chick, who appears as a scullery maid until promoted to the pretensions of a glamorous debutante. In this guise she comes into contact with Frankie, the boy who lives next door, but her heart throughout belongs to Jack Haley, who plays a butler and can't even sing.The best that this film has to offer is a multiplicity of songs. Frankie moans and disgorges five out of nine of them. To judge by surrounding screams of ecstasy (or was it anguish?), the best (or worst) of them were "A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening," "The Music Stopped" and "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink." Leon Errol, Marcy McGuire and Dooley Wilson are generally frittered away in lesser roles, and the whole thing seems but a slapdash setting for the incredibly unctuous renderings of "the Voice." Lower and Lower HIGHER AND HIGHER; screen play by Jay Dratler and Ralph Spence; additional dialogue by William Bowers and Howard Harris; based on the musical play "Higher and Higher," with book by Gladys Hurlbut and Joshua Logan and music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart; produced and directed by Tim Whelan for RKO Radio.

1436-> At the Roxy
When a murder mystery possessing as much sustained suspense, good acting and caustically brittle dialogue as "Laura," which opened yesterday at the Roxy, comes along it might seem a little like carping to suggest that it could have been even better. As the story of a strangely fascinating female who insinuates herself into the lives of three very worldly gents, much depends, of course, upon the lady herself. This is made quite evident in the beginning of the story when considerable interest and curiosity is generated over the murder of Laura Hunt, and the two rivals for her affections make quite a to do about her intriguing attributes to an inquiring detective.Yes, you get the idea that this Laura must have been something truly wonderful. Now, at the risk of being unchivalrous, we venture to say that when the lady herself appears upon the scene via a flashback of events leading up to the tragedy, she is a disappointment. For Gene Tierney simply doesn't measure up to the word-portrait of her character. Pretty, indeed, but hardly the type of girl we had expected to meet. For Miss Tierney plays at being a brilliant and sophisticated advertising executive with the wild-eyed innocence of a college junior.Aside from that principal reservation, however, "Laura" is an intriguing melodrama. Suspects are plentiful enough, if not too pointed, and Vera Caspary gives the whole addle an added measure of complexity by having the supposed corpse turn up very much alive at about the half-way mark. Her reappearance was quite timely, too, nor it was becoming obvious that even the detective was coming under Laura's spell—a situation which doesn't present itself every day in crime novels, much less on the screen.Clifton Webb, making his film debut in "Laura" as the acid-tongued columnist, Waldo Lydecker, is sophistry personified. His incisive performance is, however, closely matched by that of Dana Andrews as the detective. Mr. Andrews is fast proving himself to be a solidly persuasive performer, a sort of younger-edition Spencer Tracy. Other performances are contributed by Vincent Price, Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams. Only Miss Tierney seems out of key. Perhaps if Laura Hunt had not had such a build-up, it would have been different. Anyway, the picture on the whole is close to being a top-drawer mystery.
