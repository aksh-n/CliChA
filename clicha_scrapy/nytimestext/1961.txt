1146-> 'Tammy Tell Me True'
JUDGING by the success of "Tammy," a while back, and the new sequel, "Tammy Tell Me True," there must be a place in this jaded world for a plucky little back-woods girl with a pet goat and a homespun wisdom that soothes the most despairing grownups.The new Universal-International romantic comedy, which opened yesterday at the Palace is an unstrained sequel to the Debbie Reynolds original. It is exactly what might be expected—a wholesome, sentimental and utterly harmless little family comedy in good color. Now played by Sandra Dee, Tammy hasn't hardly — noticeably, rather—changed a bit.The same unspoiled youngster, with a muffin-thick bayou drawl and a phenomenal flair for solving other people's problems, Tammy drags her nanny goat off to college, a swampland oasis called "Seminola." There, as a "special student," she lands herself a handsome teacher, John Gavin, and befriends a lonely old lady, Beulah Bondi. She hides her from a money-grubbing niece, Julia Meade, on Miss Bondi's houseboat, and the rejuvenated old soul has the time of her life. With no less than psychic advice, Miss Dee also steadies the crumbling marriage of the Dean of Women, Virginia Grey, and a painter, Charles Drake.Actually, this Ross Hunter production is a mite perkier than its predecessor. Until the finale, when the picture literally melts in courtroom warmth, Harry Keller's direction is fairly sprightly, with the adult players gracefully letting Miss Dee dominate.Oscar Brodney's script is—well, game. It does include one genuinely bright and funny baby-sitter interlude, when Miss Dee grimly subdues three "progressively reared" little demons. She also does nicely by Dorothy Squires' nice title tune.At least one cast member takes exception to Tammy's rainbow philosophy, and more than a few spectators may second the motion. "Nan," Miss Dee announces to her whiskered pet, "ah reckon most people in the world are monstrous kind.""Baaaaaaah!" philosophizes the goat.Take your choice. TAMMY TELL ME TRUE, screen play by Oscar Brodney; directed by Harry Keller; produced by Ross Hunter for Universal-International Pictures. At the Palace Theatre, Seventh Avenue and Forty-fifth Street. Running time: ninety-seven minutes.Tammy . . . . . Sandra DeeTom Freeman . . . . . John GavinMrs. Call . . . . . Beulah BondiMiss Jenks . . . . . Virginia GreyBuford Woodley . . . . .
