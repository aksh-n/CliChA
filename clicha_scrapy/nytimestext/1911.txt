AS MR. STREET had not published a volume of his newspaper and magazine essays for five years, his "People and Questions"* needs no explanation.

--------
429-> RESPECT THE COURTS.
Nothing could be better than that private disputants should settle their quarrels out of court.

BURNS'S verses about seeing ourselves "from the outside" lose some of their triteness when an able Chinese essayist turns our own guns upon us, as it were, and riddles Western ethics, Christian doctrines, and the methods of missionaries in the Far East.

719-> THIS MAN KNEW TEN PRESIDENTS; Col. Crook Served in the White House as Bodyguard from Lincoln to Roosevelt
THE curiosity about public men is endless. The books of reminiscences that seek to gratify it are usually written by persons who met the great man on more or less even terms.

--------
720-> The Foes of Reciprocity.
Underlying most of the anti-reciprocity (and even some of the pro-reciprocity) arguments, which have been heard in Congress and elsewhere, there is the assumption that the two nations are trading units; that they are about to enter into a bargain, and that one of the two is likely to get the best of that bargain.

--------
732-> A SURPRISING REFORM.
If a few years ago -- let us say on the eve of the election of 1904 -- a watchman on the tower of politics had predicted the passage within a quarter of a century of a bill to check corruption and extravagance in elections, such as the one that has just passed Congress, his prophecy would have been received with amused incredulity.

738-> PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN CUBA.
The news from Cuba is of peace and prosperity. It concerns few persons in the United States, and least of all the Government at Washington, what political disputes the Cubans may have among themselves.

MARTI is not a matter of international importance.

--------
790-> MR. HYDE SPEAKS.
At last Mr. HYDE has spoken, and the voices of his detractors should hereafter be silenced. We know now that only the influence of his counsel has hitherto caused him "reluctantly to refuse to reply to inspired reports." A malign political conspiracy has been assailing his reputation in the dark.

Mr. Edison and immortality have given rise to much profound (?) discussion, and H.F.O., in your issue of April 16, has contributed some of it.

--------
818-> Long Island's Smoking Cars.
Observers Nos. 1 and 2 have hit the nail on the head in some respects, but neither of them has said half enough.

--------
821-> READY TO DACK ATHLETICS.; Philadelphians Willing to Bet Even Money That Champions Will Win.

--------
822-> THE SLAUGHTER IN CHINA.
The latest advices from China contain a very faint promise of an early peace.

Kidd.

--------
827-> THE UNCEASING FLOOD OF FICTION; Romances and Realistic Novels for Summer Reading by Well-Known Foreign and Domestic Producers
THE Infinite Capacity," by Cosmo Hamilton (Fitzgerald, $1.20), might well have been written to illustrate Lombroso's theory that genius is a form of mental disease. The marvelous violinist, Francois Ale, who is the hero of the story, is a creature of the wildest impulse, as much outside the domain of ethics as a faun. 
--------
828-> FOREIGN TRADE OPPORTUNITIES.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. -- The Consular and Trade Report will not the following foreign trade opportunities.

--------
831-> RIVALRY FOR IMMIGRANTS.
The statement of Mr. GEORGE B. BILLINGS, Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of Boston, that future immigrants into the United States will probably diminsh in number yearly is welcome. But the explanation given, the rivalry of Canada and Argentina, is unwelcome, because they attract from Europe just the classes of immigrants that we want. 
--------
832-> INDIANS HAVE A CELEBRATION OF THEIR OWN JULY 4
ONE-HALF of the country may celebrate the Fourth of July next Tuesday in the approved safe and sane way, and the other half according to the old-fashioned, casualty-producing method; but out in the Dakotas the Sioux Indian will do so by giving away to his friends everything he owns -- which, doubtless, is quite safe, but not altogether sane. 
--------
833-> THE ATTITUDE TOWARD WASTE.

--------
834-> MAKERS AND UNMAKERS OF LAWS.
The Supreme Court of New Jersey annulled on Saturday the employers' liability law.

The Newark team of the Eastern League worried the Brooklyn team a bit at Washington Park yesterday, forcing the Superbas to extend themselves to win an eleven-inning game by a score of 4 to 3.

--------
836-> MR. STOVER'S LESSON.
Park Commissioner STOVER hass learned that "the constant pressure of human feet on certain parts of Central Park has produced a substratum of compact soil which prevents moisture from permeating the earth."

--------
837-> SOCIALISTS ATTACK COURTS AS UNFAIR; Also Assail Roosevelt for His "Murder Is Murder" in The Outlook.

--------
838-> THE COST OF OUR SCHOOLS.
The cost of the schools of New York is necessarily very great. Few of our readers who have not given special study to the subject realize how large it is relatively and positively.

--------
839-> DEBS AND THE LAW.

LONDON, March 10. -- Lord Lansdowne's Rembrandt, "The Mill," was on view for the first time yesterday on the occasion of the opening of the new wing of the National Gallery.

The back-to-the-farm agitation was the subject of yesterday's luncheon at the Republican Club, and it roused so much interest among the city dwellers that an audience which could hardly be accommodated listened to the discussion.

--------
849-> CONFORMING TO THE COURT'S DECREE.
It may be expected that the action of the International Harvester Company sets the example which will be followed by as many other trusts as feel the need to comply with the court's decree in the oil and tobacco cases, or are able to do so. Nothing more can be asked of any good trust, and nothing of the sort can be looked for from any bad trust.

854-> INNOCENT CONVICTS.
The case of JOHN BOEHMAN, sentenced to Sing Sing for life, is like that of ANDREW TOTH. After sixteen years of the lockstep, the striped suit, and convict fare, BOEHMAN'S story that he was absent from the scene of the murder for which he was committed is to be confirmed by a competent witness.

859-> FIGURES AGAINST THE PLANTERS; Washington Can't Make Out Just How They Can Stand Fixed Charges.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. -- The "valorization" scheme for cotton as proposed yesterday by Col. Robert W. Thompson in connection with representatives of many of the cotton-growing States has not caused any excitement here among Government trust prosecutors. The plan as outlined so far does not give the impression of being a monopoly of cotton, as apparently the ownership of the product would remain vested in the farmer until the day which he designates for selling.

860-> CORRECTS TAFT ON DIVORCE.; Says Uniform Laws on Causes Exist in 90 Per Cent. of States.
CHICAGO, Sept. 10. -- John C. Richberg, President of the Illinois Commission on Uniform State Laws, declared to-day that President Taft was seriously mistaken on the subject of uniform divorce.

--------
865-> THE UNIVERSITY MEN.
We have no good word for the practice of gambling, but we are willing to bet that Mr. CRANE never tried to put one particular ball out of fifteen in a designated pocket. This one instance of the extravagance which accompanies a depraved life will not stir up the blood of the country against the university at Cambridge.

873-> CALLING FOR THE MINISTER.(5); Once in a While a Certain Class May Call in Vain.
Looking over my to-day's NEW YORK TIMES, I notice an item bearing on ministers' vacations. Somebody died in Flushing and the undertaker could not find a minister to officiate at the funeral. What I wonder at Is that the undertaker did not call for the minister to whose church this man belonged.

884-> CARDS FOR CHRISTMAS
THE little pictured cards that serve as carriers for Christmas and New Year greetings hold this season, as usual, closely to conventional lines. As usual, also, they are nearly all imported. Considering the enormous demand there is for these trifles of the holidays, it is surprising that American desirers and publishers do not try the experiment or bringing out some distinctive cards along new lines.

--------
896-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
It is not easy-indeed, it is difficult -- to see why parents of great wealth should seek to insure their child against kidnappers. The report that the McLEANS have been negotiating with the association of British insurers known as Lloyd's for the issuance of such a policy on their much-guarded heir is so circumstantial, however, that it must have some basis in fact. 
--------

General business continues upon its upward swing, and even if the growth in volume and activity is small, and there are gray spots here and there, every week now shows a little better gain over its predecessors. It is now seen that May, 1911, was as a whole a better business month than May, 1910. 
--------
900-> DR. JOWETT'S COMPLAINT.
Before we condemn the Rev. Dr. JOWETT'S reputed assertion to his English friends that he could find no English news in the American newspapers we must remember that it is a habit of Western American people to complain that Eastern newspapers publish no Western news, and of people throughout the United States to assert, facetiously, that New York is the most "provincial" place in the world, and that its press fitly represents its narrowness. 
--------
901-> PRISON FOR GEM THIEVES.; Men Caught In Austria, After Escaping Here, Sentenced Eoston.
BOSTON, Nov. 11. -- Judge John B. Ratigan to-day imposed a prison sentence of fourteen to sixteen years upon Joseph and Jacob Goldberg, convicted of robbing the jewelry store of Samuel Ullian, in lower Washington Street, a year ago.

ITHACA, N.Y., Oct. 11. -- A long, hard scrimmage marked the football work of the Cornell teams this afternoon, and the offensive power of the 'Varsity seemed considerably improved.

--------
904-> TRAFFIC TIED UP BY A HEAVY FOG; Rear-End Crash on Brooklyn Elevated Injures 11 -- River Collisions Numerous.

905-> NEGRO SHOT BY POLICEMAN.; Wounded in Abdomen During Row in Tenement Which He Was Watching.
Police Capt. Walsh of the East 126th Street Station is investigating the shooting of a negro by a patrolman, which occurred early yesterday morning, and which seems to be partly due to the excitement into which the police and the negroes of the city have been thrown by the murder of Patrolman Lynch by the negro Collins on Saturday. 
--------
906-> Plan to Curb Express Companies.
WASHINGTON, April 10. -- A bill to prohibit express companies and common carriers from competing with the Post Office Department in the transportation of mall matter weighing less than eleven pounds was introduced in the House to-day by Representative Howard of Georgia.

908-> Conditions Are Now as They Were a Generation Ago.

--------
909-> Knockabouts Race on Shrewsbury.
RED BANK, N.J., June 10. -- With a stiff wind blowing from the West three knockabouts of the Red Bank Yacht Club were started over an eight-mile course for silver mugs this afternoon.

Mr. George Beban's play, "The Sign of the Rose," is described on the programme as a character study in four acts, and as long as Mr. Beban is on the stage it is a very good character study indeed. Otherwise it is comedy-drama of a familiar but interesting enough sort. And while it contains much that is conventional and machine made the play provides a good foundation for the sympathy of an audience. 
--------
912-> Giants' Colt Pitchers Hit Hard.
WILKESBARRE, Penn., April 10. -- Manager McGraw's Giant Colts had a lively practice here to-day, when they were defeated by the Wilkesbarre team of the New York State League. The, defeat was largely due to the ineffectiveness of the Colt's pitchers, both Jenkins and Shonts being hit hard.

918-> CANADIAN CAMPAIGN FACETIAE.
The Attorney General of Manitoba thinks that the Dominion Premier talks "nonsense" about reciprocity, and gives an exhibition of his own sweet reasonableness by predicting that if the reciprocity arrangement should disturb the business of the United States -- as nobody here thinks it will -- then "the States would on one pretext or another pick a quarrel with Canada and force war on us." 
--------
919-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Banishment Would Be Enough. Even the merest amateur in ornithology knows that most of the few American bird species with the habit of building many nests within narrowly restricted areas were long since exterminated, because this form of gregariousness made it so easy to kill them, and that the remainder are precariously surviving in almost inaccessible swamps and islets.

929-> Sovereign, Tarantula, Vitessee, and Winchester in Atlantic Y.C. Race Week Series.
The matching of the four fastest steam yachts in the world by the Regatta Committee of the Atlantic Yacht Club, Dr. J.E. De Mund, Walter Sykes, Jr., and Carlos De Zafra, seems to have become a certainty through the acceptance of two of the boats, and every indication points to the others doing likewise.

Standing unconcernedly in the prisoners' enclosure at Bow Street, she listened to the evidence in support of the charge against her of assaulting the police and obstructing them in the performance of their duty. 
--------
931-> Review 1 -- No Title
Unquestionably your correspondent "AK.W." is correct in surmising that the almost universally accepted innocence of "Marie-Claire" is an entirely wrong conception of the character and motif that prompted the story. Indeed, it is amazingly strange that the book has been received so unqualifiedly well by it's circle of world-wide critics, and one has difficulty in reconciling their literary and analytical acuteness with a condition-that must be very obvious to any reader of ordinary intelligence.

--------
933-> TROUBLE BREEDING LEGISLATION.
In two conspicuous cases this week the British House of Lords has taken a position upon topics of permanent importance for reasons of temporary force.

953-> CONSCIENCE DEMOCRATS.
We venture to suggest the name of "Conscience Democrats" for the gallant band who are standing out for Democratic principles in the Legislature at Albany.

--------
978-> KITCHEN JOURNALISM.

988-> TUNEFUL VERSE FOR LITTLE EARS; Rhyme, with Reason and Without, and Happy Pictures to Enchant the Diminutives
IT is always refreshing to come upon a pretty new book for our very small brothers and sisters, whose verses are as quaint and rhythmic as those by Wilhelmina Seegemiller in "Other Rhymes for Little Readers," (Rand McNally, $1.25.) For the supply of happy, singing child verse is -- in the English language at least -- all too meagre for the demands of the very little tots under seven.

1419-> A POET WHO FINDS HIMSELF; Mr. Sterling's Success in His Latest Volume of Verse, "The House of Orchids"
THE saying goes that poets are born, not made, but the fact is, there is a superfluity of both kinds. It is a pity that the two so seldom exist in combination.

1424-> THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX.
If the Assembly makes good the threat with which it adjourned it will take up the Federal income tax amendment when it reassembles.

The long-looked-for official opening of the city's $500,000 bathhouse at Coney Island took place yesterday, but the occasion was marred considerably because the bathhouse was not completed, so there could be no real opening at all. No one except the officials was allowed to see the inside of the building. 
--------
1428-> THE REMSEN INVESTIGATION.
It is too bad that, because the policy of paring Dr. RUSBY'S salary was pursued by officials in the Department of Agriculture, Secretary WILSON'S eminent Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts should be subjected to an attack on the ground of extravagance in using moneys, freely granted to them during their experiments in determining the digestibility of chemical preservatives.

The letter from a "Hydrographic Engineer" which you published yesterday, in which the writer sees in the accident which befell the Prinzess Irene an "impressive argument" for the development of Montauk Point as a port of entry, is certainly timely. It is no exaggeration to say that the southern shore of Long Island is one of the most dangerous in this country.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 1. -- The Yale daily football practice, which has developed into a progressive record of wrenches and dislocations from which no member of the squad is immune, added its quota to the hospital list again this afternoon.

1437-> A MOTHER'S COLLEGE SON.; She Tells What She Fears About the Dangers He Meets.
With all Mr. Crane's so-called "intemperate language and extravagant statistics" as regards college life to-day, he seems to me far nearer the truth than your editorial article on "The Freshman."

--------
1441-> THE MAYOR'S CHARTER."
We think Mr. GAYNOR will have to make himself a little more clearly understood as to what is known as "The Mayor's Charter." His recent explanation, while it disclaimed responsibility, did not withdraw the prestige of his support. It was a little on the order of "missing if it be a heifer and hitting if it be a deer." 
--------
1442-> AS FAR AS EAST FROM WEST
DANIEL D. BIDWELL'S "As Far as the East is from the West" contains a pleasing account of his circumnavigation of the globe, along with about six hundred other Americans. all passengers on the steamship Cleveland from New York to San Francisco, and thence home by rail.

--------
1443-> THE PARKS.
All citizens who go about with their eyes open will agree with the Commissioner of Accounts that the city parks are in a deplorable condition. The fact that Mr. FOSDICK seems to have felt compelled to have to take charge of them temporarily indicates, perhaps, the reason for their bad state.

1471-> SCHLEY VINDICATED; The "Loop" of the Brooklyn at Santiago Described as an Admirable Military Act in Admiral Chadwick's Book
IT is inevitable that the reader of Admiral Chadwick's history of the Spanish-American war will look first to see what the distinguished author has to say about the events which resulted in the Sampson-Schley controversy.
