27-> 'Bliss of Mrs. Blossom':Story of Menage a Trois in London Is at Local Houses With 'Danger: Diabolik'
AS for Paramount's color double bill that opened yesterday on the circuits, skip a serving of infantile junk titled "Danger: Diabolik." Settle, instead, for something a little different, even original — a curious comedy called "The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom."The first exercise (in staying awake) has John Phillip Law as a superburglar glumly grappling with stale leftovers from the James Bond series, along with some psychedelic color effects and riggings from "Barbarella," the film in which Mr. Law flapped around as an angel. This time the whole thing moves in dubbed and undubbed English and about five different accents, including the teeth-hissing Terry-Thomas. The film came from France and Italy.As for "Bliss," only the British could have concocted some serenely amoral fun from a story about a London housewife who keeps a lover in the attic for years, while sweetly inspiring her husband to invent a miracle brassiere. What does the trick are the brisk writing, the restrained performances (excluding one simpering sleuth) and the extremely nimble direction of Joe McGrath.The picture, in lovely color, is roguish, restrained and absurdly likable, with a neat climactic twist. Some of the fantasy montages get a little thick, but we'll buy the sly, cool impudence of Shirley MacLaine (surprisingly low-keyed), Richard Attenborough and James Booth, as a rather peculiar but decidedly personable mènage à trois. The Casts???

112-> Miss Davis's 78th
BETTE DAVIS'S 78th movie, "The Anniversary," which opened yesterday at the Selwyn and other neighborhood theaters, is a horror film for faint-hearted horror movie fans. It has no horror music. Or any serious crimes. It is not scary. In the serious bars of pure terror, it is the ginger ale. The cast seems to have a pleasant time. Miss Davis plays a one-eyed mother of three, who wears a lurid eyepatch. She leaves a glass eye under her pillow to alarm the fiancée of her youngest son (who insists on spending the night with his girl in his mother's bed). Miss Davis is a widow. It is her anniversary.Her middle son wants to emigrate with his wife and five children from England—where the movie is set—to Canada. Her youngest son wants to get married. Her oldest son likes to dress in ladies' underthings. Miss Davis opposes all these things but the last. There is a lot of caustic dialogue. Miss Davis gets a chance to sing "Rock of Ages" under her husband's portrait. Sheila Hancock and James Cossins of "How I Won the War." and Elaine Taylor and Christian Roberts of "To Sir With Love" (Mr. Roberts played the boy who gave in last) get a chance to appear again. "The Aniversary" is not a distinguished example of the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre, but it isn't too heavy. And the genre isn't that distinguished after all. The CastTHE ANNIVERSARY, screenplay Jimmy Sangster; directed by Roy Ward Baker and produced by Mr. Sangster; a Seven Arts-Hammer Production presented by 20th Century-Fox. At neighborhood theaters.

469-> The Screen: Mrs. Alfie Confronts a Vinyl World:Working-Class London Depicted in 'Poor Cow' Day-Glo Mural Stars Young Carol White
"POOR COW," which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill and other theaters, begins with some shots of the real birth of a baby, and goes on to become one of those ringingly false. Technicolor British films about working-class life in London. It is not very good; but January has been, in general, a poor month for movies, and it might be a good idea to look at the bright side—which, since the quality of the color makes England look like April in Disneyland, is very bright indeed.Carol White, who plays Joy, the young mother (and Poor Cow of the title), is very pretty and natural in a part that amounts to Mrs. Alfie. People who liked "Alfie" will probably like "Poor Cow." Joy is married to a burglar, played by John Bindon (a former seaman whose first film role this is). When he goes to jail, she falls in love with a gentle, sensitive friend of his, played very well by Terence Stamp. When he also goes to jail, she becomes a bar girl and photographer's model for middle-aged amateurs. She has a lot of affairs and divorces her husband; but she is really waiting for the return from jail of the man she loves.The film's similarity to "Alfie" lies in its idea of the working-class young, freed by a period of prosperity from any hard need to work, leading empty lives absolutely permeated with Mod, until their attractiveness ends and they are left, without any real resources, to themselves. The difference is that Joy can keep her baby. And one of the movie's really excellent scenes occcurs when the child is briefly lost, in a section of London where demolition and reconstruction are going on. As Joy searches for him (and Carol White plays this scene beautifully), there is a moment's sense of things lost track of, of life—for an instant's lapse of attention—turning unalterably bleak.For the rest, the film's complete ungenuineness rests, like "Alfie's," really in the assumption that no matter how deeply you sound its characters. Mod is what you find: color, fabric, irresponsibility. Joy and Alfie are romanticized into a Vinyl lack of individuality.There are some fine comic scenes with Joy's aunt, played by Queenie Watts (who also appeared in Joan Littlewood's good movie, "Sparrows Can't Sing"), and some rather nice musical accompaniment by Donovan.One odd thing: despite Joy's many lovers, the camera turns quite skittishly away from love scenes. It seems, in this context, a mistake. An argument can certainly be made for sex in movies that try to approach seriously the problems of the young; and this one, which begins so frankly with maternity, seems to have become quite nervous about things physical right after the credits came on.

Stevie KingTHE tired, cliché-ridden little movie called "Track of Thunder" that opened yesterday on the circuits should discourage any similar projects about stock-car racing for some time to come. Matter of fact, the picture probably will dampen the hopes of any youngsters intending to make a career of slamming around a speedway in a churning mass of autos. The film is that dull.This is the old one about a gangster syndicate muscling in on a sporting business and setting two driver pals against each other, with a pretty girl wavering between them. Finally there's the big race, when a third pal makes the supreme sacrifice and straightens out everything but the picture.Since this United Artists release is in color there are inevitable background shots or slam-bang racing cars photographed at various Tennessee speedways and some of this footage is okay. The cars move, in fact, miles ahead of the plot and most of the performances.Tom Kirk, Ray Stricklyn, H. M. Wynant, Brenda Benet, Majel Barrett and James Dobson are in there pitching—or pinching. There is some quite, steady acting, in the standard role of a worried mother, by Faith Domergue—more real acting than the lady ever achieved in her glamour-girl heyday.Otherwise, "Track of Thunder" is a one-horse car pool.

1353-> Firecreek' Has Stars
"FIRECREEK" is a good, sturdy and occasionally powerful little Western. James Stewart is plain wonderful and Henry Fonda almost matches him. For some strange reason those peerless veteran cowboys have never appeared on the same movie prairie before, only once together in a 1948 comedy called "On Our Merry Way." To see what they, a fine cast and a dandy new director have accomplished on a small patch of ground has been worth the twenty-year wait.This unpretentious little color movie, which looks as though it cost a dime, is almost exactly right every step of the way, with Mr. Stewart as a peaceful farmer aroused to wrath when five killers terrorize a tiny, quaking community. That's "Firecreek" (and what a grand title!), just a wide place in the road. Warner Brothers-Seven Arts opened it yesterday in circuit showcases.In a cold light, the film is a kind of vest-pocket "High Noon," with Mr. Stewart as a part-time sheriff and the culprits, led by Mr. Fonda, arriving in town at the outset. The place is a dusty dot, quietly inhabited by a few old or defenseless folk. With Mr. Fonda partially disabled, his animalistic pals make mischief that leads to murder and a hanging, until a climactic gun battle takes place between the two stars. It sounds familiar, as it certainly should.But the beauty of this picture is its professional and genuine simplicity, the way nearly every line of dialogue has been made to count, either limning a characterization or edging the action forward. Calvin Clements, the scenarist and a man who knows people, is attacking complacency about evil head-on.And if the villagers seem more than types they are also well-played by an uncommonly impressive and unglittery cast of familiar, unfamiliar and new faces, from J. Robert Porter, as a brave, dim-witted stable boy, to Inger Stevens, as a disillusioned spinster. Dean Jagger, Ed Begley and Jay C. Flippen are capable as ever, and credit should go to briefer work by Barbara Luna, Louise Latham and Jacqueline Scott."Firecreek" also marks the first film directed by Vincent McEveety, from television, and let's hope he makes more. Mr. McEveety starts at a deliberate, casual pace, whips up a chilling crescendo and stages a shoot-'em-up climax that's a graphic beaut. This sequence is something to see, with the wounded, hobbling Mr. Stewart almost berserk with righteous rage.And pitted against each other at the end, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Fonda, as a ruthless, enigmatic loner, play like flint on steel. Small-size "Firecreek," sparked by two veteran aces, makes a little go a long, long way. The CastFIRECREEK, written by Calvin Clements; directed by Vincent McEveety and produced by Philip Leacock; a Philip Leacock John Mantley Production presented by Warner Brothers-Seven Arts.

--------
1355-> Singapore Fling
"A MATTER OF INNOCENCE," which is based on a story by Noël Coward, is really a kind of remake of "Shakespeare Wallah"—with all the delicacy and background and nuance completely lost. Hayley Mills, who was so good as the little girl in "Tiger Bay," plays a plain young Englishwoman on an Asian tour with her dowdy aunt (very much overacted by Brenda De Banzie). She meets an Indian gigolo in Singapore (Shashi Kapoor, who had a similar, better role in "Shakespeare Wallah"), has an affair with him, becomes much prettier, and goes away. Trevor Howard plays her uncle, the black sheep of the family, who oversees a plantation and also oversees his niece's progress to a shade of gray.All three talents are wasted. Shashi Kapoor, in particular, is given lines in a kind of garbled English that no person of any nationality—even in the imagination of the most firmly Imperialistic scriptwriter—ever spoke. But the movie, shot in color in Singapore, has some nice music by Michel Legrand (who did "Umbrellas of Cherbourg"), and it is entertaining in a way bad movies are. It is always interesting to find any film that tries to depict in any way at all the lives of Westerners, no matter who, who are trying to live in and come to grips with the problems of the East.The film opened yesterday at the New Embassy, the Guild and the 68th Street Playhouse. The CastA MATTER OF INNOCENCE, screenplay by Keth Waterhouse and Wills Hall, based on a story by Noel Cowarn; presented by Guy Green; produced by George W. George and Frank Granat; a George-Granat-Universal Pictures Ltd. production released by Universal Pictures.

1444-> Slow Start on Ethics
Since Congress has been notoriously and deliberately obtuse on the subject of ethical standards, the reports submitted to both houses last week have to be considered progress. But the report to the House is less than ideal, and the Senate committee's "important beginning" is hopelessly inadequate.

Miss Ti-Grace Atkinson, N.

--------
1457-> THE LINE OF MOST RESISTANCE
Fred C. Shapiro's portrait of Bill Coffin in "God and That Man at Yale," March 3, is sharp and clear but the background is incomplete. The peace movement has its leaders but it has not indulged, as the Government has, in the cult of personality. 
--------
1458-> Advertising: The Cloak-and-Dagger Battle
The agency business -- as those in it will constantly tell you -- is a people business. And people like to talk, which is good if it's just nonbusiness chatter, but bad if it has to do with a client's yet-to-be-unveiled new product or advertising campaign.

1463-> Letter to the Editor 11 -- No Title

DICK BUTTON, the former United States Olympic skating champion, appears in line for a gold medal in television sports reporting. To the American Broadcasting Company's running coverage of the Winter Games in Grenoble, France, he has contributed not only the expected expertise in his speciality, but also, more important, a candor and critical objectivity that make the gee-whiz, smiling-toothed reportage of video's full-time sportscasters seem hopelessly out of date.

REVIVALISM is the dominant spirit in today's world of opera. With but a few exceptions, an interest in opera means a passion for the past.

MANCHESTER, N. H., March 13 -- Young gentlemen now abed may not exactly hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks who fought with Gene McCarthy on his St. Crispin's Day.

1491-> THE COMPLEAT SWINDLER. By Ralph Hancock with Henry Chafetz. 294 pp. Macmillan. $6.95.
" Any serious study of swindling,'' the authors claim, "must assume that a little bit of larceny exists in everyone."

1492-> ST. OLAF COLLEGE OFFERS CONCERT; Olaf Christiansen Leads Choir Last Time Here
For most of the audience that filled Philharmonic Hall Friday night, the concert given there was more than a musical occasion. It was the leave-taking of a former mentor, friend and symbol of remembered joys in music when they were young.

1493-> Daytona 24-Hour Endurance Race Starts Saturday
CALL it a race if you feel you must observe the amenities, but there are no penalty points for characterizing it as a rat race -- the Twenty-four Hours of Daytona, hitherto known as the Daytona Continental.

There are as many legends about hot cross buns as about any bread in Christendom. They are said to have originated in pagan England; they figure in nursery rhymes; and, even today, hot cross buns baked on Good Friday are supposed to have miraculous curative powers.
