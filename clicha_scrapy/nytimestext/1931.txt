0-> THE SCREEN
A graphic and engrossing screen conception of Edna Ferber's widely read novel, "Cimarron," was presented by Radio Pictures last night at the Globe before a keenly interested audience. In it Richard Dix plays that unique character, Yancey Cravat, poet, pistoleer, lawyer and editor, the man who is periodically attacked with the wanderlust. This picture, a stupendous undertaking in view of the time that is covered and the hosts of persons in its scenes, starts with the land rush forty years ago to the Indian territory now known as the State of Oklahoma. It ends in 1930 with many of the characters who were in the first scenes still surviving.Although it is episodical, it holds one's attention and Mr. Dix gives a fine impersonation of Cravat. Cravat's nonchalance and his impulsiveness may seem more than a trifle strange at times, but he is nevertheless a person to be remembered. He is consistently inconsistent. His sangfroid is remarkable, but he goes on until he comes to a tragic end.From the first to the last scene one is often stirred by this chronicle. It has its subtleties and it has been most intelligently directed by Wesley Ruggles. It gives a wonderfully impressive idea of the early days in the territory, from the time the hordes of persons on horseback, in wagons and on foot make the dash to lay out their claims on the signal of a pistol shot, to the gradual improvements that come to Osage as years go by. There is the indomitable Sabra, Cravat's sterling wife, who sticks to the newspaper that he starts in the early days to the last. No matter how gallant Cravat may be during certain interludes, it is invariably his wife who enlists one's sympathy.Imagine a husband who has deserted his wife and children to go to the Cherokee strip, returning five years later and asking his wife whether she missed him! And what's more, he discovers at the moment of his return that the notorious Dixie Lee, who tricked him in the first land rush, is on trial for her wayward conduct in Osage Sabra, like other women, is eager to have Dixie put in prison, but Cravat hastens to the court and offers Dixie his services as counsel and finally wins an acquittal for her.In a previous episode, Cravat is asked to read the church services. There is no place of worship, so the biggest building in the community is sought. It is a gambling hall, with grotesque pictures on the wall. Lon Yountis, who is responsible for the death of the first editor who came to the territory, is at the service, and Cravat seizes that occasion to denounce the murderer. Quick as a flash the repellent Yountis pulls the trigger of his pistol, but like Wild Bill Hickok's victims, he is not quick enough, for Cravat ducks behind the table and then sends a bullet through Yountis's heart.Cravat has other encounters, where it appears almost as though he alone fights a whole band of desperadoes. And when he kills the Kid, who had been his companion on other jaunts, he regrets that he had to do it.There are moments when one may feel that Mr. Ruggles banks too much on Cravat's unerring aim, but it is pardonable license and last night's gathering was never quite sure whether Cravat would lay his man low or himself meet an untimely end. He is winged in one encounter, which is rather clever, for in spite of Cravat's charmed life, until a closing scene, one feels that after all he might be a target for some desperado's weapon.The changes in the scenes as the community grows are done with a great deal of artistry. The place that was nothing but a scene with people erecting wooden shacks finally becomes a hustling modern town. And through it all one sees Sabra and The Wigwam, as the newspaper is called. There is the stuttering printer, who toward the end asserts that he has been forty years with The Wigwam, the longest time he has held any job! In the course of this lengthy film Cravat reveals his tolerance, not only in the case of Dixie Lee, but also when his son becomes enamored of an Indian girl. His editorial in favor of the redskin, which was frowned upon at first by his wife, is eventually reprinted every anniversary of its appearance, and when Cravat is away for several years, his name still stands at the masthead of The Wigwam.In harking back over this picture one is tempted to describe one of the sequences and then revert to Yancey Cravat, for some further deed of his that escaped the mind for the moment is remembered. And toward the close of the picture the spectator will in all probability find himself waiting to catch the last glimpse of Cravat, gray, wrinkled and aged, the victim of an accident.Irene Dunne is excellent as Sabra. Edna May Oliver furnishes some really clever comedy. Estelle Taylor does good acting as Dixie Lee. Stanley Fields gives a steady and convincing performance as Lon Yountis.

Stone, Stanley Fields, Robert McWade, Edna May Oliver, Frank Darien, Dolores Brown, Gloria Vonic, Otto Hoffman, William Orlamond, Frank Beal, Nancy Dover, Helen Parrish, Donald Dilloway, Reginald Streeter and others, based on Edna Ferber's novel of the same title, directed by Wesley Ruggles.

80-> THE SCREEN; Her Loyal Daughter. A German Danton. Movietone News. On Other Screens.
A flaxen-haired Joan Crawford is the principal figure in "This Modern Age," a pictorial attraction now at the Capitol. It is a film story which glides along merrily most of the time, but now and again it has its off moments.The main reason for the title is a carefree young man named Tony, who is given to reckless driving and drinking. In fact he is never actually sober, and occasionally he is beheld in his evening clothes at high noon making a call on his friends. Apparently he would sooner give a bottle of wine to a girl than a bouquet of flowers. Monroe Owsley does exceedingly well by the part of Tony.As for Miss Crawford, she gives a better portrayal here than she has in any of her previous talking pictures. As Valentine Winters she succeeds in being quite convincing in cheery and serious moments. A further asset to this production is Pauline Frederick, who figures as Diane, Valentine's divorced mother, who until the closing scenes is the mistress of a Frenchman named André de Graignon.Valentine turns up in Paris to see her mother, after being for many years in the custody of her father. It is not until the climax is reached that she learns of her mother's relations with de Graignon.An instance of implausibility is where Valentine first meets Bob, a Harvard football player and the son of well-to-do, conservative parents. Tony and Valentine are in an automobile which turns turtle after a crash. Bob, who is in another car, helps Valentine to crawl out of the wrecked conveyance. She talks to Bob as though nothing untoward had happened and a few moments later she thinks of Tony. No sooner is his name mentioned than the inebriated young man extricates himself from the overturned automobile. All thought of the accident is quickly dismissed, as neither Tony nor Valentine is hurt. But it is quite plain that cupid has scored, for from then on the narrative is chiefly concerned with the love affair between Valentine and Bob.When Bob and his father and mother go to see Valentine and Diane, their quiet game of bridge is rudely interrupted by Tony bursting into the house. He is followed by a group of friends, all presumably the worse for wine. Then there is trouble from de Graignon and the truth comes out concerning Diane. But the shadow-story tellers, as might be surmised, find a way to end matters satisfactorily.Neil Hamilton does very well as the noble Bob and Albert Conti rises to what is demanded of him as de Graignon.Nicholas Grinde, director of this picture, has done splendid work by his comedy, but his serious interludes might have been handled more effectively.Chester Hale's stage contribution, "Going! Going! Gone!" has some glamorous scenes and several good numbers.

Albert ContiMarie . . . . . Adrienne d'AmbricourtAlyce . . . . . Marcelle CordayThe shade of Georges Jacques Danton is visiting New York for the third time in recent years. Speaking fluent German through the medium of Fritz Kortner, one of Germany's best stage and screen actors, the great orator is expounding the epoch-making theories of the French Revolution from the screen of the Cameo Theatre.Beginning with scenes within and without the Club of Jacobins, of which Danton became president in January, 1793, the film carries the spectators through the high lights of the revolution until the voice of one of its most ardent champions was silenced by the guillotine on April 5, 1794. In showing the functioning of that dread instrument and the rolling of the tumbrels bearing its victims through the streets of Paris, the producers have displayed laudable restraint. In fact, all through the picture the atmosphere, while highly charged with revolutionary excitement and mob passion, is free from extravagant ferocity and maudlin sentimentality.The grimness of the story is but slightly relieved by occasional light features, such as when the commander of the German forces outside of Paris with whom Danton is negotiating to prevent a march on the capital of the republic laughs to scorn the idea that German troops could ever be contaminated by the thought of revolution. At this point Schiller's writings are brought in by Danton to prove his contention, but the Duke of Coburg fails to be at all impressed. The flash-backs from revolutionary happenings and mob scenes to aristocrats dancing, playing cards and otherwise pursuing the more or less even tenor of their way, are especially effective.Herr Kortner is convincing in his role, although he is hardly ugly enough to correspond to the traditional picture of the great tribune of the people. Lucie Mannheim is appealing as the aristocrat won by Danton for his second wife in his rough-and-ready way in the midst of the revolution. The parts of Robespierre, Marat, Saint-Just and Desmoulins are well taken and Herr Stahl-Nachbaur lends a certain dignity to Louis Capet before the convention which condemned him to death.

188-> THE SCREEN; Another Mark Twain Classic.
Those clever juvenile players who delighted audiences throughout this country and in other lands by their fine portrayals in the film of "Tom Sawyer" are to be seen at the Paramount in a pictorial version of another Mark Twain classic, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." It is an offering which will be heartily welcomed, in spite of changes due to the demands of the screen, by all admirers of the great American humorist.As in the production "Tom Sawyer," Junior Durkin impersonates Huckleberry Finn, Jackie Coogan acts Tom Sawyer. Jackie Searl impersonates Sid Sawyer and Mitzi Green, now as a blonde, undertakes the rôle of the flirtatious little Becky Thatcher.One of the early incidents is concerned with Huckleberry Finn's experiences at school, where all the pupils are far younger than he. He has his troubles not only in "bounding Pennsylvania," but also in spelling the name of that State. He is better at drawing than at geography or spelling, but he is thoroughly in his element when it comes to expected piratical adventures.Tom Sawyer's penchant for Becky's company is responsible for a coldness between Huckleberry Finn and himself, but when Tom hears that his comrade has disappeared his demeanor toward Becky undergoes a decided change. There is the episode wherein Huckleberry Finn's vagabond father forces his son to accompany him to a deserted shack, but Huck eventually outwits his parent, and once again Tom and Huck have a thrilling adventure on a raft. It is when they are on the river that the gamblers, thrown off the steamboat, are rescued by the boys. They are much impressed by the grownups, who pose as a king and the Duke of Bilgewater.Although Huck and Tom have differences of opinion after they have volunteered to get their "noble" friends food, they battle together to protect the box containing money which is hidden in one of the many barrels of apples in the cellar.Before this exciting exploit, the boys do their best to hide food from their young hostess, Mary Jane, but, as is not unexpected, Tom's stupidity in putting the better part of his meal on the floor is taken advantage of by a dog.The boys change their opinion concerning girls toward the end, for Huck, who looks with affectionate eyes upon Mary Jane, admits that, while girls are in the way when one goes fishing, one does not always want to go fishing. This appears to be a relief to Tom, who is obviously quite prepared to ask Becky's forgiveness for his angry words to her.Master Coogan does quite well with his rôle. Young Durkin is capital, and he actually looks like the illustrations of Huck. Jackie Searl gets in a few effective digs, but he is not as much in evidence as he was in "Tom Sawyer." Mitzi Green is a little too much the actress. Warner Richmond is fair as Huck's father. Clara Blandwick is again an excellent Aunt Polly. Jane Darwell appears as the Widow Douglas. Eugene Palette and Oscar Apfel are splendid as the gamblers. Charlotte V. Henry does well as Mary Jane.

Frank McGlynnWill Rogers made the Roxy spectators forget the scorching sun outside yesterday afternoon by his performance in a humorous picture called "Young As You Feel," an adaptation of George Ade's play, "Father and the Boys," which was directed by Frank Borzage, who was responsible for the cowboy comedian's first Fox production, "They Had to See Paris.""Young As You Feel," which has its quota of laughable incidents and merry patter, gives Mr. Rogers the opportunity of disporting himself as a fashion-plate. In some respects this picture recalls Mr. Arliss's "The Millionaire," for Lemuel Morehouse (Mr. Rogers), who runs a packing house, after being introduced as a punctillious dyspeptic, turns to night clubs and the races and leaves the screen feeling so full of vim that he declares his epitaph will be "Died in his infancy."His inspiration for abandoning business and seeking enjoyment is Fleurette, a singer, impersonated by Fifi Dorsay, for whom he has a Platonic friendship, although his sons, Tom and Billy, fear the worst when they hear that their father has eloped in an airplane with her.In the introductory scenes Morehouse permits his sons to lead a happy existence, while he is tied to his office desk. In the end, the young men are forced to attend to business while their father takes in sporting events and trips the light fantastic far into the night.In the course of the yarn Morehouse outwits a swindler, who turns from spurious art works to real estate, and although Fleurette gives her hero a resounding kiss toward the close of the picture, she does so in the presence of the young man whom she refers to as "my 'usband."Mr. Rogers has his fun with the Greenwich village ilk, who are heard ejaculating, "The beauty of its ugliness," as they gaze upon a statue called "Death of a Faun," a title which elicits several caustic comments from Morehouse. Toward the end of this adventure, he mocks the art worshippers when he unveils two big stones, which he chooses to call "Death of Another Faun."As in some of his previous films, Mr. Rogers occasionally forgets his lines, but he nevertheless succeeds in adding something that causes them to be just as effective. In the greater part of this film he wears faultlessly-cut clothes, including a dress suit with a silk hat and a gray tail coat. He has also the faculty of seeming to enjoy his acting in this production.Miss Dorsay succeeds in adding to the amusement and she sings a couple of songs. Brandon Hurst gives a good portrayal as Morehouse's butler. Lucien Littlefield does well in a minor rôle. Donald Dillawayand Terrance Ray acquit themselvesfavorably as Morehouse's sons. John T. Murray, Dorothy and Rose Gregson, and C. Henry Gordon also rise to what is demanded of them.

211-> Life With the Salesmen.
Traveling salesmen trip their passing whimseys over the screen of the Mayfair this week. Fast trains see them playing poker in the club car. Detroit sees them discussing those professional attributes of "tough prospects." And then—when darkness falls—the hotels play their hosts, providing both the scene and the ice for what in indubitably entertainment. And the rooms, and the darkness—and the entertainment—give something else; motivation for a shooting.Used as they are to vaudeville and to song and story, the embattled class of the salesmen might not view "Traveling Husbands" with so much alarm. Their lives are not those of Hymie, Ben, Joe and Barry, but their realization of that fact may not be universal. Possibly they should visit the Mayfair, while waiting for "tough prospects" to receive them, and go away and thereafter be more kindly to their wives. For that, if anything, is the moral of the film.This particular epic of the salesmen does have its moments, to be sure. As literary life has long viewed them—see all the legends—so does "Traveling Husbands." There are snatches of comedy and glimpses of the summery sort of entertainment before the shooting; and, indeed, some of them afterward. But when drama creeps in with the attempted murder, and love is duly blamed, the affair becomes—well, a "tough prospect." On the whole, it will not be remembered when all other pictures are forgotten.Evelyn Brent takes the part of Ruby, whose knowledge of life is more certain than her aim with a pistol. Frank Albertson is the young salesman whose endeavors to "sell" the unfriendly J. C. Wilson lands him into both the arms of the law and love—and ultimately out of the former. Constance Cummings is the young girl, the daughter of J. C., and Spencer Charters and Hugh Herbert provide "Traveling Husbands" more definite comedy.Elsewhere on the Mayfair's program is a "Vagabond" trip to Haiti, a cartoon, a comedy and the current events in the news. TRAVELING HUSBANDS, based on a story by Humphrey Pearson; directed by Paul Sloane; a Radio Picture. At the Mayfair.Ruby . . . . . Evelyn BrentBarry . . . . . Frank AlbertsonEllen . . . . .

712-> THE SCREEN; A "Mystery" Ship.
With Maurice Chevalier appearing in person on the stage, rendering in his inimitable fashion songs in French and English, and Donald Ogden Stewart's farce, "Finn and Hattie," on the screen, the Paramount now is the house of laughter. M. Chevalier won hearty applause and soon after he had disappeared through the curtains the spectators were bubbling with merriment over the actions of Leon Errol, Mitzi Green, Zasu Pitts, Jackie Searl and Lilyan Tashman in the talking picture which was directed by Norman Taurog and Norman McLeod.Finley P. Haddock (Mr. Errol), his wife, impersonated by Miss Pitts, and Mildred, their daughter, played by Mitzi Green, are first beheld leaving their Main Street for Paris. One of the first bits of comedy is where Haddock discovers that the brakeman in the club car is quite an expert in wrestling. Haddock is the proud possessor of a medal, which he wears on his watch fob and which he boasts is also for wrestling. The result is that the two men in the otherwise unoccupied car decide to test their prowess and it is not long before Mr. Haddock is ignominously thrown. This is accomplished cleverly and when Mr. Haddock feels that he has had enough of being hurled to the floor, the brakeman undertakes to initiate the panting Haddock into the art of jiu jitsu and once again the Main Street magnate is hurled to the carpet.At the hotel in New York the Haddocks encounter Sidney, portrayed by Jackie Searl, who did so well in a rôle of the same name in "Tom Sawyer." As a preliminary to a feud between the two children, Sidney slaps Mildred's face and from then on the girl makes Sidney pay and pay.In addition to the boisterous children, there are the Princess, played by Miss Tashman, and Collins, impersonated by Regis Toomey, who think that it will be a comparatively easy matter to swindle Haddock out of $50,000. And it might have been if Mildred had not been gifted with unusual perspicacity. It is Mildred who by a ruse recovers the alleged love letter her father had written and it is also she who in a wild struggle snatches a check for the equivalent in francs of $50,000, which Haddock had made out to the Princess.Sometimes the comedy in this picture is very effective, but during some interludes it is somewhat lame. Toward the close there is the mirthful manner in which Mildred gets hold of the Princess's check, while in an adjoining room Sidney is left balancing a gold-fish bowl on a stick and blowing a whistle.On boarding the steamship for France, Mrs. Haddock is a victim of seasickness, owing to the rough weather. In vain does her husband explain that the ship has not left the dock. Mrs. Haddock believes that she is about to leave this earth.Mr. Errol is splendid, but he might have been asked to forego the smashing of another costly vase, a similar stunt to that which he did in "One Heavenly Night." Mitzi Green makes things thoroughly uncomfortable for Sidney, but she is a trifle too precocious, due chiefly to the dialogue and the direction. Jackie Searl reveals himself to be a clever little actor, but he is also a victim of the lines allotted to him. Miss Pitts is excellent. Mack Swain affords chuckles as a Frenchman with a long beard and no necktie, the lack of which arouses Haddock's keen interest. Harry Beresford officiates as a street cleaner who is introduced ceremoniously to the Haddocks by their taxi driver. He tells the Haddocks that he and his wife could never live anywhere else but New York."Finn and Hattie" is an adaptation of Mr. Stewart's book, "Mr. and Mrs. Haddock Abroad." The film is also on view at the Brooklyn Paramount. "Mr. and Mrs. Haddock Abroad."FINN AND HATTIE, with Leon Errol, Mitzi Green, Zasu Pitts, Jackie Searl, Lilyan Tashman, Mack Swain, Regls Toomey and Harry Beresford, based on a novel by Donald Ogden Stewart, directed by Norman Taurog and Norman McLeod; Maurice Chevalier, in person; Boris Petroff's stage contribution, "Vagabond Trails," with the Gypsy singers and others. At the Paramount.A highly fictional conception of the fighting between mystery ships and submarines during the World War is now on exhibition at the Roxy. It is called "Seas Beneath," and while it has its surprising and mayhap unconsciously amusing moments for officers and men of Uncle Sam's Navy, its melodramatic incidents and voluble comedy afforded entertainment at an early showing yesterday.It is not a picture to be taken very seriously, so far as war activities are concerned, for no mystery ship could ever have survived long in such circumstances. All its action is theatric in the extreme, without much thought being given to the necessary conduct aboard such craft, as revealed in Admiral Gordon Campbell's book, "My Mystery Ships."It rather reminds one of an Edgar Wallace melodrama with the sea instead of the land for a background. Yet it is endowed with competent acting, excellent photography and some compelling scenes of submarines and ships.George O'Brien impersonates Commander Robert Kingsley of the United States Navy. He is the skipper of a mystery ship which eventually puts into a neutral port, where German U-boat officers succeed in gaining admittance. Marion Lessing portrays Anna-Maria Yon Steuben, a German agent, who is eager to have the American vessel sunk by her brother's submarine. In the course of the adventures ashore, one of the American officers is drugged and he misses his ship. He covers himself with glory, however, before he is shot, by setting fire to a German craft.Commander Kingsley has his "panic" crew, most of whom get away from their ship in a boat while others make spectacular dives into the sea. Kingsley awaits the submarine with his special crew around him instead of having them at their posts. But when the time comes for sinking the U-172, the mystery ship is successful, with, if memory serves correctly, one shot.Although it has not the reprehensible actions or the bickering rivals of "The Cock-Eyed World," this melodrama sometimes recalls that film of the past.George O'Brien does quite well. Walter C. Kelly figures as Mike Costello, who takes war in a humorous fashion. Henry Victor gives a good performance as a German submarine commander.As a tribute to the memory of the late Anna Pavlowa, there is an impressive number on the surrounding program called "The Dancer." "Winter Gaieties" is another colorful contribution to this section of the program. A "Mystery" Ship.SEAS BENEATH, with George O'Brien, Marion Lessing, Warren Hymer, Walter C.

989-> THE SCREFN; A Mighty Failure. A Comic Botany Student.
After an absence of nearly ten months from the screen the stalwart figure of George Bancroft is to be seen at the Paramount in "Rich Man's Folly," the narrative of which is said to have been suggested, but only suggested, by Dickens's "Dombey and Son." There is nothing here that savors of Dickens's style nor are the incidents handled so that they arouse any great interest or even curiosity. In fact the development, the direction and the acting are as hard and mechanical as the strange nature of Brock Trumbull, whom Mr. Bancroft impersonates.Pathos is attempted here and there, but it is no more moving than Trumbull's irrational antics toward the close of the proceedings are exciting. It is a tale that strikes one as though all the episodes had been voted upon at a conference, when the various ideas sounded more logical than they are in pictured form. There is hardly anything that happens that does not suggest the carpenter rather than the writer and Trumbull's selfish ambitions are harped upon until one feels that the film is little more than a test of patience.When Trumbull knocks men right and left and opens the sea-cocks on a ship that is about to be launched, one rather expects that he will meet his own doom. But no, Mr. Trumbull lives to see days of peace, when he learns that there is something more in this world than power, tradition and money. And, while he does not in the least deserve it, he is privileged to enjoy the company of his grandchildren.In the beginning, Trumbull, the power of powers in ship building, revels in dominating others. His employes are exhorted not to even think for a moment that his wife is going to give birth to another girl. The child must be a boy and that is the question uppermost in his mind. A boy it is and this unnatural father makes no inquiry concerning the condition of the mother. She is, as one suspects, dying and evidently glad to pass away. His wife's death is made little of by Trumbull, who revels in the boy she has left him. As for his daughter Anne, he shows no affection for her. Time rolls by and Brock Junior is 8 years old, the apple of his father's eye. Trumbull and Son is the name of the firm as it had been for generations and the boy is to christen one of the newly constructed vessels. It is raining, a motion picture rain, and the boy catches cold and eventually dies.Trumbull wants no comfort from Anne, so he sends her to school. He decides to leave his ship-building yard to his general manager and go to Europe. Anne eventually falls in love with Joe Warren, one of the minor men in the ship-building business, who is pooh-poohed at by Trumbull. The big man comes back to create more disturbance. He wrests a contract from Warren, marries a blonde, to whom he gives $250,000 as a wedding gift, and then, when his mind becomes unhinged, is bent on destruction. Of course any two men could have stayed him from what he does, but that would have made the sequence natural.Part of this picture is maudlin, part is annoying and most of it is hopelessly illogical. However, Mr. Bancroft is the same tower of strength he was in his old silent film, "The Pony Express," but one does not feel that his performance in this up-to-date work is anything like as impressive as that offering of the old days.Those who do as well as possible considering the dialogue and action, are Frances Dee, who appears as Anne; Robert Ames as Warren, David Durand as Brock Jr. and Gilbert Emery as a steamship owner.Besides the conductor, Rubinoff, there is on the surrounding program a revue called "Paramount on Parade," in which the principals are Kate Smith, Bing Crosby and the Mills Brothers. A Mighty Failure.RICH MAN'S FOLLY, suggested by Dickens's "Dombey and Son"; directed by John Cromwell; produced by Paramount Publix.

William ArnoldWith half a dozen songs and a chorus of Broadway co-eds, "Local Boy Makes Good" might be a passably diverting musical comedy of life among the college boys. It romps in familiar fields, led by a bashful student of botany. He works in a bookstore and look timorously at the world through horn-rimmed glasses. And, yes—he is afraid of girls. At carefully spaced intervals the picture throws a good laugh or two out into the audience. The in-between stretches, which the musical comedy would fill with its songs and girls, are left to take care of themselves in the Strand's new occupant. Mathematically speaking, "Local Boy Makes Good" spreads a half hour's worth of amusement through an hour and a quarter.Joe E. Brown is a good comedian, given half a chance, and he is just as funny as his material permits him to be. When he staggers into the stadium for the relay race, filled with rubbing alcohol and a new spirit of independence, he inspires as explosive a round of chortles as the average constitution can stand.The story carries the young botanist into an affair with a girl from the rival college. He writes passionate notes to her, describing himself as the star athlete of his school. A mischievous joker mails one of the letters, and the spectacle one finds himself facing shameful exposure. It is as routine—a college story as that.The production is attractively photographed and staged. The cast, in rôles that are necessarily minor, provide fair enough foils for Mr. Brown. The surrounding program contains the latest item in S. S. Van Dine's mystery series and a Grantland Rice Sportlight, "Pig-Skin Progress."

1037-> 'East Side, West Side.'
The scrawl of black skyline in the evening seen from the Hudson or the East River is New York's signature, a perpetually exciting thing. John Breen, in the new Hippodrome feature, based on Felix Riesenberg's "East Side, West Side," looks at it from a river barge and dreams of what lies underneath the scribble of great rooftops. After his mother dies and he knows that the drunken bargeman is not his real father, he slips off into the river and swims toward the city. Seen as a symbol of all the young men who come to New York in a spirit of high adventure, John Breen is an interesting character and the story of his obsession with the skyline is a sturdy subject for a motion picture. In "Skyline" the theme is treated with enough imagination to make a rather effective entertainment and not a great deal else.John Breen hangs around construction gangs and watches the scaffolding of new skyscrapers rising up until he wins his chance. His idol, the celebrated builder, James McClellan, puts him to work shoveling gravel and later introduces him to Park Avenue and Columbia University. He brings the boy to live with him and takes a fatherly interest in his career.Thereafter "Skyline" is more concerned with the drama of the boy and his unknown father and his little Irish sweetheart, and a temptress, than with builders and skyscrapers. The finale is a maze of misunderstanding and reconciliation in which the skyline is blurred out of focus. That seemed a disappointment after the vivid opening scenes, but the applause that greeted the end was not without enthusiasm. At that, "Skyline" is different, and that is something.The players do their work competently. Hardie Albright plays the rôle of John Breen with a proper enthusiasm. Maureen O'Sullivan is a pretty sweetheart and Myrna Loy, in a new blonde coiffure, is effective. Thomas Meighan is sincere in the rôle of the architect, the father who dare not know his son. SKYLINE, based on a novel by Felix Reisenberg; directed by Sam Taylor; produced by the Fox Film Corporation. At the Hippodrome.James McClellan . . . . . Thomas MeighanJohn Breen . . . . .

1131-> A $650,000 BUNDLE OF LAUGHTER; Noel Coward's "Private Lives" Turned Into an Effervescent Film Comedy--Miss Swanson's Amusing Picture--Other Offerings "In a Swiss Chalet." Their Elopement. The Prima Donna's Mistake. "Sooky." Strange People.
IT may be assumed that Noel Coward little thought when he finished writing his play, "Private Lives," that some day a film producer would spend $650,000 on transferring it to the screen. The principals in this excellent picture are Norma Shearer and Robert Montgomery, two of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular players, and the director was Sidney Franklin, who can usually be relied upon to make an intelligent and interesting production.The story is decidedly light, but through the author's bright lines, most of which are to be heard in the shadow version, it kept audiences at the Capitol in a constant state of merriment. Mr. Franklin has been alert enough to take advantage of the camera's scope in many scenes, and he also reveals that he has a keen sense of humor.To give audiences an extra good laugh, Mr. Franklin shows Amanda Prynne (Miss Shearer) and Elyot Chase (Mr. Montgomery) doing a little mountain climbing. It is true that at moments this particular sequence is a trifle too farcical, particularly when Amanda leans over what looks to be a mountain ledge to give her former husband a kiss. However, this comes under the formula of entertainment, which could readily be appreciated from the effect it had upon the audience."In a Swiss Chalet."But the outstanding episodes are those in a Swiss chalet, which in the play took place in Amanda's apartment in Paris. This slight change of locale is of small importance and the scenes are so well done that it is quite helpful to the picture. The alternating tempests and cooing between Amanda and Elyot are accomplished very much after the manner of the play, a few lines of which have been eliminated because they might cause censorial frowns.This is another example of the improvement which speech has wrought in the screen for it is safe to assert, that without Mr. Coward's dialogue the film story would not have amounted to very much, as only occasional fragments of the lines could have been used through the medium of titles.One might also hazard again that talking pictures are improving the popular taste, for it invariably happens that when a producer nowadays underestimates the intelligence of his audiences the film is a financial failure. This is decidedly heartening and the time may come when the love scenes are more restrained than they are even in this current study. But the few violent embraces here are to be excused because of the style of this rollicking affair.Their Elopement.It may be recalled that Amanda and Elyot, who have been divorced five years, encounter each other on the Riviera in adjacent apartments, she with a new husband and he with a new wife. In spite of their being on a second honeymoon, Amanda and Elyot soon decide that they will elope, leaving the second Mrs. Chase—the sobbing Sybil—and the emphatic Victor Prynne to sympathize with each other.After that there is a subtitle, in this sophisticated froth, none other than "Came the Dawn," and Amanda and her ex-spouse are beheld somewhere in the Alps, one moment speaking glowing words of love and admiration for each other and the next having a regular cat-and-dog fight. Prior to leaving the Riviera they arrange that "Solomon Isaac," spoken by either of them during a spat, shall mean a truce, or two minutes of silence. This exclamation is finally shortened to "Sollocks," which happens to be the name of the nearest railroad station to their abode in the Alps.The ejaculation of this word has the desired effect on all occasions except one, which is when Amenda is so infuriated with Elyot that she smashes a phonograph record over his head. This causes Elyot to slap Amanda's face, but it is not long before they conclude, after the arrival of Victor and Sibyl in Switzerland, that they are at least more compatible than they would be with their more recent partners.The closing scene in a railroad coach is nicely done. Another outburst between Amanda and Elyot has started when the conductor announces, "Sollocks—two minutes." It is enough to bring about a period of peace, but for how long one knows not.In one hectic scene it seems as though the powers of the microphone were taxed either by the speed of the utterances or through the loud tones.Miss Shearer has charm and vivacity and she speaks her lines with capital control. Mr. Montgomery is at his best after the Swiss sequence is reached. Una Merkel does her share in furnishing amusement. This Sibyl is moved to tears when she discovers that her Elyot has left her, and Reginald Denny as Victor looks to be in a daze as he realizes that he is in the same boat as Sibyl. Mr. Denny does well by his rôle. Jean Hersholt is beheld in the minor part of an Alpine guide.It is a handsomely staged production, with several impressive outdoor glimpses. Every detail has received punctilious attention, even to a right hand drive on a foreign car. The train scene looks as though it might be in Europe, and, while there is a great deal of trick camera work, it is cleverly done.The Prima Donna's Mistake.MISS SWANSON chose an amusing if utterly implausible story when she picked the Hungarian play "Tonight or Never." The picture, which is now at the Rialto, has been cast carefully, five of the players acting the same rôles they had in the play. Although Miss Swanson's portrayal does not equal that of Helen Gahagan before the footlights, she, in spite of a monotone quality in her diction, succeeds in helping along the general amusement.Melvyn Douglas plays the part of the Unknown Gentleman, who is supposed by Nella Vago (Miss Swanson) to be a gigolo. Mr. Douglas gives a sterling performance. Nella is a temperamental diva and Rudig (Ferdinand Gottschalk), her singing teacher, is of the opinion that her voice is cold and soulless. He thinks that she ought to have a love affair. At the moment, Count Albert is her chief admirer, but, after having succeeded in helping Nella along in the operatic world, he is wont to pay court to other singers.Jim, as the Unknown Gentleman is alluded to most of the time, is smitten with Nella. He stands outside her window and the length of time he has been there is told through the number of cigarette ends on the pavement near him. The first scenes are in Venice and then one is taken to Budapest, where the prattling and credulous Rudig discovers that the devoted Jim is sharing an apartment with a Marchesa who is presumed to be posing as the young man's aunt. Nella has not met Jim up to that time, but she manages to make his acquaintance by calling at his apartment and saying that she is looking for somebody else.When the handsome Jim hears that he is thought by the charming prima donna to be a gigolo, he pretends that it is the truth and, although Nella is somewhat disappointed, she, nevertheless, finds Jim so agreeable that she falls in love with him. This affair of the heart is supposed to cause Nella to sing with warmth and fervor. She even attracts the attention of an impresario from New York, a Mr. Fletcher, who sends her a contract to go to the Metropolitan.To say more than this would spoil the story for those who do not already know it. This picture is exceptionally well staged, the settings having been designed by Willy Pogany. Miss Swanson looks most attractive in Mlle. Chanel's graceful sartorial creations."Sooky."ALTHOUGH there are some amusing incidents in "Sooky," the sequel to that clever picture "Skippy," there are also some dull ones, where the producers are too eager to draw tears. Skippy, Sooky and Sid are again seen in the persons of those youngsters, Jackie Cooper, Bobby Coogan and Jackie Searl.Skippy in this film, which is an adaptation of Percy Crosby's book, "Dear Sooky," is not the wholehearted boy he was in the previous picture. While he is devoting his time to punching Sid, the commander of a uniformed force known as the Boone Boys, or when he is getting up in the morning, he is like the Skippy of old, but when he becomes so filled with sympathy for Sooky and Sooky's mother, the episodes are rather maudlin.There is a suggestion of "Tom Sawyer" in parts of this film and in other sequences one is reminded of Dickens's "The Christmas Carol" and also of "Skippy." But none of it is nearly as pleasing as its forerunner.Skippy here has a dislike for shower baths and he argues with his father, Dr. Skinner, before taking his morning wash. He considers getting under the shower just about the same as being sent out in the rain without his clothes. But while this scene has its whimsical touches, it is not comparable to those in "Skippy," where the youngster gives himself a lick and a promise in the morning and carefully wets his tooth brush, so that his mother will think he has cleaned his teeth.Notwithstanding its feeble spots, and there are many, the acting of the three little lads is really remarkable. Jackie Cooper is especially convincing both in the laughable and the sentimental chapters. Master Coogan is very appealing and he creates some fun by his sturdy attempts to blow a bugle. Jackie Scarl succeeds in much the same fashion as he did in the film of "Tom Sawyer." In fact his part is still called Sidney. He has that sneer and telltale proclivities that infuriate Skippy.Strange People.THE picturization of Ben Lucien Burman's novel, "Mississippi," is a lethargic tale of floating shanty dwellers in the lower Mississippi country. It has, however, been admirably directed and the performances of Lew Ayres, Anita Louise, Harry Beresford and Elizabeth Patterson are very true to life. But with all its good qualities, it is problematical if it makes a good entertainment for anybody who has not encountered these squatters, whose belief in spirits, strange superstitions, their lack of imagination, their melancholy singing and their fiery hatreds are set forth in a knowledgeful fashion by Russell Mack, the director.It is a story of an old Mississippi steamboat captain named Lilly, who, having killed a man, adopts his victim's child. When the grown-up boy, referred to as States, discovers that Lilly is not his father he is very bitter and there ensues a series of events which include the smashing of States's shanty by Captain Lilly, a challenge from States to Lilly to fight a duel and finally episodes wherein Lilly wins States's favor and Towhead (Miss Louise) is on her way to become States's wife.One moment a man points a gun at Captain Lilly and misses. Then States fires at the object moving in the weeds and wings his man, a fellow called Chicken Sam, who, after receiving first aid from States, takes his vengeance by informing the lad that Lilly is not his father.According to one of the characters, an elderly woman known as Vergie, it is preferable to live a distance from the Court House, for the spirits are more accessible in the country than they are in town. In one scene Towhead seeks the help of a medium in trying to win States's affection.It is all pretty glum, in spite of the capable direction and the good work of the players.
