96-> The Screen: Travelogue; Caravan to Russia' Arrives at Cameo
"CARAVAN TO RUSSIA," which arrived Saturday at the Cameo, is hardly that. This is a tame little color travelogue of only mild interest, considering its feature length.Photographed and narrated by Paul Delmer, a British journalist, the picture very unpretentiously records the highlights of a sixteen-week trailer trip by Mr. Delmer, his wife and three children. The excursion must have been a pleasant one but, judging by what we see here, not especially fascinating.With Mr. Delmer supplying a cordial, rather homespun, narration, the footage follows the family from Moscow to Yalta and back. Mr. Delmer is an able photographer. Unfortunately, many of the family stop-offs have been visited before by expert Soviet camera men.This is particularly noticeable during the entire Moscow portion, for instance. Most of the picture simply shows the Delmers gliding over various changing countrysides, continually chatting with friendly Russians, and now and then looking in on a school, factory or national shrine.Far and away the most absorbing portion is a visit with Mr. and Mrs. Paul Robeson in Yalta, a seaside resort that steals the show. The close glimpses of the noted singer, as he relaxes in a garden and gives a concert for children, show a tired, determined-looking man.Mr. Delmer ends his travelogue with a brief speech contending that the Soviet Union and the United States can and must live in peace. Fair enough, but the picture Mr. Delmer brought back is as unenlightening as it is unstudied. CARAVAN TO RUSSIA, a traveloge in color, photographed, directed and produced by Paul Delmer; presented by Paul Delmer Associates of London. At the Cameo Theatre, Eighth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street. Running time: eighty minutes.

372-> Screen: 'Glass Tower'; German Film Opens at 72d St. Playhouse
MUCH ado about a woman who wants to resume a career on the stage while her rich industrialist husband wants her to stay home and be his idle wife is made in the German film, "The Glass Tower" ("Der Glaserne Turm") which came to the Seventy-second Street Playhouse yesterday. The production and acting are superior, but the issue is flimsy and banal.For nigh on an hour and three-quarters, Lilli Palmer effectively performs this lovely and sensitive woman who yearns to be free to express the things that her autocratic husband, O. E. Hasse, has striven to suppress. And for a part of that time, Herr Hasse looms like a rock in her way, with a jealous eye cast in the direction of a handsome playwright, Peter Van Eyck.Eventually, Herr Hasse makes a desperate and, to our way of thinking, foolish attempt to settle the whole silly business, and that throws the case into the courts, where a bit of manufactured melodrama sets Miss Palmer free. The issue is one that might more fittingly have turned up on daytime radio.As for Herr Hasse's rash maneuver, it only goes to show that big important business magnates often lack theatrical sense. Had he looked for a couple of minutes at the rehearsals of Mr. Van Eyck's play, he would have guessed that the best cure for his wife's itch was to let her go on in it.If we ever saw the makings of a ripe flop, we see them plainly here. We'd give it two weeks at the Berlin Schiller Theatre. Then we'd bet you that the wife would come home to her beautiful, comfortable penthouse and her heavily sugared spouse! The CastTHE GLASS TOWER (Der Glaserne Turm), scenario by Wolfgang Koppen; directed by Harald Braun; produced in Germany by Bavaria-Filmkunst, A. G.; an Ellis Films release presented by Essex Universal. At the Seventy-second Street Playhouse, East of second Avenue. Running time: 104 minutes.Katja Fleming . . . . .

WE must now face the fact that Germany's appealing 20-year-old Romy Schneider is destined to take her place in the galaxy of important international film stars. On the basis of "Scampolo," a German-language comedy romance filmed in color in Italy, Miss Schneider must be adjudged a performer who can move with the best of them.The film's frankly casual situation about a homeless lass who has her first affair of the heart with a handsome and at the same time believable architect is set among the beautiful seascapes of the Isle of Ischia of Naples. The over-all effect of this pleasant and convincing comedy, which opened at the Seventy-second Street Playhouse yesterday, is also abetted by a script full of light wisdom, written by Ilse Lot-Dupont, Franz Hollering and Herbert Reinecker. But even these considerable assets must take second billing to Miss Schneider.For she performs with a marvelously self-contained energy, conveying warmth and depth in what is essentially a frivolous role as the girl of the title, whose name, Scampolo, we are told, means a leftover in Italian. Whether she is musing on her own rather forlorn state or serving as the glib guide for tourists, which is one of her several jobs, she acts with a sparkle that indicates a real star.But do not gather from this that her performance is a matter of mere chance. She and the other principals—Paul Hubschmid plays her romantic interest in the manner of Hollywood's best leading men—are under the intelligent control of Alfred Weidenmann. His direction has cinematic variety without being self-conscious. But it is in the handling of his actors that he reveals the fine sense of understatement that befits such an idyllic Mediterranean romance.Mr. Weidenmann exacts excellent performances from Georg Thomalla, as a photographer friend of the hero; Eva Maria Meinecke, as one of the photographer's associates, and Elisabeth Flicken-schildt, as a laundress who keeps a fond maternal eye on Scampolo.The scenic aspects of the film are also blended perfectly into the story. All in all, "Scampolo," despite its some-what unpromising title, is one of the more refreshing comedies to come from Germany. Miss Schneider sets the pace for a film that is as fresh as an in-shore breeze. SCAMPOLO, screen play by Ilse Lot-Dupont, Franz Hollering and Herbert Reinecker; directed and produced by Alfred Weidenmann. At the Seventy-second Street Playhouse, east of Second Avenue. Running time: 104 minutes.Scampolo . . . . . Romy SchneiderCosta . . . . . Paul HubschmidAndreas Michaelis . . . . . Georg ThomallaSabine Falconi . . . . . Eva Maria MeineckeCaesare . . . . .

984-> Screen: Post-Civil War; 'Wonderful Country' at Local Houses
IT was a pleasure yesterday to watch Tom Lea's novel "The Wonderful Country" spreading across the screen pretty much, we suspect, the way the author must have wanted it.This is a superior, intelligent film on nearly every count. Robert Mitchum, Julie London, Gary Merrill and a good supporting cast are framed against a superbly authentic landscape of the Rio Grande territory, in a faithful retelling of Mr. Lea's post-Civil War drama about an American-born "pistolero"—a hired killer in Mexico. For reasons best known to United Artists, the picture bowed at local neighborhood theatres (tied to that dog-pound fugitive, "The Hound of the Baskervilles").Mr. Mitchum is ideally cast as the hard-bitten derelict hero stealthily crossing the border in the pay of the divided Castro family, periodical rulers of his adopted land. Robert Ardrey's script, retaining the blunt Lea dialogue, carefully details the hero's precarious status as a revolutionary pawn and his tender romance with Miss London, as the wistful wife of a cold American Army officer, Mr. Merrill. Mr. Mitchum's encounters with various Mexicans and Texans, on both sides of the law, providing a compelling, colorful gallery of spokesmen for the turbulent Rio Grande territory of the Eighteen Seventies, beset with marauding Apaches.To shoot or not to shoot, that is the question—both Mr. Lea's and picture's. And unfortunately Mr. Mitchum's final decision isn't altogether convincing. A professional killer simply chucking away his six-shooter for, apparently, the love of a slightly tarnished lady? This is the one weakness of a film that substitutes irony and understanding for real depth.However, as a well-acted, introspective adventure yarn, beautifully paced by Robert Parrish's direction and magnificently evocative of the locale where it was made, this Chester Erskine production is consistently rewarding. Billowing out in the background like a full-masted schooner at sunset, the country itself is truly wonderful to behold, as framed by the color camera of Floyd Crosby. And let's not forget the art director, Harry Horner, or the film editor, Michael Luciano.The author's knowledge and love of the craggy, cactus-studded wasteland down below are resoundingly echoed by these technicians. Practically every "take" arrests the eye in tinting and detail. Some of the shots—quietly looming adobe villages, nocturnal street festival and a frenzied onslaught of Apache riders—are spine-tingling.With a theme that seems basically rather familiar ("The Gunfighter" was better), the picture has bite, restraint and true pictorial grandeur. That interesting vignettes do not culminate in unified power is certainly no fault of the cast, straight down the line.The three principals are first-rate, as are such contributors as Pedro Armendariz, Victor Mendoza, Albert Dekker, Jack Oakie, Charles McGraw and Leroy Paige (of baseball fame). Even Mr. Lea steps into the act, briefly, as a barber. Finally, Alex North's musical score is grand, as usual.But the haunting canvas of "The Wonderful Country" should have exposed more heart. Or packed a genuine wallop. Better still, both. THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY, adapted by Robert Ardrey from the novel by Tom Lea directed by Robert Parrish; produced by Chester Erskine and distributed by United Artists. At neighborhood theatres.

--------
1400-> Mistaken Identity
ONLY the most rabid fans of Alec Guinness and Bette Davis (yes, what a combination!) are going to find "The Scapegoat" fascinating, like Daphne du Maurier's novel of mistaken identity. To one viewer, who has the profoundest respect for all three, yesterday's new British arrival at the Guild seems pretentious, cold and slow-moving. Miss du Maurier's dazzlingly cunning puzzler is now a stately charade —handsome, curious and untingling.Probably nobody knows better than the author that the theme of exact look-alikes is an old one in literature and films—take "The Prisoner of Zenda," "The Prince and the Pauper" and "The Masquerader," to name only a few. Miss du Maurier brought off the trick beautifully and had the further gumption to prescribe Mr. Guinness for the double role of the hero.Basically—we repeat, basically—the plot of this Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer release remains the same as in the novel. A lonely-English bachelor-tutor, vacationing in the French provinces, is duped by a slick nobleman into heading the man's family, a group of neurotic aristocrats in a plushy chateau.It's quite a houseful. There's his bedridden, dope-craving mother, played by Miss Davis; a jittery wife, Irene Worth; a contemptuous sister-in-law, Pamela Brown, and a brooding tomboy of a daughter, Annabel Bartlett. A mistress appears (Miss du Maurier supplied two). A very obvious murder threat hovers in the air, the deed is done and, finally, the real count and his scapegoat have a bloody showdown.As produced by Michael Balcon, this is a plushy appointed tale, with some fetching glimpses of the French countryside and appropriately musty chateau interiors. The main musical theme is striking; Bronislau Kaper has snugly embellished it with his lovely little waltz from "The Glass Slipper" of several seasons back.At the same time, both the score and Robert Hamer's direction archly keep hinting at startling things about to happen. To put it bluntly, very little does happen except conversation (including Mr. Guinness' baffled asides to himself). One question never satisfactorily explained is how did the imposter's "family" get that way; Again, where are all Miss du Maurier's causes and motivations. With Gore Vidal credited for the adaptation, and Mr. Hamer for the actual scenario, it would be most interesting to know just who shed most of the original twists, turns and revelations for the surface characterizations we see here.The word for Mr. Guinness' performance (perhaps for this reason) is thoughtful. But burning through the film's rather frosty detachement is one big question. Why would a practical man, however lonely, assume responsibility for such oddballs? Miss Davis, for instance, allotted a few scenes and cackling like a wicked old parrot, should have sent the imposter running. Only Nicole Maurey, as the lovely mistress, and Geoffrey Keen, as a chauffeur, are truly "likable"—the hero's label for the family.The picture abruptly crackles to life only at the climax, when the tutor and the count have their show-down. The fade-out trick may or may not be the author's original, wonderful hammer-lock. In view of the director's deliberately teasing camera nip-ups, this spectator isn't quite sure what really did happen, or which man won. Generally, though, Miss du Maurier's devilish dynamite emerges on the screen as cloudy, suavely poured tea. THE SCAPEGOAT, adapted by Gore Vidal from the novel of Daphne du Maurier; scenario and direction by Robert Hamer; a du Maurier-Guinness Production, produced by Michael Balcon; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At the Guild Theatre, Fiftieth Street east of Sixth Avenue. Running time: ninety-two minutes.John BarrettJacques de Gue . . . . . Alec GuinnessCountess . . . . . Bette DavisBella . . . . .
