GENTLEMEN: - Being born and educated in Mobile, but now a resident of Buffalo, yet I am tenacious of my Southern principles, and have an interest in "that peculiar institution" otherwise. Allow me to say, plainly, that the most serious obstacles the Democracy have to contend with in the rural districts of the North, are some few slaveholders visiting us, and some few Fillmore speakers who are as thick as grasshoppers from the South.

If the American people value any one portion of their birthright of freedom more than another, it is the exemption they enjoy from arbitrary taxation.

At the same time, a very conciliatory dispatch is to be addressed to Lord CLARENDON, probably putting the dismissal chiefly on the ground of CRAMPTON'S personal complicity in violating our laws, instead of because the British Government paving violated our sovereignty.

The Amsterdamshe Courant contains the following: " It is well known that East Indians have many inventions unknown to Europeans, and that they possess secrets incomprehensible to us.

JOSEPH MILLER, Esq., that prolific editor and commentator, long age commemorated the joker's valet who was always accustomed to laugh before the point of the joke came in, lest afterwards he shouldn't have a chance.

COMPLETION OF THE ORGANIZATION. The organization of the House is quite complete, although the Printer is still to be elected. The handsome manner in which Hon. WM.
