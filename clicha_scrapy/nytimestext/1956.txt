123-> Screen: John Huston and Melville's White Whale; 'Moby Dick' Opens at Sutton and Criterion Gregory Peck Starred as Captain Ahab
HERMAN MELVILLE'S famous story of a man's dark obsession to kill a whale, told with tremendous range and rhetoric in his great novel, "Moby Dick," has been put on the screen by John Huston in a rolling and thundering color film that is herewith devoutly recommended as one of the great motion pictures of our times. It opened yesterday in joint bookings at the Sutton and Criterion Theatres.Readers of Melville's mighty opus will be pleased and encouraged to learn that Mr. Huston has caged its lengthy discourse in a picture that runs under two hours and pulls all its vast and murky meanings into the focusing "I" of one man.Now the intent of Captain Ahab, master of the whale ship and crew that go on a voyage to the Pacific, to fetch up with the white whale, Moby Dick, is the entire motivation of the lean and violent drama that unfolds. Ahab's consuming passion for revenge on the fabulous beast that has mutilated his body on a previous voyage and filled his soul with hate is the only inspiration conveyed to his zealous crew. And so all the deep, symbolic ponderings of human agony and fate that course through the length of Melville's saga are in this one orbit in the film.Obviously, Mr. Huston has sensed that the pull of Melville's tale is in the transcendent mysticism that he found in the vastness of the sea. The long stretches of time and empty water touched the minds of the whalemen of his day. And so Mr. Huston, as director and co-author of the script, clears his film early from New Bedford and gets it out into the sea.Tarrying in the old-time seaport (it is rightly Nantucket in the book) only long enough to set the wildness and the restlessness of his whaling crew and to sense the entanglements of commerce and pious sentiments that go with the land, he gets his ship onto the ocean and his harpooners onto a whale soon enough to make it certain that this is the area of his tale. And here he keeps it, through long watches, through terrible torments of the mind, through calms and storms, until that White Whale is finally fastened and the climax of his symphony unfolds.We use the word symphony on purpose, because the clean dramatic structure of this film and the sound and pictorial elements of it are composed like a symphony. Mr. Huston has set up his drama on strong, realistic incidents—on the killing of one whale to show the danger, on the baleful dedication of the crew, on the omens of Queequeg, on the typhoon and on the thrashing sea fights with Moby Dick. But the aim of all its careful scoring is to build up a mighty harmony of spiritual striving and failing, of hope and despair. And that it does.Space does not possibly permit us to cite all the things about this film that are brilliantly done or developed, from the strange, subdued color scheme employed to the uncommon faithfulness to details of whaling that are observed. Mr. Huston and his technicians have done a remarkable job, even though they found their New Bedford in a rather poor little Irish port and used the faces of plainly Irish women as their brief frieze of sad New Bedford wives.As to the casting and the playing, it might be remarked that Gregory Peck gives Ahab a towering, gaunt appearance that is markedly Lincolnesque, and he holds that character's burning passions behind a usually mask-like facade. We could do with a little more tempest, a little more Joshua in the role. Mr. Peck spouts fire from his nostrils only when he has at the whale.However, we like the resolute Starbuck of the obviously British Leo Genn and find humor and verve in Seamus Kelly's Flask and Harry Andrew's Stubb. Friedrich Ledebur's Queequeg is a delightfully grotesque presentation of Melville's Marquesan harpooner, and Richard Basehart does right well as Ishmael, the whaleman who is observer and narrator of the tale. Orson Welles is good as Father Mapple, but his sermon is nigh superfluous.This is the third time Melville's story has been put upon the screen. There is no need for another, because it cannot be done better, more beautifully or excitingly again. MOBY DICK, screen play by Ray Bradbury and John Huston, from the novel by Herman Melville; directed and produced by Mr. Huston as a Moulin production for Warner Brothers release.

398-> Screen: 'Storm Center'; Bette Davis Star of Film at Normandie
IN their film called "Storm Center," Julian Blaustein and Daniel Taradash have tackled a theme that is drawn from the coals of smoldering conflict and political passion in American life today. That is the theme of freedom to circulate ideas and the damage that can be done to an individual and to a community when this freedom is abridged.The issue presented in this picture, which came to the Normandie on Saturday, is that of a woman librarian who refuses to remove a book called "The Communist Dream" from her public library when the city council tells her to. As a consequence of her refusal, one of the councilmen implies she is a "Red," which leads to her discharge as librarian and her belittlement in the community. From all that is evident in the picture, the lady is innocent of the charge.Stated thus bluntly, the issue appears undeniably stacked, and no one, outside a rabid scare-head, is likely to say the lady has not been cruelly used. The villainy of the councilman, thus put forth, is as plain as if he stroked a black mustache.Yet this is the way producer Blaustein and writer-director Taradash have stated the issue—bluntly. And even more bluntly, they have shown the sheepishness of the citizens in shunning the librarian. No subtle or tenuous circumstances as might be likely in such a situation are touched, and thus the crisis seems less a real-life issue than a hypothetical case put in a tract.This is too bad, because the purpose and courage of the men who made this film not only are to be commended but also deserve concrete rewards. They have opened a subject that is touchy and urgent in contemporary life. It should be presented so adroitly that it would fascinate and move people deeply.Furthermore, they have got from Bette Davis a fearless and forceful performance as the middle-aged widowed librarian who stands by her principles. Miss Davis makes the prim but stalwart lady human and credible. Brian Keith as the councilman who "smears" her seems an improvising actor in her shade, and Paul Kelly looks an intellectual misfit as her easily manipulated friend.Finally, Messrs. Blaustein and Taradash do put a stern thought in this film, which is that the fears and suspicions of our age are most likely to corrupt and scar the young. By showing the effect of the fulminations of a narrow-minded father upon his sensitive, bookish son, they suggest the unrealized peril of extending contemporary terrors into tomorrow. And by having this boy, in his confusion, set fire to the library, they point up the frony of book-burning in a trenchant, apocalyptic way.However, again the thesis is much better than the putting forth of it. The visualization of this drama is clumsy and abrupt. And neither Joe Mantell as the father nor Kevin Coughlin as the boy act with the natural mannerisms and anxieties of truly upset folks.Mr. Blaustein and Mr. Taradash have tried nobly, but they have failed to develop a film that whips up dramatic excitement or flames with passion in support of its theme.

438-> Screen: 'The Killing'; New Film at the Mayfair Concerns a Robbery The Cast
THE poor man's sage who first noted that "all horse players die broke" not only was right but awfully conservative. "The Killing," which was unveiled at the Mayfair on Saturday, is a sharp, black-and-white illustration of the theory that the odds are against both a daring gang who rob a race track and the bettors, to judge by the robbers' record "take." Though "The Killing" is composed of familiar ingredients and it calls for fuller explanations. it evolves as a fairly diverting melodrama.Stanley Kubrick, the film's youthful director, who also wrote the script, was not being niggardly in his stakes. The motley crew headed by Johnny Clay, the ex-convict who devises the scheme for the big "killing," shoots at nothing less than a $2,000,000 haul. The preparations for this coup are reminiscent but not nearly as imaginative as those of the classic, "The Asphalt Jungle." And, the motivations and backgrounds of a few of the mob appear to be weak considering their blameless backgrounds and the risks involved.Mr. Kubrick has kept things moving at a lively clip as the plotting is revealed in timetable fashion. Sterling Hayden makes a restrained but hard and efficient leader. His Johnny Clay is a tough citizen who knows the dangers his boys will face and he takes no chances. Elisha Cook does well by the role of a Caspar Milquetoast of a race-track cashier who is willing to risk his neck to buy the love of his wife. As that two-timer, Marie Windsor is properly cheap, brassy and decorative.Kola Kwarian, as a wrestler who aids in the hold-up, and Tim Carey, as a psychopathic gunman, contribute a couple of realistic characterizations, and Joe Sawyer, as a track bartender looking for quick money to help his ailing wife; Jay C. Flippen, as an aging member of the gang; Ted DeCorsia, as a corrupt cop; Vince Edwards, as Miss Windsor's boy friend, and Coleen Gray, as Mr. Hayden's fiancée, are interesting but not new types.Aficionados of the sport of kings will discover that Mr. Kubrick's cameras have captured some colorful shots of the ponies at Bay Meadows track. Other observers should find "The Killing" an engrossing little adventure. Chances are it will be less exhausting than a day at the track.

447-> The Screen; 'Mademoiselle--Age 39' Is Shown at Cameo
BASIL LOGOTHETIDIS, one of Greece's most popular comedians, is the star of "Mademoiselle—Age 39." This Greek comedy, produced in Cairo with English titles, arrived at the Cameo Saturday.It's the story of an aging bachelor (Mr. Logothetidis), himself engaged to a young miss, who tries to marry off his aging sister by advertising in a newspaper for a suitor. Complications set in after a series of mistaken identities involving two prospective suitors, the young miss and the matchmaker's attractive cousin.This offers Mr. Logothetidis plenty of room to gesticulate and display a good sense of timing. However, the film is somewhat crudely made and the English titles apparently do not capture some of its humorous lines. But, on the basis of the reaction at the Cameo Saturday, the Greek-language audience may find it an appetizing dish of cinematic shish kebab.

1015-> Screen: 'Friendly Persuasion' Persuasive Film; Story of Quakers Is at the Music Hall Civil War Indiana Is Setting for Tale
WHO would have thought the story of a Quaker family living on a farm in southern Indiana at the time of the Civil War would make for a winning motion picture in which a spurt of stirring drama and suspense would top off a natural abundance of comedy, quaintness and charm? The likelihood of such a setup was frankly hard to foresee.Yet producer-director William Wyler has come up with just this surprise in his colorful "Friendly Persuasion," which opened at the Music Hall yesterday. And what is more, he has got into this treatise on the old-time manners and basic beliefs of the Society of Friends a lot of homely precept and a touching display of the nobility of man.Inspired by a lovely group of stories by Jessamyn West and spurred by the sympathetic talents of Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, Mr. Wyler has brought forth a picture that is loaded with sweetness and warmth and as much cracker-barrel Americana as has been spread on the screen in some time.For the most part, his "Friendly Persuasion" is nothing more than a loose woven account of the amiable rural adventures of the Birdwell family, a quaint clutch of Indiana Quakers, and their robust neighbors and friends. There are five Birdwells—Papa and Mama, whom Mr. Cooper and Miss McGuire play; one daughter, Mattie, and two sons, Josh and Little Jess. There is also a pet goose, Samantha; a horse out in the barn (she is traded for a somewhat faster stepper during the course of proceedings) and various cows.In the way of neighbors, there are Sam Jordan, whom Robert Middleton plays; his son Gard, who is a suitor for Mattie, and an assortment of stiff-backed friends. And, of course, there are all those people at Meeting and at the country fair, not to mention the riotous "Widow Hudspeth, who is played by Marjorie Main.With this assortment of people, Mr. Wyler (still inspired by Miss West) has a grand time showing how lively spirit bubbles out of Quaker austerity. Mama is a gentle Quaker preacher, so she formally disapproves of Papa racing his mare against Sam Jordan's, but she secretly enjoys the pell-mell buggy rides. And when Papa brings home a wheezy organ that he has recklessly bought at the fair, she finally succumbs to persuasion and allows him to keep it upstairs.So it goes with the well-adjusted family, little bickers and reserved displays of love, until Morgan's Raiders appear on the horizon and son Josh wants to shoulder a gun. Then Mama abhors the bent toward violence and Papa delves deeply in his soul to find justification for the breaking of faith by his son. Mr. Wyler, in a tautly staged sequence that matchès "The Red Badge of Courage" for shock and gore, resolves the zeal of the young warrior. And all is happy at the end.What he achieves in this picture is acquaintance with solid characters whose lives are happily ordered by a simple morality and genuine love. In their very naïveté and simplicity there is a soothing serenity. And in all their surroundings, Mr. Wyler has got so much warm rusticity, which is richly enhanced by color, that it makes you feel mellow and good. Except for a modern theme song that is sung as an introduction by Pat Boone and sneaks in on various soft occasions, you wouldn't think you were within years of video.While top honors go to the performances of Mr. Cooper and Miss McGuire, who are wonderfully spirited and compassionate in their finely complementary roles, a great deal of admiration must go to Anthony Perkins as Josh. He makes the older son of the Birdwells a handsome, intense and chivalrous lad. Richard Eyer is delightful and natural as the rambunctious Little Jess, while Phyllis Love is electrical as Mattie and Mark Richman is nice as her suitor, Gard. Walter Catlett, Russell Simpson and Joel Fluellen are good in lesser character roles.As they put it in "Friendly Persuasion," thee should be pleasured by this film.On the stage at the Music Hall are Ann Gilbert, singer; Danny Carroll, dancer; the Foursome, singers, and the Glee Club, Corps de Ballet and Rockettes.

That talent comes in quite handy in the performance of this film, for the simple fact is that Mr. Ewell doesn't have very much to fling around.As a happily married writer whose beautiful and shapely blonde wife re-enlisted in the Air Force and is shipped off to a Hawaiian base, his job is to give a funny picture of a nervous husband doing all he can to be near his spouse and try to get her back into civilian life again.Mr. Ewell manages to do it—most of the time, that is—especially toward the end, when the script of Albert Beich and Frank Tashlin takes on a little comic form. Then the harassed husband's endeavors to make his wife look like a "Section 8" case—that is to say, a person who is mentally unfit to serve—have the mischievous contrivance and abandon of real farce comedy. Up to this point, the developments seem slightly spontaneous and unrehearsed.As the wife, Sheree North has the good looks and sufficient skill to convey the natural bewilderment of a lady who loves her husband but thinks him slightly bats. And Rita Moreno does a cute job of taking off Marilyn Monroe in one scene that is a frank facsimile of the getting-to-know-you scene in "The Seven Year Itch." Les Tremayne as Mr. Ewell's agent, Rick Jason as a handsome fly-boy and a couple of firmly packed young beauties make for pictorial atmosphere, which is sleekly and handsomely presented in color and Cinema-Scope.Supporting Miss Henie in her ice show are Ted Deeley and Tommy Collins, comedians; Les Percellys, billed as Continental ice-crobats; Douglas Breniser, and the Skating Ensemble and Choraleers. THE LIEUTENANT WORE SKIRTS, screen play by Albert Beich and Frank Tashlin from a story by Mr. Beich; directed by Mr. Tashlin and produced by Buddy Adler for Twentieth Century-Fox.

1200-> Screen: Love Conquers in 'Power and the Prize'; Big Business Succumbs in Drama at State Acting Is Impressive in a Rather Trite Story
WHAT should be a quite popular demonstration of true love conquering all, even the ruthless opposition of an American big-business tycoon, is literately and pleasingly presented in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "The Power and the Prize," a cupid-versus-corporation drama, which came to Loew's State yesterday. And the reasons why it should be popular are pretty well concentrated in the lovely person of Elisabeth Mueller, a German actress, in the role of the romantic prize.As a poor but honest refugee from Austria who captures the fancy and then the love of a sturdy young executive sent to London to do a big wrap-up job, Miss Mueller, whose physical appearance reminds us of Marsha Hunt, makes a whirlwind courtship by Robert Taylor not only charming but plausible. Furthermore, she makes the defiance that Mr. Taylor has to show toward his boss, who is dead set against the romance, emphatically logical.It is actually a somewhat hackneyed story that Robert Ardrey has pulled from a novel by Howard Swiggett in the contemporary "flannel suit" style. The uncontrolled outrage and vengeance of the big-daddy boss, Burl Ives, against the girl just because her suitor flubs the job he is sent to London to do are more a romantic convention than a credible show of power techniques. And the easy solution of the problem is a glib working toward a happy end.But Mr. Ardrey has written his screen play sleekly, with sharp and sophisticated words, and he has kept his business maneuvers within a clear and dramatic frame. The distinction between ruthless go-getting and respect for others' rights and dignity, which is what the executive learns in London, is fairly and simply made. And the current trick of using a "Red" label to smear somebody is frankly exposed.But what is most effective in this picture are Miss Mueller's cultivated charm, her exquisite nuances of expression and, indeed, the good acting of everyone. In addition to this handsome young lady, who shows a rare sensitivity, the entire cast creates fluid characters in an assortment of interesting roles.Mr. Ives is mammoth and morbific as the sort of business man who would believe, with absolute assurance, that what is good for Amalgamated Metals is good for its executives' wives. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is polished and prudent as an upright British business man, and Charles Coburn is briefly terrific as a veteran of the American corporate wars.Richard Erdman as a tagalong technician, Mary Astor as big-daddy's lonely wife and Nicola Michaels as an immature fiancéee are also impressively right. Even Mr. Taylor, who runs to statuary looks these days, is convincingly ardent and courageous as the temporarily diverted tycoon.Henry Koster has directed this picture crisply and composed it felicitously in Cinema-Scope black-and-white that is superfluous but appropriately reflective of the movie industry's own big ideas. THE POWER AND THE PRIZE, screen play by Robert Ardrey; based on a novel by Howard Swiggett; directed by Henry Koster and produced by Nicholas Nayfack for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

YOU'D never know it from the title and certainly not from some of the ads they've been running on "Teenage Rebel," but this little film, which came to the Globe yesterday, is from the stage play "A Roomful of Roses" and it has to do with a lonely, sensitive girl.It has to do particularly with the tension that develops when this junior miss goes to spend three weeks with her mother, whom she has not seen for several years, because her mother and father are divorced and she has been living entirely with her dad. And the closest thing to rebellion in it comes when the unhappy child gets the notion that she is being cared for out of pity and tries to break away.This should be adequate to inform you that, far from being in the realm of rock 'n' roll melodrama or hokum about delinquent kids, it is a serious consideration of a very delicate and pathetic impasse in the life of a child and her parents, each of whom has taken another mate.Outside of that change in title, the transfer from stage to screen has been made with commendable fidelity to the play of Edith Sommer and with even more commendable good taste. Producer-writer Charles Brackett and director Edmund Goulding have well perceived that the heart of the thing is in the contacts between the mother and the child—in the succession of painful face-offs wherein the mother tries to break through. And they have wisely selected two fine players, Ginger Rogers and Betty Lou Keim, for the roles. Miss Keim is the talented youngster who played it on the stage.As a matter of fact, the whole drama is so centered in these two that the rest of the pertinent action, which embraces the new husband of the mother and a callow lad who lives next door, appears to be (as it is beyond question) mere theatrical carpentry. Michael Rennie is gentle and kindly as the husband and Rusty Swope is droll and obtuse as the boy, but their service is mainly in sustaining the necessary structure of a slight plot.As for the scenes between Miss Rogers and the decidedly welcome Miss Keim, they are consistently interesting and moving, effectively giving one a view of the eagerness and agony of the mother and the pathetic guardedness and valor of the child. Mr. Goulding has paced the progression of their movement together with subtle skill. When they finally reach accordance, it is a real and rewarding scene.This film, which is a production of Twentieth Century-Fox, is another of its unpretentious offerings in CinemaScope black-and-white. The CastTEENAGE REBEL, screen play by Walter Reisch and Charles Brackett; from the play by Edith Sommer; directed by Edmund Goulding and produced by Mr. Brackett for Twentieth Century-Fox.

1491-> Screen: 'Wee Geordie'; Tale of the Highlands at Little Carnegie
The rare amalgam of Olympic competition, romance and lovely locales has been used to pleasant effect in "Wee Geordie," which arrived from England at the Little Carnegie last night. The proceeds of this screening will swell the United States Olympic Fund, which is also pleasant to contemplate.But the astute writing-producing-directing team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat has relied largely on occasional Scottish gags and chuckles to support a fragile story. Their saga of "Wee Geordie," the gamekeeper's son who grows up to be a giant and Britain's Olympic hammer-throwing champion, is gently satirical but not nearly as tall and weighty as its hero.It must be said, however, that they have used remarkable restraint in capturing the reactions of the sensitive, tiny youngster to the taunts of his schoolmates. And they neatly rib the physical culturists as Geordie, in subscribing to a newspaper ad, attempts to grow the muscles of a blacksmith by studiously applying himself to the instructions (narrated off-screen) by "Professor Samson."That Geordie will develop into a behemoth—even without the "Professor's" blue-prints—is a foregone conclusion. That he will capture the Olympic crown and the lassie of his heart is also fairly obvious.As a matter of fact, the plot offers few surprises but the thin story line is bolstered by some charming regional dialogue and a few funny scenes. More important, Technicolor has been used with artistry to illuminate the pastel shades of green glens and woodlands, deep-blue lakes and mist-shrouded mountains. Some color footage of Melbourne and a former Olympics give "Wee Geordie" topical travelogue distinction.Bill Travers, who may be remembered for his performance in "Bhowani Junction," is ideal in the title role. As the gentle brute, whose heart is in the highlands, he is properly hulking, dour and succinct. Being a man who once traveled to Perth and didn't like it, he is only mildly appreciative of England and Australia. And, though he is importuned by a large Danish lady athlete, his mind is on the girl he left behind him.Alastair Sim, who apparently can do no wrong, has his moments as the "laird" of the estate on which our hammer-throwing gamekeeper labors. A typical bumbling squire, he fusses and fumbles appropriately. Norah Gorsen makes a vigorous, pert and pretty romantic partner for Mr. Travers, and Doris Goddard, as the Scandinavian Circe who tempts our hero, and Miles Malleson, as the foggy, "Colonel Blimp"-type head of the Olympic squad, add a few humorous bits to the goings-on."Wee Geordie," by the way, tosses the hammer more than 200 feet for a record. The actual top mark is a trifle more than 185 feet. "Wee Geordie" isn't that good.Also on the program, is "The Bespoke Overcoat," a thirty-seven-minute drama written by Wolf Mankowitz from a story by Gogol. It was directed by Jack Clayton and stars David Kossoff and Alfie Bass.The film, which won prizes at both the Venice and Edinburgh Film Festivals, treats of the ruminations of both a poor brandy-bibbing tailor (Mr. Kossoff) and his late pal, a clerk for a wholesale clothier (Mr. Bass), whose ghost, the tailor imagines, has risen from the dead.Although the subject is supernatural and has been done in flashback style, it has tender, fey and occasionally poetic qualities enhanced by Mr. Kossoff's sensitive performance. WEE GEORDIE, written and produced by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat; based on a novel by David Walker; directed by Mr. Launder and released by George K. Arthur.
