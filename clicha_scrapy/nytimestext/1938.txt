649-> THE SCREEN; Shirley Temple Forces a Dimple in Her New Picture 'Little Miss Broadway' at the Roxy--Other Films At the 86th St. Garden Theatre At the 86th Street Casino
The devastating Mistress Temple is slightly less devastating than usual in "Little Miss Broadway," her new one-moppet show at the Roxy. It can't be old age, but it does look like weariness. After all, the tot has been trouping pretty steadily and there was bound to be a let-down. Although she performs with her customary grayety and dimpled charm, there is no mistaking the effort every dimple cost her. And perhaps even Shirley couldn't feel enthusiastic about the Harry Tugend-Jack Yellen script. They appear to be in need of a vacation or something, too.Characteristically, she's an orphan, and Pose No. 1 has her singing a song of optimism to the other little girls, including the Brian sisters, at the home. Attitude No. 2 has her round little chin quivering as she says good-bye to all her tiny playmates upon her adoption by Pop Shea, owner of the Hotel Variety. In No. 3 she is making friends with Jimmy Durante, the midgets, the mind-reading act and the ventriloquist of the theatrical hotel. Plate 4 involves the mean old lady next door who owns the hotel and Slide No. 5 deals with the old lady's nice young nephew, George Murphy, and Pop Shea's pretty daughter, Phyllis Brooks.Skipping the next several steps, which Mistress Temple has taken so often she doesn't even have to look, we come to the court-room scene in which Shirley's troupe puts on a show, gets a $5,000-a-week contract, wins over the old lady next door and makes everything shipshape on the good ship Lollypop. That's exactly the sort of picture it is, not even a solid framework for Shirley's inimitable talents. Will we be in the minority on this report? We will, indeed.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreRolf Moebis, one of the best of the younger generation of Teuton movie actors, confirms the good impression made upon Yorkville audiences in a couple of his earlier pictures by his restrained and sensitive performance in "Dreiklang" (Triad), the new UFA importation at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre. Helga Marold, a newcomer here, is entirely convincing as Rolf's childish half-pal, half-sweetheart, temporarily sidetracked by the lure of Lil Dagover's mature charms.Paul Hartmann is first-rate in the rôle of Rolf's father, also in love with the mysterious widow, with a vague past, who is spending some time in a small German town. While the story is rather short on dramatic interest, Director Hans Hinrich keeps his characters moving most of the time. Furthermore, the scenarist has not succumbed to the Hollywood influence so apparent in many recent German productions. Spectators should avoid reading the program summary in advance.At the 86th Street CasinoCharming little Jenny Jugo, with her fetching combination of pertness and occasional pathos, is the chief justification for "Die kleine und die grosse Liebe" (The Minor Love and the Real Thing), the current offering at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre. German film-makers have the ruler of an imaginary principality (the popular Gustav Froelich) give up his throne for love of a hostess on an air liner.While this linking of the Balkan kingdom motif of by-gone days with the most up-to-date means of transportation seems slightly bizarre at first, the spectators soon become accustomed to it. There are times when the dialogue is rather profuse, but this is partly compensated by some lovely scenes, apparently taken along the coast of Northern Italy. The details of the story are unimportant. Josef von Baky directed the picture for the Tobis Company. LITTLE MISS BROADWAY, from a screen play by Harry Tugend and Jack Yellen; music and lyrics by Walter Bullock and Harold Spina; directed by Irving Cummings; produced by Darryl F. Zanuck for Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Roxy.Betsy Brown . . . . . Shirley TempleRoger Wendling . . . . . George MurphyJimmy Clayton . . . . . Jimmy DuranteBarbara Shea . . . . .
