The long caftan, which has captured the hearts of women with its flattering lines, has been joined by a shorter version this summer. The kneeskimming caftans are cool alternatives for city summer wear. You'll also be seeing them by the pool, on the croquet lawn and buying corn and tomatoes at the roadside stand.
