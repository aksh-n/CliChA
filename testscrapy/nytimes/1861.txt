THE MILITARY REVOLT AT WILLETT'S POINT.; THE CORONER'S INQUEST. The unhappy difficulty and loss of life resulting from the attempt of Capt. CRESTO and his command to leave the regiment with which he was connected at Willett's Point, continues to form the engrossing topic of conversation at Flushing and vicinity. Few facts come to light, however, tending to change the aspects of the case as first reported. CRESTO and his command had been mustered into the State service, but seems to have had no idea that this bound him to remain in Col. LEGENDRE'S Regiment.
