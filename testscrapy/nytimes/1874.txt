A FOURTH WARD SHOOTING AFFRAY.; About 11 A.M. yesterday, Joseph Clark and "Barney" Dolan, two Fourth Ward thieves, met at the corner of Roosevelt and Water streets, and, after a war of words, pistols were drawn and five shots fired, creating considerable excitement in the neighborhood. Clark was shot in the thumb, and went to the Fourth Precinct Station-house, where his wound was dressed. He then stated that Dolan and he had had a dispute the night previous over a game of cards, and when they met yesterday the quarrel was renewed, with the above result. Dolan's friends say that he did not have a revolver, and that Clark shot himself. No arrests were made.
