Whether it would be advantageous to the Province or otherwise, if a discovery of profitable gold mines should he made, may be matter of dispute. We are old the geologic formations are not such as to permit the existence of deposits in such quantities as would remunerate the miner. So were we told respecting copper. It was, first of all, found that copper had no existence in the region of the Townships;then when small bits were picked up, Science modified its views, and confidently told us it might possibly be had in "pockets." In the meantime, whether it is found in "pockets" or in quarries, they are digging out copper by the ton at Action.

Some weeks since, a quantity of clothing was stolen from Mr. George Weenick, a tailor, at No. 10 Laurens-street, and Levi Rosenstein, a journey man in his employ, who disappeared at the same time with the goods, was suspected of the theft. Yesterday, Rosenstien was arrested by Officer Barker, of the Steamboat Squad, and a portion of the stolen property was recovered. The prisoner not only confessed his delinquency in this instance, but also requestedthat a silver watch and gold chain which he carriedmight be restored to its owner, Mr. Solomon Kurtz, of No. 369 Ninth-avenue, from whom he stated that he had stolen it about a month ago. Justice WELSHcommitted him for trial.
