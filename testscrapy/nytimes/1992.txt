Results Plus TENNIS Washington Beats Connors MaliVai Washington moved within a step of his first professional title when he ended Jimmy Connors's run in the Federal Express International in Memphis with a 6-2, 7-5 semifinal victory. Washington, who is ranked 38th in the world and turned pro in 1989, was to play the winner of last night's match between No. 7 Wayne Ferreira and unseeded Amos Mansdorf. The 14th-seeded Washington, who reached his first career final earlier this year in New Zealand, broke service in the opening game when Conners lobbed long from the baseline and then went on to an easy first set. Connors, seeded 16th and ranked 46th, broke serve to tie the second second set at 5-5, but Washington broke back and served out the match. (AP)

Results Plus; Heinzer Repeats Franz Heinzer of Switzerland won his second downhill in two days yesterday at Kitzbuhel, Austria, establishing himself as king of the most fearsome hill on the World Cup circuit. The defending downhill champion raced down the twisting, 3,200-meter-long Streif course in a record 1 minute 56.04 seconds, bettering his time on the same track Friday by 64 one-hundredths of a second. A. J. Kitt of Rochester was second in 1:56.39. Patrick Ortlieb of Austria delighted the partisan crowd of 30,000 by finishing third in 1:56.63. Heinzer's victory solidified his grip atop the overall downhill World Cup standing. He has 411 points, followed by Kitt with 297 and Ortlieb with 272. (AP)

RESULTS PLUSFaldo Leads by a Shot Nick Faldo took the third-round lead in the $1.15 million Scandinavian Masters in Barseback, Sweden, yesterday with a six-under-par 66, leaving him at eight-under 208 for the tournament and one stroke ahead of Peter O'Malley of Australia. Faldo had one eagle, five birdies and one bogey in his round. Tony Johnston of Zimbabwe, James Spence of England and Frank Nobilo of New Zealand were two strokes behind. Johnston's 65 yesterday was the best score yet at the 7,290-yard par-72 Barseback Golf and Country Club course. Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, Danny Mijovic of Canada and Peter Baker of England, all at 211, trail by three strokes.(AP) AUTO RACING Brabham Wins Easily A road-racing star, Geoff Brabham, surprised a field full of oval-racing experts by running away with the third round of the International Race of Champions yesterday at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. The Australian-born Brabham, the four-time defending champion of the IMSA Camel GTP sports car series, started fourth in the 11-car field and slipped back several spots on the wild start when the field drove five-wide through the first turn on the 2-mile, high-banked oval.

Results Plus GOLF Norman Gains Ground Greg Norman secured a place among the leaders and Jose Maria Olazabal a spot among the survivors in the weather-delayed finish of second round play in the International tournament in Castle Rock, Colo. Norman, one of 71 players stranded on the course by an electrical storm Friday afternoon, returned yesterday morning to complete second round play. Norman, who hasn't won in more than two years, scored 10 points under the modified Stableford scoring system used for this event. Medal scores do not count in the event, only point totals. Golfers earn 5 points for eagle, 2 for birdie, zero for par, minus 1 for bogey and minus 3 for double bogey or worse.
