The New-Orleans papers have lately given an account, through correspondents, of the arrest of Gen. CARVAJAL and others, by a party of U. S. troops, at Brownsville, Texas. The cause of the arrest is a charge against the parties, of having robbed and plundered the Mexican town of Reynosa, on the Rio Grande. It is a good old maxim, that "one story is good until another is told." From my acquaintance with Gen. CARVAJAL, I believe him to be a pure patriot, and one who would discountenance any ruffianism or pillaging.
